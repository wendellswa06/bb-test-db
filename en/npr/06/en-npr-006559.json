        "Things like furloughs for federal employees haven't really started yet.",
        "And what about - I mean, I read a lot about the fact that this part of the country, the one that we're in at the moment, the Washington, D.C., area, Northern Virginia, areas like that, are the ones that are going to be most affected.",

        "So there's a lot of money that flows into the Northern Virginia and Maryland area, as well as the District of Columbia.",
        "So that money gets cut, and it will be felt here, pretty hard.",

        "Other places around military bases are going to feel it.",
        "And then, other services are going to be cut.",

        "I mean, we're waiting to see what's going to happen, but did the president, for instance, possibly miscalculate in overplaying how difficult this was going to be or...?",
        "It remains to be seen whether he overplayed how difficult it's going to be because it could wind up being somewhat difficult.",
        "You just have to play a waiting game.",
        "Where he may have miscalculated is really on the defense cuts.",
        "I think the natural assumption was that the Republicans would never let this level of defense cuts go through.",
        "There's some - you know, a total of about $46 billion may get pulled out of the Department of Defense, and Republicans with their traditional, sort of, pro-Pentagon position, I think the president may have calculated that that would be enough of a hammer to prevent them from ever letting this go through.",
        "And apparently it wasn't so much.",
        "They were willing to let this go through.",
        "But couldn't this hurt the Republicans politically, these really deep defense cuts, I mean if this goes on...?",
        "Oh sure, I mean, you know, it's a little bit similar to what happened back in the '90s with the government shutdown, and that really didn't play well for the Republicans, I think.",

        "You've got the expiration of the continuing resolution, which is on March 27, which is funding the government.",
        "Now both sides have said they don't want a government shutdown.",
        "So they're going to try and work something out on that.",

        "So you've got that fight.",
        "And I think, yeah, the president may be concerned because, you know, sort of these budget fights sort of suck all the oxygen out of the room.",
        "He wants to talk about guns and immigration and some other issues, and it's kind of hard to get to those things if you're still fighting all these budget fights and worried about the next sort of government shutdown or people getting laid off.",
        "So I think it does behoove, sort of, both sides to try and get something done and at least get past all of these budget crises.",
        "I think, my sense is that the Republicans have decided that they don't like going from sort of crisis to crisis, and they do want to sort of move on because they have some ideas about some other issues, as well.",
        "Although it seems like Speaker Boehner's standing among his fellow Republicans seems to be enhanced with the sequestration, given the fact that he acquiesced on the tax increases for the wealth in the fiscal cliff deal, and he got a lot of heat from his fellow Republicans on that.",
        "But he's standing firm and said look, we already gave you the tax hikes.",
        "Now it's time for spending cuts.",
        "Right, I think you're exactly right.",
        "I mean, Speaker Boehner took a lot of heat.",
        "He agreed to some tax increases that he didn't like, a lot of the real conservatives in the party didn't like.",
        "And his standing firm is sort of shoring him up with sort of that very conservative faction within his own party, and I think that helps him, you know, increase his stature and give him, maybe, some more political capital.",
        "And then of course if the pressure increases, you know, from the American people if these sequestration cuts go into effect, Boehner can say to his own caucus, hey look, I tried, I stood tall, I didn't sit there and get into a game of negotiations with the president, but not the American people are crying for some action.",
        "I was going to say there's a new CBS poll that had 38 percent of the people blaming the congressional Republicans, 33 percent blaming President Obama.",
        "And so it doesn't seem like the Democrats are winning this argument hands-down.",
        "No, I mean, there's certainly enough fingerprints on both sides for this, you know.",
        "I mean, apparently, you know, according to Bob Woodward's book, the president's staff, sort of, came up with this idea.",
        "But of course the Republicans were demanding something in exchange for the debt ceiling.",
        "And, you know, they passed a bill, he signed a bill.",

        "Right, I mean, you know, there is the potential, if the American people don't feel this, then it sort of shores up the Republican argument of see, we've told you, government is too big, and if you cut it a little bit, it's not a big deal.",
        "Of course none of this gets at the real government spending issue, which is the entitlement programs, and sequestration doesn't really attack those.",
