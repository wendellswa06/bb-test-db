        "I don't think, you know, people really appreciate it.",
        "It's all sort of abstraction.",
        "And it's going to take some of these kind of events.",
        "And again, I think that is what the president is banking on, certainly not on anybody being harmed in anyway.",
        "But, you know, some of these impacts really being actually felt by the real American people.",
        "And until that actually happens as opposed to being talked about, I'm just not sure it's going to resonate very much.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your call, Mike.",
        "Rob, when the government let - there were some people in detention - people here illegally, they were released prior to the sequestration.",
        "Republicans thought that was just a gimmick to scare people.",
        "Was that a legitimate response?",
        "I'm not sure that the government really had to do that.",
        "I think there was some sort of political gaming going on there with doing that, you know?",
        "A few weeks ago, the Pentagon didn't deploy an aircraft carrier, delayed the deployment of an aircraft carrier.",
        "I think there, too, you know, these were decisions that were made and there probably were alternatives, but they wanted to, you know, have some impact and see if they could sort of, you know, sort of goose the American people, if you could, into responding to these things.",

        "We were trying to get Melanie and Paul, if I recall.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "You know, Rob, another question about Republican - the politics part of it because I'm very shallow.",
        "I care about the political aspects and not how it affects Americans.",
        "But there has always been, as you said earlier in the program, that President Obama always counted on the fact that the Republicans would never accept the Pentagon cuts and the military cuts.",
        "But there's other Republicans who say we're not so much pro-Pentagon as we are pro-cuts and pro - streamlining of the government.",
        "Is that a conflict going on in the Republican Party right now?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that one really significant item in here from a political perspective is I think there has been a kind of sea change certainly in an element of the Republican Party in that you have these guys who say, yeah, I'm against big government and big government includes the Pentagon, and I want to see it all cut.",
        "And I think that's really new.",
        "You even have guys like, you know, Rand Paul from the Senate is all for this kind of stuff.",
        "And there's a growing element there that, you know, really see all government spending are really concerned about the Pentagon.",
        "It's an opportune moment, you know, where - traditionally, when the United States ends a war, Pentagon spending comes down as might be expected.",
        "And we've gotten out of Iraq.",
        "We're getting out of Afghanistan.",
        "So it's a time for Pentagon spending to probably naturally come down anyway.",
        "But, yeah, I think this conflict within the sort of the old line establishment Republican Party and some of these newer folks, if you want to call them Tea Party folks, but people who are really concerned about the size and scope of government, want to see it all pared back.",
        "That's a real new phenomena I think in the Republican Party."

        "So there is some impact on Congress, even the Capitol Hill Police and folks like that, but the members themselves, no, their salaries won't be cut.",
        "As to the military issues, you know, I think one of the challenges here is - several military officers have said, you know, if it was just the number, just the amount, and you could do it in a sensible way, the military could probably absorb these cuts without, you know, sort of harming itself or national security.",
        "The problem is this across-the-board mechanism, and that's what really bothers the military.",

        "They have the - the QDR, which is coming up, which is due this year, which is the quadrennial defense review, but yet, the Pentagon has already calling for a BRAC in 2015 and 2017.",
        "So why not wait to see what this QDR comes up with to see what the actual people who are using the military assets say we don't need this anymore, we can do without this, we can move this over here, as opposed to having people who are probably never even been in the military decide what needs to go and let some of their special pork programs go.",
        "Let those be the ones that get the cuts.",
        "I'm a libertarian through and through, but I truly support some sort of pathway to citizenship because we need those people to start paying into the Social Security system.",

        "One problem with the QDR is because the legislation which actually mandates that they do the QDR actually tells them that they can't consider resource requirements.",
        "In other words, they don't have to make hard choices.",
        "They don't sort of limit themselves and they - what happens - what a lot of times comes out of the QDR is just everything is a priority, and here's all the stuff we need to buy.",
        "And it doesn't really say, you know, we only have so much money.",
        "Everybody knows that you have to think of national security, you know, and you have to think of ends, but there's also a question of means.",
        "And the QDR really doesn't help you with that because it doesn't sort of involve how much money we actually spend.",
        "It's just sort of what we think is important, and sort of a lot of everything winds up being important in the QDR.",
        "So I'm not sure how much the QDR informs it, but I do agree with you that, you know, some real hard choices have to be made and people need to think through these kinds of choices.",

        "I think a lot of people are just - they're hearing the word sequestration, and their minds are just going off.",
        "I mean, are they just - they don't even want to hear it anymore, and they may not even understand what it means yet.",
        "And I - so it's very hard to tell when people are going to start really caring about this and when - and that I think is what's going to force Congress to do something eventually.",
