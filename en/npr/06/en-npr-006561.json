        "There have been occasions in the past when the Vatican has decided to launch an investigation of a particular group - often within religious life - either for alleged deviation for church doctrine, or because of internal difficulties within a community.",
        "But it certainly doesn't do it every day.",
        "And further, of course, this is coming in the context of broader tensions in the United States between the Catholic Church and some women's groups over issues like the proposed HHS mandates on contraception and private insurance.",
        "I think all of that creates a context in which this review is particularly explosive.",
        "And is this seen as the Vatican trying to bring those obstreperous Americans back into line?",
        "Well, certainly, I think some undoubtedly are going to see it that way.",
        "Now, of course, the official line, both from the Vatican and the American bishop - that's Archbishop Peter Sartain of Seattle, who's been put in charge of this process - the official line is that this is intended to create new avenues of communication and cooperation so that everyone is on the same page.",
        "Whether or not the nuns in the United States are actually going to experience it that way, of course, is another question.",
        "And what is that experience likely to be like?",

        "Well, I think the short answer, Neal, is we don't know yet.",

        "As it happens, Archbishop Sartain is in Rome at the moment for a regularly scheduled visit - along with a number of other American bishops - to offices in the Vatican.",
        "And the leadership of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious - that is, the officers of this organization - are also in Rome.",
        "So it's entirely possible that they may try to meet.",
        "Archbishop Sartain has said that he doesn't want to say too much publicly about what the process is going to be until he's had a conversation with those folks.",
        "But I imagine this is going to play out not in days or weeks, but rather in months.",
        "It is designed to end with a new set of statutes - that is, sort of governing principles for this organization - and some new regulations about who they're going to invite to give speeches at their national meetings, and so on.",
        "But exactly how cooperative this is going to be or exactly how disciplinary the nuns will experience it, I think all that remains to be seen.",
        "One thing that should be said is that the choice of Archbishop Sartain has been seen, in many quarters, by church insiders, as a choice for a fairly moderate and pastoral approach to this process, because he is not known as a hardliner or a head-knocker.",
        "He's known as a centrist who is able to build consensus.",
        "I think that's one thing people will have their eyes on as this process unfolds.",
        "You mentioned discipline.",

        "And Democrats were really worried, or at least they were saying they were worried that their Democrats wouldn't get onto the ballot.",
        "They actually, so far, seem to be succeeding, though it's important to point out that it's after 2 a.m. out on the West Coast when we are talking right now.",
        "And they are still counting votes, and they could be counting votes for the rest of the day and into several days from now.",
        "This is all kind of really interesting because Democrats focus so much of their energy on these districts between San Diego and Los Angeles.",
        "Like three or four districts that could really...",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's actually closer to seven in the entire state, and the idea being that California is part of their path to victory to retaking the House.",
        "They even opened a special field office there.",
        "But I just got back from California, and things were really testy because there were so many Democrats in these races.",
