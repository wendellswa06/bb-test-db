        "Well, so this is how it works.",
        "They take an egg from the woman who is trying to have a baby.",
        "They fertilize it in their lab with her male partner's sperm.",
        "Then they get an egg from another woman who's been paid for eggs.",
        "They fertilize that egg with the same man's sperm.",
        "Next, they remove most of the DNA from both of these eggs and put most of the DNA from the couple trying to have the baby into the other woman's egg.",
        "That creates a new - it's an embryo, really, at this point with DNA from three different people - the woman trying to have the baby, her husband a tiny bit of DNA left over from the other woman.",
        "OK.",
        "So it's like there's two mothers.",
        "And what is the benefit here compared to more conventional procedures?",
        "The woman who's trying to have the baby can say that some of her DNA - it's her biological child or a little closer to that.",
        "Is that it?"

        "Oh, yeah.",
        "So most of the DNA that ends up in these embryos and any babies produced this way comes from the mother who's trying to have the baby and her male partner.",
        "The overwhelming majority of the DNA comes from that.",
        "Only about 37 genes are left over from the woman who donated the egg.",
        "So it's an infinitesimal number of genes compared to the - most of the DNA in these embryos and babies.",
        "But just enough to make an embryo?",
        "Yes.",
        "And the idea is that is - might be the key that enables these women who had been infertile to have babies.",
        "There might be something about that leftover DNA that makes the difference, enables the cells to develop properly.",
        "This raises so many questions.",
        "Let's try to get at least one on the table.",
        "Is this safe for everyone involved?",
        "And are there any potential side effects that are hard to even anticipate here?",
        "Yeah, so that's really one of the big questions.",
        "This is all so new that critics say it's just way too early to be trying this.",
        "You know, we just don't know if babies made this way will be healthy.",
        "You know, the procedure - this was invented to help couples who are carrying terrible genetic disorders have healthy babies, but it's just starting to be tested for that.",
        "So no one really knows how safe it is for anything, including treating infertility.",
        "But just to be clear, children have been born this way.",
        "I mean, you can go if you know where to look and find a child who's got three parents.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The doctors at this clinic say they've produced four babies this way.",
        "And so far, they all seem perfectly healthy.",
        "And there are three more pregnant - at least three more women who are pregnant right now, including a woman who came to this clinic from Sweden.",
        "And they've now formed a company to basically market this service to women from other countries, including the United States.",
        "And they've sorted parental rights in advance here?",
        "Well, you know, so far, that hasn't been an issue.",
        "But, you know, there really hasn't been that many babies born this way.",
        "There's only a handful in the world.",
        "OK, dramatic story.",
        "Rob, thanks very much, really appreciate it."

        "More people are dying from drug overdoses today than from gun homicides and motor vehicles combined.",
        "One remembers, of course, that four years ago, the Vatican announced a broad-ranging review of all the 400-plus women's religious orders in the United States.",
        "At the time, there were predictions that was going to lead to an earthquake.",
        "Four years later, the process has reached conclusion, and I think most people would say it's going out with something of a whimper rather than a bang - that is, it didn't lead to the kind of cataclysm that some had predicted.",
        "So we're going to have to see if this overhaul of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious is a similar case.",
        "And it does come in the context, as you mentioned, the tactical-political context that we mentioned earlier, the dispute with the Obama administration's regulations on contraception, but more broadly in the context of a Catholic Church who's - well, I guess the dispute that some people have with it is: How much of a Catholic am I supposed to be?",
        "Can I have my own conscience within certain contexts?",
        "How much discipline is going to be imposed on my beliefs?",
        "And this - well, contraception has been a huge issue.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, of course, all the polls will tell you that majorities of American Catholics don't necessarily, in all the details, uphold official church teaching on contraception.",
        "But I think the broad picture is there is always this sort of balance in Catholic life between, on the one hand, needing to be faithful to certain core principals and, on the other hand, leaving room for people to sort of make their own life choices.",
        "I think what is clear is that we are going through a period in which the leadership of the church, both in Rome and in the United States, is concerned that there has been - over the last 50 years - maybe too much slippage there, and that there is a certain process going on of sort of tightening up on core matters of Catholic identity - that is, insisting that Catholics, particularly those who are inside officialdom, that is who are official church personnel, that they are sort of responsible for walking the talk.",
        "And I think this investigation of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious is a piece of that broader picture, which is kind of an effort to sort of reaffirm a sort of strong sense of traditional Catholic identity.",
        "And as you pointed out, John, there's an important distinction between those who are in orders and lay Catholics.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I mean, there are 1.2 billion Catholics in every nook and cranny of the planet, but the vast majority of them would be laity, who aren't, so to speak, on the church's dime.",
        "But I think there's a higher set of expectations from officialdom for people who have some kind of official capacity in the church - that is bishops, priests, sisters and lay people who officially work for the church and officially represent the church.",
        "I think there, the circle is drawn a bit tighter in terms of what kind of dissent is going to be seen by officialdom as acceptable."
