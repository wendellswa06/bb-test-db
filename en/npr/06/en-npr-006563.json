        "Is it the deviations of this particular group?",
        "Is it the great praise for their work in other contexts?",
        "Is it this broader context of the church and what it means to be a Catholic?",
        "I think John Allen made that last point very well in his usual thoughtful and informed analysis.",
        "He said that the church expects a great deal from people who are officially, publicly consecrated in its service, and it - the first paragraph of the doctrinal assessment makes that point, quoting Pope John Paul II, that it is very important that those people be fully supportive of and committed to the church's doctrine in their life and work.",
        "And that, I think, is the nub of the issue.",
        "The other point is that the Leadership Conference of Women Religious is an entity that is official established by the Vatican and approved by the Vatican to help the women religious in the United States to carry out their consecrated life.",
        "And so the Vatican has a responsibility to assess whether that is being done effectively.",
        "And that is the entire theme of this doctrinal assessment.",
        "Sister Simone Campbell, what's the discussion been like from your corner?",
        "Well, first of all, at NETWORK, an organization that works in politics, the application of our faith in the political realm, was totally stunned and shocked that we were mentioned by the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith.",
        "I had no idea they even knew we existed.",
        "And I think that pointed up to me that more of the issue is not so much a question about our faithfulness to doctrine, because it is one faith.",
        "We share one faith.",
        "And I've been to many OCWR meetings, and it's very clear that we share the fullness of Catholic social teaching of the Catholic Church, of the beauty of our faith.",
        "Where there's a difference is that we apply that faith, because of our experience in realms of where - with the poor and marginalized.",
        "And because we apply it to a different set of experience, we may end up with different political results.",
        "Wow.",
        "...And give them more rights.",
        "No.",
        "We speak for ourselves.",
        "We may speak for our organizations.",
        "We don't speak for the whole church.",
        "The bishops do that, and we say that all the time.",
        "But the issue is, is that I believe that our lives speak volumes to people who know sisters.",
        "A lot more - I've been told a lot more people know sisters than know bishops, and so they know about the giving of our lives with people are the margins of our society.",
        "And it's that witness value of our lives that has so touched the American people."

        "The admonishment came from what's called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a division of the Vatican founded in 1542, originally known as the Sacred Congregation of the Universal Inquisition.",
        "It took its current name in 1965 with a mandate to, according to its website, promote and safeguard the doctrine of the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world.",

        "Hi, thank you.",
        "What I just wanted to say was I've been Catholic all my life, I'm 42 now, and when I was in my 20s, I was young and could get angry about the ridiculous things that the church would say, you know, no contraception, and it just seemed very unfair to women.",
        "And I was in college, and it just - I didn't have room or time for it, and it was really easy to turn away from the church.",
        "And I think as far as doctrinally how it affected my life, when I grew up and saw more of the world and came back to the church, I came - my philosophy was you stay in this faith when the reasons to stay outweigh the reasons to go.",
        "And the reasons to stay for me would be, you know, the sacraments, confession and Eucharist and the children, you know, being baptized and being brought up in the faith because Catholicism is a really hard faith to stay in if you've got - this is, I know I'm not right to say, but if you've got a good conscience about what's right and what's wrong for women and for men.",
        "And I work probably 20 hours a week with St. Vincent De Paul bringing food to the poor.",
        "I mean, really homeless people, like, doing the real work.",
        "And our church, there's - I'm in the archdiocese of Archbishop Peter Sartain, and he has referendums at the back of the church that we are encouraged to sign on the way out, you know, again, about marriage being between a man and a woman.",
        "And it's just frustrating and infuriating, but still I stay because the reasons to stay outweigh the reasons to go, and I just, you know, this church is 2,000 years old, and we just keep waiting for change.",
        "If you look back at all the mistakes that were made 1,000 years ago, the church finally got around and changed it.",
        "And this group of nuns, you know, speaking out publicly, it's so brave and so courageous, and I'm so proud of them, but I'm afraid they're going to be silenced or excommunicated.",
        "But it's - push is coming to shove.",
        "It's coming to a head now."

        "So you don't think that your disagreements on doctrine make you any less of a Catholic?",
        "No, I think I'm a good Catholic.",
        "In fact, when I go to confession, I sit there, and I say: You know, I really don't have a whole lot to say because I think I do a pretty good job.",
        "Maybe pride is my biggest sin.",

        "She said that she was going to accept the things that were important to her.",

        "I think she has not been presented, probably, with the fullness of Catholic doctrine.",
        "She probably has not been - had a full explanation to her of why contraception is a problem.",
        "And if she understood it and especially understood it in the context of the church's teaching on marriage and human sexuality, perhaps she would be more welcoming of it, and perhaps she would be able to help the people that she's - at the soup kitchen."

        "So I think that what the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is trying to do here is get some clarity.",
        "They see that an official voice of the church - and the sisters do speak for the church, at least the leadership of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious is established as an entity to help religious women.",
        "They're expected not only not to contradict what the church teaches, which is one of the complaints, but also to be very active in talking about, to the people since more people see them than see bishops, talking to people about the fullness of the church's teaching.",
        "I wanted to get a response from Sister Simone Campbell.",
        "NPR's Tom Goldman for us this morning.",
        "Well, it's very ironic to me that we women who take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, who don't have families, we don't have babies, that we should become embroiled in an argument over contraception when our basic commitment is to a celibate life.",
        "The church's obsession, at times, with the sexual relationships is a serious problem, and I know we've struggled with the pedophilia scandals, we've struggled with all kinds of sexual aberration with priests and bishops, and that makes it really hard for us as a church to speak with any sort of authenticity about what does it mean to be people of the Gospel.",
        "And so we as Catholic sisters, we live this every day with people who are suffering at the margins of our society, and we are laity.",
        "It's very interesting, in canon law, religious are seen as laity because there's only two states: There's the ordained cleric, and there's laity.",
        "We're laity with vows, where we've committed our lives to service.",
        "And some would say that vow, as you mentioned, includes obedience.",
        "It includes obedience to God and to the whole orientation of the Gospel.",

        "Sure.",
        "I noted at the beginning of the show that you had commented that this was a disconnect between the Vatican and the American people.",

        "I see it as a disconnect between my fellow American Catholics and the Vatican.",
        "A lot of my conversations with fellow Catholics indicate that they really don't understand church teaching and the doctrine and the reason behind the doctrine.",
        "And I keep thinking, well, if they understood what the church was teaching, they'd make better choices in their own personal lives, and they could keep that between them and their priests.",
        "But I do expect my church leaders to - how would you phrase it - toe the party line.",
        "If they're going to officially represent the church, they need to represent the official church teaching, and they need to be able to understand it well enough to be able to explain it when people question them why the church teaches what it does.",
        "Is that a failure of leadership, of the teachers?",
        "It's a failure of the teachers, it's a failure of the parents as to bring their children up in the church.",
        "I accidentally attended an RCIE class when I didn't need to, that's a class for adults coming into the church, because I'm a cradle Catholic, I was born and raised in the Catholic Church.",
        "And that particular class is very well-done, but the other classes I've heard of, they didn't pose some of the questions that my class had, and so they didn't get answers to them.",
        "And I know in the child level, as you're bringing them up through the tweens and the teenage years, when you could be expected to be imparting this type of information or old enough to understand it, when it comes to contraception and marriage and obedience to the church teaching, I just don't see it happening at all.",
        "And do you believe that this reprimand from the Vatican is timely and a good thing?",
        "I think it generates good conversation.",
        "I don't know the situation, and I haven't read the reprimand myself so I don't know exactly what it says, but I think it generates a badly needed conversation in the American Catholic Church about what we're teaching, why we're teaching it, and if we're going to claim the name of Catholic, can we actually uphold that name.",
        "That's an interesting point, Sister Simone Campbell.",
        "I think that is an excellent point, and actually that's my prayer, that this will lead to dialogue for everyone because it is true we're all human, and none of us are perfect, and we can all learn.",
        "And one of the surprises from the visitation that we - that John Allen referred to that we were so upset about, do you know the blessing that came out of that is that American sisters are much closer to each other than we ever were."
