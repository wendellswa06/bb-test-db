        "That's right.",
        "And the reports said just today or yesterday Assad has started attacking these rebel areas with conventional weapons, not chemical weapons.",
        "So that seems to be OK.",
        "Now, a half-million people already have been killed in this civil war, and the killing does not seem to be letting up.",
        "There are still some rebel areas in the east and the north of Damascus that he will be clearing out.",
        "But again, the Pentagon says and Trump says if there are any more chemical weapons used, we'll attack again.",
        "Despite the mixed messages and the mishmash, does the Trump administration appear to have a clear strategy when it comes to Syria?",
        "No.",
        "It's only defeating ISIS and preventing chemical weapons from being used.",
        "Outside of that, there does not seem to be any kind of strategy, and that's why the Republican chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, Ed Royce of California, said, I want to bring some administration officials up to Capitol Hill this week to explain the strategy.",
        "And that's where we are.",
        "You know, it's worth noting that Trump's base is not happy about these strikes at all.",
        "He may suffer a real political price because of this.",
        "Mike Cernovich, an influential guy on the Internet, has lambasted the president for this, is calling it unbelievable, not what we voted for.",
        "Also, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones railed against the president for these strikes.",

        "That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
        "Yeah.",

        "All right.",
        "A big question now is, how is all of this playing out in Moscow?",
        "To help answer that, we have reporter Charles Maynes, who is there.",

        "Good to be with you.",
        "Charles, U.S.",
        "sanctions on Russia and on individual Russians are nothing new.",
        "Are sanctions actually an effective strategy here?",
        "Well, the sanctions have certainly been effective in some ways, in terms of limiting the Russian economy.",
        "We've seen the ruble devalue by about 10 percent over the last several weeks.",
        "Particularly this last round of sanctions that were against Putin's inner circle seem to have affected the markets here.",
        "But if you talk about these sanctions against Syria, this would be the third round in the last month.",
        "This time, as you noted, aimed at companies who support Bashar Assad's chemical weapons program.",
        "The problem gets to this division between Russia and the West over the whole chemical weapons issue.",
        "'Cause Russia says, you know, these companies don't exist because Assad's chemical weapons program doesn't exist.",
        "So one of the questions that I have is how the U.S.",
        "will identify these companies, or are they really sanctioning Russian companies that do business in Syria, where Bashar Assad is the leader?",
        "Well, Syria's president, Bashar Assad, hosted a group of Russian lawmakers in Damascus yesterday.",
        "What came out of that meeting?",
        "Well, there were certainly words of mutual support.",
        "First of all, these lawmakers were there during the actual airstrikes.",
        "They were on the ground in Syria.",
        "Of course they weren't harmed, which is important, but they were meeting with Bashar Assad.",
        "He told this delegation that, you know, that essentially Assad and Russia were together and sort of victimized by this Western campaign of lies and disinformation over these allegations of chemical weapons use.",
        "Of course, both say they don't use chemical weapons.",
        "Assad also interestingly noted that now Moscow and Damascus were waging what he called, quote, \"\"one battle,\"\" not only against terrorism, as we like to say, but now about sovereignty of states.",
        "This is an issue that's very dear to Vladimir Putin's heart, as well.",
        "So it's not just Russia and Syria.",
        "We also know that Russia's president has been speaking with Iran's leaders.",
        "Iran, of course, another ally of Syria.",
        "Do you think we could see any sort of retaliatory action from Iran in response to these air strikes, or are they going to stay out of it?",
        "Well, I don't know what Iran's planning to do, coming from Moscow, but I can say that they seem to be on the same page for now.",
        "Both Putin and Rouhani talked yesterday by phone, and both expressed real concern.",
        "They called these airstrikes illegal.",
        "They said that they'd done serious damage to the prospects for peace in Syria.",
        "I just think it's important to note that Russia has really been trying to get out of Syria, and certainly they're interested in some of the business that they can develop once the reconstruction of Syria begins, and that's where these new sanctions are certainly bound to affect them."
