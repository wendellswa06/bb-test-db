        "I don't.",
        "I think actually it's quite a different atmosphere than what we saw in Iraq even right after the invasion, when I think - I think the mood was better there on the surface.",
        "There was quite a bit of discord already underneath, but journalists were sort of telling very good stories and were not always alert to when things were beginning to turn and sectarian tensions were beginning to rise.",
        "Whereas here, at least at this juncture in Afghanistan, I think there's, you know, there's almost complete skepticism about every aspect, whether that's the Afghan government, some of the American policy, some of the problems with corruption both on the Afghan side but also in terms of international contractors, Americans and others.",
        "So I think there's actually quite a bit of skepticism and digging going on.",
        "One difference between Iraq and Afghanistan is that the time zones have shifted, and Afghanistan is even further away from East Coast time than Iraq is, and Alissa Rubin, we know you stayed up late to talk with us, and we're going to be happy to let you go.",
        "We appreciate your time.",

        "Yeah, hi.",
        "Perhaps you've already answered my question, but I'll put my two cents in.",
        "My two cents says that I would like to see reporters less embedded with the military.",
        "I think they were so in deep with the military that that really compromised their objectivity, and (unintelligible) a lot of the kind of stories that they get.",
        "Rajiv Chandrasekaran?",
        "Two points on that.",
        "I'd love to spend more time around Afghanistan in an unembedded capacity.",
        "It's just, quite frankly, in many parts of the country, impossible to do that.",
        "It's impossible to get to those places.",
        "It's impossible to get out and actually report on one's own.",
        "You'll be made as a foreigner very, very quickly in many of the rural, more-insulated pockets of Afghanistan.",
        "Now, you know, in my time embedded, both in Afghanistan and in Iraq, I should note that while there are legitimate criticisms of the whole embed program, I've never been told what I can and cannot write.",
        "Obviously, there are certain ground rules, and you can't disclose future operations, things that would put people's lives in danger.",
        "But I've written many a critical story of the U.S.",
        "military, and I have not had my embeds suspended or rescinded.",
        "Now, that said, I know that other journalists have had problems when they've written critical stories, that there are certain rules that are at times placed on some journalists, particularly photographers, both video and still photographers, that can be overly onerous, particularly when covering wounded troops.",
        "And so there are legitimate criticisms.",
        "And I think I could speak for many, many of my colleagues in saying that we wish we could be spending more time covering Afghanistan in an unembedded capacity.",
        "But going back to one of the early points that Alissa made, which I think was a very important point, in Iraq, it was possible, though we were living during the height of the violence in these pretty fortified compounds in Baghdad, you could, with the appropriate security precautions, get out and about in the city a little bit, get a sense of what was going on.",
        "And Baghdad in many ways was representative of what was going on.",
        "It was the center of a lot of the activity.",
        "Kabul is a bubble.",
        "Kabul is pretty safe.",
        "You know, there have been bombings and attacks here and there, but you can go around and talk to lots of people in Kabul, and you won't really get a sense of what's really happening in Helmand Province or in Kandahar where, quite frankly, this conflict is really centered.",
        "I think one of the points that Lee might have been curious about, though, is if you spend a lot of time with the military, don't you necessarily adopt, become influenced by the military mindset?",
        "I think there's a danger of that.",
        "And you know, I think what we try to do at the Washington Post and I know other organizations do is you try not to keep a reporter embedded with the same unit for weeks on end.",
        "You go in for a week or two, observe what they're doing, write a couple stories, but you try not to sort of essentially spend your entire time with one unit, one set of people on whom you're dependent for your sustenance, for your protection, etcetera.",
        "You know, another key difference, Neal, between Iraq and Afghanistan, in journalistic-coverage terms, is that in Iraq early on, most news organizations went in with a pretty big footprint, as we've noted, multiple correspondents setting up kind of big bureaus.",
        "Part of what that meant was that we set up large Iraqi staffs.",
        "We hired fixers and translators, and we hired stringers in other parts of the country.",
        "And I joke - for two years, I was the Washington Post bureau chief in Baghdad, in '03 and '04, and I joke that I was sort of running a journalism 101 program for a lot of Iraqis.",
        "And a lot of very, very brave men and women decided to work for the Washington Post, and we taught them about, you know, the basics of journalism, about objectivity, about asking aggressive questions, taught many of them how to write basic sort of dispatches in English.",
        "Obviously, we'd rewrite them and work them into our pieces, and we trained a cadre of incredibly talented people.",
        "And during the height of the violence there, they were our essential eyes and ears, telling us what was happening in various parts of the country, including many parts of Baghdad.",
        "And it was their dispatches that formed the core of the stories that our correspondents would be filing back every day.",
        "We don't have that in Afghanistan in part because most news organizations, like the U.S.",
        "military, adopted a very light footprint early on in Afghanistan.",
        "We would have one, maybe two, three reporters in-country.",
        "We didn't set up big bureaus with lots of translators and lots of stringers around the country."

        "So today, when we're in a very different situation, we're now faced with the challenge of how do you, in a very violent, difficult, challenging environment like this, find a reliable journalistic colleague in places like Kandahar and Helmand or Wardak Province.",
        "And I dare say it's going to be very difficult, next to impossible, to try to create this capacity so that - I do think that one of the real consequences going forward here in our coverage of Afghanistan is that we're going to have fewer eyes and ears on the ground among - brave Afghan eyes and ears on the ground helping us, compared to what we had during the height of the violence in Iraq.",
        "There is also the associated conflict going on in Pakistan that is even more difficult to cover.",
        "And indeed, there are a number of news organizations, NPR among them, that have bureaus in Islamabad.",
        "Nevertheless, that's a long way from Peshawar, and that's a long way from the tribal regions, where the conflict is underway.",
        "Very, very true.",
        "Except in Pakistan, there is a greater tradition of a free media, and there are a lot of very talented, very brave Pakistani journalists that do operate in place like Peshawar and other parts of the North-West Frontier province and Baluchistan.",

        "And that is a fundamental question that needs to be asked and answered.",
        "And you get one set of answers when you're out there with the military and you're using a military translator, you know?",
        "How many Afghans want to, you know, talking to a reporter surrounded by a bunch of soldiers?",
        "Say, well, you know, we don't really like these guys.",
        "We don't want them here.",
        "We want them to leave, yeah.",
        "So that becomes much tougher.",
        "At the same time, part of what I do, at least, take some guidance from are public opinion polls that still show that a significant percentage of Afghans still hope that international forces can bring a degree of stability to their country.",
        "The Taliban doesn't really enjoy a whole lot of popular support, at least willingly.",
        "A lot of it is coerced in parts of the country.",
        "But to be able to go around and to just spend time with villagers, spend time in smaller cities and towns across the country, that yields I think revelatory stories.",
        "Another challenge here is the language gap.",
        "It is true that most American reporters who went to Iraq didn't speak Arabic, but there were some, a handful of very, very talented individuals.",
        "A colleague of mine, Anthony Shadid, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2004 for his dispatches in the Washington Post, fluent Arabic speaker.",
        "Who just did another great piece from Iraq, too."

        "And so we had a handful of reporters in Iraq who could, without needing to rely on a translator, could engage with Iraqis.",
        "I daresay there's nobody in the American newspaper media, Americans, who speak in a fluent Pashto and could go and hang out in a village in Kandahar province to really bring that place to life in the way that we've had some of those dispatches from Iraq.",
        "We're talking with Rajiv Chandrasekaran of the Washington Post, a senior correspondent there, who's reported from Iraq and from Afghanistan and wrote a really good book called \"\"Inside the Green Zone.\"\" And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I have read that, indeed, embeds are so short much of the time these days that they're generally referred to as media visits.",

        "That indeed is true.",

        "And so I do hope that as we all ramp down our presences in Iraq that it doesn't zero out, and that big news organizations continue to maintain a presence and continue to focus on some of these very important issues over there as we turn our attention to Afghanistan.",
