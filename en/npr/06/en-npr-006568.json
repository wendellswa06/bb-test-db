        "Yeah, the White House is confirming that Hope Hicks will step down from that job.",
        "She's held this position for 170 days.",

        "Hey there, Rachel.",
        "Is it just a strange coincidence that Hope Hicks announced her resignation after she testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the Russia investigation?",
        "Oh, that is a good question.",

        "Right.",

        "And that's amazing considering she's only been in the job for months.",

        "And, you know, this is - you noted she's the fourth communications director.",
        "She's also the 50th White House staffer to leave - to resign or be fired in just a year.",
        "Right.",
        "And she was really close to the president.",
        "So it's going to be interesting to see who he turns to, who is left who he can trust.",
        "I want to turn now because while President Trump has lavished praise on Hope Hicks, he was not so kind to another one of the folks who have been with him since his campaign - talking about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the president lambasting him on Twitter again."
