        "But as you guys mentioned, he's under pressure for the Nassar scandal, also an even larger scandal, if you can imagine that, in the Olympic sport of swimming - scandals that didn't necessarily start under Scott Blackmun's watch, which began in 2010.",
        "But critics say, you know, just not enough done to stop them by him, by his organization.",
        "And even in the USOC statement announcing Blackmun's resignation due to health issues, it talks about the need to identify new leadership for the USOC at this critical point in its history.",
        "So new leadership - anything broader than that?",
        "Any other changes the USOC is going to make in the wake of all these scandals?",
        "You know, it announced some reforms and new actions as it called it today in this announcement talking about Blackmun's resignation, including more money and resources for support and counseling for athletes who've been victims of abuse, including Larry Nassar's victims.",
        "It wants to assess and put more money into the SafeSport program, which was set up to protect athletes but obviously hasn't in some cases.",
        "Also - and this is key - these reforms call for a review of how the USOC and its national governing bodies work together.",
        "The USOC is supposed to oversee those NGBs and act when necessary.",
        "And this has been the big criticism of the USOC and Blackmun, that he created an environment with these NGBs under the USOC's umbrella - like USA Gymnastics, USA Swimming - and that they were working together to achieve Olympic glory, medals, money - above all else...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...That the USOC neglected its responsibility as an overseer and a policeman, if necessary, of those NGBs and, as a result, failed to protect athletes.",

        "Instead, Aspen signed contracts to bring in hydro, wind and biogas from other regions and states.",
        "In 2015, Mayor Skadron says that made the city utility the third in the nation to be powered completely by renewable energy.",
        "It was really exciting.",
        "It was really hard.",
        "All that renewable power keeps the lights on downtown, but Aspen still uses natural gas to heat homes.",
        "And when you go to the ski resort or outlying homes, the power comes from a different utility that uses some fossil fuels.",
        "There are different factors that either enable or inhibit city's ease of achieving their goals."
