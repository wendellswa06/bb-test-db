        "Well, I have been — I think a lot of what Senator Obama is now saying, I've been saying for a long time.",
        "I don't think that's the - I don't think that's a bad thing by the way, because the election shouldn't be about the two of us.",
        "It should be about what we need to do for the country.",
        "And I'm proud of the fact that he's saying - now saying very similar things.",

        "I'm against - dead against building more nuclear power plants.",
        "I don't think we have a safe way to dispose of the waste and I think they're dangerous and expensive.",
        "We have a difference on health care policy.",
        "My health care plan is universal because it mandates coverage for every American by law.",
        "Senator Obama's does not.",
        "It could leave as many as 15 million people without coverage.",
        "Each has a difference view about it.",
        "I think that we do need to mandate that everybody have health care coverage.",

        "Well, let's start with basics.",
        "I don't have any doubt that all of us, all three of us care deeply about this issue.",
        "And, so let's — and I think that's the starting place.",
        "I do think there's some differences in perspective.",
        "Among the three of us, I'm the only one who actually grew up in the South during the Civil Rights Movement.",
        "So, I saw it in a very personal, very real way and it made a huge difference in my life, in the way I view the world.",
        "I feel an enormous responsibility, as somebody who lived a part of my life in a segregated South, to lead the way toward racial equality in this country.",
        "I heard some suggestion - I couldn't tell if it was direct or inferential, to be fair about it - that the real change in the Civil Rights Movement occurred from politicians in Washington.",
        "I don't believe that.",
        "Having lived in the South during Selma, during the Orangeburg, South Carolina - the Orangeburg massacre, during - the four young men sitting down at a Woolworths lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, I think it's that and the kind of leadership that the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr. provided that brought about the real change in the country.",
        "So, I think it took some courage and guts.",
        "And I saw what happening around me.",
        "And my view is that's where the change occur - change occurred.",
        "It didn't originate with politicians."

        "If you're, if you're a man or woman of color in America today, you're more likely to be charged with a capital offense, you're more likely to be convicted, and you're more likely to get the death penalty.",
        "And just, that is just the reality of our justice system, our criminal justice system in America today.",
        "On top of that, particularly given the availability of DNA technology, we have to ensure that it's just impossible for us to execute somebody who's innocent.",
        "And then third, we know that, because I know the justice system very well.",
        "I lived in it for decades.",
        "We know that many cases, if you have high-quality representation, it makes a huge difference in the likelihood of conviction, in the likelihood of the death penalty.",
        "And I might add, I'm also opposed to what they have getting a little in the (unintelligible), but bear with me, to what they've described as death-qualified jurors, which means that the prosecution is prevented to ask the jury whether they will vote, whether they have any -have any objection to the death penalty.",
        "And if they do, then they're excluded from service.",
