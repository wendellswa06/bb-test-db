        "What has it been about the relationship with Black Entertainment Television that has made such a grand marriage between Bobby Jones and BET?",
        "One might not believe how high your ratings are on a network that otherwise really speaks to young people in a different--some would say even a different ideological and certainly image bent and slant.",
        "Well, I don't think people would realize how many years this show has had the ratings that it's had.",
        "In fact, many years I didn't know what the ratings were because they probably didn't want me to know.",
        "They thought maybe I would ask for more of something, I don't really know.",
        "But it has--the reason why that relationship is so strong, I think, is because of need.",
        "They needed it, BET, some music like that to kind of counterbalance the other kind of presentations that happen there.",
        "And I needed it.",
        "We needed it.",
        "The gospel world needed it.",
        "And at this point, we are still the only black gospel show with a format for music as it is, like it is, that serves the nation on cable television.",
        "(Soundbite of gospel music)",
        "How did you, Bobby, at a time that perhaps it wasn't as popular as it is now, find a way to mesh the idea of delivering the word and delivering it in a way that was entertaining, almost--and no stigma meant here--showy?",
        "Well, it was a in-person meeting at Beth Myers' house in the Boston area and it was really important that Paul Ryan not be detected getting to Boston.",
        "So, as Beth tells the story, the congressman boarded a commercial flight in Chicago wearing jeans, a baseball cap and sunglasses - not how he usually dresses.",
        "When he landed in Connecticut, Beth's 19-year-old son Curt picked him up in a rented SUV where they drove to Beth's house, had lunch with her family and a few Romney advisors.",
        "Bunny, let me direct you to talk a little bit about your position and your role at the Army Corps of Engineers.",
        "You were hired by a retired African-American general who was the first black man to head the Army Corps of Engineers.",
        "OK.",
        "Yes, the music was rejected, Ed, initially, especially in your what we call high-order black churches in America.",
        "They wanted no part of gospel music because it was mostly that music that was designed and presented in churches of the low socioeconomic settings where people were.",
        "So they kind of like pushed it to the back and never wanted to do it.",
        "But when I saw how interesting the music was, and I thought if we could add a little bit of--excuse this word, but just for a better word--class to it that it could be acceptable if it was organized and presented in a way where people could just enjoy the raw elements of gospel music rather than tagging it with all of the other social idioms that go along with that; that it would be accepted and that it would be a piece of work that could go anywhere any other music could go.",
        "But it was a struggle to get it there.",
        "But that's what I had to do initially, to get this done.",

        "So that's going to limit a lot of the exposure from some of the artists unless we start independent record label presentations.",

        "And I know that's not an easy way to describe the state of gospel music in the church, but I see that we do have some challenges ahead.",
        "Well, quagmire it may be, but one of the lights that has tried to work through that quagmire for a long, long time and of--a quarter of a century time on Black Entertainment Television is my friend Bobby Jones.",
