        "So if that was August 5th, the shooting at the Sikh temple, wouldn't that have been the same day?",

        "So if Paul Ryan was at the memorial service on Friday, how did he get to Norfolk for the vice presidential rollout the following morning?",
        "Well, you got to remember there were TV networks that literally had people parked outside of Paul Ryan's house so the campaign did more cloak and dagger stuff.",
        "After the memorial service, one of Paul Ryan's congressional staffers drove the congressman home.",
        "He dropped Congressman Ryan off at the house where Ryan's sister-in-law was in the house to keep the lights on while the congressman snuck out the back door into the woods behind his house.",

        "And that's where the same congressional staffer who had just dropped him off, came around to pick him up.",

        "Then the campaign announced that there would be a VP pick the next morning.",
        "And as Beth tells the story, she turned off her phone, went to sleep, woke up early yesterday morning and drove with one Secret Service agent, the Romney crew and Paul Ryan to Norfolk where the announcement happened.",

        "The contract was multibillion dollars, somewhere around 7 billion, you know, dollars, and the contract was supposed to be a bridge to competition, and I felt that it should look like a bridge, you know, to competition, and that the duration should not be five years, after I had advised the office of secretary of Defense, the Army and the Corps of Engineers that it should not be no more than one year, and therefore, you know, I had to put in a contingency, you know, of the approval that five years was absolutely unnecessary and certainly would lead the public to believe that we had no intention of having a limited competition.",
