        "So yes, a lot of things are going on in the world, but we just, you know, for sheer watercooler, we just have to talk about this Twitter exchange between President Trump and the hosts of MSNBC's \"\"Morning Joe,\"\" Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.",

        "And the reason we're - the reasons we're bringing this up is it continued today with President Trump saying, you know, calling Joe Scarborough crazy Joe and dumb-as-a-rock Mika, saying they're not bad people, but their low-rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses - too bad.",
        "And for the record, it is not low-rated.",
        "So I just have to ask, you know, people have been talking about this and raising a lot of different issues, whether he was, you know, using the National Enquirer to threaten, whether the - and so many things.",
        "So I just wanted to ask each of you, what's the what here for you?",
        "What is the what here for you?",

        "You know, I think back to the campaign, when you had women telling reporters that they didn't think a woman could be president because hormones because emotions.",

        "You know, if he has a problem with powerful women, he's meeting the most powerful woman in the world, German Chancellor Angela Merkel.",
        "Our allies expect not only a commitment to democratic values from us, leadership on those values, including respect and equality and - but they also expect stability.",
        "They expect knowing that the president of the United States is not set off by petty arguments and easily slings invective.",

        "We've known for years that the president of the United States is a cyberbully, a misogynist who has this thing about women and blood.",
        "So who I'm mad at right now is the 52 percent of white women who voted for Trump.",

        "Yeah, I mean, like Paul, I was not surprised by this comment.",
        "It takes a lot to surprise me from the president anymore.",
        "What I did find sort of interesting was how kind of macabre and disgusting it was.",
        "And, you know, we do, of course, know that Trump thinks a lot about women and blood.",
        "We saw this with Megyn Kelly when he talked about blood coming from her wherever."
