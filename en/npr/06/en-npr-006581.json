        "I have talked to some of these couples, and they are lovely.",
        "Tell us a little bit about them.",
        "Mainly, the couples I've spoken to have been together for--and this is the honest truth--they've been together for over 40 years, so it has been quite an emotional time, because they never actually thought they'd see this during their lifetime, because they can still remember when homosexuality in this country was illegal.",
        "So it's a massive, massive moment for them, really, the fact that they will get legal recognition.",
        "It has really been wonderful.",
        "It's a real historic time here, and you can actually feel, almost feel, the society shifting forward.",
        "It's just brilliant.",
        "In some parts of the country, I understand, registrars have said that personally they're not thrilled with this, being required to perform this service.",
        "What's the situation there in Brighton, or have...",
        "There are--none of my registrars will--no, there's none of them in Brighton at all.",
        "We're all really, really excited.",
        "And there were some--many of them came in very early yesterday morning so that they could be there to witness the historic moment when we took the first notices.",
        "And on the 21st of December, when we can actually form the first civil partnerships, they're all coming in.",
        "They've all got jobs to do, whether it be handing out champagne or welcoming the couples and their guests.",
        "We've all got something to do on that day.",
        "Now, obviously, registrars do other things as well.",
        "We do.",
        "You register births and deaths.",
        "And marriages.",

        "Yeah, so it is going to add to our work, but we don't mind.",

        "Yes, there is a certificate.",

        "We're using a manual system, actually.",
        "I should say that the civil partnerships were due to go online.",
        "An American company, ManTech, were developing--well, they are developing this for us, and eventually they will be registered on the United Kingdom's first ever national Web-based civil registration system, but it's not quite ready.",
        "So what will happen is we will register them manually and issue a certificate from that, in the sort of loose-leaf folder, the register is, but...",
        "Is it a handsome certificate?",
        "It's official-looking.",
        "It's watermarked paper with the General Register Office crest at the top.",
        "And it is the first certificate in this country that records both parents' details, including the mother.",
        "We're very archaic over here, and at the moment on a marriage certificate, we only record the father's name and occupation of the person who's taking part in the ceremony.",
        "And on the civil partnership, we'll be recording both mother and father, so that's quite exciting.",
        "And will you take care to ensure that the first one will have your name on it, too?",
        "(Laughs) I think I might be fighting my colleagues for that."

        "The civil partnership in the United Kingdom is just one example of same-sex union, one that mirrors a handful of other European countries.",
        "And joining us now to talk about different kinds of same-sex partnerships and sometimes marriage that are allowed in other countries around the globe is Robert Wintemute.",

        "Can you briefly outline them for us?",
        "Sure.",
        "The simplest model is just to take what we already have, which is marriage, and allow same-sex couples to enter this existing institution.",
        "The second model is to create something new, a kind of separate but mainly equal--create a new institution that has the same rights and duties as marriage, but give it another name, and that's what we have in the United Kingdom starting this month, civil partnership.",
        "You have that in Connecticut and Vermont, civil unions; California, domestic partners--after different names around the world.",
        "Third option is to create something new and let everyone, any couple, enter into it.",
        "New Zealand has that.",
        "They call it civil unions.",
        "And a different-sex couple can enter into that there.",
        "And finally, the fourth model is to have something new, open to everyone, but it doesn't give all the rights and duties of marriage.",
        "And that's what they have in France, for example."

        "It was just super.",
        "And I think to myself that one day in the United States they will look back at this issue like they have looked at the issue of not granting black and white couples the ability to marry, or some of the other policies that have held women down or various other minority groups, and they'll feel ashamed that they didn't, long before this, do the right and the noble thing.",
