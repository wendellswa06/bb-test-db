        "Even opponents, even the Conservative Party, which was against the legislation here, was willing--many of the people in the party were willing to accept some kind of civil union or some sort of an arrangement that's similar to what Britain is doing, but they didn't want an equal status with a union between a man and a woman.",
        "For Spain, obviously, for many, many, many years, Catholicism was the official religion.",

        "There are certain judges--there are judges who perform marriages, and some places that mayors do it.",

        "One, in particular, has made a legal case citing conscientious objection.",
        "Now the government says you can't cite conscientious objection, in this case because that would be like saying, `I refuse to marry people of different colors or different races or different ethnic groups,' which would be a clear form of discrimination here.",

        "The number of marriages declining--it would be hard to have the number declining, because they only started in 2001.",
        "But what I think you might find is that not necessarily all couples, same-sex couples, want to get married.",
        "I think what you find is most same-sex couples want to have the choice, the right, the freedom to decide and the freedom to say no. So--and then there's no inconsistency there, because the issue is really about every couple having the same options.",

        "Mm, that's a tricky question.",
