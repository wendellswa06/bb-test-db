        "And then you get on to the questions of equal treatment of couples and parental rights, access to adoption, etc. So in China they don't have any criminal laws anymore, but there is no law against discrimination based on sexual orientation and there are no groups that are in a position to campaign for it.",
        "So the situation--they're at a very early stage there.",
        "In India, they still have a criminal law left over from the British Empire.",
        "So certain forms of sexual activity between men are a criminal offense in India.",
        "And the question whether that's constitutional is before the Indian Supreme Court.",
        "And until that question is resolved, the society is not going to move on to talk about equal access to marriage for same-sex couples.",
        "And this is--is it on the agenda at all in Muslim countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, all the way through the Arabian side?",
        "No.",
        "In most Muslim countries, same-sex sexual activity or at least between men is a criminal offense.",

        "But nothing has been enacted yet except in two provinces in Argentina.",
        "The most important one is in the city of--the city of Buenos Aires has a law that allows same-sex and different-sex couples to register their relationships.",
        "But my understanding is the city doesn't have the power to grant all the rights and duties that go with marriage.",

        "No, the equivalent in the US is more a domestic partner law in New York City or Washington, DC, or San Francisco, where you can register at the city level and you get certain benefits, but it's nowhere near what you would get through a marriage.",

        "The photoreceptor cells that I just mentioned, which are there to receive the light, actually are not on top of the retina where you would expect them, so close to the lens, but they're actually on the far side - which means that all the light has to propagate through the entire retina before it can be received by the photoreceptor cells.",
        "Which seems to be a very strange arrangement, because that means that any image that's under the retina can potentially be scattered, distorted, and the image quality deteriorates.",
        "And that's been a puzzle for a very long time, why the retina is inverted and why we still see clear images.",
        "I mean, that situation amounts to putting a sun diffusing screen in front of your photograph film or CCD chip in your camera and then expecting that you can get clean images.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, that's the general problem that you have to deal with in this situation.",
        "So, what we published a few years back, actually was - that there are some cells in the retina called Muller glial cells, which are long cylindrical and have a high receptive index, and they work just like optical fibers they use for telecommunications, for example, that kind of channel the light almost all the way down through the retina.",
        "Like a tube.",

        "That would be a very extreme situation, I think.",
        "It's not as black and white, but they have to get light, basically, almost all the way down to the retina, to the photoreceptor cells.",
        "And that seems to take care of most of the problem, especially in diurnal animals such as ourselves.",
        "The nocturnal animals are different because they want to see at very low light levels, which means they need to have very high sensitivity.",
        "And they do that by having a lot of rod photoreceptor cells.",
        "So many of them - which means that there are also many nuclei to these photoreceptor cells.",
        "And these nuclei pile up basically in the last third of the retina.",
        "So, the light gets through these cells that I just mentioned, about two-thirds down, and then the light still has to go through these nuclei.",
        "And they can potentially scatter the light and deteriorate the image.",
        "So, what we found now is that there's a very specific adaptation of these nuclei to get the light all the way down to the photoreceptor cells.",
        "And what is the adaptation?",
        "Well, that's actually a very crazy story, because nuclei, in a biological context, are mostly thought of as the place where you have DNA, where transcription takes place, where the genetic code is stored and then read out, and then passed on to the rest of the cell.",
        "Right."
