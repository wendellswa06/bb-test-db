        "It's about two meters - if you stretch out the DNA that is contained in the single nucleus.",
        "So, it's very difficult (unintelligible) to get all that long DNA stretch into the nucleus and they just solved that problem by coiling that DNA up and wrapping it around histones and so forth to create different territories, actually, within the nucleus.",
        "So, that's very, very densely packed chromatin, which is called heterochromatin, that is not used.",
        "There's nothing read out, so you can kind of safely store that away.",
        "That heterochromatin is usually found at the parameter or the periphery of the nucleus, whereas the euchromatin is just the other kind of chromatin that is more accessible and less densely packed that still provides access for molecules to get in there and to the transcription and to RNA that is found in the center.",
        "So, the nocturnal animals have found a way of using this DNA to magnify this - the light that's coming in?",
        "That is correct, yeah.",
        "And that's different than what we do?",
        "That is different than…",
        "You know, we always think, as you said, we always think of DNA as just being the genetic blueprint, as a chemical object.",
        "But this is -the DNA is actually acting like a physical conduit?",
        "Not the individual molecule itself…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…but the fact that you have a lot of it.",
        "Right."

        "Well, it takes - this is more like a physics problem than a biology problem.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And that's the reason why we, as physicists, are actually involved in this particular study.",
        "So, you physicists had to tell the biologists how to look at their eyes?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "One way of looking at it, I guess, yes.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So, you - how did you get this - how did you, as a physicist, get to be involved with the biologists?",
        "Well, exactly because of that.",
        "There was basically the need to interpret the data that our colleagues in Munich and Frankfurt had found a little bit differently than what the biologists would normally do.",
        "So, the group of Thomas Cremer in Munich, they've kind of pioneered this idea of different chromosome territories within the nuclei.",
        "And they started to look at mouse because mouse is a convenient animal to use.",
        "And they looked at the retina because - and this layer they've been talking about and there are many in the nuclei and they just wanted to see what's going on within these nuclei.",

        "So, this colleague brought us together and said, well, the two of you should talk and kind of maybe…",
        "Right.",
        "…you can figure out what's going on here.",
        "Don't you think there should be more cross-fertilization this way between…?",

        "The molecular biology that's the current state of the art in biology was also founded by physicists.",
        "And I think there is some culture here in Cambridge, certainly, where this kind of cross fertilization is happening.",
