        "As a decorated naval aviator, a member of Congress for more than two decades, John McCain often campaigns on the strength of his foreign policy experience.",
        "The next president faces any number of challenges around the world in Iraq, Afghanistan, Russia, China, to name just a few.",
        "Two weeks ago, we spoke with the senior adviser to the Obama campaign about how they see America in the world.",
        "If you missed that conversation, there's a link to it on our Web site.",
        "Today we get the view for the McCain campaign.",
        "Many Mondays, Ted Koppel joins us.",
        "He's managing editor of the Discovery Channel and our NPR news analyst here on Talk of the Nation.",
        "Our guest, Randy Scheunemann, director of foreign policy and national security for the McCain-Palin campaign.",
        "What do you think the foreign policy priorities of the next administration ought to be?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And Ted, why don't you start us off?",
        "Well, I'm reminded of an all-night Senate session that took place months and months and months ago, but one of the things that leaped out at me - and this must have happened, I just happened to be watching at 1:30 or two o'clock in the morning - and there was Senator McCain on the floor, and he said something which on the face of it is self-evident but you never hear senior politicians talking about it.",
        "And he said one of the reasons that Iraq and our presence in Iraq is so important to the national interest of the United States is oil.",
        "Is he going to be talking about that during the campaign, Mr. Scheunemann?",
        "Well, he's certainly going to talk about the importance of Iraq stakes, our interests that are at stake, the consequences of alternative policy options that Senators Obama and Biden have advocated over the year.",
        "I mean, clearly - over the years, excuse me.",
        "Clearly, what we have seen with the tremendous rise in oil prices is the impact of events in oil-producing countries far from our borders has a significant economic impact on the United States.",
        "That's why Senator McCain has laid forward a comprehensive vision to move us away from dependence on imported oil and a comprehensive energy policy in the context of Iraq.",
        "Clearly, if we did not have the oil that Iraq is supplying to the world market today, prices would be even higher and American consumers would be paying even more for gasoline and heating oil.",
        "Actually, I wasn't referring specifically to the oil that comes from Iraq alone.",
        "Obviously, that's included in the equation, but is it Senator McCain's position that one of the reasons that Iraq is so important to us and that stability in Iraq is so important is that a lack of stability can bleed over into other parts of the Persian Gulf, which, of course, is arguably the most important region in the world for oil and natural gas.",
        "Clearly, the consequences of what we do in Iraq will have a huge impact on stability throughout the region, in Saudi Arabia and Jordan and certainly in Iran.",
        "And had we followed the course of action advocated by Senator Obama last year, which was to adhere to a rigid timetable for withdrawal, which he put forward in January 2007, all troops would have been out in March of 2008 or April of 2008 under his plan.",
        "And I think it's clear that Iraq would have been in chaos.",
        "Senator Obama also, in May of 2007, voted against 94.4 billion dollars in supplemental emergency funds dedicated to funding our troops fighting on the ground in Iraq and in Afghanistan.",
        "And had his position prevailed, funds would have been cut off and it would have then forced the most precipitous withdrawal imaginable.",
        "Instead, we have proceeded on the surge strategy, something Senator McCain advocated since the fall 2003 after his first return from his first visit in Iraq.",
        "Had we followed that policy earlier, I think the positive effects we have seen over the past 18 months would have been in place much earlier.",
        "But we are where we are now and the fact is that violence is down dramatically, the Iranians have not achieved their goals, al-Qaeda in Iraq is on the run but not fully defeated, and we have the prospect of a stable Iraq, able to govern itself, not pose a threat to its neighbors without large-scale U.S.",
        "forces, a realistic prospect for us to talk about.",
        "Yes.",
        "I actually have one correction and one question.",
        "I'm here in Azerbaijan, right beside Georgia, and a lot of the work I was doing with direct - affected directly by Georgian - a lot of my colleagues are there.",
        "And Georgia did indeed attack first.",
        "So, you know, that just needs to be put out there.",
        "But the Russian's response was a bit too much.",
        "But my question was, McCain seems to prefer military-type responses or military-backed diplomacy, or that's the impression I get.",
        "What I wanted to know was what does McCain plan on doing to improve international relations because in my work - I just finished a job in Afghanistan and now I'm here in Azerbaijan - and really, the world just doesn't like the U.S., and I fear that more McCain is going to equal more Bush, at least that's how the world will perceive it.",
        "So what's McCain going to do to change that?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air."

        "Davidson, thanks for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "OK, bye.",
        "Well, Davidson, I'm glad to hear that NPR is listened to halfway around the world, in Baku or whatever part of Azerbaijan you're in, and I thank you for the question.",
        "Frankly, it is a complete misperception to think that Senator McCain has a preference from military options.",
        "Just the opposite, as he said repeatedly, he hates war and as a veteran he knows firsthand the cost of war.",
        "He has talked about using all of the tools at our disposal: economic, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, financial, as well as the military tool in the struggle against radical Islamic extremism.",
        "In regards to the question about how America is viewed in the world, Senator McCain has said repeatedly that America's image is a strategic asset, every bit as important as our army divisions, army brigades and aircraft carriers, and that we have neglected under this administration the impact of certain actions of ours that have on our image around the world.",
        "Senator McCain has called for the closing of Guantanamo.",
        "Senator McCain stood up to the Bush administration on issues of detainee treatment, forced a change in the law to make clear that we do not abuse those individuals that are under our custody, whatever actions they may have committed.",
        "He did those things because he believed they were right based on his personal experiences but also because he's traveled the world and he has met with foreign leaders and he understands how harmful the images of Abu Ghraib in Guantanamo and the idea that Americans would torture detainees, how negatively that affects our image in the world and our ability to work with our allies on common threats, as well as to pursue common opportunities, depends on perception of the United Stated.",
        "So in that sense I think he's very different from the current administration as he's stood up to them on a number of occasions.",
        "Here's an email question from Craig in Moose Lake, Minnesota.",
        "Global overpopulation must be the top priority of any administration.",
        "We're heading into a global emergency of global warming, water and food and energy shortages, poverty, war.",
        "Every issue we do with in a stop-gap manner is made worse by growing human numbers.",
        "When energy runs out, we'll no longer be able to support our current population, let alone another two to four billion.",
        "We must do everything we can to bring down numbers through birth control to the two billion scientists say the world can sustain.\"\" Is global population going to be a priority in the McCain administration?",
        "Well, you know, I thank Craig for the question but I think we would approach things a little bit differently.",
        "We heard this view in the 1970s that somehow there was an optimum number of people in the world and that resources were declining and that we are running out of things and there were all kinds of predictions made about what we would be running out of in the 1980s or by 1990.",
        "Fortunately, those didn't come true because those models tend to underestimate human ingenuity and human entrepreneurship.",
        "Senator McCain has been very outspoken on the need to combat disease.",
        "For example in Africa, where the goal of eradicating malaria, was strong supporter of significantly increased funding to make more effective drugs and retrovirals available to those people in Africa and elsewhere that were infected with HIV.",
        "So I think it's a little bit of an oversimplification to say that from overpopulation stems all other problems.",
        "But certainly Senator McCain shares a concern that is implicit in the question about the need to do more on global warming.",
        "In 2003 he introduced the first legislation to provide for a cap-and-trade system.",
        "He has broken with the Bush administration on that issue, as well, very significantly, on the need to do much more to control carbon dioxide emissions and to work cooperatively on an international, truly global solution to what is a global problem.",
        "Let me draw on a variation of the same theme.",
        "The Chinese are putting an additional 9,000 cars a day on the road.",
        "Between the Chinese and the Indians, the demand for oil, in particular, is going to grow exponentially over the next few years.",
        "What exactly is the McCain plan for dealing with that problem?"

        "Senator McCain has spoken extensively about what we need to do here at home, but also noted what other countries are pursuing on the transportation side, which he specifically mentioned.",
        "The Chinese are also very advanced in research into biofuels, and in fact, into biofuels and methanol, for example, which does not compete with food crops for growing.",
        "Senator McCain has talked about flex fuels, he's talked about incentives for a battery that is commercially viable that would make electric cars more widely available and more commercially viable in the United States.",
        "He's also talked about the need for additional nuclear power, which is a clean, safe form of technology and note that the next step on the U.S.-India civil nuclear accord is approved by the nuclear supplier's group.",
        "To the extent India is generating its power through nuclear means, they are not generating carbon dioxide emissions.",
        "And so it's got to be a multi-faceted approach.",
        "There's no silver bullet but between nuclear power and getting a transportation network that doesn't revolve around gasoline will do a significant - significant improvement in the emissions from - not just from United States but also from emerging powers and rapidly growing economies like China and India.",

        "Yeah, my question is actually one posed by Joe Biden yesterday.",
        "And that was, again, this - seeing this as a regional conflict as opposed to as a conflict between states, and John Mccain seems to be comfortable with - again, the state-by-state conflict.",
        "But since he has refused to speak with Syria or Iran and in fact, as indicated, he'd like to bomb Iran, does that really make him a good candidate or a good president in terms of making decisions on a regional basis, which is, again, many of these issues are regionally-based and we're going to have to work with a number of people.",

        "Unless you're talking about negotiations with a regional organization, you can only solve problems regionally by working with individual governments.",
        "In the case of Iran, Senator McCain has been a strong supporter of more effective diplomatic, political, economic and financial sanctions to dissuade the Iranian government from its current course, while at the same time supporting the very generous package of incentives that has been put on the table with the support of the United States by our European partners in the negotiations with Iran.",
        "So the issue with Iran isn't lack of negotiations or even the level of negotiations.",
        "The issue with Iran is...",
        "Well, would he speak directly with them?",
        "The issue with Iran is getting the right balance of carrots and sticks of incentives and disincentives to prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons, which would have catastrophic consequences.",
        "It would certainly endanger the existence of our valued ally in Israel and it would certainly set up a regional nuclear arms race.",
        "And I think the last thing we need to see is more nuclear powers in the Middle East.",
        "But it seems pretty clear that a number of countries, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt would consider their own nuclear programs or considering their own civilian nuclear programs right now, should the Iranians get nuclear weapons.",
        "And so that would be a very, very high priority in the McCain administration.",

        "And let me also add, would it be willing to tolerate an agreement with North Korea that let Pyongyang hang on to some of its nuclear weapons?",
        "Well, let's take Iran first.",
        "As I said in response to the question from the previous caller, the consequences of an Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic.",
        "They would be devastating.",
        "Our European allies and partners understand this, not only for the state of Israel, which rightly views Iranian possession of nuclear weapons as an existential threat, it would trigger a regional nuclear arms race.",
        "We've already seen the Syrians try to move down the nuclear road with North Korean assistance.",
        "And so I think that the idea that the world would somehow be better place if Iran had nuclear weapons is belied by the facts and certainly not a view that's shared by our closest allies.",

        "The security of East Asia, certainly the security of the Grand Peninsula, is worse off since the North Koreans decided to start building nuclear weapons.",
