        "Flurys, a legendary European-style tea room, stays open all night on Christmas Eve, says manager Rajeev Khanna.",
        "And Randy Scheunemann, we're getting a lot of questions from listeners about your previous lobbying work for the state of Georgia, with the company you still co-own but you've left the lobbying part of it since March when new rules were put in by the McCain campaign.",
        "But is it not a conflict of interest, do you think, for lobbyists, for foreign governments, to be advisers to presidential candidates?",
        "I think what's important, Neal, is for disclosure in every - all the work I have done, whether for domestic or foreign client, has been fully disclosed, consistent with all the requirements of U.S.",
        "law.",
        "That's the reason people are able to know so much about what meetings I did and what my firm was paid because we did fully disclose that work.",
        "I'm proud of the work I've done for countries that have successfully gotten into NATO, like Latvia and Romania over the years.",
        "I'm proud of the work I've done for Georgia, which is a struggling democracy seeking to get closer to the West in the face of, as we discussed earlier, some pretty significant Russian opposition.",
        "And Senator McCain, as well as anybody else I ever discussed any of my clients with, knew fully who I was working for and knew that I wouldn't be working for them if I didn't share their goals.",
        "Since we're back on the subject of Georgia again, let me tie up one loose end.",
        "The agreement that appears to have been worked out between the Russians and the Europeans would have Russian troops remaining in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.",
        "Would that be acceptable to President McCain?",
        "I think, first, let's get to implementing - the Russians actually implementing what they have promised to implement in the past, and that is to get Russian forces out of non-disputed areas, including areas where they are literally hundreds of kilometers from South Ossetia.",
        "The Russians also had an interpretation of a provision of additional security measures which was disputed by the French.",
        "But the agreement calls for forces going back to the status quo level of August 6th, in which case we're talking about a relatively small number of so-called peacekeepers in Ossetia and Abkhazia.",
        "I think what's going to be critical, if we get to that point, is to get true international peacekeepers in there, truly an independent, impartial force, which is something that the Georgians and the United States government and many in Europe have been calling for for a long time, because obviously, Russian actions make it clear they're not playing the role of peacekeeper, they're playing the role of belligerent.",
        "Does the agreement actually call for the return of the same number or does it mention numbers at all?",
        "My understanding is that it recalls the same level and deployment of forces.",
        "In which case, the Russian's would be eligible for about 300, I believe, is the number in South Ossetia, slightly larger number in Abkhazia.",
        "Would a McCain administration help the Georgians reequip and retrain their army?",
        "That's not something Senator McCain has talked about publicly.",
        "He certainly was, it this current context, he certainly was supportive.",
        "The number of programs that took place in previous years that enabled the Georgians to improve their capabilities, and of course, the Georgians did it not because of designs they had on anything to do on Georgian territory but because they wanted to be participants in international security operations."

        "A number of my friends in the foreign policy field, when I ask, what's your worst nightmare, what keeps you awake at night, the answer is Pakistan.",
        "Is there anything new and different that a McCain administration would do with regard to concerns about Pakistan, which, after all, has many nuclear weapons?",
        "Well, certainly, Ted, I think that we'd have to agree with your friends in the foreign policy community that Pakistan poses one of the most significant challenges for a new president.",
        "I think unfortunately, on the part of the Obama campaign, there's been some oversimplification of just how difficult the situation is.",
        "You know, Senator Obama has talked publicly about undertaking unilateral military action in Pakistan, which makes it more difficult to get the support of those we need in the Pakistani government because of an understandable backlash.",
        "Which the Bush administration apparently did last week.",
        "The Bush administration has done this but the difference is, Neal, you don't see President Bush or Secretary Gates or Secretary Rice going to the podium and announcing to the world they're going to undertake unilateral military action in Pakistan, whether the government likes it or not, for the very obvious reason that it makes it more difficult to get the cooperation of the government.",
        "That's what Senator Obama seems unable to understand.",
        "They've also, in the Obama campaign, scored their rhetorical debating point about putting all the eggs in the Musharraf basket for too long, and they need to update that one because President Musharraf is no longer in power, there's a new president.",
        "In fact, Senator McCain spoke with the new president, Zardari, yesterday morning, and it's going to be a very difficult challenge.",
        "The reality is we cannot succeed in achieving our security goals in Pakistan without working with the government, and that's going to be difficult.",
        "They're going to have forces that don't want to move in the federally-administered tribal areas in Waziristan.",
        "It's going to involve a lot of military aid, it's going to involve development aid and it's going to be tough and it's going to be frustrating, but we have no alternative.",
        "That's the realistic view of dealing with Pakistan.",
        "Randy Sheunemann, thanks very much.",

        "The National Security Council is the group that advises the president on national security decisions.",
        "And that was first created by statute in 1947 and has existed in various forms since that time.",
        "After the 9/11 attacks, President Bush created an additional council called the Homeland Security Council, which is a similar group of advisers - and largely overlapping - that advises the president on homeland security issues, which are really just threats to the homeland as opposed to more international issues, which may involve foreign policy and may not involve threats to the homeland.",
        "So yesterday, the president issued a national security presidential memorandum, which defines the functions and structure of these two councils and the membership on them.",
        "And why does Steve Bannon's position on this council stand out to you?",
        "Well, the president can, of course - there's no law against it - take advice from anyone he wants on either his National Security Council or his Homeland Security Council.",
        "Both have traditionally included the vice president, secretaries of state and defense and attorney general, secretary of the Treasury.",
        "But presidents have historically not involved members of the political side of the House at the White House.",
        "So, for example, in the Bush administration, Karl Rove was specifically not included in National Security Council meetings or the meetings of the group just below that, the Principals Committee meeting, which are the same Cabinet secretaries but meeting without the president.",
        "And the reason President Bush did that and, I think, presidents generally have not wanted to include domestic political advisers is they want to send the signal that national security decision-making is not based on domestic political concerns.",
        "Now, there's one other thing that you said you feel perhaps many people may have overreported, if I can use that term.",
        "The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has been - his role in - his role - it is a him - has been described differently in this new memorandum.",

        "That's right.",
        "I do think, actually, the press has gotten this part wrong, at least so far.",
        "We'll have to see what happens.",
        "The memorandum issued by the president yesterday creates a Principals Committee below the National Security Council.",
        "And the Principals Committee, rather than always including the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, says that they shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.",
        "Some have suggested that that seems to be excluding them from some meetings and that perhaps the president specifically doesn't want to hear from his director of national intelligence or chairman of the Joint Chiefs.",
        "I read that differently.",
        "Since the Principals Committee reports to both the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, it does seem that the Principals Committee could be covering issues like hurricanes that - where those two would not need to be involved.",
