        "Yeah.",
        "A resistor.",
        "Well, so if I put my little meter to measure the resistance on one side of it, and I switched it around to measure the other side, that I reversed the polarity, am I going to get the same reading?",
        "Absolutely right.",
        "I mean, that's one of the interesting things that memristors offer is the ability to dramatically actually decrease the amount of power that's required in a variety of integrated circuits, both memory circuits and perhaps even logic circuits.",
        "So, you can shrink them down, too, because they don't need much power.",
        "It depends on the type of memristor.",
        "I mean, what you're describing there is a static measurement on a device.",
        "And so, if you did that with a diode, you would get a different reading.",
        "So, diodes are devices in which the resistance differs depending upon the polarity of the voltage attached to it.",
        "The difference about a memristor is that the resistance will change as the function of the amount of current that goes through it.",
        "So, if you put your ohm meter on a memristor and you're flowing current through it, what you'll see is that the resistance will change with time.",
        "So, are you building circuits with this device now?",
        "Yes, we are.",
        "We've been - when we first really kind of understood what we had about a year and a half ago, and you know, before we actually published a paper on this, we knew that this is a very extraordinary claim.",
        "And so extraordinary claims require, shall we say, extraordinary verification.",
        "So, we don't...",

        "Something like that, yes.",
        "And so we have worked very hard both on individual devices.",
        "Simple circuits containing several memristors and now, even mixed circuits containing transistors and memristors in the same circuit to look at their properties and understand what they would be good for.",
        "Yeah, you're not sure what they would be good for yet, huh?",
        "Well, you know my guess is that the real utilization of these things is going to come from some bright young person who is either, you know still in high school or maybe even in college right now.",
        "But you know, we've got some ideas of things that we're going to look at and so one of those ideas actually involves a - what we call a non-volatile random access memory.",
        "And then another one involves what we call essentially a synaptic circuit.",
        "And now, I noticed that part of your title is that you work in the Quantum Systems Lab.",
        "That's correct.",
        "This is not a quantum device then?",
        "I mean, it doesn't behave quantumly, does it?",
        "Well, in the Quantum Systems Laboratory which has been around in various guises for nearly 13 years at Hewlett Packard, our primary you know, claim the fame in some senses.",
        "We can make very small things.",
        "And so, the whole issue is that of course, quantum mechanical properties emerge as you specially get into the nanoscale regime.",
        "Well, you know, not only did quantum properties emerge in some systems, but when we're looking at these nanoscale devices, we saw that memristance emerged.",
        "So, really the common factor here is working at the nanometer scale.",
        "We're today about the memristors on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News with Stan Williams of Hewlett Packard.",
        "So, let's see.",
        "There's some - couple of really interesting questions.",
        "Let's get to them on the phone now.",
        "Amshu (ph) in Elk Grove, California.",
        "Hi.",
        "AMSHU Caller): Hi there.",
        "I just wanted to ask your host - thanks for taking my call.",
        "I just wanted to ask your host that, does the Ohms Law's change in quantum circuitry or is there no valid Ohms Law because you got voltage and you got a resistance and the current there are constant parameters and if you will (unintelligible) quite changes, the resistance still remains the same proportionally?",
        "So, does that in quantum circuitry or it doesn't exist?",
        "Yeah, can you use Ohm's Law in the memrister?"

        "All right, Ohms Law, of course, is the direct proportionality of current and voltage as expressed through resistance because memristance changes with amount of charge.",
        "It does not obey Ohms law.",
        "So, it's a non-linear element, we call it.",
        "So, no memristance has its own behavior which you know, it's a little bit hard to explain on the air but for anyone who knows what an (unintelligible) is - I mean, what happens is that a memristor will have a current voltage characteristic that is an (unintelligible) figure.",
        "In other words, it's loops.",
        "It looks like a bow tie or a figure eight instead of just a straight line.",
        "So, it's sort of like when it goes out, it doesn't come back in the same direction.",
        "That's exactly correct.",
        "It goes out and comes back in a completely different place.",
        "And in that difference, there is that where you can store information.",
        "That's exactly correct, because you can think of it as - what the memristor does is that somehow integrates over its history and carries with it the information about its history.",
        "So, if you run current through it in one direction, you can increase the resistance, and you can call that a zero for the purposes of a computer.",
        "If you run current through it in the opposite direction, you can decrease the resistance, you can call that a one and because you can - the memristor will remember its state, it will remember the resistance even after you turn off the current.",
        "You then have what's called a non-volatile element.",
        "It will remember its state long after you turn the current off.",
        "So, you can keep computer memory theoretically alive so to speak, where you either pick up where you left off before.",
        "That's exactly correct.",
        "So, one of the ideas that we've been positing is having a computer that never has to be booted up or perhaps only booted up once because with a memristor based memory, when you turn the computer off, you will - all of the information that you had about your operating system in your various applications will just be stored right there, and it'll be immediately available as you as you turn the computer back on.",
        "So, it can actually save power.",
        "You were making money for your…"

        "It doesn't require power to operate but if you want to mimic the properties of the memristor, it takes a very large number of transistors.",
