        "And it is largely a Republican Party that is very Washington-centric, and a Republican base that is very anti-Washington.",
        "You have a lot of individuals within the Republican Party leadership who believe that the problem with government is not government, it's Democrats in charge of government, while the base still thinks the problem with government is government.",
        "But despite such divisions, the Republican Party - from the grassroots to K Street - is remarkably upbeat about its prospects.",
        "Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer - who was one of the three authors of the RNC autopsy report - says that's true, even though so much about the GOP rebrand is still a work in progress.",
        "Right now, the party remains pretty split.",
        "How that split ends up - does the party unify?",
        "I think it will.",
        "But who will it unify behind?",
        "This all is what remains to be seen for the big rebranding of the party.",
        "I find it amazing that the party - in comparison to the Democrats - is doing as well as it is doing without any rebranding taking place.",
        "It shows you how weak the Democrats are, how much trouble Obamacare has created.",
        "That may hold true - at least for upcoming midterm elections, which usually bring out a more Republican-friendly set of voters.",
        "But after that, Fleischer warns, the next presidential cycle will bring back all the demographic challenges the GOP still has not met.",
        "2016 will be a test of a lot of the weaknesses that were exposed in 2012.",
        "And before you get to 2015-16 cycle, you have to get through the 2014 cycle, which likely is going to be a very successful cycle for Republicans, even without improving the brand, particularly.",
        "The worst thing Republicans can do is win a lot of seats in 2014 and think that the same electorate will show up in 2016, because it won't.",
        "The voters in 2016 are going to be much younger, much blacker, and much more Hispanic.",
        "It is a very different electorate than a much older, whiter electorate that is going to show up in 2014.",
        "So, even if the party is celebrating midterm victories about a year from now, it will have to turn its attention again to the unfinished business of rebranding itself for an emerging electorate.",
        "And it will have that much less time left to do it.",

        "Well, ours is probably a little different position because we did not expand Medicaid like they did in Colorado.",
        "But we are concerned about the long-term sustainability aspects of the Affordable Care Act.",
        "We want to make sure in fact that insurance premiums are affordable as opposed to the double-digit increase we see taking place throughout the country.",
        "We in fact believe that there's opportunities for the states to have a larger role in developing policy.",

        "And frankly those are very similar issues.",

        "When the plan that you and Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich designed spoke about making it easier for states to change the plan, would they be changing the core benefits that people receive from the plan?",
        "If not, what should you streamline in the way of change?",
        "So we were not talking about changing in any way the essential benefits that people receive under these various plans, right?",
        "What we were suggesting was changing the actual process by which a state would seek to have a waiver that, again, wouldn't change the composition of a plan or what benefits someone got but would change some of the more detailed stuff about how you can move money from one part of the state government to another or how you would be able to create a reinsurance pool more successfully and more cost effectively.",
        "Governor Herbert, your state has very interesting demographics 'cause Utah's a very young state, which would mean you have a lot of very healthy, young adults who don't buy health insurance very often.",
        "The letter that Governor Kasich and Governor Hickenlooper wrote said - I believe one provision was, keep the individual mandate, a position that that wasn't easy for a lot of Republicans.",
        "Does it make sense to you?",
        "Do you need the individual mandate to make sure that young, healthy people just don't stay uninsured until they get sick?",

        "Yeah, Chauncey Bailey, many people knew him as just a hard working, crusading journalist who was always for his community in Oakland.",
        "But a lot of people didn't realize that he had strong ties to cable access and television access for African-Americans, and that Oakland was really a leader in this.",
        "They had the first black-owned and controlled cable - local access cable station in the country, I believe.",
        "And that was Soul Beat TV, and was founded in the 1970s, even before BET.",
        "They did, you know, mostly show music videos.",
        "But over the years, it provided an outlet for community issues to be heard.",
        "Chauncey Bailey was actually news director there for eight years, and when it went away, he single-handedly was responsible for resurrecting its tradition.",
        "He founded a new local cable access station called Our TV, which was the successor to Soul Beat.",
        "Now, one of the biggest kahunas is Cathy Hughes, and she's got network Radio One.",
        "However, just a few days ago we heard that Radio One was going to sell its L.A.",
        "station, leaving it with no presence in this huge radio market.",
        "What do you see for Radio One and Cathy Hughes?",
        "Cathy Hughes is another early pioneer in this.",
        "You know, if you go back to her roots, she bought her first station, WOL in Washington, D.C., and she bought it because of some of the government policies that had recently been put in pace to help minority investors.",
        "So we kind of have to look back and say, would she even be this huge billionaire presence today if those policies hadn't been put in place?",
        "She was able to buy it from the Washington Post, I believe, under the distress sale policy, which was geared towards minority ownership.",
        "Radio One is the largest African-American radio network, but still, they only have about 54 stations.",
        "So if you compare it to something like a Clear Channel, which has just completely monopolized the industry with 1200 stations, it's relatively small.",
        "So what do you think lies ahead in terms of ownership?",
        "And put it in the context of this digital world, where you have so much distribution now happening, not over radio airwaves or even through cable television, but through a very different set of rules that operate on the net?"
