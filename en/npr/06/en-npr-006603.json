        "As it turns out, tracking down the chateau's furnishings is a major task of every Versailles curator.",
        "On October 5, 1789, a mob chased the king and his court from the palace and stole all the furniture.",
        "Saule says Versailles's furnishings are still spread all over the world, so the staff is constantly scouring estate sales and auctions everywhere.",
        "It's like a police inquiry.",
        "We are Sherlock Holmes.",
        "We are obliged to follow the pieces from the sale at the time of the revolution to today and see is there something which is in a place in the world and is it possible for us to buy it.",
        "In Utah, prior to the Affordable Care Act, we only had about 11 percent of our population which were not covered by insurance, and half of those could in fact afford it.",
        "They just chose for whatever reason not to buy it.",
        "And a lot of those, as you suggest, are the young invincibles.",
        "They think, well, I don't need that till I'm 40 or 50.",
        "Why get it now?",
        "And I'm not really convinced that we need to have a mandate.",
        "I think states can make that decision.",
        "I just don't think we should have a one-size-fits-all federal mandate.",
        "I'm just curious to hear from both of you, a Republican governor and a Democratic governor, upon your visit to Washington whether your sense of the Senate and the Congress right now is that Washington is in a problem-solving, un-ideological mood and ready to make big compromises to get a better health care bill or to repair the one that exists, or is it just a replay of the same arguments we've heard for the past year?",
        "Governor Hickenlooper, do you sense anything different today about Washington?",
        "There are a couple of big differences, one being that Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, who is chairing this committee that we both addressed, really has stressed narrowing the focus.",
        "And let's say - let's see what we can get done in the short term that is going to help stabilize these private markets that are so much at risk.",
        "And we had three Republican governors and two Democratic governors with widely divergent views on the world and from very different states, and yet we pretty much all agreed with some variation but on the importance of maintaining these CSRs, these cost-sharing reductions.",
        "And the same thing with one of these reinsurance pools - we need to have some way of supporting states to allow them to have - instead of everyone getting - or at least all the expensive, high-cost cases getting consolidated in one pool - a way to spread that cost out to a larger number of people.",
        "Governor Hickenlooper sounds hopeful.",
        "Governor Herbert, are you hopeful that Washington's in a mood to fix things?",
        "(Laughter) Well, I'm hopeful more on some days than others.",
        "Certainly today I'm hopeful.",
        "Again, I think that we started off in a - kind of a bad way with the Affordable Care Act, which passed on just partisan lines.",
        "That was a mistake.",
        "We should have worked harder to have a bipartisan product.",
        "But let's not make the same mistake on the other end now.",
        "I hope there's an attempt to have a bipartisan solution which will be lasting, that people can feel good on both sides of the aisle.",
        "Well, thanks to both of you for talking with us today.",
        "Republican Governor Gary Herbert of Utah and Democratic Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper, thank you both very much.",

        "People that might be confronted with a pile of papers now at this point - should they get an extension, and do they quite know what getting an extension entails?",
        "You just don't throw up your hands and say I need more time.",
        "What people should do is file their return honestly and accurately, making sure they have the documentation to support what they're putting down on their return.",
        "If they have a question and they don't have something that they should have, they should do exactly what you suggest, which is to file an extension.",
        "That gives them a period of time - six months, actually - to put it all together.",
        "But what they have to do is they need to protect themselves.",
        "If they think they owe money, make an estimated payment at the same time they file the extension.",
        "Now, most people get refunds, actually, so they wouldn't have to worry at all about it, if they think they're going to be due a refund."

        "What are some of your thoughts about tax preparation firms, recognizing that there are hundreds of them?",
        "Well, we depend on the integrity of tax practitioners across the country.",
        "And the vast majority of them are honest and professional, though there are some that are trying to, oh, inflate deductions or refunds, and they are trying to increase their fees by even helping prepare fraudulent returns.",
        "But the system is so complex now that most people, over 60 percent, actually go to paid preparers.",
        "And there's a big percentage on top of that that use the software at home.",

        "That's a standard amount.",
        "You're exactly right, this was a tax that was collected for years and then the courts said that because of the changes in the billing practices of the phone companies, it was no longer a proper tax.",

        "What about your senses?",
        "Do you find that when you drop things, you still look down, or do you acclimate to no gravity?",
        "Well, we get used to it, but it's still sometimes troublesome, if you lose something, how to find it back also because you tend to focus on the walls and the floors, and it may just be floating just in front of it, and you might just miss it.",
        "It's amazing how you can look around for something which is right in front of you.",
        "So that's still going on, and I think our brain has a hard time to deal with the three dimensions, but we are - we are careful to prevent it.",
        "So everything we have, we fix it with Velcro, with tape, with Bungee cords.",

        "You know, one of our favorite topics on SCIENCE FRIDAY are the microbes that live in and on us.",

        "They may clump in a manner that's different than the same culture growing on Earth.",

        "And fortunately, that's the way Dragon turned out.",

        "We heard a lot about Dragon, but where there other events that happened in Space Station, another top event that you think should have gotten more due that we haven't heard about as much?",
        "Well, we're doing a lot of fascinating science, and sometimes that doesn't get as much headline news as the single events.",
        "And I think one of the reasons why is that science in the process of being made isn't necessarily exciting.",
        "In fact, some people might call it boring.",
        "If you're sitting in front of a piece of scientific equipment, maybe a glove box, and, you know, your hands are poking in there, and maybe you scratch your nose every so often with your shoulder because you can't - because your hands are in the glove box.",
        "And, you know, someone watching you do that is just going to be bored, but the science that's going on in the glove box may be really, really exciting.",
        "And so when the documentary is made in 10 years, the professional journalists and actors will be able to make it exciting.",
