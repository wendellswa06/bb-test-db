        "Oh Don, I think you do a pretty good job, to my mind.",
        "So I wondered, are there - were there challenges to living in Space Station that you hadn't foreseen, or did this experience test you in ways that you didn't expect, maybe?",
        "Yeah, I think there's a lot of challenges up here, and I think you really notice it at the end of the day, when you're really, really tired.",
        "Like Andre was saying before, you always have to be aware of things that might float away.",
        "If you're working a procedure, you don't want to miss a step that could be critical that could break some equipment.",
        "And so everything you do from when you wake up in the morning, and you have breakfast, to using the bathroom, to the procedures you use all day, it is really, really tiring, and I think that's one of the biggest things that I noticed since I've been up here.",
        "I think we have just a little under a minute left, so maybe as a quick, quick ender, are there qualities that you would identify for a long-term mission now that you've spent so much time up in space?",
        "Yes, what I would do is, any perspective crew member, I would go and look in their garage, and if their garage is a mess, a hodgepodge, then that would be an automatic disqualifier.",
        "If their garage is nice and neat, then you know that they are going to be able to take care of all the equipment on Space Station and put everything away in its proper place.",
        "Thank you so much, Expedition 31 flight engineers Joe Acaba, Andre Kuipers and Don Pettit.",
        "Thank you for talking to us on SCIENCE FRIDAY from the International Space Station today.",
        "It's been a pleasure.",

        "We're now resuming operational audio communications.",
        "And Don, I just cleaned my garage last week.",
        "That last voice, by the way, was - the guy who had just cleaned his garage, was the voice of astronaut Jack Fischer, and he was acting as CAPCOM in Mission Control Houston that day."

        "We're going to take a break, and when we come back, we're going to have a memorial to a famous resident of the Galapagos, but let's talk a little bit more about that conversation.",
        "They seem to be eager to get home, and I would think after six months in space, I'd want to get home also, you know?",
        "That was my first question because I was like I bet after six months, you're not itching to do six more, and it did sound like they were ready.",
        "I think - you know, it's close quarters with all those roommates.",
        "That alone would make me crazy after that long.",
        "Yeah, you know, you've got to be the right - they go through all these tests, right profile, psychological profile and everything.",

        "Well, we were exploring the idea of, trying to do some documentary on the spiritual life of the enslaved Africans.",
        "There's not very much information about what that was all about because in addition to the trauma of losing their life, their liberty, their homes, they also lost their religions.",

        "Alex, how did his faith help navigate him to the life in America?",
        "Well, we kind of like speculate in part because he kept his faith pretty much to himself, in part because in the latter part of his period of enslavement, he was making progress in getting himself and his nine children who have been born - enslaved in America, getting them free.",
        "And he was getting a lot of help from a number of Christian missionaries who saw him as a way of evangelizing Africa; that they would send this Christian prince as they what saw him back to Africa, and he would bring the Evans(ph) as it were to the true faith.",
        "So when he was asked many times about his religion, he sort of kept that quiet because he knew that to publicly proclaim too much that he was Muslim would maybe and hinder his chances of getting his family and himself free.",
