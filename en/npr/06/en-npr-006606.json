        "You'll be hearing from us, don't worry - right on time.",
        "Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mark Everson.",
        "Any grade school student learns that the United States has three equal branches of government.",
        "But at various times in history, one branch has been more equal than the others.",
        "Sometimes Congress has been more assertive, sometimes the courts, and sometimes presidents.",
        "An intense debate is now going on about presidential power to run the war in Iraq.",
        "In his new book, \"\"This Mighty Scourge,\"\" James McPherson writes that Abraham Lincoln might be considered the president most responsible for increasing presidential power in wartime.",
        "Mr. McPherson, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his one-volume history of the Civil War, \"\"Battle Cry of Freedom,\"\" joins us now from Princeton University.",
        "Professor, thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Well, thank you for having me.",
        "In fact President Lincoln, you suggest, may have invented that phrase war powers.",
        "In his first message to Congress, a special session of Congress that he called a few months after the war broke out on July 4th, 1861, Lincoln told the Congress that because of the outbreak of the war he found it necessary to call out the war power of the government to suppress this insurrection.",
        "And so far as I and other scholars have been able to determine, that is the first use of that phrase by a president.",
        "He declared a blockade around Fort Sumter in South Carolina, which was an act of war without congressional approval.",
        "He increased the size of the army.",
        "What argument did he offer to do that?",
        "He argued that this was an emergency, that Congress was not in session and could not be called into session, and that to fulfill his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, he needed to preserve, protect and defend the nation from the war that had started by the confederates firing on Fort Sumter.",
        "And when Congress did meet in July, 1861, he informed them of what he had done and asked Congress in effect to ratify retroactively what he had done, and they proceeded to do so.",
        "Let me ask you about Clement Vallandigham, Senator Vallandigham.",
        "He attacked the war.",
        "He called for a ceasefire and negotiations with the South.",
        "And the Union Army had suffered reverses in the spring of 1863, so the war was unpopular.",
        "And a military court convicted the Senator of uttering disloyal sentiments.",
        "I want to be careful with historical analogies, but it would almost be as if let's say Senator Feingold of Wisconsin were taken in today, arresting someone who was a lawful political opponent of an ongoing war, detaining them, putting them into exile.",
        "I mean, my gosh, this strikes me as just an extraordinary abrogation of civil liberties.",
        "That's exactly what Lincoln's opponents said.",
        "Lincoln chose to reply to them, and his argument was twofold.",
        "First, that it wasn't merely because of a speech that Vallandigham had made that he was arrested, but that the effect of Vallandigham and others like him was to provoke resistance to the draft, which had just gone into effect in the North, and desertion from the Army.",
        "And in fact there was widespread desertion.",
        "It was not merely a question of free speech, Lincoln said, but of resistance to the ability of the North to wage the war upon which the life of the nation depended.",
        "Do you find any kind of contemporary resonance in the debate going on now and Lincoln's actions during the Civil War?"

        "Superficially, I think you can make an analogy between President Bush's suspension of habeas corpus for those interned at Guantanamo and others, and his establishment of military courts to try these people, and Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and his executive order in September of 1862 declaring martial law throughout the entire country and making it possible for civilians to be tried by military courts.",
        "The constitutional grounds on which Lincoln did this was the statement in the Constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless in cases of invasion or rebellion, the public safety may require it.",
        "We unquestionably had a case of rebellion in 1861 to 1865.",
        "And all of those people who were in fact jailed, some of them only temporarily, were supporting or at least sympathetic with that rebellion.",
        "But in the case of the detainees at Guantanamo and others who have been arrested, all of this has been done abroad and there's no - it's not a question of rebellion in the United States, certainly.",
        "I suppose the administration might be able to make the case that terrorists are engaged in an invasion or planned invasion of the United States.",
        "But it's a pretty farfetched, I think, analogy.",
        "So I think that's where any invocation of Lincolnian precedent for what is happening now tends to break down.",
        "James McPherson, professor of history emeritus, Princeton University, and author of a new collection of essays, \"\"This Mighty Scourge: Perspectives on the Civil War.\"\" Professor McPherson, thanks so much.",
        "Well, thank you.",

        "Well, in some ways, he reached out to us.",
        "He learned about the project through our - one of our directors, Bill Duke who did the directing of the reenactments with the program.",
        "That's how we came into acquaintance with him.",
        "So you do have Bill Duke, well-known director, bringing his talents to these lush reenactment sequences.",
        "And then you have someone else, Andrea Kalin.",
        "Looking at the documentary side of things, was it hard to marry those two talents and those two approaches together?",
        "Bill and Andrea worked together on a few other projects.",
        "And these two perspectives coming together, I think, made a very dynamic documentary."

        "Let's go back into Abdul-Rahman's story.",
        "So he has been brought to America.",
        "He has connected with missionaries, but he also attracted the attention of people at the highest echelons of American society.",
        "He became essentially, extraordinarily valuable person to the man who had purchased him.",
        "One of the things this story really points out is that we, sometimes, talk about the, you know, the unacknowledged debt that America owes enslaved Africans and enslaved African-Americans for helping to build America - and that's true.",
        "But I think sometimes, we put more attention on the physical contributions, you know, the muscle contributions - the sweat contributions.",
        "And what this story helps shed light on this, there was an extraordinary amount of intellectual capital that was brought to America from Africa - that was - it was crucial - and the economic development of the United States.",
        "And his story in a microcosm shows it because the person who purchased him was as very poor farmer, and it was (unintelligible) knowledge of how to cultivate cot on a large scale that actually allow this man to escape his own poverty and become one of the wealthiest people in Mississippi at the time.",
        "So he wasn't - he was extraordinarily valuable to this man who would never part with him for any reason.",
        "As time went forward, there's sort of extraordinary event occurred where a - he met up with a - by accident, with a former Irish ship sergeant who had been shipwrecked in Africa and had been saved by Abdul-Rahman's father.",
        "So the one white man in America owed him an enormous debt suddenly was in town.",
        "And through a long intervention, his story began to be known at a very national level.",
        "And the president of United States, eventually, himself hoping to carry favor with the emperor of Morocco.",
        "Because he spoke Arabic, Abdul-Rahman was mistaken to be Arab and Moroccan rather an African.",
        "And so was the idea that, oh, if we get this guy free and back to Morocco, maybe the emperor will do us a few favors as well.",
        "So he was allowed free passage back to Africa but his wife and children remain enslaved.",
        "And that became - that become sort of the dramatic third act because he travelled around America telling his story, and as one observer eventually said, became the most famous African in America at that time.",
        "What do you want to be the footprint of this documentary?",
        "How do you want it to echo in the world?",
        "I think most importantly, this is a man who lost everything.",
        "And all of us, at any time, could lose everything.",
        "And he, in some way, charts the notion of what it is to be able to hold on to your dignity, to hold on to your hope for the future in spite of great losses and to be able to remain intact because after 40 years on enslavement, he's still was completely intact, incompletely himself and able to act on his own behalf in very complicated situations to achieve many of his goals.",
        "So it's a story of inspiration, I think, for everyone.",
