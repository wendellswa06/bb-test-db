        "What's going on?",
        "Yes, actually, I just got back last night, and I have to say it's actually quite deceptive, because the rains have been falling over the last month, the rains have been coming on and off, and it's relatively green in this region.",
        "And most of the people affected are the nomadic communities and the communities who live off of the road, so it's not easy.",
        "From the images I've seen on the television here, you'd think you'd go into a village and you'd see everybody.",
        "The point is it's very difficult to get to some of these communities that have been cut off.",
        "What have you personally seen?",
        "What is it like for these people to suffer through this famine?",

        "The problem is now she's not back in her field to attend her crops, and she has other children, so it's a spiral effect on this family.",
        "Is there food there?",
        "What are people doing?",
        "You've heard the reports of people eating leaves and grass and that there isn't anything to eat in some of these communities.",

        "Some people have gone into debt, sold their cows if they can and just trying to make due on things they can dig out of the ground.",

        "That doesn't give them much resistance when it gets even worse, though, does it?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So can you imagine the effects on a child since eight, nine months now, eating one meal a day, and even that isn't a big meal, and now you've got rains, and in some areas, that means you're going to have all these water-bound viruses, especially malaria, so you're malnourished, and then you also don't have the resistance now to things like malaria.",
        "So it's again, another spiral.",
        "Some reports have suggested that the government in Niger downplayed the threat of famine because of national elections late last year.",
        "Is that fair?",
        "I don't want to comment on this, but you do have to remember that Niger is one of the most poor countries in the world.",
        "The only other country that is as poor i--listed is Liberia, so you can imagine the capacity of a government that has 11 million people, 12 million people to take care of, their capacity to respond to such a huge crisis is limited.",
        "I assume you don't necessarily want to comment on that because you have to try to work in that country.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Let me ask you, though, about some of Niger's neighbors: Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania.",
        "They're also at risk?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The difference--I would say that maybe the governments and maybe the World Food Program, the UN, maybe had a head start on working in Mauritania and Mali, but one of the other reasons why we're talking about Niger as much because there are 12 million people.",
        "Mauritania, for instance, there's only two million people.",
        "So in absolute terms, there are many more people in Niger, so this is going to affect many more people.",
        "It's--about a third of the population is in crisis in--almost a quarter actually--in Niger.",
        "When you compare it to Mauritania, two million people.",

        "Does politics in places like Niger play a role in malnutrition, in famine?",
        "Well, I think most famines result not just from natural conditions, such as drought and locusts, but from economic, social and political factors, absolutely.",
        "And in situations of armed conflict, famine may be used as a weapon of war even.",
        "I mean, that's certainly the situation in Darfur on the other side of Africa.",
