        "I think there's some contrasting views on what Eddie's saying.",
        "On the one hand, as the UN humanitarian coordinator, Jan Egeland, said, the appeal for Niger is about 20 minutes worth of global military spending.",
        "The United Nations is looking for $30 million there.",
        "So there's evidence that way.",
        "On the other hand, the response to the tsunami last December, I mean, there was certainly an outpouring of humanitarian feeling from people all over the world.",

        "No problem, Neal.",
        "I understand you just got back from Zimbabwe, which is having food problems of its own; though that seems to have different root causes from the situation that we're talking about in West Africa.",
        "No, it's true.",
        "Across Africa, the different food problems that you see in different parts are all driven by different things.",
        "And they're all fairly unique in terms of the different regions.",
        "You know, up in Niger, it's been driven by drought, it's been driven by locusts.",
        "In Zimbabwe, you get a strange combination of poor governance and governmental systems, which have really caused many of the food problems; seizure of commercial farmlands, very chaotic redistribution of land, in an attempt to essentially set up sort of subsistence farmers again on what used to be very profitable, larger, white-owned farms and redistributing that land to blacks.",
        "But also in Zimbabwe, you have the issue of AIDS, and in Southern Africa in particular, AIDS is very much a driving force in hunger throughout the region; that people are getting sick.",
        "The really productive people are not--many of them are not healthy, you know, in places, up to 35 percent and that is cutting down on the productive capacity of subsistence farmers in many parts of Africa.",
        "And when you've got people living already very much on the edge, when you've got 35 percent of the population--in fact, that doesn't mean that 35 percent can't go out and work the fields, but, you know, even if 5 or 10 percent no longer can go out and work the fields, that means that their children aren't getting fed.",
        "The burden falls to relatives.",

        "Well, most people usually tell me that they want the West to come in and just send in food, send in money.",
        "That's usually what I hear from--when I'm talking to peasants out in the countryside, you know, oftentimes, you don't have an extremely high education level, but also, there's this feeling that, you know, in the West, you guys have everything.",

        "And that's what they usually hope for.",
        "Governments tend to be--sometimes they also want the same thing.",
        "They would love for people to come in and bring in lots and lots of resources, but usually, it's a more nuanced approach, and they view it in terms of help from the West, in terms of development aid, setting up more infrastructure projects, things like that.",
        "Here's an e-mail question, this from Kendall in Miami.",

        "Marc.",
        "Well, I don't think that's so much part of the problem at the moment.",
        "I mean, when you've had a crop failure, it's not a question of new species invading, but, you know, the food crops of the world today are often growing far away from their point of origin.",
        "I mean, people in Africa eat cassava, which had its origin in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "People eat rice all over the world.",
        "So I think it isn't necessarily a question of relying only on indigenous species.",
        "It's on crops that can do well, crops that are hardy and can resist droughts, crops that are easier to protect from an onslaught of locusts.",
        "So I think actually, agricultural research on finding crops that will do well in difficult environments is an important part of the long-term solution.",
        "Marc, can I ask you something about that, though?",
        "I mean, to what degree are you getting these types of crops in Africa?",
        "I don't feel like I'm seeing a whole lot of that as I travel around.",
        "I mean, in some places, Kenya is doing some things, but I don't feel like I'm seeing much of that happening in Africa.",
        "What's your take on...",
        "No.",
        "I think there is some--I mean--and particularly if we're talking about genetically modified crops.",
        "There are only a few countries in Africa currently growing those.",
        "But even the spread of hybrid forms of, for example, corn, that requires farmers to purchase seeds every year, for the most part.",
        "So for very poor farmers, that's difficult.",
        "There has been some success with hybrid corn in Kenya and some other countries, but I think we're a bit away from widespread planting of those in Africa.",
        "We need to overcome some of these problems, like poor roads and whatnot, first.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "Thank you.",
        "I just--I had a comment regarding--well, first of all, I just want to say I do agree that the situation that we're discussing here is very unique in each community, because Africa is a huge continent, and oftentimes, there are people that tend to discuss Africa as a community itself, which I think that it's very important to consider that these situations are each unique, and that when many Americans desire to contribute through, as you were saying, Live 8 or charities or donating to NGOs or look to NGOs or agencies to solve the problem of these communities that are living in extreme poverty, I think there's a couple of points to consider, and first of all, just that that concept of solving a problem or saving a community from its own demise is troubling.",
        "For example, just, again, agreeing with someone who spoke earlier and saying that it's not necessarily the communities themselves that are the problem, but it is the situation that they have been placed in in terms of their position in the greater capitalist world economy."

        "But secondly, and my last point is just also for us all to consider our own role as communities in America in our consumption habits; that I believe that is a really crucial part of this equation that frequently gets left out of these discussions and needs to be considered, because instead of taking the Malthusian approach to understanding these development problems and saying it's primarily overpopulation or, you know, it's only environmental, these are important things to discuss, but we're missing a massive part of this problem when we don't discuss surplus and consumption habits of other countries, for example, America or the UK or Germany, etc.",
        "The developed world you're talking about, Karen, but surely...",
        "Well...",
        "...the answer for people in Africa is to increase their production and develop their economies to make them more productive, rather than for farmers in the Midwest or Australia to divert some of their crops to Africa.",
        "Well, I'm not saying that crops should necessarily be diverted.",
        "When I talk about our consumption habits, I mean in terms of people needing 50 pairs of jeans instead of five or people--because these are all part of this equation.",
        "Although it doesn't seem obvious at first, the fact that when we look at the textile industry, when we look at these industries, even the labor industry globally and how this is connected to our consumption habits and the situation that a number of these communities end up in in the world economy, there's a definite link.",
        "And, yes, communities do need to be productive, but I do believe they should be productive on their own terms, and they should decide for themselves what that productivity will be instead of an agency like World Bank or USAID or whoever coming in with structural adjustment programming or contingency moneys that say, `Here.",
