        "Marc, do you have a comment on that?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, I think the point that both you and Karen made is that the solutions lie in Africa.",
        "One of the reasons we have a difficult situation in Niger now is that by waiting beyond the November appeal, people have eaten their seeds, they've sold their livestock.",
        "So reviving agriculture, making the jump from relief to development, is going to be that much more difficult.",
        "People no longer have assets, and so it's going to be difficult to revive the livelihoods within the affected communities.",
        "And I think a timely response to an event like this is critical for that reason.",
        "We're talking about famine and what to do about it.",
        "Our number, if you'd like to join us, is (800) 989-8255.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Jason Beaubien, let me bring you back into the conversation.",
        "We're discussing situations where people didn't respond in time and situations are going out of control.",
        "Are there examples that you know of where crisis was predicted and averted?",
        "I think certainly I--all across the continent at the moment, the World Food program is distributing food in many areas where, if they weren't, you would be seeing huge problems.",
        "In Swaziland, here in southern Africa, you know, again, has an extremely high HIV rate.",
        "It's also been hit by a drought.",
        "They're in there distributing food, distributing food to AIDS orphans.",
        "And so these don't ever rise to the point where you have emaciated children on television because these aid agencies are there, they're active in the community and they're getting food into many of these places.",
        "And all across the continent you see that, at refugee camps, in various places.",
        "Aid is working to avert having starvation, to having incredible famine, but at the same time, you do have, you know, a huge aid machine that has been functioning in Africa for, you know, three decades, four decades, and I think that the overall question of this debate during this hour is a good one about--What is the appropriate response?",
        "And certainly the answers--and I don't feel like I have the answer, necessarily, but certainly the responses in the past haven't set up infrastructure and sort of inoculated this continent against famine.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Marc Cohen, let me ask you.",
        "We used to read of and hear of famines in Asia.",
        "Development has largely mitigated a lot of those problems.",
        "Are there lessons to be learned from there that can be applied to Africa?",
        "Yes, I think--if we talk about India, which used to be viewed as a basket case and a place where famines happened regularly, one of the lessons there is the response to drought and other problems in many of the states in India is to put people to work on public works projects, to rehabilitate roads, to take care of things, but the point is to put money in people's pockets so that they can buy food on the market.",
        "Usually, famine is not a result of crop failure; it's a result of people being unable to buy food.",
        "There may be food in the country, there may be food that can be imported, but if people can't access that through some kind of income, and by being put to work when they lose their jobs, that's when difficulties happen.",
        "And this is not an original point with me; the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has written a lot about this.",
        "And I think the idea of making sure that people continue to participate in the economy, where that's feasible, is a very important way to prevent famines from getting out of hand, to keep them from happening."

        "And one final e-mail before we have to go.",
        "This from Joel in San Francisco: `Microcredit lending could help alleviate famine.",
        "When the world's poorest people, especially women, have access to credit at low interest rates, they have working capital to start and expand small businesses, providing an income stream which can help themselves and their families to afford food and other necessities in good times and in bad.'",
        "Jason, we have only a few seconds left, but I wonder have you seen evidence of any of that working?",
        "I have.",
        "I have seen some microcredit programs that have done wonders, completely transformed both the status of the women in the community, made it much higher, which is a very important thing at times in Africa, and also giving them access to the money that they need to get more money into their households and thus be able to feed their children.",
        "So, yes, I've seen some great examples of that across Africa.",
        "Jason, thanks very much.",

        "And now he is accusing the same former ally of backing his current enemies.",
        "So it is a real change of circumstances.",
        "But let me say that Sudan denied aiding the rebels.",
        "Although we've had this week in Chad, Donald Yamamoto, Jendayi Frazer's deputy at the State Department, the number two in charge of Africa, saying there appears to be evidence that Sudan is giving logistical help and safe haven to the rebels.",
        "So you have Sudan denying it and the rest of the world saying you appear to be helping.",
        "But you also have the Khartoum government in Sudan, accusing President Deby of backing the Darfur rebels who say they are intent on toppling President al-Bashir.",
        "So it is a right royal mess.",
        "And of course, the people who are suffering most are civilians--both sides of the border--because they are the ones who are displaced, who were driven from their homes, and who have been killed in the hundreds of thousands in Darfur.",
        "And now Chadians even, being displaced at the border, because they say they're being attacked by Sudanese Janjawid militia.",
        "So, if I understand you correctly, people have fled from the Sudan into Chad, and they thought they were going to be safe.",
        "And instead what's happened, is that the Janjawid militia has crossed the border and tried to attack, not only these Sudanese refugees, but the people who actually are Chadian citizens.",
        "The people who are currently most at risk are the Chadians.",
        "The Sudanese are 100-plus miles from the Chad/Sudan border.",
        "They're already in refugee camps.",
        "So if we can put it that way, they are relatively stable, although the conditions are not ideal.",
        "Although there were reports of rebels actually attacking one camp two weeks ago.",
        "But it's the Chadians now--55,000 of them, in villages spread all along a very lone, sandy, dusty border between Chad and Sudan--who have been displaced from their villages, they say, by Janjawid militia, i.e. Sudanese-backed militia, and also by Chadian thugs, as opposed to the Chadian rebels.",
        "So it is becoming a huge mess.",
        "And President Deby here, is saying the international community has turned a deaf ear.",
        "They have been protesting from the Chadian side, protestations which have gone unheard, and now look what has happened.",
        "You have obviously covered Africa for some time.",
        "You're very experienced in the continent.",
        "Your ancestry is Ghanaian.",
        "What do you expect, based on your experience, to happen, in terms of the international community addressing this issue?",
        "So far people are saying, we're going to do something, but they're not doing anything.",
        "At what point can we expect action?",
        "And what type?",
        "Well, that's exactly what refugees, displaced people, and others are saying.",
        "When are they going to come to our help?",
        "Washington called what's happening in Darfur genocide, but more then a year ago.",
        "But nobody has moved in, but there are problems.",
        "You've got to have some sort of give and take.",
        "The Sudanese government is saying it doesn't want a UN force in Darfur.",
        "It wants it to remain and African Union force.",
        "The African Union force is clearly under funded and doesn't even have the mandate or the arms to be able to protect refugees, displaced people, or humanitarian workers.",
        "So I think, really, the United Nations, along with the U.S., the West, and especially the African Union, has got to rap knuckles and say to all sides, this has to stop.",
        "And all this, it's innocent civilians, children, women, old people--these are the people suffering.",
        "There may be a quarrel between the president in one country and his presidential neighbor in another, but that is second to the suffering of the people, and that must be the priority.",
        "But it really does need international help.",
