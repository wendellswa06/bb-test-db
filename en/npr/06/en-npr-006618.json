        "Well, what that argument is about is that those provisions either have no budgetary effect or the budgetary effect pales in comparison to the policy implications of that provision.",
        "That's what the Byrd Rule was designed to prevent because, again, the whole reason that this bill can't be filibustered is it was designed to bring about needed budgetary changes.",
        "It was not designed to circumvent the Senate's way of doing business, requiring, in essence, 60 votes to pass major substantive legislation.",
        "So how might the argument over the defunding of Planned Parenthood - how would that come to a vote in the Senate?",
        "Well, presumably, that amendment or that provision is in the pending version of the amendment that's been offered.",
        "There are two hours of debate on that amendment.",
        "And at the end of those two hours, points of order will be in order.",
        "And presumably, some opponent of that provision - let's say the Planned Parenthood provision - would stand up and make a point of order against such and such language on the grounds that it violates the Byrd Rule.",

        "That's exactly what Lincoln's opponents said.",
        "Lincoln chose to reply to them, and his argument was twofold.",
        "First, that it wasn't merely because of a speech that Vallandigham had made that he was arrested, but that the effect of Vallandigham and others like him was to provoke resistance to the draft, which had just gone into effect in the North, and desertion from the Army.",
        "And in fact there was widespread desertion.",
        "It was not merely a question of free speech, Lincoln said, but of resistance to the ability of the North to wage the war upon which the life of the nation depended.",

        "Superficially, I think you can make an analogy between President Bush's suspension of habeas corpus for those interned at Guantanamo and others, and his establishment of military courts to try these people, and Lincoln's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and his executive order in September of 1862 declaring martial law throughout the entire country and making it possible for civilians to be tried by military courts.",
        "The constitutional grounds on which Lincoln did this was the statement in the Constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless in cases of invasion or rebellion, the public safety may require it.",
        "We unquestionably had a case of rebellion in 1861 to 1865.",
