        "And I think you have to place that in a historical context.",

        "Of course.",
        "I think that E.D.",
        "Nixon and Martin Luther King and many of the other people involved in the boycott, they were so pleased when it was Rosa Parks because they knew that she was a woman of great character and she had the strength to put up with the death threats and the other kinds of intimidation that came after she was arrested.",
        "So I think they knew that she was the perfect client to take this case and to become the test case against segregation in the South.",
        "And she was the perfect symbol because, you know, I don't think over the years anyone found anything to besmirch her character, so she was the ideal symbol for a great movement.",
