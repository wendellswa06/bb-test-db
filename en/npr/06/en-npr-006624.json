        "Then, if a veteran had an illness on the list and could prove he was exposed, he would automatically get benefits.",
        "But most veterans can't prove they were exposed, and even those who do have evidence have gotten stuck in a cycle of denials and appeals that goes on for years, sometimes decades, as the VA asks for more information and proof that these vets and their families just don't have.",

        "They say, well, you know, you can appeal this, but now we need more information.",
