        "It's been happening throughout the entire war, and it's very difficult to really figure out who is telling the truth because of the fact that it's hard to get independent observers out there basically because the entire area is an insurgent-controlled area and there's a lot of hostilities to foreigners out there.",

        "Civilians started gathering around the vehicle here in central Baghdad and started chanting pro-insurgent or anti-US slogans and some of them started might have started to look at the Bradley and they think about picking it apart.",
        "And then the Americans hit an air strike in the area, saying that they believed everyone there was an insurgent.",
        "But it turned out clearly that was wrong because one of the people killed in that air strike was actually an Arab newscaster who was working for a very well-known Arab satellite network.",
        "Ed, what are you hearing on the Baghdad media, in the streets if you can get there, about reaction to the vote on Saturday on the constitution, which most reports I hear and read now say it looks as though it passed?",
        "Right.",
        "The reaction is, of course, widely varying depending on who you talk to because a lot of the Sunnis voted no, but at the same time, they also say they're going to take part in the December elections.",
        "That means that at least one area of dialogue is open between the Sunni Arabs and the rest of the country."
