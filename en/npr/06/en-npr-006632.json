        "What did the test find?",
        "Well, it's the initial test of the A sample that shows a testosterone, epitestosterone level in excess of six.",
        "And off the record sources have told me that the number is 11, which is significantly higher.",
        "The odd thing about that, though, is that it's not an elevated testosterone level.",
        "Apparently, it's a lower than normal epitestosterone level.",
        "So it could be almost anything.",
        "Could be almost anything.",

        "Indeed.",
        "It's a standard insurance.",
        "When a rider provides a sample after winning a stage or being the top three of the stage or being one of the randomly chosen riders, they take that sample, divide it in two, test the first part - and if comes back positive, they confirm that test with a second test.",
        "Now you talked about this epitestosterone finding.",
        "Could that be from some sort of natural cause?",
        "And we know that Landis - one of the heroic qualities of his victory - he has a seriously necrotic hip and needs surgery after the race.",
        "Could he be taking pain medication?",
        "Might that be the result?",
        "Well, he's getting a cortisone injection, and that was one theory.",
        "There's an interesting theory.",
        "One of the heroic elements of stage 17 is, in fact, goes back to Stage 16 when he was in the yellow jersey but collapsed in terms of performance on the final climb on Stage 16.",
        "He lost nearly 10 minutes on that climb alone, and then came back the next day to ride.",
        "That evening, after Stage 16, he and his team director, John Lelangue, went out and had a beer.",
        "And this morning, I've been doing quite a bit of reading on that and alcohol's influence on testosterone and epitestosterone levels.",
        "And it's a real gray area.",
        "I mean, this is not one those binary tests where it's either positive or negative.",
        "The whole testosterone/epitestosterone test is a ratio of a hormone and its metabolite.",
        "So if you're above a certain number, though, is it presumed that you cheated?",
        "There is an assumption.",
        "I mean, the number, the ratio of six is a fairly high number anyway.",
        "And there's an assumption that there's an artificial source of testosterone.",
        "Is that necessarily proof?",
        "At this point, no, because the B sample hasn't been tested.",
        "And then there have been very many successful challenges to that very ratio test, and we just have to walk the thing through the system.",
        "You know, after the test, if it comes back positive, is the opportunity to appeal, and that could take several months and then it will get appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.",
        "So it could be eight or nine months before we actually know the real outcome of this case.",
        "In the past couple of days, Landis withdrew from some appearances, including some races.",
        "Some speculation started when he did that there might have been a problem with doping results from the Tour de France, but couldn't he also have been tired?",
        "Could his hip have hurt?"
