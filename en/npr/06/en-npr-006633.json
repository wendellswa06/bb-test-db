        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And that was the initial justification given for his absence.",
        "But, you know, these post-Tour criterions, which are more a public relations parade than anything else - he attended one on Wednesday, or on Tuesday, and then left two of them, one on Wednesday and one today.",

        "Now, there's also a federal criminal investigation taking place now.",
        "How far along is that?",
        "So the idea is that some of these back-office people at the Madoff firm could provide evidence against the bigger players.",

        "And I was playing violin, just like my parents would want me to and following that directive, and then heard Hendrix and, you know, pretty much changed my whole sense of what I felt about music.",

        "Started playing guitar, actually, at first, and then quickly realized there were lots of guitar players.",

        "Yeah, and that happened as I got older.",
        "When I was a youngster growing up, I heard just the sheer audacity of it and it spoke to my teenage heart.",
        "And as I got older, of course, I got attracted to other styles of music, especially jazz and classical music, composition, and started integrating everything.",
        "And then looking back to Hendrix, I was listening to \"\"Electric Lady Land\"\" a couple of years ago, and I was so struck by hearing how what he was doing with the guitar was he was composing the way somebody would write for string quartet, in the sense that he wasn't really playing a whole bunch of chords the way a guitar player would normally play just laying down chords - of course he does that.",
        "But with \"\"Electric Lady Land,\"\" he was really layering melodies that he was playing on the guitar.",
        "And the way he played the guitar, he was able to get that kind of sinuous vibrato that creates this texture and bed of melodic fragments laid on top of each other - perfect for a string quartet like Turtle Island."

        "I mean, the reasons those top names were eliminated from the Tour de France in the first place wasn't because they had turned in positive test results, it was because cycling adheres to a strict ethics code, and I know that sounds unusual given all the doping."

        "But I mean, in a sense it's a necessary response to it.",
        "Cycling has a stricter ethics code than almost any other sport, and the absence of Ivan Basso and Jan Ullrich from this year's Tour were a direct result of the pro tour ethics code, which says that a rider, even under investigation, can't participate in an event until his name has been cleared.",
        "If you applied that same standard to baseball, for example, I don't think we would've seen any homeruns from Barry Bonds this year.",

        "Who would be declared the winner?",

        "He then went on a long break when Floyd Landis was in the yellow jersey and gained back half an hour simply because it was a strategic move on the part of the Phonak team to let him go because he wasn't going to be a major threat in the Alps.",
        "Landis had the collapse, Pereiro moved back into the yellow jersey, and then Landis fought back to third place that following day and then regained, for the final time, the yellow jersey on the penultimate stage, the time trial.",
        "And Pereiro, who was 30 minutes out of first place, may suddenly find himself holding the jersey.",
        "The Tour of Spain, the Vuelta Espana, last year had the same result.",
        "Roberto Heras tested positive for EPO and was negated, and that was handed off to Denis Menchov from the Rabobank team.",
        "And let me finally ask you, there have been fresh questions, as I'm sure you know, raised about the American racer Lance Armstrong, who won seven consecutive Tours de France, including last year.",
        "Are there going to be further questions about his right to those victories in the Tours?",
        "Well, certainly not as a result of this.",
        "I mean, there was a story and an investigation last year regarding test samples from the 1999 Tour.",
        "They apparently tested positive for EPO.",
        "But there were no B-samples to confirm those tests, and there have been subsequent investigations which have cleared his name.",
        "So at this point I don't think there are any pending investigations, but it, you know, as you can tell, this has been an ongoing problem in the sport for a long time.",
        "I mean, Lance Armstrong came into the Tour de France, that string of Tour de France victories, on the heels of another drug scandal.",
        "And cycling has made a serious effort to clean itself up, but obviously we have a lot more work to do.",
        "Charles Pelkey, thanks very much for your time."
