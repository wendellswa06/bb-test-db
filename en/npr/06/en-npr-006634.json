        "Good morning.",
        "Oh, and first off, why are we seeing so many people voting early?",
        "I know there are a lot of changes, but what exactly are they?",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, well, one reason, you know, is that more states just now allow early voting.",
        "My home state of Massachusetts has instituted early voting for the first time this year, and so a lot more states are just allowing this practice either in person or by mail-in ballot.",
        "And, Renee, if you look at the 1990s, you'll see that only about 10 percent of voters were casting their ballots before Election Day.",
        "Now, this election cycle, we're going to see probably well over a third of Americans vote before Election Day, and if you look at some battleground states, it's even higher than that.",
        "Take Colorado or Arizona - about two-thirds of voters are likely going to vote before November 8.",
        "And of those a third of voters - all voters - can you tell us who they are voting for?",
        "We can't.",
        "Election officials, you know, aren't opening up the ballots to see how people voted.",
        "But analysts can glean a lot of details about the types of people voting.",

        "He's this early voting elections guru based at the University of Florida.",
        "The earliest of early voters are people who are high-information voters.",
        "They fit the characteristics of people who are paying very close attention to politics.",
        "They vote very frequently.",

        "And, Renee, one important detail that you can see in this early voting data is a person's party ID.",
        "Well then, beyond Republican and Democratic, that is the parties themselves, what are the demographics?",
        "Who's voting early?",
        "So so far we've been able to see that Hispanic turnout across the board is higher than it was in 2012.",
        "And that's generally thought to benefit Hillary Clinton because she consistently polls better with Latinos.",

        "So many women experience this.",
        "You mentioned the diversity of the harassers, but I'm sure you've seen there's been some criticism online that this video is mainly showing African-American and Latino men as opposed to white men.",
        "I mean, that was two minutes of footage.",
        "And I guess a video doesn't go viral unless it's short, depending on people's attention span.",

        "So hopefully it can be prevented if somebody does attempt something.",
        "Nobody's attempted anything, but there have been threats.",
        "And luckily I'm not even hearing them or reading them verbatim.",
