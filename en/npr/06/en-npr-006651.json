        "Does it tell you your Social Security number, anything like that?",
        "What does it say?",
        "Well, all it is is a way to identify people.",
        "But if I know who you are - so let's say that you are visitor number 123 at my website, then any information that I've collected about you I can put in a database.",
        "So, you know, if I am a retailer website, and you've bought something from me, then I probably know your address and your credit card number and things like that, and that's all linked to the information I have in the database.",
        "So when the Web browser sends that cookie, then the company can just look you up, and whatever the information they have about you, they know ah, this is the right person.",
        "And one of the cases involved Google getting around the privacy settings in Safari that involved the cookies, right?",
        "Yes, so one special type of cookie is something called a third-party cookie.",
        "And so a normal first-party cookie is, you know, I go to a website, and that particular website exchanges a cookie with my Web browser.",
        "But a third-party cookie is when another website that I don't even realize I'm visiting puts a cookie in my Web browser.",
        "And so that might be a company that's placing an advertisement on a Web page, for example.",
        "And so in the Safari Web browser, the default setting is that the Web browser doesn't let third-party cookies in.",
        "It just says no, you know, the user wants to only get cookies from sites they know they're visiting.",
        "These other advertising sites or whatnot, they don't get their cookies in.",
        "And Google found a way around that to let the cookies in.",
        "Wow, is that something, that considered something terrible in the Internet world?",
        "There are a lot of people who are pretty upset about it.",
        "Yeah, and so what has Google said now?",
        "Will they change their policy?",
        "Google said yeah, we didn't really understand what we were doing, and yeah, we're changing that."

        "Well, you know, they're a big company, so...",
        "Yeah, how could they not know that this is what would be happening?",
        "The other case involved Internet Explorer.",
        "What was going on in that case?",
        "Well, so Internet Explorer also has a function where it protects people's privacy by preventing third-party cookies.",
        "But Internet Explorer is actually a little bit more complicated.",
        "In that case, instead of blocking all third-party cookies, Internet Explorer actually looks at each third-party cookie and makes a judgment about whether it's a good cookie or a bad cookie, and it only blocks the bad cookies, and bad as defined by Microsoft.",
        "And the way it decides if it's a good cookie or a bad cookie is that cookies sometimes have a special code called a P3P Compact Policy - sounds kind of complicated.",
        "And so Internet Explorer reads that code and uses it to decide if it's good or bad.",
        "And so what some companies discovered is that they can lie in that code so that their cookies won't be blocked, or, even better, then can make that code basically be a non-code.",
        "This is not a policy.",
        "And by saying this is not a policy, they were able to trick Internet Explorer into accepting their cookies.",
        "Is there anything we can do, as consumers, to further protect our privacy when we're surfing on the Web?",
        "Well, so you can change your browser privacy settings or use some third-party software that is going to provide additional protections if you want to be able to, you know, stay in control of this.",
        "So, you know, in the Internet Explorer Web browser, besides the default settings, they have something called tracking protection lists that you can use, or you can download some free software called Ghostery, G-H-O-S-T-E-R-Y, that you can add to your Web browser."

        "We have some specific laws for things like health care privacy, but we don't have any over-arching laws.",
        "In Europe, they do have some comprehensive privacy laws that put a lot more limits on what companies can do with your data.",
        "So here in the U.S., as you point out, we're focused on some very particular types of companies, and this week's announcement was aimed mainly at some of the online companies, especially online advertising companies and their sort of data collection.",
        "But there are these other companies that do collect large amounts of data on people that kind of aren't really the main companies that we're talking about here, and there may not actually be any laws in the United States that specifically address the types of data collection that they're doing."
