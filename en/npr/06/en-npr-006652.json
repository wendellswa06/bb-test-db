        "It does.",

        "We look at the usability of privacy tools.",
        "We also look at security and usability.",
        "So right now, we have a big research experiment going on about how to make passwords easier to use.",

        "How - yeah.",
        "How do you make passwords?",

        "What's - give us a secret there.",

        "Well, one of the things we found is that you can have a really strong password if it has a lot of characters in it, a really long password.",
        "And it's a lot easier for us to remember long passwords than it is to remember passwords that have lots of funny symbols and numbers in them.",
        "And so - and you might try to think of a phrase that you can remember and use that as part of your password.",
        "And how long should that phrase be?"

        "Right.",
        "...but, you know, if you have something that's, you know, like 14 characters long, that's going to be pretty good.",

        "...you don't want to use a regular word there.",
        "You don't want to use just one word.",

        "Well, you shouldn't do a really common phrase, though.",
        "You know, it should be a phrase that is meaningful to you but maybe isn't sort of the thing other people would guess.",

        "Right.",

        "Are those good?",

        "Right.",

        "Should people have any expectation - the caller talked about this.",
        "Is this the price we do pay for the Internet - the expectation that you're not going to have any privacy online anymore?",
        "Well, I think that's a pretty controversial idea.",
        "I certainly have heard people articulate that idea before.",
        "And people say that, you know, something has got to pay for all these great services we have on the Internet, and it's your data is how you're paying.",
