        "What they've been coming here to see, though, is mostly invisible: 12,000 sensors buried under the asphalt I'm standing on, affixed to lamp post across the street and many others and atop city buses.",
        "You see here, the two antennas, you see, just behind the tree?",
        "So, those antennas are gathering information coming from the sensors."

        "This was one of the UAW's top demands for job security, and, at the time, nobody ever thought the industry would get in as much trouble as it has gotten, and so General Motors agreed to this.",
        "And because there's something called pattern bargaining in the UAW, the other car companies accepted it as well.",
        "How much do these employees earn?"
