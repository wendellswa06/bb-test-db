        "Well, the insurance game, of course, is about business and profits and bottom lines just like any other company.",

        "I think they owe them restitution.",

        "They know what destroyed those homes.",
        "I know that that's going to be a big hit financially, but they are already in process of making up that money by raising the premiums to exorbitant rates for some who have decided that they want to return and rebuild.",
        "So they're going to get their money.",
        "But to deny people, I mean, this just seems beyond a legal and a business decision to me.",
        "I know business doesn't often end up in the same sentence with morality.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And I mean I think even, I mean, even just in the terms they technical for phraseology, say, you know, they pay for damage from wind but not from, like, from water surge.",
        "Well, you know, what was causing the water to surge if it wasn't partly the winds and so forth?",
        "On a purely legal basis, they may be technically correct.",
        "But there is, it seems at least at worst - excuse me - best, it seems at least amoral if not immoral.",
        "The one story I did see, though, the judge who made this decision was trying to urge all parties to go into a mediation, which means that they may not get dollar-for-dollar restitution but they may get at least something to try and put their lives together.",
        "But it does again undermine the hope for people who believe that the Gulf region can be restored to what it once was.",
        "This is really a case where the spirit of the law and the spirit of the issues that are at stake really ought to take precedent over these technical, legalistic maneuverings because there are the thousands and thousands of families that had been affected by this.",
        "And we have to help people get back to their lives, and this is the precise context where a mediation, where a much more ambitious multilateral conversation needs to be established."

        "Right.",
        "…and what was trying to be established here was a class action.",
        "So a lot of people could, you know, presumably move through the system a little faster in getting some help.",
        "Well, I recognize that.",
        "But the mediation process has managed to settle, I think, about 50 percent of this particular group of people.",
        "I did want to say just to add on, though, that if the flipside of it was though - if the insurance companies did have to pay complete restitution and then they, because of that, had to go bankrupt, that doesn't exactly help those also trying to rebuild as well because then you're going to have less insurers able to assist those for future calamities.",
        "And I guess the argument then, and we'll have to wrap this up.",
        "I guess the argument then is the profits of the insurance companies and how close to the edge really would they be towards bankruptcy if they funded all these insurance clients, correct?",
        "I'm guessing not too close.",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah, that's just going to be my guess.",
