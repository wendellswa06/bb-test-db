        "And Janet, so, oil prices are still dropping even though OPEC had this emergency meeting today.",
        "Why?",
        "Madeleine, part of it, I think we have to say right up front, is that the market volatility going on today is infecting all markets including oil.",
        "It could also be the traders and investors see the one and a half billion barrel a day cut from OPEC as proof we're in a global recession, as if more proof was needed.",
        "But recessions do choke off the need for oil.",
        "No one's expanding.",
        "Factories tend to close.",
        "Fewer people go places and that leads to a drop off in oil use, and less demand usually cuts oil prices.",
        "It could also be that investors just don't believe some of the OPEC nations will be able to cut production because they need the money from their oil to run their own economies.",
        "Jorge Pinon is an energy fellow at the University of Miami.",

        "The only countries that have the capacity, not only physical oil capacity but also the financial debts to cut back production, would be Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and UAE.",
        "UAE, that's United Arab Emirates that Pinon referencing there.",
        "But to illustrate his point, Pinon gives Venezuela as an example.",
        "He says the country is losing about $60 million a day selling oil just to the U.S.",
        "at today's prices compared to what it was making back in the summer.",
        "So, this is why OPEC wanted to cut production to raise prices?",
        "Well, they said the demand slowdown was making things worse in the market, and they said the market was actually over supplied with oil.",
        "They stressed, you know, they don't want to inflict more pain on consumers in nations suffering from the financial crisis.",
        "But at the same time, they said if prices fall too low, it could prevent future investment in new output and could eventually create a supply crunch.",
        "In response to OPEC, U.S.",
        "officials blasted OPEC.",
        "They said that in trying financial times we need more supply in the market, not less.",
        "And it would seem that in this period of economic volatility that lower energy prices would be at least one good thing, a silver lining.",
        "You would think.",
        "But Pinon from the University of Miami says that lower oil prices could put a stop to the development of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro and nuclear."
