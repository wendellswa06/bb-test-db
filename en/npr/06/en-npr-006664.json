        "It certainly is.",
        "It's not going to done overnight.",
        "We are just now in the recovery phase of the cleanup, and the cleanup itself will take much time.",
        "As you pointed in New Orleans, there's still much water there.",
        "And with Hurricane Rita bearing down the region, likely there'll be more water.",
        "And so we have to be very mindful of that; that it's not going to be quick.",
        "What we're focusing on is on individual services, helping individuals find temporary shelter and housing, helping them to get reconnected to jobs.",
        "And that's where the president spoke on Thursday about his programs of looking at helping worker recovery accounts be created for individuals, who will have it difficult to get employed; helping with the Homesteading Act, helping individuals find, back in the region, places where they can own homes, those that were not there; and working with providing relief to the small business community through the GO Zone proposals, making sure that they, too, have a desire to go back and help rebuild that region.",
        "Some of those programs are going to have to be approved by Congress, no?",
        "Well, certainly.",
        "But we have already been working with Congress, giving them greater details about it, and then it's going to be working out with Congress to get it done.",
        "But many of these issues, again, in terms of helping with worker recovery accounts, we have provided in the past certain assistance to individuals that are hard to employee.",
        "So it's not reinventing the wheel in any shape.",
        "What we're doing is targeting the relief to this region to help get it--quickly recover because not only is it important for the region, but it's significant to our national economy as well.",
        "And so it's important getting businesses back up and going and individuals back to work, where they can be gainfully employed and help participate in rebuilding the region.",
        "Sovereign country.",
        "Congress is going to have its own ideas.",
        "For example, today Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine introduced the Small Business, Homeowners and Renters Disaster Relief Act of 2005.",
        "Are you guys working together with the Republican leadership in Congress to make sure that their proposals align with your plans?",
        "We will be working with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to get the best plans together that will provide relief immediately for those immediate needs but also provide assistance for planning and building out for the recovery effort for the long term.",
        "So we will work with the leadership in Congress, both the House and the Senate, both Republican and Democrat, because, again, it's important to all Americans that we rebuild a strong Gulf Coast region.",
        "According to the White House briefing on Friday, city or regional employees would determine who gets worker recovery accounts.",
        "What criteria will they be using?",
        "Well, for the worker recovery accounts, many of the local labor departments have--already familiar with working with this type of program.",
        "Essentially, what it consists of is about 26 weeks of assistance for employees who are deemed to be difficult to hire or difficult to employ because either they lacked the essential skills necessary for the job they're searching for, the educational component or they just need a longer-term assistance.",
        "And so what we've done is set up up to $5,000 that they can use to provide employment-related and supportive services, including counseling, job training, even in some cases child care, transportation and relocation costs.",
        "And all that will be a part of it.",
        "This sounds like a 26-week extension of unemployment benefits plus."

        "It's sort of on top of that because, of course, they do have the 26 weeks of unemployment that they're entitled to.",
        "But after that some people--because maybe the line of work that they were in is no longer viable in a new Gulf Coast region and so, therefore, they're going to have to get retooled themselves with new skills, and so that may take longer than 26 weeks.",
        "And that's why we have the worker recovery accounts.",
        "And the goal, again, is not only to say, `Here's the training that you need, but if you get employed sooner than the additional 16 weeks,' they can get, as a bonus, the balance of that account that they can take for themselves because they got gainfully employed.",
        "Can you take a couple of calls with us?",
        "Sure can.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's begin with Doug.",
        "And Doug's calling us from Ormond Beach in Florida.",
        "Yes, I was wondering--we have millions of people who are displaced and out of work, and I was wondering if it might be possible to form an organization like the WPA and put a lot of these people back to work, bring them back, set up camps and have them rebuild their own city and get paid for it.",
        "A Works Project Administration back from the old New Deal era of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.",
        "Claude Allen?",
        "Well, actually our desire is to see--the best way to do this is not through the government setting up some public works program but, rather, using the strength and the power of the private sector.",
        "And that's what the GO Zones are designed for.",
        "And that is that small business, large business, they know what they need to get going back in this region, and so we are really incentivizing both the small business community but also individuals by providing them the job training accounts that can serve that purpose without having to have a large government footprint on this type of program that may not be necessary when the private sector can do it very well.",
        "Well, with one...",
        "Makes a great deal of sense.",
        "Doug, thanks for the call."

        "Thank you.",
        "With one thing or another, there are going to be a lot of contractors hired by the government to do a lot of different things.",
        "Are local businesses going to get a fair cut of this?",
        "Well, the president's made it very clear that he believes that we should certainly be supportive of having people in the region, from the region, be a part of the recovery effort.",
        "In fact, that's critical in order to build jobs in those areas.",
        "While we can't dictate that, we certainly believe that that is appropriate and that--we're working with the state and locals in terms of the contracts that are going out to ensure that they are complying with and meeting all the federal regulations that require equal opportunity and the like.",
        "And so those are going to be very important, but yes, we will work with them to make sure that locals do have an opportunity to get those jobs because this is their home.",
        "Here's an e-mail question from Todd in Des Moines, Iowa.",
        "`Who benefits from the exemption from prevailing wage rules in rebuilding?",
        "I think he's talking about the suspension of the Davis-Bacon law.",
        "Well, the people who benefit are actually the American public, the taxpayers, and the region at large.",
        "The purpose for waiving Davis-Bacon and other regulations that we're dealing with in this area was to get people back to work quickly but also to make sure that we're not putting bureaucratic barriers before people when we've got a region that has been devastated by Hurricane Katrina.",
        "And so for the period of about 90 says, we have waived a series of regulations to attract businesses that historically do not contract with the federal government because of simply that, we put too many obstacles before them.",
        "While we will have strong adherence to our equal employment laws, strong adherence to equal opportunity, we want to make sure, though, that we can get as many takers, businesses, that would desire to go in here to help rebuild the Gulf Coast region--to do so without having to go through a lot of hurdles through the government putting up before them in terms of bureaucracy.",
        "There was another part of Todd's question.",
        "He said, `Doesn't suspension of Davis-Bacon just allow outside parties to come in and mandate a wage for rebuilding, forcing locals to take low pay or leave it to have no rebuilding at all?'",
        "It was so friendly and helpful that people would greet you at the stores and help you as much as they could everywhere you went.",
        "Not at all.",
        "Not at all.",
        "In fact, what we're trying to do here is that we're trying to get people back to work and not have to haggle with and overlook a lot of paperwork.",
        "So, for example, in some of the cases, it has been said that we are waiving some of the affirmative action laws, and that's actually not the case.",
        "What we've done is simply said that for the period of 90 days, you don't have to have a written affirmative action plan.",
        "And yet under such a waiver, those very companies--minority-owned businesses, small businesses that heretofore do not contract with the federal government--will now have an opportunity to do so and not have to fill out all the papers that we historically require in a normal period.",
        "And so, no, we will not be undermining the prevailing wage or undermining the economy.",
        "We'll let the market dictate and remove government from the bureaucracy of putting before those who want to do the work and those who want to employ people and put them to work.",
        "Claude Allen, thank you so much for your time.",
