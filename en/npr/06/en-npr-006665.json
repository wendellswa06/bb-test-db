        "But, remember, the business elite in New Orleans may not necessarily want a lot of poor people to come back to New Orleans.",
        "I mean, we know in the history of urban renewal that urban renewal often has meant urban removal of the poor.",
        "So on both sides you've got sort of maybe a lack of interest of a lot of people going back to New Orleans.",
        "And then the question is: What are we going to do to help them?",
        "Let's get another caller in.",

        "Sure.",
        "My question is: Is there anything in the president's plan that's going to be used for the city of Baton Rouge?",
        "I know our mayor has gone and asked for it, but I don't know if there's anything earmarked.",
        "And, frankly, we're just being overwhelmed.",
        "You know, what...",
        "I do know one thing specifically that was in the president's plan, David, and that's to provide education benefits to schools that have been, of course, inundated with a lot of kids from New Orleans and other places.",
        "OK.",
        "But, I mean, we've got traffic problems.",
        "I work 10 miles from my house, and it takes me an hour each way.",
        "It's unbelievable the amount of people that have come in, and, you know, I--you know, we need help, too.",
        "I guess that's what I'm saying.",

        "Well, the government obviously has to rebuild infrastructure so lenders and insurance companies will be available to support builders and investors all over the Gulf Coast.",
        "Now the president did talk--or at least the president's office has talked about the Gulf Opportunity Zone concept, and David may be interested in this.",
        "New Orleans and the entire Mississippi delta region will be eligible for some tax breaks that, you know, other parts of the country are not eligible for in order to attract new private-sector investment.",
        "The problem there is that New Orleans and the Mississippi delta region have already been among tax-favored enterprise zones for over a decade with very little impact.",
        "So, once again, I think the president's trying to use the private sector, and I think that's perfectly fine.",
        "But maybe it's not enough and it's not quickly enough to get to what David is concerned about and what others are concerned about in terms of helping people on the ground right away.",
        "This enterprise zone, these have been--David, by the way, thank you very much for the call.",
        "I didn't mean to cut you off.",
        "Sure, Neal.",
        "But these enterprise zones--previously they've been relatively small targeted areas--suddenly are going to have an enterprise zone--well, people are saying the storm affected an area the size of Great Britain.",
        "That's right, and that's a big enterprise zone, Neal.",
        "The problem there is the businesses, according to a lot of studies--now we've never had an enterprise zone that big, but businesses do not locate mainly on the basis of tax advantages.",
        "They locate where they can get skilled people, they have good infrastructure, good communications systems, good transportation systems.",
        "And that's why so much has to be done before we can expect businesses to go to the New Orleans and the Gulf area.",
        "There are some businesses who may leave New Orleans for good.",
        "It's going to be some time, they begin to realize, before they could be able to get back into the city.",
        "If they're going to establish a new headquarters in Baton Rouge or elsewhere, why move back into New Orleans?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And remember also that one of the key industries in New Orleans specifically has been tourism.",
        "Tourists are probably the least likely to want to go to a place that has been as badly ravaged as New Orleans.",
        "The other industry is oil, but that is also--it's going to take time to get that infrastructure back.",
        "And that's not going to provide a lot of jobs to poor, relatively unskilled people.",
        "They need the tourist industry.",
        "And shipping is another big industry.",
        "Shipping, too, is another big industry.",
        "But again, mostly skilled longshoremen, people handling cargo--most of the poor in or who were in the area were involved in retail, restaurant, hotel, hospital, child care, elder care.",
        "These are not the kind of jobs that are going to be back there anytime soon."

        "Ninety percent of the students in New Orleans schools are black.",
        "And if you close the entire schools for an entire year, it means you don't want poor black people to come back to New Orleans.",
        "People have to have their children enrolled in schools, so they have to stay where they are to enroll their children in school.",

        "These companies are bringing people in from other states to take these jobs.",
        "And the people of New Orleans who could gladly take these jobs are being kept out, mainly because you can't move back in because your children got to go to school somewhere.",
        "And that makes us wonder if they want us back at all.",
        "I--there was an interview on \"\"Morning Edition\"\" today with an education official in New Orleans or in charge of New Orleans saying that they could open the schools, and they're thinking now as soon as January.",
        "But you're right, the remainder of this year...",
        "So this is actually going to be a waiting room right here.",
        "OK, but you've got people enrolling their kids in schools elsewhere, and we're supposed to just wait for them might to open the schools, maybe.",
        "Do you understand what I'm saying?",
        "Oh, I understand completely what you're saying, but...",
        "Because ...(unintelligible) the real people have to find a job where they are to put their children in school.",
        "But, Robert Reich, at the same time these schools, some of them, are still under water, some of them have been severely damaged.",
        "It's going to take a while to recollect to the teachers.",
        "January seems ambitious.",
        "It does seem ambitious, Neal.",
        "This is why I think it's important to, as I said before, distinguish between the goal of helping people who had been in this area, New Orleans and the Gulf, and who are now scattered all across America, on the one hand, and rebuilding New Orleans on the other.",
        "Those are two different goals, and they may have very little to do with each other, particularly if a lot of the people who are scattered all over American decide not to come back."
