        "It has the goal of rebuilding New Orleans and restoring the services and the style of life that was there before, and then some.",
        "Its focus, I think, is a lot on helping the private sector participate in the rebuilding, setting some good metrics to make sure things get done so that the critics--whatever criticism there is, it seems to me, more focused on these positive elements is merited.",
        "What are the metrics that you're talking about, these measurements of progress?",
        "Well, for example, there's going to be, in creating this Gulf, there's a Gulf Opportunity Zone, which is taking the areas of the three states that were hit hardest and allowing firms to write off additional funds if they invest in the area.",
        "And one of the metrics is to allow for twice as much expensing as before if the firms invest there, from 200,000 rather than 100,000.",
        "There's also, I think, very important when they write the contracts for their infrastructure rebuilding to set the time lines and provide incentives for firms--construction firms to get the jobs done in time.",
        "This was a technique used in California after the Northridge earthquake and it was very successful.",
        "We're talking about the proposals to rebuild New Orleans and the Gulf Coast, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let me ask you, John Taylor, about the price tag for this.",
        "The president said, `We'll do everything that's necessary and not a penny more,' but there is no price tag at this point, is there?",
        "Schieber liked the vibe here so much that she stayed.",
        "Garden City is now majority-Hispanic and extremely diverse, a town of 27,000 speaking at least 27 - some say 40 - languages and still finding fresh ways to welcome newcomers.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVING TABLE)",
        "Well, of course, the Congress has already put out $60 billion of funds.",
        "It's--and those are going to be used for infrastructure reconstruction, for direct payments to people.",
        "There's also the proposal to create these worker--special worker accounts for retraining, getting better education, and so the funds will be used for that, too.",
        "But right now the numbers that have been put forth are $60 billion.",
        "Some of it's already being spent this year, some of it will be spent next year, and then with the reconstruction projects, it'll be a number of years.",
        "But people are estimating something in the ballpark of 200 billion here."

        "Well, those are just estimates and guesstimates at this point in time.",

        "Here's an e-mail question that we have from Chris in San Diego: `Given that wetlands serve as a sort of buffer zone and could prevent a hurricane from being stronger than it otherwise might be, is part of the president's plan to rebuild those wetlands on the Gulf Coast which had been largely eradicated?'",
        "I have not heard that particular part of it.",

        "Anyway, Brad is calling here from Vancouver in Washington.",
        "Yes, hi.",
        "I have a curiosity about where this money is ultimately coming from.",
        "You know, $60 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to what's gonna be out there necessary, you know, and I guess I already know that it's gonna increase our deficit, and when we increase our deficit, it's not just borrowing from ourselves.",
        "My understanding is that we borrow from other countries.",
        "And I'm curious, you know, since Mr. Bush isn't going to lower the taxes or decrease the amount of money that he's spending in Iraq, you know, who's the biggest note holder here?",
        "Who are we gonna go to to get this money to spend on the reconstruction?",
        "I think he said--he meant to say that President Bush wouldn't raise taxes rather than that he wouldn't lower them.",
        "John Taylor?",
        "Yes.",
        "The president has, I think, very wisely said that it's not a good idea to be increasing taxes.",
        "Taxes that are in place now should remain.",
        "I think the caller is very correct to say that we ought to look for ways to control spending in other areas.",
        "The president's budget had a number of proposals to constrain spending, to reduce programs that he viewed as unnecessary.",
        "It seems to me at this point, especially the Congress should come back and look at those proposals and...",
        "Things like the transportation bill?",
        "There's--well, the proposals were for $15 billion, so that's a good start.",
