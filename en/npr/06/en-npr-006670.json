        "Well, in El Paso, she visited a couple of Border Patrol stations and met with the local Border Patrol chief, who briefed her on these medical screenings they're conducting.",
        "She also met with El Paso's mayor, and his name is Dee Margo.",
        "And I spoke with Mayor Margo last night.",
        "He said he and the secretary talked about this nighttime release of 214 migrants at a downtown Greyhound station last Sunday that got a lot of media attention.",
        "And the reason is because Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, usually alerts the local shelter network when they're going to make a big release like this.",
        "This time they didn't, and that left these hundreds of mostly Central Americans out in the cold.",
        "And Margo says Nielsen apologized for this, saying that it was a mistake.",
        "They didn't discuss the deaths of the two Guatemalan children because those are still under investigation.",
        "What have you learned about the conditions of the processing facilities where these families are held after they enter the U.S.?",
        "Well, the conditions are far from ideal.",
        "The Arizona Republic looked at testimony in legal filings where migrants describe these facilities, and over and over, they say the same thing.",
        "They're held in crowded, windowless spaces, sometimes on the floor, for days.",
        "And some said there wasn't any soap to wash their hands or clean vomit off their children's clothes.",
        "And medical experts quoted in this story say it's no wonder children are getting sick.",
        "Even Customs and Border Protection acknowledges that these facilities were not designed to hold families and is asking Congress for help."
