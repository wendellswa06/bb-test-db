        "He recently opened a Poverty Research Center at the University of North Carolina.",
        "And now that America is finally talking about the depth of class crisis, Edwards believes we must act soon to make real change.",

        "They've seen their faces on television and the real question is are we going to be able to keep the nation's attention focused on doing something over the long term about poverty.",
        "And I think in order to accomplish that, we need people like you and me to continue to not only talk about it but propose some ideas about how to eliminate poverty in this country.",
        "Senator, I'm curious why you believe we did not and have not dealt with poverty in a way and in a place where we sit as the richest country in the history of the world and have not been able to eradicate it?",
        "I think addressing poverty, particularly in a country like ours, is a matter of conscience.",
        "It's a matter of doing the right thing and I think it requires leaders to demand and ask the country to do what's right.",
        "Because I happen to believe the country will respond.",
        "You look at what happened in the aftermath of Katrina.",
        "It's a perfect example.",
        "Even though there was a lot of bungling on the part of government, the American people responded extraordinarily.",
        "They'd do exactly the same thing if their leaders asked them to do it on the issue of poverty all across America.",
        "So I think the bottom line is, I think it's in the heart and soul of the American people to do what's right.",
        "They want their money spent wisely.",
        "They want people who are getting help to act responsibly.",
        "But they do want people to have a real chance and they don't want people to live the kind of lives that so many Americans who were in the city of New Orleans who had to evacuate, so many Americans do, are part of that 37 million, live every day."

        "We've seen this, through this catastrophe, and I'm curious, as you look back on your days in the Senate and your years in Washington, how much does government bureaucracy cause an inability to really deal with such a pervasive problem?",
        "Oh, the bureaucracy's a huge problem.",
        "I mean, what happens is you end up having a lot of government bureaucrats who are more interested in--unfortunately, in themselves sometimes than the people they're trying to help and perpetuating their job, etc. But there are lots of things we can do to help eliminate poverty in this country.",
        "Now first, and sort of laying the foundation for that discussion, you know, we had over a million people added to the poverty rolls just in the past year, according to the Census Bureau.",
        "And it's deceptive when you have Washington politicians talking about how great the economy's doing, that there's a recovery.",

        "For the vast majority of Americans, including the poor and the working poor, their real income has been going down over the last several years.",

        "You know, so there's - there is quite a feeling that NATO is not doing enough, although they also feel that if NATO hadn't intervened in the first place, if there weren't air strikes, that it would be much worse.",
        "Would those air strikes, if they targeted buildings with mortars or rockets in them or snipers, they would risk injuring civilians, no?",
        "There are no civil - most of the civilians have been evacuated off of these streets.",
        "And have you been able to identify which particular units in the pro-Gadhafi forces are attacking Misrata?",

        "They talk about different kativas(ph), the brigades that are loyal to Gadhafi that have come in.",
        "But it's unclear to me exactly who is who.",

        "Yes.",
        "Well, I think the answer is very simple.",
        "Whereas in Benghazi, the forces are on the move in the open countryside, in the case of Misrata, it's inside the city.",
        "So NATO is constrained by the fact that the resolution that empowers it only allows it to defend civilians.",
        "And that means it's got to avoid any danger of attacking civilians.",
        "And since it can't see those responsible for the sniping, the mortaring and so on, I think there's a great reluctance to begin a process that might involve an escalation into some kind of engagement on the ground.",
        "And, of course, the point is that in the end, the only way in which the struggle in Misrata is going to be ended is by engagement on the ground, and that's beyond the limits of the resolution.",
        "One thing that would not be soldiers on the ground, would be forward air controllers, people who could say: Hit that building over there, the one I'm shining this laser on.",
        "Yes, of course, you're right.",
        "But the problem is every little step that involves a presence on the ground implies an escalation.",
        "And everybody remembers Vietnam, remembers the way in which Kennedy began with advisors and ended up with main forces on the ground.",
        "And there's an enormous desire to avoid that.",
        "There's another problem, too, it's a problem that been, I think, somewhat shrouded, which is that NATO, which at the moment consists basically of Britain and France together with some other states, just doesn't have the means available to it to do what it should actually do."
