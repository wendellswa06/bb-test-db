        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "As I told the screener, I believe that time is definitely on the rebels' side.",
        "And I just base that, just based upon - I'm fascinated with the story.",
        "I probably read about this stuff three hours a day from various sites and listen to the radio, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "You just mentioned the incident with the border crossing there - hearing, you know, upwards of 100 soldiers defected to the Tunisian side, and the rebels were able to take that base.",
        "And in the field, it no longer looks like Gadhafi has command of his army.",
        "It's no longer really an effective fighting force.",
        "It seems to be he has his most loyal handlers with groups of civilians and mercenaries.",
        "In another report that I read, he was - he doesn't even like to put his forces in units of greater than 200 or 300 for fear that those units might defect en masse.",
        "So I'm just seeing a slow but sure disintegration.",
        "George Joffe, there are - there is an embargo on supplies of military weaponry to the Gadhafi side.",
        "They're going to run out of ammunition.",
        "They can't replace equipment like tanks and armored personnel carriers.",
        "That's quite true, but at the same time, you've got to remember they had enormous stocks of them built up over many years, held all over the country - in the south at Sabha, of course in the center at Surt, around Tripoli and even around Benghazi.",
        "So I think he's still got considerable reserves left to use.",
        "But I have to agree: I think the forces are declining.",
        "And that point about the border crossing taken on the western border of Libya is very important because it indicates that there's still a lot of trouble in the Jebel Nafusa, overlooking Tripoli, an area occupied by Libya's Berbers who have long resented the Gadhafi regime."

        "Now, their struggle has been completely unreported, but it's been apparently very fierce.",
        "And it indicates the way in which Tripoli is being cut off, not just from the east of the country, but from the south of the country, as well.",
        "Tony, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Though he talks about defections, there was an important political defection, the former foreign minister, Musa Kusa, who arrived in London and left the Gadhafi government and is being treated leniently to encourage others to come over, as well.",
        "But he's been the only one.",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "The only one recently.",
        "Well, recently perhaps, but there have been a slew of ambassadors who defected, former ministers who've defected.",
        "And it's said that, in fact, the core government in Libya is held sequestered inside Colonel Gadhafi's headquarters in the Bab al-Azizia barracks inside Tripoli, largely because of fears that they would defect.",
        "Now, that doesn't seem to me to indicate a really functioning administration or a coherent system by which to maintain control of the country or the part of the country in which Gadhafi still holds sway.",
        "So I think we are seeing that slow decline, that slow disintegration.",
        "It may take a long time.",
        "Some of the units are very well-trained and motivated, but it's there.",
        "And don't forget, too, one of the things NATO did do was to hit the command and control centers in Libya.",
        "So Colonel Gadhafi's abilities to communicate and instruct and direct forces at the outliers, like Misrata, must now be very impeded."

        "He is isolated.",
        "And that means over time, people are going to begin to consider whether their interests are best served by supporting him.",

        "They argue as to which of them should be in control of the forces on the ground.",
        "They both ignore the ostensible defense minister appointed by the National Transitional Council, and therefore, the command and control system is badly disrupted.",
        "Beyond that, too, there's still no real evidence of proper training for the forces involved.",
        "That's why Britain, Spain and Italy are sending instructors to try and help them.",
        "And beyond that, there's growing resentment about the fact that the National Transitional Council is dominated by some of the grand families of Benghazi, and that's beginning to create a degree of resentment inside eastern Libya.",

        "And this could - certainly the pressure on the NATO alliance, for both politics and for other considerations, this could be very fracturing.",
