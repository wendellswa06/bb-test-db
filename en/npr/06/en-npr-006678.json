        "Okay, John, thanks.",
        "There are certainly divisions within NATO to exploit.",
        "There are indeed.",
        "Not divisions so much amongst the Europeans, although there are divisions there, too, between on the one hand Germany that doesn't take part or some of the other states, such as Poland, that won't allow their aircraft into combat.",
        "But the real division lies between the United States and Britain and France.",
        "And the division, really, resides around the fact that President Obama has determined that the United States should not lead this operation, that this should be a joint operation.",
        "And the Europeans are discovering that they don't have the resources available to do the job properly.",
        "And therefore, concerns about whether or not NATO can hold together are well founded.",
        "I think it goes on to a much deeper question, which is the degree to which the United States feels it should still provide European defense.",
        "European states, don't forget, have reduced their defense expenditures to below two percent of GDP.",
        "Now, that's trivial compared with the United States.",
        "And understandably, there are many inside the United States who feel that actually the time has come to let the Europeans look after themselves.",
        "So that's one serious problem.",
        "The other problem is that NATO forces know that they could end this very quickly.",
        "They could intervene directly on the ground despite the provisions of Resolution 1973.",
        "But they're anxious not to do that because of the wider implications in terms of the perceptions of the Arab world of what NATO is actually doing.",
        "They therefore are caught in a very fine balance between doing just enough to help the rebels succeed and not doing enough to actually destroy the Gadhafi regime.",
        "George Joffe of Cambridge University's Department of Politics and Intelligence Studies is with us today from member station KUER in Salt Lake City.",
        "Now, I'm not sure I agree with Dan(ph), that time is on Colonel Gadhafi's side.",
        "He certainly thinks so, but I don't think that's actually the case.",
        "In the end, he's isolated.",
        "He's isolated, not just in terms of the international community, he's isolated in Africa, and he's isolated in the Arab world too.",
        "That's going to count against him because he's lost enormous credibility."

        "In the end, his regime isn't credible, and that's the factor that's going to count.",
        "That would drive the rebellion onwards.",
        "It will make it break out elsewhere inside the territories he now controls, and that would hasten his end.",
        "Do you think the example of Kosovo is instructive, where, of course, a NATO-led air campaign - this time led by the United States - one thing the Europeans discovered in that was it's getting increasingly difficult to even operate with U.S.",
        "forces, the differences were so great - but that's your other point.",
        "But, in any case, a couple of weeks into that, it did look like that was going to be a stalemate too.",
        "In the end, Serbia cracked.",
        "That's correct, but then, President Milosevic was somebody capable of making rational decisions.",
        "It's questionable whether Colonel Gadhafi, in the current circumstances, is.",
        "He is determined that he must regain control of the country, and this is a personal issue.",
        "He believes that he created the ideal political system, and he finds it as a personal affront that others should have rejected those ideas, and he's determined to impose them.",
        "That means he's not rational in the decisions he's going to take about whether or not he can continue to resist.",
        "And that, of course, means that he's bound to overreach himself, and that's really, I think, what NATO is calculating on.",
        "And it's true, that in Kosovo, there were great doubts.",
        "But they arose, largely, not just because of the intra-operability of NATO and United States forces, but also because of the way in which the Europeans reacted.",
        "The French, in particular, resenting lead given by President Clinton.",
        "And there, of course, it took 79 days of aerial bombardment before success was achieved.",
        "I'm not sure that NATO in Europe has got the resources to do that.",
        "We're talking with George Joffe about the stalement that seems to be prevailing in Libya at the moment, with the government of Colonel Gadhafi in control of much of the west, the rebels in control of much of the east, fighting going on still at Ajdabiya, the gates of Benghazi and the besieged city of Misrata.",

        "David with us from Portland.",
        "Hi there.",
        "I had - earlier, your guest mentioned that, over time, the Gadhafis will crumble from within.",
        "I wonder if that has already begun to happen.",
        "At the beginning of the conflict, there were - at least a few high-level defections, and I wonder if he's really just the shell of what he once was, and he's just kind of playing it out.",
        "George?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "I find myself in agreement with that.",
        "Um - but you need to remember too, that's not a factor here.",
        "Colonel Gadhafi has the support of his own tribal base, based around Sirte and running out towards Misrata.",
        "And that tribal base is quite strong.",
        "It's also got a major investment in the regime because it's benefited from it very largely."

        "It will eventually move away from him, but not yet.",
        "And then there's a second thing too.",
        "Quite apart from the formal structure of government, he has always depended very heavily on his family, and his family is closely associated with him.",
        "And therefore, in a sense, because he's got that, he can appear to be much stronger than he really is.",
        "It will therefore take a very long time before we see the regime finally collapse, but I'm certain it will collapse because it doesn't have the intrinsic ability to continue to rule the country.",
        "Can I ask a follow-up?",
        "If you make it quick, David.",
        "Okay.",
        "So when we went into Iraq and we got in there with Saddam Hussein, and all of a sudden everybody just turned tail and ran, is it possible that this might be the same kind of instance if it gets to that point?",

        "There have been rumors, already, there's been at least one attempt.",
        "And eventually, one of these attempts will succeed.",

        "Yes, voices are being raised saying that we're moving beyond the stage of the intervention as originally justified, but even then, there's still generalized support for the initiative that's being taken.",

        "If Misrata fell, I think that will do two things.",

        "And that, may well, have been the case.",
        "On the other hand, it will convince those who were in principle in support of the operation, then now it's got to be carried through for reasons of national and international prestige.",
