        "I think the country would do the right thing if its leaders asked them to do it, whether the face of poverty were black or white.",
        "But the reality is, however optimistic you are, that the face of poverty in America is the face of color.",
        "We have to recognize that.",
        "We have to be honest about it.",
        "Just by way of example, when you clump poor people together and when you clump poor, black people together, like we saw in New Orleans in the Ninth Ward, it's much harder for those families to lift themselves out of poverty.",
        "It's much harder to have the kind of schools that you want to have.",
        "It's much harder to have the kind of job opportunities that you want to have.",
        "I mean, for a whole variety of reasons, New Orleans needs to be rebuilt in a culturally and racially integrated way, not in the kind of segregated way that we saw before Katrina hit.",
        "And there are lots of ways that we, as a nation, can help accomplish that.",
        "I want to talk to you about some of the issues that you put forth in terms of trying to meet the goal of eradicating poverty.",

        "First of all, we want to make work pay for people.",
        "I mean, for folks who are out there working, trying to support their families, and I can't tell you how many I've met over the last six or eight months, in 25 or 30 different states, working two or three jobs, but they can't earn a decent income.",
        "You know, at a minimum we ought to raise the minimum wage in this country to at least $7.50 an hour.",
        "And for those who are listening who probably already know this, it's $5.15 an hour right now.",
        "We ought to pay--create a more level playing field for workers who are trying to organize so that they can have decent benefits and decent pay.",
        "One of the things that I'd like to see us do is have what I call work bond.",
        "So that we actually give an extra tax credit, up to $500 a year, for low-income workers.",
        "So in other words, if you're working, you're out there trying, we're going to provide you with a little help to help lift you out of poverty, you and your family."

        "We all know that the poorest among us are the most susceptible to predatory lending.",
        "So one of the things that I'm suggesting is that we have a crackdown on predatory lending and a new deal for poor families who are entering the workplace where we say, you know, for the first five years you work, we're going to set up up to a thousand dollars a year aside for future home payments.",
        "You know, some people are for school vouchers.",
        "I'm not.",
        "But I am for housing vouchers.",
        "So that we give poor families, working families, an opportunity to move into neighborhoods, to provide some cultural and racial integration in those neighborhoods, to maybe get them access to better schools.",
        "I mean, there are a whole variety of things that can be accomplished by that.",
        "Do you believe we'll see that, sir, in the sense of once we see some distance between the emotional impact of Katrina and those who make these decisions, do you think that they'll hold on to the feeling of wanting to move this country to a better place?",
        "I think it depends entirely on, number one, whether there are leaders, who the country recognizes, who are willing to make this a long-term issue.",
        "Now in fairness, this is--you know, doing something about poverty in America, and you remember me talking about the two Americas in my own presidential campaign.",
        "This is something that's very near and dear to me, and I'm personally passionate about.",

        "Not ...(unintelligible).",

        "Within a lot of African-American households, I think, there's an idea that black men don't want to take an active participation in the lives of their children.",
        "That if they do, there has to be some sort of ulterior motive.",
        "Now, this is something nobody has ever heard of before.",
        "First of all, I felt then and, of course, I think now that that was just utter nonsense.",
        "What I was trying to do, and I hope I'm still trying to do, is to talk about the truth, the reality of the America we live in today, where we have a few people--and I might add, including myself--who are doing very, very well, and then most of the country who's struggling every single day.",
        "It's not right.",
        "If we believe in real equality in this country, then we have enormous work to do to help lower those inequities that exist.",
        "And the way we should do it--and this is part of what's wrong with what they're accusing me of by looking backwards to the '60s--is we ought to do it in a 21st century way that allow families to have independence, to be responsible, to have dignity and self-respect.",
        "I mean, this is not about just giving them something.",
        "It's about giving them a hand up to do for themselves.",
        "And I might add, I think it's a huge thing, and I think there is a hunger in America today, for us to have a sense of national community, to be involved in something that all of us can be proud of."

        "You've got a lot of politicians, some of whom are mostly looking out, either for themselves or for each other, and there doesn't seem to be a deep understanding of the problems that people face out here in the real world every day, which I think is part of why the American people weren't as conscious of the existence of poverty before Katrina as they are today.",
