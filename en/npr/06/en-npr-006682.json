        "And the - one of the - the senior director of the National Safety Council, which is, you know, a consortium of industry interest in safety, I think he said it best.",
        "He said it's just not possible for our brains to focus on the road and the call or texting.",
        "So I just - it just feels like we've reached a point - it's kind of too - like, again, it's too bad that we've - with the aid of the past administration, we have not really been, you know, confronted with the dangers of cell phone use while driving the way we should have.",

        "Yeah...",
        "So I think we can - with a concerted effort and serious information that this is a serious thing to do with serious consequences, if you're in an accident and you are doing this act, I think - it'll take a few years, but I think we can get compliance up pretty high.",
        "We're talking with Boston Globe columnist Derrick Jackson about the proposal, his proposal, to ban the use of cell phones while driving.",

        "Does it distract you?",
        "Well, possibly somewhat, sometimes.",
        "I believe you have to be intelligent enough to know when to set the phone down, when to pay attention more seriously to the driving and the situation than not.",
