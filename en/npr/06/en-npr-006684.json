        "But fundamentally, I don't - I don't think he can shift strategy again.",
        "He shifted it so much.",
        "The erratic charge will really begin to stick.",
        "I think the decision the McCain campaign was made about a year ago.",
        "They had some advisers, guys named Mike Murphy and John Weaver, who wanted them to run a non-traditional Republican campaign.",
        "Those advisers were ousted, and now he's running a traditional tax-cut Republican campaign, wrong year to do that.",
        "Strategically, David, some Republicans are saying, look, take your resources out of - (unintelligible) Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, focus on a couple of states that you could conceivably still get focus on, say Virginia, North Carolina.",
        "Would that be a strategy that they should follow?",
        "You know, I don't think ads really work at a presidential level.",
        "Well, I saw a report the other day that in Northern Virginia, Obama's running 1,400 ads and McCain had run 8, that's a pretty big advantage, but these guys are really well known.",
        "I don't think ads are really driving much here.",
        "E.J., let's talk about the message, in Virginia today, the Democratic Senator, Jim Webb, was introducing Barack Obama, and he said, you know, you can trust him.",
        "I trust him.",
        "This is in Southwestern Virginia, part of the state that Obama's campaigning hard to get, addressing lingering doubts about this guy and at the same time, we're now hearing about robo-calls from the Republican party and the McCain campaign to voters talking about Obama quote, \"\"working closely with the domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.\"\" Are there still doubters who Obama could turn around or who McCain could turn around?",
        "Well, there are still doubters, because there are undecided voters…",
        "Sure.",
        "And that, you know, it's two weeks out, a week is an eternity in politics.",
        "So, you cannot - should not declare a campaign over.",
        "But I think again, the economy has taken a lot of voters who might had doubts about Obama.",
        "Some voters who might have had qualms - white voters about voting for an African American.",
        "I was talking to Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio, represents Youngstown area, and he said, look, a lot of voters who may have racial feelings, white voters, are now way beyond that, because of the economy and McCain is in a catch 22.",
        "He needs to raise doubts about Obama.",
        "However, every time he attacks, it's now increasing his negative rating in the voters.",
        "So he's in this - he's in this bind, and he's having trouble getting out of it."

        "David Brooks, you have a sort of personality profile in the New York Times today, talking about Barack Obama and you mentioned that's easy to sketch out a scenario in which he could be a great president.",
        "But there's also a flip side to that you point out.",
        "Well, he's so calm.",
        "And he's so thoughtful, and the great president scenario is that he really doesn't - he's not - he doesn't have demons that are going to destroy him.",
        "He gathers very smart people which he's already done, and they really have long-term discussions and really govern the country the way we want it to be governed.",
        "I think the down side is that he is so passionless, and has shown so little evidence in his past of really taking a courageous tough decision, when the decision is really tough to take, that he be - could become passive.",
        "And then he would just be ignored by the Congressional Democrats, and he would float off in an island on his own.",
        "That really is the determining factor in the election now.",
        "His calmness, his reassuring presence has no doubt been a winner.",
        "His approval rating - he's got 21 percent more people who approve than disapprove of him, and that's the driving force behind this election.",
        "And we're going to have to leave it there.",
        "Thanks to you both for coming in.",

        "Among other things, she is showing rather poorly, as you say, in polls in individual states, including in the state of Alaska, where...",
        "Where she, of course, backed Joe Miller and not the winner, Lisa Murkowski.",
        "That's right, and although a lot of people thought it was Sarah Palin's clout that got Joe Miller the win in that head-to-head Republican primary last year, and that forced Lisa Murkowski to run as an independent and as a write-in candidate, that in the end may have shown really only her appeal to a limited number of Republicans, even in Alaska, because as I say, her positives there are barely better than they are in the state of Massachusetts.",
        "And we have to, though, concentrate on three states.",
        "That would be Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.",
        "That's right, and in these states, while she has a strong following in all three, and maybe particularly in Iowa, where she has made a number of trips, she would have to deal with not only the negatives that people feel for her on the independent side and the Democratic side, but even within the Republican Party, where, while she still has overwhelmingly positive reactions in the Republican Party, people are very practical in Iowa, and they ask: Who's our best candidate in November?",
        "Who can beat Barack Obama?",
        "And the polls we've been seeing show that she's weaker against Obama than really anyone else in the field.",
        "She also, well, refudiated her mistyped tweet.",
        "She said that she mistakenly typed an F and did not intend to create a word.",
        "She just meant to say repudiate and hit an F, and she said and everybody just, well, lost it over one typed missed letter."
