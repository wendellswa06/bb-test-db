        "It may have a lot to say, in a sense, about the whole Palin idea of her running for president in 2012.",
        "Quite a few people think that she's benefiting from this, profiting from it, if you will.",
        "She has an enormous media career, and so does her family, all to some degree reliant not only on her personal charm but also on this idea that she might very well run for president in 2012 and be a formidable contender for the office.",
        "If that is - if that is in the end what's making people interested in Sarah Palin, she's going to have to string this out for as long as possible and play on that media interest.",
        "Well, staying with her likely opponent, should she get in the race and win the Republican nomination, that's of course Barack Obama, on vacation this week in Hawaii and, well, not taking any work with him, it seems.",
        "You, too, thanks a lot.",
        "You know...",
        "No, he is - he is truly on vacation, although he has found at least some kind of a reason to visit a Marine base there, whether it's to play golf or whether it's to greet the troops or have a meal or visit them, their Sunday services last weekend.",
        "He is, of course, from Hawaii, and for him to go to Hawaii is maybe a little different from, say, you or I going to Hawaii.",
        "It is a vacation, but it is also a visit back to his homeland, his home ground, if you will, and Hawaii is a place that most of us would like to spend a little bit of time.",
        "Now, he did not take with him any bills to sign.",
        "If there were a bill where it made a difference whether it got signed today or next week, it could be spirited out to him by rapid transit in less than half a day, but there doesn't seem to be any legislation on his desk at this point that needs that.",
        "The first responder legislation for 9/11 firefighters and others, to have certain kinds of health care and benefits, will - it won't make any difference whether he signs it this week or next week."

        "And appeal to Democratic blue-collar voters too.",
        "That is correct, as he has had in New Jersey.",
        "So if this is a misstep, he saw the storm coming.",
        "He said: I don't know if it's going to be that bad or not, but what can I do?",
        "I can do whatever I can do to encourage this cleanup from Disney World.",
        "And of course he had a lieutenant governor who was ready to step in for him.",
