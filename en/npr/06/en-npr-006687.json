        "He also served as chief counsel to former Republican Senate Minority Leader - Majority Leader, excuse me - Bill Frist and is with us from time to time.",
        "And Alex, nice to have you with us, happy new year.",
        "Thanks for having me on, and well-done on the firm name.",
        "And who's your pick for politician of the year?",
        "So this is somewhat old-fashioned, given some of the attributes people are giving to people.",
        "My nominee is Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, and he is nominated because he did exactly what he said he would do when he ran for office.",
        "When Ken ran for attorney general, he said he was going to challenge the individual mandate in court, and most people said that's crazy, and it won't work.",
        "And guess what?",
        "Judge Hudson has ruled it unconstitutional.",
        "It'll go to the Supreme Court.",

        "A reporter, Wade Goodwin said…",
        "But you have this relatively obscure state senator getting elected attorney general and actually has taught the American public about the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.",
        "So for that alone, he would be my nominee.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's before he actually was successful in winning his court case.",
        "And of course, you're talking about the health care law, which -the mandate, which would require, in 2014, that every American purchase health care or be penalized on their tax forms."

        "That's correct.",
        "And one of the fascinating things to me is in talking to some of my more liberal friends on the subject is when they've heard him on television, they've said: You know, I profoundly disagree with this guy, but after watching him on television and talking about this health care issue, I actually think he's right.",
        "And so he's not only taken an incredibly dense, complicated subject that A, most politicians are desperate to get away from as fast as possible, he's distilled it very well, but more importantly, and again why I've nominated him, he said he was going to do it, and he went out, and he did it.",
        "And that's a rare attribute these days in a politician.",

        "But in the end, he was able to make Sharron Angle the focus of much of people's attention in the fall.",
        "And Sharron Angle left much to be desired as a candidate.",
        "And then in the end, Harry Reid won surprisingly by not a terribly close margin, largely because he dominated the Hispanic vote, which is increasingly important in the state of Nevada.",
