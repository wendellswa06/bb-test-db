        "Well yeah.",
        "I mean, all through life I think you have those reflective moments, not just then.",
        "So that was definitely there, and that's always there.",
        "Hopefully anyone will reflect about things that you do, not too much, not obsess about it.",
        "But yeah, I was reflecting and thinking is that right?",
        "You know, you ask yourself am I?",
        "And then you're like no, no wait a minute.",

        "Absolutely, and Michael, I was wondering when you said not being attracted, I was wondering in terms of relationships?",
        "When you said that…",
        "Yeah, actually, physically and not just sexually.",
        "I guess with relationships in general, and you know, of course…",
        "Well, I think that we all have our right to choices, and things that we see and believe, you know, things that we kind of, you know, we're attracted to.",
        "But I think that a racist should be defined by an accumulation of things and not just a handful of surface, you know, sound bites or excerpts.",
        "It should come from us kind of looking closely, whether it's within or without, at a person and then kind of looking at a number of things and not just one or two.",
        "Yeah, and it's like this is a whole issue that we're dealing with now.",
        "It's just like a comment thrown out there, like to use it for attack, you're a racist, and use it so quickly or lightly, and when no, like you have to look at so many things.",
        "Michael, thanks very much for the call, and I apologize for misidentifying your state.",

        "Growing up, my dad - my dad was raised in a very conservative, ignorant upbringing in the South.",
        "So that was part of his makeup, and going through high school, when I learned what racism was, I remember a conversation with my mother where I - you know, I said to her, and just between the two of us, I said, well dad's racist.",
        "And she very quickly admonished me and said no, no he's not.",
        "He's a bigot.",
        "And did you understand what she was trying to get at?",
        "I kind of got the idea right away.",
        "She didn't really explain herself much, but I really got the idea that okay, this is not a light title to apply to somebody.",
        "But I'm curious as to what your, what Ms. Turner Trice would consider the differentiation between the two, if there is any.",
        "You know, I'm reminded - President Obama had said that his white grandmother once said some things that he found profoundly offensive, but you know, the question was she a racist?",
        "Can you call a person who takes in her brown grandchild and loves him and rears him a racist?",
        "And one might say that, and this kind of pertains to your father, maybe that person says some things that are racist or insensitive, and maybe his prejudices come out in those statements, but as - in terms of is that person, in totality, is that person a racist, I think maybe that's what your mother was getting at.",
        "Does it logically follow that the person is a racist because he says, he or she, said bigoted things, and I think that maybe that's part of the whole - looking at the whole person and the entire situation as opposed to kind of cherry-picking parts.",
        "Andrew, did you ever - oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.",
        "No - because I think that we all, you know, we all - or most of us - have said things that maybe - said things in inelegant ways and things that we may regret later, or we - and there's also the possibility of change, right?",
        "So you can feel one way at one point in your life, and you can start to evolve into a different person.",
        "Andrew, did you ever talk with your father about it?",
        "No so much.",
        "My father was a stroke victim.",

        "As I grew older, I realized that, you know, it was less of the stroke and more of his upbringing.",
        "But also I figured that, you know, if you had to be truly racist, then my definition became then you act, you pursue your beliefs actively and try to put it on others, and he never did that.",
        "I mean, it was always just kind of his own personal views.",
        "Andrew, thanks very much for the call.",
        "And I think that that's a really important point that it's how much does the person really act out, and maybe the power portion comes into this.",
        "How much does that person's belief really affect his or her actions and in terms of affecting other people.",
        "Here's an email that goes at least a bit to that point from Amy(ph), in California.",
        "I hate to admit it, but when Proposition 8 passed in California, I was so shocked and outraged, I put up a yard sign: Get out the torches and pitchforks.",

        "Be careful of what you say.",
        "Of course, Proposition 8 was the gay marriage ban that passed in California, and many African-Americans voted against it, including Amy's neighbor.",
        "And there is the word used - there is something that, well, to identify with the KKK can be certainly interpreted as being racist.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, those are - I mean, we have these code words that you may not use the R-word, as you said, but I mean, there are other words that really dovetail into that whole sentiment, and again, it's very difficult.",
        "You know, it's hard to kind of undo it or unsay it, and so that whole sign on the yard, it does - it's kind of a scar, and we have to - we work very hard to kind of not fall into those situations.",

        "Yeah, amid the passions of a political campaign, Dawn Turner Trice, we did hear that comment.",
        "And you had to make arguments that of course you could be voting for John McCain or somebody else for that matter, and not for Barack Obama, and you know, there were plenty of reasons to do it.",
        "Absolutely, and I mean, the label is an easy - it's such an easy comeback, you know, and because in addition to it just being freighted, I mean, we all kind of know, we know what it means, and it's such - so instead of delving and asking people, you know, well, what else about the candidate?",
        "I mean, are you voting issues?",
        "And a lot of times, that did not happen for people who so easily threw the word out and just assumed that because a white person did not vote for Obama then that person was not doing so purely on racial grounds, and that's totally not fair.",
        "And I do think there was some opposite to that, where people - you know, I think people did vote for him just because he was black.",

        "I mean, there were people who were voting on the issues, and it just so happened that it - that Obama was the candidate of choice.",
        "Do you think any Democratic candidate would have gotten 93 percent of the black vote, Dawn Turner Trice?",
        "I think that traditionally, any - Democratic candidates have gotten 89, 90 percent of the black vote.",
        "So three percentage points extra, maybe those were the people who voted purely along racial lines.",
        "I mean, truly that's not the case."
