        "You know, and I think when you place a moniker on a person such as they are racist, you know, and stuff like this, you have to be very careful because, you know, I'm looking from a black male perspective that maybe think that they're not as racist.",
        "Maybe it's just us, and we're over - sometimes black people, we're oversensitive to certain issues and certain things about us.",
        "And we have to be careful how we say that because that's a real mean thing to say that a person - it's hateful, is a racist, and you know.",
        "And as I got older, and you know, and I've grown up, and being - I come from America, and I just want to say that all white people are not like that.",
        "And I have been called racist because of my views, but I've grown on it to understand that that's not always true about people.",
        "It's interesting you raise that point, Anton.",
        "There's an email that we have right on that point from Jennifer(ph) in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
        "As a white teacher in a majority minority school, I've been accused of being a racist at least once a semester, always by African-American students.",
        "My Hispanic, Asian and mixed students have never called me a racist.",
        "I'm always offended, and it is hard for me to respond without anger.",
        "I simply look the person in the eye and try to think about their experiences and ask if I were, why would I teach in this school?",
        "After listening to how my students talk about each other and other adults, I believe anyone can be guilty of racism and that racism, of course, is taught in the home.",
        "But Dawn Turner Trice, young people especially can react without thinking quite so much.",
        "Absolutely, and I think that it's our responsibility, and I'm speaking as a parent, that we have to be able to - we have to teach this.",
        "I have older relatives who have said something things in the presence of my daughter, and I've had to - you know, I've had to confront that because it's not fair.",
        "And we leave this trail of - whether it's language or misperceptions, and kids, you know, pick up on that.",
        "Now, I totally agree with the teacher.",
        "The teacher, if you - I mean, it does say something, that she is teaching in a predominantly black school - and/or school district - and that she is - she cares about these kids.",
        "And when I think about that story, I'm reminded of what happened to Judge Charles Pickering, whom President Bush nominated to the U.S.",
        "Court of Appeals in 2001 -the case in which the Senate Democrats filibustered the nomination, and then a contingent worked hard to label him a racist.",
        "It turned out that if you looked beyond the surface accounts into the deeper - beyond the quotes that were bandied about at that time, that in the 1960s, Pickering had fought the KKK and put his family and himself in danger.",
        "And in 1981, he had defended a young black man charged of robbing a young white girl at knife point.",
        "And, I mean, that didn't make him popular in Mississippi.",
        "He had also - and this, for me, was the most telling thing, he had chosen, in the 1970s, to keep his children in public school while Mississippi parents were resisting integration and taking their kids out.",
        "And so, you know, we can espouse all sorts of noble philosophies when it comes to race, but there's nothing like getting our children involved.",
        "And here the proof is in the pudding, right?",
        "And so, that's what Judge Pickering did.",
        "And this is - I think that you have to look at the entire picture rather than the cherry-picked parts before you start throwing out the label of racist.",
        "And unfortunately, young kids aren't, you know, they aren't always able to do that.",
        "But clearly, we, as adults, aren't always able to do that as well.",
        "Do that.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "And I have no quibble with that.",
        "It is a racist statement because - I mean, that sentence makes her sound as though she's painting with one broad brush.",
        "And - but beyond that sentence, and this is within the same speech, she says that there is no one Latina experience and no one group speaks with one voice.",
        "And so, she allows that not all Latinas will come to the same conclusion and not all white guys are the same.",
        "So, the sentence is troubling, as Obama and others have said, but does that make her a racist?",
        "And that's the point that I tried to make with readers.",
        "It is a troubling statement, but does that one statement make her a racist?",
