        "Heller is part of a team that's been trying to understand precisely what happens to individual brain cells during this process.",
        "The team's latest research appears in the Journal of Neuroscience.",
        "It shows that soon after a ground squirrel begins hibernating, each brain cell actually gets smaller.",
        "It's like a big bush.",
        "And what we're seeing is we're seeing the extent of that bush being retracted.",
        "It's as if the bushy cells are pulling in their branches all over the brain.",
        "The structures that retract form connections with other nerve cells, and it's these connections that let us remember who we are and where to find food.",
        "So Heller says it's kind of amazing that most squirrel memories remain intact after hibernation.",
        "They clearly don't forget how to be a squirrel.",
        "There are important things that they don't forget.",
        "For example, they don't forget who their relatives are.",
        "Somehow, the squirrels are able to reassemble the vast network in their brains.",
        "That suggests the animals are carrying some sort of blueprint that brain cells can use to put everything back the way it was.",
        "It's still not clear how that happens.",
        "Even so, Heller says it raises a provocative question about humans with brain damage from a stroke or Alzheimer's.",
        "If there were a way to actually repair the loss of structure which results from disease or accident such as a stroke - if there's a way of repairing that, could we get the function back?",
        "That question won't be answered anytime soon.",
        "But it's one that intrigues doctors like Kai Frerichs.",
        "He's a neurosurgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.",
        "Frerichs says he's especially intrigued by evidence that the ground squirrel's brain has special protection only when the animal is hibernating.",
        "That gives hope that maybe there is something we can learn from this state that could be transferred to a non-hibernating species as well.",
        "Frerichs says you might be able to help people who've just had a stroke if you could induce a state similar to hibernation.",
        "He says right now, brain tissue begins to die almost immediately after a stroke."

        "We want to get to that place, but we are living in a very real situation where that is not acceptable, and in many ways stemming from this one-drop rule for Barack Obama to say, I'm mixed race, is him denying his blackness.",
