        "Well, I become a teacher.",
        "I teach them the history, the true history of the peoples of the United States of America and how we the people, you know, that was - the nation of we the people that was founded by the signers of the Declaration of Independence was supposed to be a white man's country.",
        "But minorities took the ideas and the principles of the Declaration of Independence and made them theirs, and they said we the people have to include us.",
        "But multiculturalism is this path toward grounding us in this reality of our diversity.",
        "Multiculturalism is not a fad, it's not going to go away, and multiculturalism is not political correctness.",
        "Multiculturalism is a serious effort to redefine who is an American.",
        "Well, Jen, some people think, though, that it's not their responsibility to educate others about race or ethnicity.",
        "Whose responsibility is it?",
        "It's all of ours.",
        "It really is.",
        "And one of the things that I have really been thinking a lot about is how, for the most part in this country, issues around race, issues around identity are left up to the people of color, or it's a situation where white folks are made to feel nervous about these conversations, made to feel like they don't know anything, they have nothing to contribute, and people of color are assumed to be the experts.",
        "And I think that there are a lot of false assumptions that come with that dichotomy.",
        "And one of the things that we're going to have to do is to put those aside and say, you know what?",
        "This is not going to get better unless we're all at the table together and where people are able to bring their experiences and where everyone is respected and valued.",
        "We don't have that now.",
        "And I think that's part of the reason why, like I said before, we're talking about race and identity in our own separate communities.",
        "What if I'm not interested in other people's communities or other people's cultures or other people's food or music, and I just want to be around people who look like me and think like me and talk like me?",
        "What about that?",
        "I mean, that's your prerogative.",
        "And I'm not - I personally am not going to do anything to force you out of that corner.",
        "I don't think that that's a realistic way to live, moving forward, just as we're talking about how this nation is becoming more and more diverse, but I understand why people might want to do that.",
        "There's a security in community, and there's a security in people like you, but I think what you miss then is realizing, guess what?",
        "There are other people like you in different communities, and you miss the richness of this country if you stay only with people who reflect exactly your experience.",
        "Ronald, let me ask you as we bring our conversation to a close, what has integration done to the concept of multiculturalism in terms of how young people, a younger generation, has come up with a completely different paradigm than older folks have, with regard to race and multiculturalism and diversity?",
        "Well, I think, integration now means an integration of our different cultures, where we can be, as individuals and as communities, more than our ethnic identities and our ethnic cultures, our specific ethnic identities and ethnic cultures.",
        "We can become multicultural.",
        "And this is the rich opportunity that America offers today in the 21st century.",
        "There's a lot of sharing that we can do with one another, but we have to remember that we are a diverse people and we all belong to one nation, we share a common citizenship.",
        "And that is the reason why we also have to interact with one another.",
        "It would seem that, because we're in a global economy and a global culture, that the old rules with regard to multiculturalism are being expanded and are evolving.",
        "Would you agree with that, Jen?",
        "I think that we're in the right direction, as Professor Takaki said before, but I still think we have a way to go.",
        "We're still holding on to things like the one drop rule, as he explained.",
        "We're still holding on to our old patterns.",
        "And one of the reasons why I'm so excited about Barack Obama is because I'm hoping that his mere presence and him bringing up issues around race will keep it on the table.",
        "I think that our country sort of perks up when something major happens around race and then have all of these conversations and stop and wait for the next huge event.",
        "And so we haven't really been building this momentum and I'm talking about, you know, a national conversation.",
        "I don't think we're building this momentum that we need in order to get to a better place and a little bit farther from this old way of talking about race and multiculturalism."

        "Well, that didn't happen but it's going to happen on this trip.",

        "There's the forum next week in Iowa, and an organizer of a group called Rural Votes is back in touch with reporters.",
        "That group actively supported Mr. Obama in the last election.",

        "And the fact is, whittling down the big Republican majorities in rural areas from past presidential elections is one important way that President Obama can hope to win next year.",
        "So, if politics and economics are so closely connected, can we expect to hear anything about new economic policy or jobs on this trip?",
        "Well, the president has said he plans to roll out new ideas to improve the economy and create jobs in the coming weeks, and I don't think anybody would be at all some of those new ideas came out over the next few days on this bus tour.",
