        "What do we know about this story?",
        "Well, this is a story, it's been around now for about a year, but there's more and more information that's coming steadily.",
        "It's about Africa's Gitmo, as its being called here.",
        "There are an estimated three, it's hard to tell how many, but at least three secret prisons in Ethiopia, could be some in other countries as well, that are being used by the U.S.",
        "as the sites of rendition.",
        "You know, being able to pick up suspects without any regard to human rights, you know, and cart them off to these hidden prisons, where often they could be tortured.",
        "There is really no sense of habeas corpus, any kind of rule of law here within these prisons.",
        "Markets in Greece were hammered after the country plunged itself into political turmoil by calling early elections next month.",
        "That's the bad news for Greece.",
        "But there is good news for the rest of Europe.",
        "Joanna Kakissis reports that this time around, the problems in Greece are not spreading to markets in the rest of the eurozone.",

        "There are reports of women, even children, being held in these secret centers.",
        "So it is worrisome, and I think the concern, really, is that with all the tension on the other Gitmo, the Guantanamo Bay, that there will be public pressure to close Guantanamo Bay, but these other secret prisons that are now being strewn around the world will continue to remain in force, and will be really a place of violence, of torture and of core violation of basic human rights of individuals."
