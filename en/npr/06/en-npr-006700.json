        "Well, the real nub of this issue here is that the Trump administration has been using the illegal entry statute to target asylum-seekers.",
        "More than a year ago now, it announced a zero tolerance policy, that the administration would prosecute all asylum-seekers under this illegal entry statute for having entered between ports of entry.",
        "And once this is applied to a family and a parent is going to be prosecuted under it, what we see happening is that the Trump administration then put the parents into proceedings that require them to be separated from their children.",

        "That's correct.",
        "The 1325 and 1326 prosecutions under illegal entry and reentry had been on the books for years.",
        "But the fact is the Trump administration has really used it now to target asylum-seekers.",
        "For years, we've seen the criminal justice system add more criminal laws and harsher penalties to the system, and we ended up with massively crowded jails and tax bills and horror stories of people being treated unfairly in the jails.",
        "Now that is exactly what's happening with prosecutions for illegal entry, which has criminalized thousands of people simply for not having legal status.",
        "And that happened under the Obama administration and prior administrations, and it's just now being applied to extreme levels by the Trump administration.",
        "If 1325 were eliminated, what would that mean?",
        "Would people crossing the border without papers get the equivalent of a traffic ticket?",
        "Like, what would happen if it became a civil penalty rather than a crime?",
        "Well, the important thing to recognize is that there do need to be consequences for violating the immigration laws, and it just depends on how it's going to be done.",
        "Almost all of the immigration statute is civil by nature, so that if you entered illegally, you could be put into immigration court removal proceedings.",
        "And then if those proceedings went through, you could be deported out of the country, and that would be the specific consequence, which is already obviously very severe.",
        "Your title is director of government relations.",
        "You're based in Washington, D.C.",
        "Do you see any real motion in Washington to actually repeal Section 1325 or would this have to be part of some broader comprehensive immigration package that seems out of reach of Congress?"

        "The ability of Greece, even in the worst-case scenario, to shake the financial market now is much more limited.",
        "One reason is that 80 percent of Greek sovereign debt is now owned not by Greece, but by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - the country's lenders.",
