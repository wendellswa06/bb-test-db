        "NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports.",
        "To understand why a growing number of states actually want to recognize a union to represent home health care workers, listen to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, talking about her state's Medicaid program for adults with disabilities.",
        "The home services program has about 28,000 home care aides, and these people are working in homes all over the state.",
        "There isn't a centralized workplace, and the goal for the state here is creating and retaining a professional group of home care aides to meet the needs of what is an ever-increasing population of older people with disabilities.",
        "And we need to do that in a cost-effective manner.",
        "Prior to the state recognizing the union in Illinois, turnover was huge, leaving large gaps in coverage for disabled adults.",
        "In the 10 years since unionization, though, wages have nearly doubled; from $7 to $13 an hour.",
        "Training and supervision has increased, and workers now have health insurance.",
        "It's not a surprise, then, that retention has greatly increased.",
        "What may surprise many is that the home care system is cheaper than nursing home care, with savings of $632 million, according to the state.",
        "Nobody has to join the union, but non-union members - and there are three, in this case - do have to pay the costs of negotiating and administering the contract.",
        "Under long-established labor law, when a majority of workers vote to approve a union, those who do not join cannot be forced to pay for political activities of the union.",
        "But if the union is accepted by the public employer - as the service employees union was in Illinois - non-union members still have to pay their fair share of the expenses of negotiating a contract.",
        "That's to prevent non-members from free riding on the due of members."

        "The state replies that the aides are trained and supervised by the state, paid twice a month by the state, and that the state can fire them.",
        "The objector's second claim is that the union is little more than a lobbying group.",
