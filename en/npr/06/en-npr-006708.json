        "Max made the drums a solo instrument truly.",
        "You know, that wasn't just part of the rhythm section or the ensemble, that it had, you know, an independent and a musical voice.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",

        "You know, he wasn't just beating the drums, like he'd say, you don't beat the drums you'd play them.",
        "And so you know, he was the proponent of playing the drums, of using the drums as a musical voice."

        "Maxwell Roach was born in Newland, North Carolina, in 1924.",
        "His parents moved to Brooklyn when he was a child.",
        "He started his drumming career playing gospel music in the churches where his mother sang.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "Lee, thanks for the call.",
        "Not--there was no physical violence.",
        "What happened this morning was that a few hundred police officers showed up at the gate of N'vei Dekalim which is the largest of Gaza's 21 Jewish settlements.",
        "There's about 500 families here.",
        "They showed up to serve evacuation orders to the families in N'vei Dekalim.",
        "The orders say as everyone here already knows, `It is now illegal for you to be in Gaza.",
        "And the army is going evacuate you by force over the next couple of weeks if you don't leave voluntarily.",
        "The gate to the settlement was blocked by several hundred, maybe even a thousand of the locals and of the hundreds of supporters who've come from all over Israel to back them up, and they prevented the police from entering the settlement.",
        "This lasted for a couple of hours on an extremely hot day.",
        "There was verbal abuse on the part of the residents but absolutely no physical violence whatsoever.",
        "A few hours after they showed up at the front gate of the settlement, the police kind of snuck in the back gate of N'vei Dekalim in an attempt to--just to get those evacuation orders to the settlers.",
        "The settlers immediately found out that they had come in the back door.",
        "The thousand people who had been at the front gate rushed to the back gate and basically stopped them from getting in the settlement from the other side.",
        "And the police, after a few hours of trying, by about 2:00 had folded up the evacuation orders and disappeared.",
        "Now I know you spent the day talking with some families as well.",
        "What are they doing today?",
        "Well, the truth is that people in N'vei Dekalim are packing.",
        "I'm sitting in a room right now of a family who's lived here for 20 years in this house, and the room is full of boxes, a cupboard here that's been taken apart, and a similar scene is repeated in a lot of the houses here at N'vei Dekalim.",
        "There are still people here at N'vei Dekalim and even more so at the hard-line ideological settlements in Gaza, settlements like Kfar Darom and Netzarim where people are still in denial about the withdrawal.",
        "Even as it is under way, they still believe that it's not going to happen and they still refuse to take any steps and acknowledge that it's going to happen.",
        "But here in N'vei Dekalim, which is a religious settlement, populated by ideological people, people are not in denial.",
        "People here are pragmatic and they understand that this is going to happen and people here are packing up.",
        "I did want to ask you, though, about that aspect of denial.",
        "There are those as you just mention who said this day would never come.",
        "Well, here it is.",
        "What are they doing?",
        "The day has not yet come as far as these people are concerned.",
        "The day will come when soldiers arrive to forcibly evict people from their houses and that day hasn't arrived.",
        "As of today, it's illegal to live in Gaza, and beginning on Wednesday morning, the army is going to be coming into the settlements in an order that no one knows yet.",
        "No one knows what are the first settlements out.",
        "They'll likely be--they'll come in and start to forcibly evict people who refuse to evacuate themselves voluntarily.",
        "When the soldiers show up at those settlements and knock on doors and say, `Leave your house or we're going to take you out by force,' that is when these people are going to have to deal with the denial they've been living in for the past 18 months over which we've seen this plan develop.",
        "But the situation is different here.",
        "Most of the people here are not going to leave voluntarily.",
        "Most of the people are packing up and they're waiting for the soldiers to knock on their door.",
        "They--my impression has been garnered over dozens of conversations with the people here that they won't be able to live with themselves afterwards if they don't wait until the last moment.",
        "And as far as they're concerned, the last moment is when the soldier knocks on the door.",
        "People here are not planning violent resistance.",
        "People suggested to me that soldiers will knock on the door and they would invite them in and offer them a cup of coffee, explain to them why they think this plan is such a terrible idea and maybe show them the house that they lived in before leaving without offering any resistance whatsoever."

        "Thank you.",
        "Good evening.",
        "In a sense, it was a decision taken by Ariel Sharon not as part of the, quote, \"\"road map\"\" per se but as a decision that Israel would take on its own, a unilateral decision.",
        "Now when he made the decision to do it, it was his way of saying, `Look, we're going to do something but it is not tied to the Palestinians.",
        "This is a time when Yasser Arafat was still alive.",
        "This is at a time when he was trying to say, `We don't have a partner.",
        "We're going to do something on our own.",
        "The fact is, however, it does create an opportunity for the Palestinians because if the Palestinians are able to govern themselves, fulfill their security obligations, demonstrate that they can handle things and they show that Gaza is an effective model, then it becomes for the world and for the Israeli public a model that could be applied to the West Bank.",
        "If they are not able to do that, then, in fact, you have the opposite image of chaos, violence and why would you take that model and apply it to the West Bank?",
        "Shibley Telhami, if this was done over the Palestinians' head, how do they respond to it?",
        "Well, first of all--I mean, there's no question I think whether or not just from Palestinian point of view or American point of view or Israeli point of view, if you look at it, you know, in a detached fashion, clearly a withdrawal through an agreement would have been better because it would have been something that's common interest on both sides and both publics would have seen it that way.",
        "The fact that it's unilateral clearly is not as good from the point of view of getting Palestinian support for it.",
        "Having said that, withdrawal is far better than no withdrawal.",
        "It's a good thing that it's happening.",
        "It is important.",
        "It is a--precedent setting.",
        "It does open up opportunities.",
        "At the same time, there really are expectations that could be problematic because clearly in this environment, Gaza is in a terrible shape, a terrible shape economically.",
        "It's been devastated over the past few years, a terrible shape politically, securitywise.",
        "The challenge is enormous, and it's going to put a lot of pressure on not only Abu Mazen but on all the Palestinian factions to find a way to maintain stability, create some more economic activities while at the same time working toward a broader peace.",
        "And I think the trouble with it being unilateral is that it didn't happen--it's not a consequence of something that Abu Mazen did; this is not an Abu Mazen success that he can tell the Palestinians `The Israelis withdrew because I was elected.",
        "Unfortunately, clearly, the militant groups are going to be claiming this as a success for them, and it puts even more political pressure on him as he's going to enter the elections that he just announced in January.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Those are the local elections in January.",
        "Let's get some listen...",

        "When we were at Camp David in the year 2000 and we were trying to resolve all the issues of the conflict--it seems a very long time ago now--there actually was a proposal at one point that Israeli settlers could remain in the West Bank and Gaza if they were prepared to remain under Palestinian rule.",
        "At that time, the Israeli side decided--they felt that would create too many complications, so they didn't favor it.",
        "And I don't think the issue of staying under Palestinian rule ever occurred to Sharon because, first of all, I think there was a feeling you that couldn't know for sure what would happen to them.",
        "There was no confidence that, in fact, that their security would be safeguarded.",
        "And there was a sense that if Israel was going to make a decision on Gaza, then it was going to be a unilateral decision in terms of not only getting out but not discussing it with the Palestinians.",
        "I think Shibley's point about Abu Mazen not getting credit for this is right.",
        "It would have been easier for him if, after Arafat was gone, there was more of a clear-cut negotiating process where Israel said, `We're getting out.",
        "Now we're going to work out the sequence, the terms, the timing, everything with you,' then it would have showed that negotiations actually were paying off.",
