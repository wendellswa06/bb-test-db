        "The pullout ranks as one of the most significant changes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1967.",
        "Tens of thousands of Israelis rallied in Jerusalem on Friday to protest the pullout.",

        "Well, I think that, in a sense, both sides benefit.",
        "Even though it wasn't negotiated, at least the potential is both sides do.",
        "First, in the case of the Palestinians, understand that Gaza has the greatest population density in the world, and the Israelis, to protect the settlements and the settlers, have controlled about 25 percent of the territory.",
        "So when the Israelis get out of that, that means you're opening up one-quarter of the territory of Gaza that has been off limits to Palestinians, and that's a major benefit just in terms of space.",
        "Also now that the greenhouses and the dairy farm have been bought for Palestinians, it'll be--the Palestinian Authority will own it, but it will probably lease it out to Palestinian business.",
        "This can provide additional employment which is desperately needed in Gaza, and it also reflects what are thriving businesses.",
        "So from a practical, psychological, physical standpoint, the Palestinians benefit.",
        "From an economic standpoint, they can also benefit.",
        "Israelis also benefit, though, because even though it's been very painful for the Israelis who have lived there, one of the issues that was raised that actually created a spur to getting out was not just the demographic question, which is important because of its trends, but also in places like Netzarim, you had 400 Israeli soldiers to protect 60 families there.",
        "There was an illogic of having large numbers of soldiers protecting small numbers of families.",
        "So from the standpoint of Israel's overall security posture, I think it's pretty clear that they're in a better position after being out of Gaza than they are while being in it.",
        "Shibley Telhami, who benefits?",
        "No question that both sides have some benefits out of this.",
        "I think you can argue that the Israelis certainly benefit a lot economically, militarily.",
        "Many Israelis felt that the Gaza settlements were a drain on Israel.",
        "Some even wished that they would negotiated away already in Oslo even though the Israelis, in principle, didn't want to make that concession early on as part of final settlement.",
        "And a lot of Israelis had felt that, you know, just to protect a little over 8,000 settlers, they were spending so much money and energy and lives.",
        "So they benefit, no question.",
        "I think the separation from both scenes would help them."

        "The Palestinians will have almost an end to the Israeli occupation.",

        "But they benefit in that way; they have a new opportunity.",
        "I think, unfortunately, a lot of other groups benefit.",
        "Hamas benefits.",
        "Hamas benefits because it does have an ability to claim that it forced Israel out.",
        "It does benefit because it now has really kind of a new competition opened up in Gaza in which the Palestinian Authority is weak and they have a chance to advance.",
        "What are the risks?",
        "And there are enormous risks, one of which is what I call the gap of expectations.",
        "I think each side is expecting this withdrawal to lead to something else, and I think that is going to become a problem as they both turn to their domestic politics in the months ahead.",
        "The Palestinians and the Israelis will be, in essence, trying to put their political house in order at home, and that's going to escalate the rhetorical game and make them take harder lines than in the past on final status issues at a time when there is a different interpretation of the timetable at least of when the negotiations will start over final status questions and what is the timetable of a Palestinian state if at all in the coming months.",
        "Here's a question.",
        "It's sort of about what happens next.",
        "This is from Walid Hasboon(ph): `Does Article 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention apply to the remaining settlements in the West Bank, which would mean all settlements and many other Israeli occupation practices are illegal?",
        "Moreover, does this engagement mean that Israel is now in compliance with Article 49 as related to Gaza?",
        "Dennis Ross.",
        "Well, with regard to Gaza, the Israelis will be out.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Israel will still be the, quote, \"\"occupying power\"\" in the West Bank, so the Geneva Convention would still apply there.",
        "And--well, what about the West Bank?",
        "If it's proved so difficult and so fractious, so divisive to the country of Israel to order these withdrawals from Gaza, which are presumably easier than some of the other more difficult areas in the West Bank, what does that say about the prospect of withdrawal from the West Bank?",
        "Well, again, let's put this in some perspective.",
        "Number one, there's no question that from the standpoint of the settlers, the settlers want to be raising the emotional cost of the withdrawal.",
        "I don't believe you're going to see violence; there could be some isolated episodes of it.",
        "I don't think you'll see violence because this is a citizen army on the Israeli side.",
        "Violence against the Israeli army will create a terrible backlash in the Israeli public against the settlers.",
        "So settler leaders don't want there to be violence.",
        "There may be younger people highly ideologically motivated who may see things a little differently, but for the most part, I don't think we'll see violence.",
        "So I think, number one, yes, the settlers want to create an emotional reality that makes it difficult to apply this precedent to the West Bank.",
        "On the other hand, I go back to where I started.",
        "The Israeli public will be watching; the whole world will be watching.",
        "If Palestinians are able to overcome their own differences, if the rivalry between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority and Fatah is something that can be somehow managed so that, in a sense, there's a common approach to what happens not only during the period of withdrawal but in the next couple of months so that, in fact, we see the calm preserved, we don't see violence erupt--if that's the case, then it seems to me that you begin to demonstrate that there's a model that does work.",
        "It's a model where the Palestinians, when they assume governance for themselves, they really do assume responsibility.",
        "Hmm.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now the real question--and Shibley was raising this--is management not only right now but over time.",
        "One of the things that has made me uneasy has been that the--what I call the security-for-access nexus.",

        "Now the crossing points, the passages, the practical links--all of these issues have partial agreements; there isn't one in which there is a fully understanding right now.",
        "And the problem that I see is that once the Israelis get out completely, when you begin to implement the arrangements, they're going to be implemented only after the Israelis are out.",
        "And at that point, I can tell you knowing something about them, they're all complicated.",
        "Well...",
        "Complicated arrangements never go simply, and the net effect of that is you will end up refining them after the Israelis are out, which means when there's a problem, the Israelis will put a squeeze on the access.",

        "If you're looking at it from the point of view of the Israelis, this was a unilateral withdrawal to minimize the number of attacks on Israel to bring about a level of relative security, to postpone final status issues.",
        "If, in fact, there is a withdrawal and Sharon manages to regain the upper hand in Likud, he's a popular man overall because he will have managed to pull this off, withdrawal from Gaza, increasing security and maintaining the support of the US, getting even Arab countries and, to some extent, the Palestinian Authority to indirectly cooperate with him in the withdrawal.",

        "So the question is not about what happens between now and the Israeli election in terms of permanent status; the question is: What is the political process that's going to be in the aftermath of the next Israeli election, and how do you build a bridge to that point so that everything doesn't fall apart in between when you have a crisis over the gap in expectations?",
        "I believe in the end, the Israeli public if they see that there's calm, they're going to understand that, `All right.",
