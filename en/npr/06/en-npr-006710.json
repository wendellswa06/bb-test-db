        "Yes.",
        "If we want to see from the international view, we think--I think, and my friends--that it will be good; not tomorrow, but in the process, we believe that it will be--it may be a good step forward to the future.",

        "I am US citizen, but my parents lived in Gaza in the '40s, so I do feel very bad for the Israelis that were evicted out of their--what they consider their homes, because the same thing happened to my parents in the 1940s when they're forced out of their land and they moved out of the country.",
        "My question is what's going to happen now to these settlements?",
        "My parents claim that they do have land in that area that belongs to them, and they have evidence, paperwork, that these lands belong to them.",
        "So what's going to happen to the settlements?",
        "Shibley Telhami, can you help us out?",
        "Well, first of all, you know, I'm not sure what areas the gentleman is talking about, because, of course, Israel really didn't control Gaza in '48.",
        "Gaza was occupied in the 1967 war.",
        "The caller may be talking about other Palestinian towns and areas that came under Israeli control after the 1948 war.",
        "The Gaza settlements were really not built--unlike many, for example, Israeli towns and neighborhoods that were built on old Arab neighborhoods in a variety of places in what is now Israel.",
        "In Gaza, actually, the settlements were not like that.",
        "They were not built on, you know, remnants of Palestinian towns, by and large.",
        "There are a lot of claims, obviously, for property.",
        "This is all now tied up into the negotiations and part of the final status agreement, which is the issue of the right of return and/or compensation to the refugees who left.",

        "Thank you.",

        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "And here are some of the headlines we're following here today at NPR News.",
        "The Congressional Budget Office is projecting this year's federal budget deficit will drop to $331 billion; that's 20 percent lower than last year's record of 412 billion and just below a White House estimate last month.",
        "And the recent London subway bombings have American cities thinking about how to better protect their own transit systems.",
        "Firefighters in Boston are complaining they've received almost no training in how to respond to an attack on that city's subway system.",
        "You can hear more on those stories and, of course, many more later today on \"\"All Things Considered\"\" from NPR News.",
        "Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, we'll decipher what we know of Iraq's draft constitution and the future government's relationships to the regions of Iraq and to the religions of its people.",
        "We'll also hear the latest from Baghdad in a few minutes; then maybe step back a little bit tomorrow when we know more about the constitution.",
        "But right now, we'll wrap up our conversation on the extraordinary day in the Middle East, the first day of the withdrawal from 21 Israeli settlements in Gaza and four on the northern West Bank.",
        "Our number, if you'd like to join us, is (800) 989-8255.",
        "Our e-mail address, totn@npr.org.",
        "Our guests are Dennis Ross, former special Middle East coordinator during the Clinton administration, now a counselor at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and Shibley Telhami, Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland and senior fellow at The Brookings Institution.",
        "And let's get an e-mail question in.",
        "This from Stuart: `Could you please ask your guests whether they think improving the economy of the Gaza Strip would help to reduce Palestinian tensions with Israel?",
        "Also, comment on some specific economic development proposals.",
        "I've heard about a shipping port in Gaza, expanding agricultural production and processing facilities, building more housing and institutional facilities, developing seaside tourism along the southern coast evacuated by Jewish settlers.",
        "Though he says he can't see anybody booking a family vacation on the Gaza Strip.",
        "Well, you never know.",
        "Shibley Telhami, what about those proposals?",
        "There's no question that the economic component is extremely important for bringing about stability and ultimately, I think, in helping create an environment that's suitable for negotiations.",
        "I could tell you that in public opinion surveys I've done in the Arab world broadly, that income is the single-most important predictor of attitudes.",
        "It is just extremely important.",
        "I think when you look at the devastation in Gaza, you know, we don't know exactly what the percentage of unemployment is, but it wouldn't be surprising if it's more than 50 percent.",
        "It is a circumstance that clearly is ripe for radicalism, for exploitation, and the Palestinian Authority is not going to be able to do it on its own.",
        "It requires enormous resources, and there should be a lot of projects.",
        "The Europeans have already agreed to put money on the table to help the Palestinian Authority after the withdrawal.",
        "They're going to have to implement that.",
        "There are a lot of NGOs.",
        "One of them I should mention, and out of self-interest, I'm on the board of this organization called the Education for Employment Foundation, which is a non-profit organization trying to start skill type schools in Gaza, undertaking the idea of being a partnership between American NGOs and Palestinian NGOs to create schools that would help people develop skills, because part of the problems that we see is people often have degrees that are not really particularly useful for the work environment; in this case, to provide cutting-edge kind of education that would help them get employment and partner with big corporations, local corporations, multinational corporations to employ them immediately after.",
        "This would be just a small enterprise, but there are a lot of different projects of this sort that are going to be needed to bring about some kind of economic stability in Gaza."

        "The people in Gaza, about two-thirds are living under $2 a day.",
        "If you want to transform the situation, create a sense of hope, demonstrate that life is changing for the better, and show that the Palestinian Authority is delivering it so that the authority of Abu Mazen goes up and the ability of groups like Hamas to challenge him, compete with him goes down, you have to change the reality on the ground, and it has to happen quickly.",
        "So far, the approach to providing assistance has been a very business as usual approach.",

        "They would be paid to do cleanup, but also to compress some of it so it could be used for building materials as it relates to some of infrastructure.",

        "But what if you were told that Lithuania was going to be your refuge, your safe haven after being displaced from your own home by years of war?",
        "But another one, a year ago when I was in Gaza, I heard from Palestinians at the time that they wanted the Israelis to destroy the houses, and there were three reasons at the time.",
        "The first was because Yasser Arafat was there, and they'd fear that only his cronies would benefit from it.",
        "Second, these are all single-family dwellings, and the structure of Israeli families in Gaza don't fit the structure of Palestinian families in Gaza, which are much larger.",
