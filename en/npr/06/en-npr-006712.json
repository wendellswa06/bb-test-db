        "What actually is happening here?",
        "Well, it's kind of fluid, and it's kind of confusing.",
        "I mean, clearly, the latest is John Bolton, once again, among the advisers, has talked him out of pulling the troops out too quickly.",
        "And Bolton says, unlike the president's assertions, ISIS is not defeated, so those U.S.",
        "troops have to stay and complete the collapse of the caliphate.",
        "And secondly, those American troops have to remain for a time to make sure the Kurdish rebels who are helping defeat ISIS are not attacked by Turkey.",
        "Turkey sees these rebels as aligned with Kurdish terrorists inside Turkey.",
        "And National Security Adviser John Bolton laid out the way ahead just yesterday when he was speaking in Israel.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We're going to be discussing the president's decision to withdraw, but to do so from northeast Syria in a way that makes sure that ISIS is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again, and to make sure that the defense of Israel and our other friends in the region is absolutely assured.",
        "So there's no sense from Bolton that those U.S.",
        "troops will leave anytime soon, or very soon, as the president said.",
        "And Bolton also said to make sure ISIS is, quote, \"\"defeated.\"\" The president has repeatedly said in tweets and on videos that ISIS already has been defeated."

        "There are lots of other paths.",
        "But still, musicians' confidence, self-confidence, can be very fragile.",

        "They collected the data.",
        "And then they kept it in a notebook, which DeLay actually kept on his desk.",
