        "So that ghostly figure pressing his hands up to his cheeks and screaming, there are 700 of those all over this tree.",
        "There are 700, yes.",
        "And it's really beautiful.",
        "Well, you know, it's funny, because when I think of Christmas, I don't necessarily think of \"\"The Scream.",

        "You think it's appropriate, actually, for sort of the pre-Christmas tension.",
        "I think so.",
        "I think so.",
        "But also, I think it's important also to underline more seriously that this was 150 years since Edward Munch was born.",
        "Aha, so it's the 150th anniversary of his birth.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And we have been celebrating Edvard Munch all over the world in 2013.",
        "Well, you have 700 of these \"\"Scream\"\" ornaments, Ambassador Aas.",
        "What do you do with them after the tree comes down?",
        "Well, we're taking down the tree in January.",
        "I think that we will give these 700 ornaments as gifts to colleagues and American interlocutors, I would say.",
        "Oh really?",
        "That's your sort of diplomatic outreach..."

        "And so yesterday there was an expectation that they may just come back and say, look, judge, you know we're deadlocked hopelessly, and there was no peep out of them.",
