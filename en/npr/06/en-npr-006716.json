        "What's the sense among court watchers or legal experts there?",
        "Did the government do a pretty good job in making its case?",
        "Well, you have a situation where the government did a fine job presenting its case.",
        "The case itself, though, is considered by many observers to be half-baked, and by that I mean there's an entrapment defense here.",
        "And almost the entire terrorism plot was concocted by the FBI, and it was delivered to this group, you know, by an infiltrator who is posing as an al-Qaida operative.",
        "Well, take us back now to the beginning.",
        "How did this all come about?",
        "What are they accused of?",
        "Well, these men are accused of plotting to blow up Chicago's Sears Tower and collaborating with al-Qaida to destroy federal buildings in Miami or other cities.",
        "The entire case is built on audio and video tapes that the FBI was able to use by infiltrating the group by using an FBI informant.",
        "And he more or less over time won the confidence of the Liberty City Seven, so-called because they're from a poor minority neighborhood called Liberty City in the Miami area.",
        "Now, the defense asserts that the informant actually entrapped them, isn't that right?",
        "Yes, and in fact there is a strong argument for that because the informant was promising them money, thousands of dollars to these struggling men, that were lead by an entrepreneurial construction owner whose business was not doing very well.",
        "And you know, he was involved in this because he was trying to get money out of the informant, and the informant kept dangling money in front of him.",
        "And so a line was crossed at some point, a criminal act was committed, and so that's the government's case.",
        "But these men, as a defense, said they have never any intention of carrying out such a criminal plot.",
        "And in fact, didn't it only go through the planning stage, it didn't get beyond that?",
        "And will that be a significant issue for the jury?",
        "Yeah, and in fact that is a significant issue because it never went past the planning stage.",
        "There were no terrorism blueprints found by the FBI, the group's warehouse in Liberty City.",
        "There were no weapons of mass destruction.",
        "There were no explosives.",
        "There were, you know, samurai swords and law books and Bibles and Korans found there.",
        "I mean, they really didn't have much of an operation going there, you know, to carry out this plot.",
        "If there is a hung jury, what happens next?",
        "Well, if there's a hung jury, the judge, you know, would declare a mistrial, and then the U.S.",
        "government - the Justice Department - would have to decide whether they want to retry the seven men.",
        "You know, if the past is any indication, the Justice Department would likely authorize retrying them.",
        "And if they are retried, then we start all over again before the same judge with the same cast of characters."
