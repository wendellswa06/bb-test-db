        "You can actually wire these things up wrong and they won't work.",

        "This past weekend, the police and the county held Easter egg hunts for kids with special needs.",
        "Besides the beeping eggs for visually impaired kids, they held a special hunt for kids with mobility challenges and another for children with sensory issues or autism.",
        "Steve Case has an 18-year-old son with autism.",
        "I know what it means when a family has to not do things because their kids are just a little bit different.",
        "So yeah, it's been kind of the driving force on my end, too, working with these special needs families.",
        "He said watching the hunts was one of the best days he'd had, and he wants to make them an annual event.",
        "With a recent storm making life difficult, people on the East Coast might be dreaming of a sunnier place, like Puerto Rico.",
        "But the island commonwealth is facing a storm of a different sort, a financial one, some $72 billion in debt.",
        "Today, there was a little good news for Puerto Rico.",
        "Its largest power utility reached a deal with lenders to keep it from defaulting on some debt, at least through February 12.",
        "Some had warned a default for the utility could have led to electricity blackouts for the island where 3.5 million people live.",
        "Despite the deal, the agency's future remains uncertain.",
        "Because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, the U.S.",
        "Congress plays a major role in the island's affairs, and lawmakers are divided about what to do.",
        "We wanted to know more, so we've called Rosario Rivera.",
        "She is an economist, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.",
        "And she joins us by phone from Caguas, Puerto Rico.",
        "Professor Rivera, thank you so much for speaking with us.",
        "Thanks to you for the invitation.",
        "So how did it get to this point?",
        "Can you explain that in a way that we can understand if we haven't been following this closely?",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, you started saying that this was a storm of financial proportions.",
        "Well, it all started with a storm of economic proportions.",
        "And this financial crisis is just an expression of a deeper crisis, which is the collapse of the economic structure since 2006 that we hit a recession.",
        "Let me ask you this, though.",
        "It's been reported that Puerto Rico has been using the debt that it owes on bonds to make it look as if it had a balanced budget for some time now.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, because there is a part in our constitution that requires that we must present a balanced budget every end of fiscal year.",
        "So if there is a deficit, you should cover it with either more taxes or cutting spending or issuing debt.",
        "So what have been happening in the past, maybe, 20 years is that we have been covering those deficits strictly with debt - strictly with debt.",
        "And it just hits us in the face that all the debt that we have accumulated is bigger than our capacity to raise taxes."

        "But how else are you seeing it play out for people who are living there who are staying?",
        "It's very difficult because the weight of the tax system is only on the shoulders of the working class, and that is a shrinking class.",
        "So it's very hard on us.",
        "The creditors point out that the government issued $120 million in Christmas bonuses in December to government employees while the island is missing other debt payments.",
        "Can you talk a little bit about that?",
        "We can no longer do those things because those are politically motivated decisions.",
        "OK?",
        "I have mixed feelings on that issue because $120 million on Christmas bonuses in a time where the economy is not moving - it might be of a little help.",
        "But still, $120 million that don't go into the economy - well, we don't have them either in the treasury department.",
        "So it's those kind of decisions that have brought us here.",
        "Here on the mainland, the Republicans in Congress seems to be inclined to ask the federal government to take over Puerto Rico's finances.",
        "The Democrats in Congress seem to be inclined to allow the commonwealth to restructure and shed some of the debt through bankruptcy, which the federal law currently prohibits.",
        "What would be the reaction to those various scenarios there in Puerto Rico?",
        "Do people - is either of those scenarios considered more appealing than the other?",
        "Well, the scenario of bankruptcy is considered more appealing to us because it might make us able to pay attention to the economy.",
        "The other scenario, it means the return to the relationship previously of the conception of the commonwealth and the new relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States.",
        "It would mean that we are not, basically, to be able to dictate public policy anymore.",
        "But right now, the situation is so, so stressed up that what we haven't had is either we restructure or either we default or either we just close government or just cut so drastically the public services that we are going to have a social crisis in Puerto Rico as we have never seen before.",
        "That's economist Rosario Rivera.",
        "She is a professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey, and she was kind enough to join us from Caguas, Puerto Rico.",

        "It was a strange.",

        "You could feel it, or actually not feel it, walking the upper concourse at beloved Kauffman Stadium.",
        "Sure, most fans wore Royals blue and some had T-shirts saying, party like it's 1985.",
        "But the party was hard to find.",
        "San Franciscan Chris Welch couldn't.",
        "He stood sipping a beer, wearing a Giants cap, a Grateful Dead T-shirt, orange Giants wristbands.",
        "He said he'd been treated well."

        "The Paralympics trace their origins to 1948, and a neurologist named Ludwig Gutman, who worked with disabled British soldiers at a hospital outside London in Stoke Mandeville.",
        "That's where today's torch relay began, and that's where we reached Paralympics historian, Ian Brittain.",
        "He says Dr. Gutman challenged the thinking of the time by using sports as treatment for people with spinal injuries.",
        "The medical practice, if you like, was they're not worth dealing with, we can't save them, they're going to die, just keep them as comfortable as you can until they do.",
        "And he totally went against that premise and started to introduce sport.",
        "And he started with easy things like skittles and darts, and eventually, the first major sport he introduced was archery, because, one, it was very, very good at strengthening the back muscles and giving the posture necessary for somebody who's going to be sitting in a wheelchair all day.",
        "And, secondly, it was a sport that people with disabilities could compete alongside their non-disabled counterparts.",
        "And the original games in 1948 featured how many athletes, how many events?",
        "It was only one event.",
        "It was an archery competition between eight archers from the Stoke Mandeville hospital, where the spinal injuries unit that Dr. Gutman ran was, and eight archers from the Star and Garter Home for Injured Veterans in Richmond upon Thames.",
        "It was actually held on the same day as the opening ceremony of the 14th Olympic Games in London.",
        "So it became associated with that in some way.",
        "Yes, and it is something that Gutman pushed on a regular basis.",
        "Interestingly, though, the next year there were two sports in 1949, they introduced wheelchair netball, which is now wheelchair basketball.",
        "And he had seven teams and 37 athletes there, and yet in his closing speech he actually had the temerity to say that one day he believed that these games would be the disabled equivalent of the Olympic Games, which is, you know, a quite a claim to make when you've only got 37 athletes there.",
        "But he was obviously proved right.",
        "He was prescient.",
        "I mean over the years it's gone on to include obviously not just soldiers but athletes from all countries of the world, and a whole range of disabilities.",
