        "And it began to occur to me that these tips could be wildly outdated and very inaccurate.",
        "Not only that, but so many of these things were sort of presented as having equal weight, which they certainly do not.",
        "So we put together a list, and a friend and I from Edmunds went to an area near Death Valley in California where there was a loop, which is about 55 miles.",
        "It's used by a lot of the car testing companies, and we knew we could drive there - you know, legally, of course - but almost any way we wanted to.",

        "And yet, all of those things, if they existed and worked, you know, would cost money.",
        "What we're talking about here, both Amy and I, are ways - free ways to save money.",
        "And we're talking about not just pennies but dollars.",
        "But you have to change your behavior, and your number one recommendation, I think, is the same as Amy's, aggression - aggressive driving versus moderate driving can save you a bundle.",
        "Yes, well, Amy talked about higher cruising speeds on the highway.",
        "What we actually talked about was something which involved more, sort of, urban pattern driving, which is we compared aggressive driving to moderate driving.",
        "Notice, I don't say slow.",
        "Nobody wants to drive slow, just moderate.",
        "And we found that between those two different driving styles, there was up to a 37 percent difference and an average difference under the four - over the four cars that we tested at 31 percent.",
        "So this far and a way was the biggest and the single most important thing to do first before you look any place else for savings.",
        "And on the highway, you agreed with Amy.",
        "If you've got cruise control, use it.",
        "Cruise control, we were surprised at how much that improved our fuel economy.",
        "What we found was up to 14 percent and with an average saving of seven percent.",
        "Additionally, I mean, you also have to figure the stress on the driver.",
        "You know, why not put it in cruise if you're on a long trip and listen to NPR?"

        "But this kind of falls under the heading of, you know, older cars used to have gas caps that were easy to drop on the ground, to have them fall off.",
        "Modern cars - for which we do a lot of driving -we drive all current cars - generally will have a tether connected to the gas cap.",
        "Furthermore, it instructs you very clearly to tighten the gas cap until it clicks at least, you know, three times.",
        "And if you don't do that, you're actually run a greater risk, which is that the check engine light will come on, and in some cases you need to go a dealership to have them reset that.",
        "So there's all kinds of reasons for tightening the gas cap.",

        "It's good, and it's good to do it, but in this particular case, the nitrogen thing seems a little bit more like a gimmick than anything else.",
        "So I don't think that it's worth spending a lot of money to do it, because anything you have to spend money on will have a payback period.",
