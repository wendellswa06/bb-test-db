        "So you can test to see if any of these has an effect on your gas mileage.",
        "Well, Neal, I kind of wanted to make a point, which is, most people have no idea what kind of fuel economy they should be getting.",
        "And if they went to a car Web site, they could find out what the EPA estimates their mileage should be, which is quite a bit inaccurate.",
        "If they look at the two numbers, of course, the highway and the city, they would actually be doing well if they got the city mileage.",
        "So if we'll say that if it's like 28 and 23, if they were able to get 23, they'd be doing pretty well because the EPA mileage is actually overly optimistic about what they could get.",
        "But at least, it will give them a benchmark so they could be begin to - have a more intelligent idea what is good and what is poor gas mileage.",

        "Different cars need different parts and pieces.",
        "So if your car -the platinum spark plug is usually for cars that they change the spark plugs every 60,000 mile versus every 30,000.",
        "So you don't want to be putting a platinum spark plug in a car that doesn't call for it.",
        "You have to remember that these cars were engineered with the different parts and pieces in it so that particular vehicle is going to run most efficiently.",
        "And if you go putting things in it that it didn't call for, you may again be doing damage.",
        "So I would suggest you talk to your mechanic about this and let his professional knowledge guide you if that's going to work for your car.",

        "I usually get 27 miles per gallon in this car, but I got 44.",
        "Wow.",
        "But since then - since then, I bought a hybrid, Honda hybrid, the little two-seat Insight.",

        "I bought the automatic, and it's rated for 57, but I get close to 60 miles on my lifetime.",
        "But I've since learned how to drive it, and I average 60 to 66 miles per gallon.",
        "That's a beautiful thing.",
        "That sounds great.",
        "I love it.",
        "I drive 6,000 miles a month.",
        "So - but it does suggest even the old '92 car, that if you drive it right, you can get awfully good gas mileage.",

        "They proved that driving with your windows down can have a substantial impact on increasing your miles per gallon.",
        "And, Philip Reed, I know this is something you tested.",
        "Yeah, we did - we did a similar test.",
        "And, of course, it kind of comes down to the speed at which you're driving.",
        "We tested it at highway speeds so we had the windows down and the air conditioner off, then the windows up and the air conditioner on.",
        "And we found that there was no measurable difference between these two things because two things: first of all, modern cars have more efficient air conditioning units.",
        "And secondly, modern cars are also more aerodynamic.",
        "So the two have kind of canceled themselves out, at least at highway speed.",
        "There was a major breakthrough in the construction of the diesel engine, which makes it clean and clean in all states.",
        "And it's interesting to note that in Europe, nearly 50 percent of the vehicles run on diesel.",
        "In this country, it's less than five percent.",

        "Good morning, David.",
        "We had one vehicle that also had a sunroof.",
        "And we opened the sunroof as well as all the windows.",
        "And then the fuel mileage did begin to go down, so that we knew that we were really measuring differences.",
        "But around town, if there's no aerodynamic effect, then having the air conditioner on will cut your fuel economy.",
        "So it's not something that you want to do, it may not be worth the price to everybody.",
        "And the difference will probably be two or three percent at the very most.",
        "And you may have to spend the difference in bottled water just to keep your hydration up, right?",
        "Yes.",

        "Can I ask you a question about the air conditioning?",
        "Did you do any tests about when you go up the hill?",
        "I've read that if you're using your air conditioning on a highway, if you turn it off when you're going up a steep hill, then you're going to get better fuel economy, and then you can turn it back on once you're done going up the hill.",
        "Well, this is quite true because I know on the way to Las Vegas, they have inclines that are 16 miles long.",
        "And they warn you to turn off your air conditioner, particularly if you're pulling a trailer.",
        "So there is a substantial - well, there is a measurable drag on the car's engine.",
        "But when you have these two factors kind of working against each other, aerodynamics versus air conditioning, they kind of cancel each other out, at least in modern cars, because modern cars are so much more aerodynamic than the things I grew up driving.",

        "And the brand is K&N air filter.",
        "And I went from 14.7 miles a gallon to 20.2 miles a gallon, just by changing out the filter.",
        "And I've done a few things to my truck.",
        "I've always kept tabs on the mileage.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, it's interesting because I was talking to some guys at Edmunds.",
        "There's this huge pool of knowledge there.",
        "And I said, are there any gizmos, anything that anybody knows about, and they actually named that air filter that this gentleman was talking about.",
        "We also got an email from Sarah in Lawrence, Kansas, about K&N's high flow air filter.",
        "And it makes sense to some degree.",
        "I know - I went to a seminar on turbo chargers, which is actually a fan that blows extra air into the engine.",
        "And they made the point which I thought was very interesting, which is that the car's fuel is not just gasoline.",
        "It's gasoline mixed with oxygen - or the air.",
        "So essentially, the more air and the freer flow of the air going into the engine, the better the engine will perform and then the fuel economy will improve.",
        "So now, this gentleman experienced a huge jump in fuel economy.",
        "That seemed very high, but, you know, it's good to hear that.",
        "It's nice to think that there might be something out there that could do that.",
        "And, Amy Mattinat, from what you've written, it might just be that - or at least part of it - from the fact that you put in a clean air filter."

        "The air filters get clogged with dust and dirt and bogs, and we've even had people come into the shop that had mouse nests in their air filter.",

        "It all depends on where you live.",
        "So you want to keep a good eye on that air filter because just changing that air filter makes a huge difference.",
