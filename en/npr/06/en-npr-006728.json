        "Diesel is, I think, one of the most overlooked technologies.",
        "Diesel got a bad rap in this country back in the '80s, and it virtually disappeared because states like mine, California, passed such strong air quality controls and - however, what people don't know is that there's going to be an enormous wave of diesels which will begin arriving perhaps as early as next year.",
        "So this could be a huge breakthrough.",
        "Not only that, but biodiesel, the production of biodiesel, makes a lot more sense even than E85.",

        "Automatic cars just shift better, and I don't think it's as much of an issue as it was, you know, back, say, 10, 15 years ago even.",
        "And Philip, I know that you make this point.",
        "Technology has improved a lot of things so that, you know, some of these things you learn from your father and your grandfather might not be so true anymore.",
        "That's absolutely right, particularly in the case of, for example, cars have gone from carbureted cars to fuel-injected cars.",
        "And the fuel injection system is so much more efficient than it was before.",
        "And one of the problems we almost never have - although maybe Amy will correct me if this isn't true in Vermont - but cold starting, I mean, when I was growing up driving cars in New England, you didn't know if the car was going to start or not, so naturally you didn't really want to shut it down if you were stopping briefly.",
        "But these days, they will start back up, so it makes a lot of sense to shut off your car if you don't need it and if you're not going anywhere.",

        "But it gets so cold up here.",
        "I mean, we're talking 10 to 30 below zero.",
        "So I have to admit, I'm still one of those people who runs out in the morning and starts their car, sticks on the defrost and runs back in and has a cup of tea before I go to work just so I can see where I'm going.",

        "I don't really have an answer for that one.",
        "I'd be curious, Phil, did you test that?",
        "We didn't, but we might put it on the list.",
        "But I was just talking to an engineer this morning who talked about when you have a flat object obstructing wind, it's actually much more - produces much more drag than we'll say like a box of a similar size.",
        "So there is a lot of drag behind it.",
        "So theoretically there is some validity to it; again, how much?",
        "I would just encourage you try it both ways and see what you get.",
        "Well, I have tried it, and I feel like there's less drag without the tailgate.",
        "I watch that show \"\"MythBusters,\"\" and they said it creates a vortex with the tailgate up, and that kind of gives it more of an aerodynamic flow of air.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "But I - it's noticeable to me when I take the tailgate off or lay it down that there's a noticeable reduction in drag."

        "I've estimated over a couple of tanks, and I believe it saves about 10 percent.",
        "It used to save me 15 percent when I had a car with standard transmission.",
        "We've already dealt with that, but Amy Mattinat, this is what you call seeing down the road.",
        "It is.",
