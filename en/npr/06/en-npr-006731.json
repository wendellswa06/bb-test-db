        "Most Americans aren't paying attention and about a third of the men and women who've served in the military since 9/11 don't think the wars were worth it.",
        "Those are just some results of a new survey by the Pew Research Center.",
        "As NPR's Tom Bowman explains, civilians and members of the military view war and service in very different ways.",
        "The Pew Center talked to nearly 4,000 people, split almost evenly between military veterans and civilians.",
        "Study editor Paul Taylor wanted to explore this unique moment in American history.",
        "We've never had sustained combat for a full decade, and we've never fought a war in which such a small share of the population has carried the fight.",
        "Just half of one percent of Americans have served on active duty during the last decade.",
        "Compare that to the nine percent who wore the uniform during World War II.",
        "Americans still hold the military in the highest regard.",
        "Signing up for the military is another matter.",
        "More than 80 percent of veterans would recommend a military career to a young person close to them.",
        "Among civilians, that number drops to about half that.",
        "Civilians are much more ambivalent about military service.",
        "Again, Paul Taylor of the Pew Center.",
        "They recognize that there are burdens borne and, frankly, they don't necessarily want their kith and kin and folks close to them to bear those burdens.",
        "Should the American people be troubled by that?",
        "Is the military becoming a separate part of American society?",
        "There is a gap.",
        "Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is, in effect, frankly, above my pay grade.",
        "It's an interesting question.",

        "They gave me back my passport, but by that time, I had forged my voice, and I knew what I wanted to do with my life as a writer.",

        "And the grandfather, who sees himself as coming to the end, is trying to get back that innocence.",
        "Well, I think I suppose I encumbered the character in my play who has vastly more pseudo-knowledge than I have, in order to make my point finally that in the course of acquiring all this so-called knowledge, I've lost something.",
        "I've lost contact with something that I had.",
