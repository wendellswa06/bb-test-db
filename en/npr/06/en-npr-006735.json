        "Yes, you're there.",
        "Thanks for having me on the show.",
        "Hey, it's our pleasure.",
        "As somebody who teaches creative writing, you probably bristle a little bit when asked if - people ask if creative writing can be taught.",
        "Well, it's a sort of odd question to be asked.",
        "I mean it's like asking a used car salesman: Would anyone actually want to buy something with over 10,000 miles on it and why have you been trying to sell them for 20 years?",
        "I do think that certain things can certainly be taught.",
        "You can teach students how to line edit their work, how to revise their work.",
        "I think when people ask that question, in the back of their minds they're thinking can you take someone with essentially no talent and put that person through a writing program and turn out a novelist at the other end.",
        "I think the sad answer to that question is probably not, but I also think that writing has to be learnt.",
        "I mean it may not be teachable, but it certainly has to be learnt.",
        "Nobody just hops out of the cradle or graduates from nursery school and sits down and writes War and Peace.",
        "So the question then is where are you going to learn to write and how are you going to learn to write.",
        "And what I have always believed and what I say in the book is the best place to learn to write is from great writers.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And you point out in your book that indeed great writers were always the classroom for the next generation.",
        "Well, it was certainly my classroom.",
        "I mean I don't in fact have an MFA.",
        "I often feel underqualified to teach in an MFA program, but I was a big reader when I was a kid and a reader - I've been a reader, a passionate reader, my whole life.",
        "And I feel like my education as a writer is ongoing.",
        "I mean when I have a problem in my work, by now I've read enough so that I know which particular writer I can go to for help with a certain difficulty I myself have been having.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I wonder - you mention in your book Harry Crews, the famous novelist, who described taking apart a Graham Greene novel to see how many chapters it contained, how much time it covered, how Greene handled the pacing, tone, and point of view.",
        "Is that sort of thing useful, do you think?"

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And you can do it with great novels and not-so-great novels.",
        "I mean I've always thought one of the novels I would like to teach is The Godfather, because it's a remarkably well plotted novel.",
        "I mean it's certainly not a great novel, but Mario Puzo could set a scene and make a plot, develop a plot, and create characters, so all of those novels.",
        "And if you sit down and - I mean I use the expression reading carnivorously...",
        "Hmm.",
        "...and just look at what you can learn, what you can borrow, what you can steal, really, I think that's the way to learn how to write.",
        "Other people have encountered the same problems you're encountering and figured ways around them.",
        "Well, yeah, and I also think - I mean this sounds like a sort of slightly nutty thing to say - but I also think that certain books just kind of pop into your hands at the moment you need to write - to read them.",

        "And a friend gave me a copy of a story by Leonard Michaels that's in theory written - narrated from the point of a view of a adolescent boy but actually is full of adult consciousness.",

        "Well, it's almost enough to make a believer out of you.",

        "But it also happens when I'm teaching.",
        "I mean I love to teach literature classes.",
        "I'm teaching a - three literature classes right now actually.",
        "And every time I teach certain stories - I mean, for example, James Joyce's The Dead, which I talk about in the book as the perfect story to go to if, for example, you want to write a party scene, which party scenes are very difficult to write.",
        "There are all these characters.",
        "They're all talking at the same time.",
        "They're all in the same room.",
        "And you have a party scene, and you can't think how to do it.",
        "You go and you read James Joyce's The Dead, and there's the most brilliant example of the party scene that's ever been written, and I think you can get a little closer to being able to do it afterwards.",
        "Every time I teach The Dead I learn something from it that I didn't know before, or I see something in it that I hadn't seen before.",
        "Well, some of us might find James Joyce a little intimidating and go instead to, well, EM Forster or even Strunk & White for some advice.",
        "Strunk & White is good.",
        "Strunk & White is good.",
        "I mean, you know, The Elements of Style, there's, as I mentioned in the book, there's that marvelous new edition illustrated by Maira Kalman...",
