        "And that whenever I have any questions, instead of going to a how-to book that I had from a class, I always just turn to Catch-22 or East of Eden, which are some of my favorite - two of my favorite novels, and that always seems to help more.",
        "And that's what I try and direct anybody who asks me about my writing, how do I better myself.",

        "For me one of the fun things about writing the book was getting just a quote from all these different writers.",
        "I mean at the end of the book there's a list of books to read immediately, and I hadn't actually written a list.",
        "I mean I wrote the book, and then a young writer helped me just extract the list from the books I mentioned.",
        "And someone told me there were 117 books on the list, hugely varied.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So I think if you start reading your way through the list, you'll get a lot closer to being able to write.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And it really helps with diction as well, which helps to make your writing more mature.",
        "When you read more, you learn a lot more words and a lot better sentence structure and it helps to develop your own style.",
        "Hmm.",
        "When you go back, you said, Ryan, to these books over and over again, do you find new things in them?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean the best thing that I found to do is to reread your favorite novels, because you're so entertained the first time you read it, you find something new each time you go and you're able to study it more in detail.",
        "And you do end up catching a lot of wonderful things, and sometimes it's things that you like, and sometimes it's things that kind of ruined it - ruin the book for you as well.",
        "But, yes, I always refer back to them and find new things and new ideas.",
        "And I wonder, as - to interview people who write books, I often read with a pen in my hand.",
        "I always read with a pen in my hand - underline things, write notes.",
        "Do you do that, too, Ryan?",
        "Yes, yes, I do.",
        "Writing notes is - I do horribly in class writing notes, but while I'm reading I do; I mark up my books like crazy.",
        "Francine Prose, do you too?"

        "So the fact that they're worried may actually be a good sign, and every writer I know - I mean there's a wonderful phrase of William Burroughs, and he talks about the temptation to take your work and tear it up into tiny little pieces and throw it in somebody else's wastepaper basket."
