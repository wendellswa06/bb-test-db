        "Sure, no problem.",
        "I am an aspiring writer myself.",
        "I am - I have written a lot of short stories in the science fiction/fantasy genre, and my problem is this.",
        "I've got a few really good ideas for novel-length works, but I mean I'm finding the transition from writing short stories to writing something longer just increasably(ph) difficult.",
        "With a short story, you know, it's something short enough you can just pound it out, you know, at a sitting or two.",
        "But I'm finding that a novel takes much more organization, and I'm just lost.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I was wondering if your guest had any thoughts about that.",
        "Well, I suppose my question would be why you think you have to write a novel?",
        "I mean there are many great writers - Alice Munro, Grace Paley, Deborah Eisenberg who are - Chekhov - who are short story writers and never have written novels.",
        "And it may be that that's your genre, and then just be happy with it and celebrate it.",
        "Well, I've got a couple of really good ideas, though, that really - I don't know, the short story, you know, as such really doesn't give room to do what I really want to do.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, you know, write one line and then write another and then another.",
        "I mean I know many writers who use outlines and who know what's going to happen.",
        "I myself am not that kind of writer.",
        "I start writing and I just keep going.",
        "So try it that way, I mean, and don't worry too much.",
        "You know, it's like driving with really bad headlights.",
        "You know, you can see about six inches in front of your car, and you just try and keep going.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Samuel Fuller, who was a novelist as well as movie director, used to write up these big storyboards, not necessarily with ideas, but he would have this different - the sequence of scenes in different colors: red for a romantic scene, blue for an action sequence - and try to vary his pace that way.",
        "It worked for him.",
        "Do you think that might work for other people, Francine Prose?",
        "Well, everybody has such a different way of working.",
        "I remember when the writer/novelist Leslie Marmon Silko was working on her marvelous novel, The Almanac of the Dead, and she would get these little bits of scenes and little sort of visions and little images.",
        "And she would refer to them as transmissions, and she would just write them down.",
        "They were disconnected.",
        "When she had 1,500 pages of transmissions, she started writing the novel."

        "And I'm curious - I'm writing it in the first person, and I keep struggling with first person versus third person.",
        "And I'm curious if you have any advice or if you can recommend any books, especially historical fiction, that have been successfully written in the first person, or maybe some potential pitfalls of either voice.",
        "Historical fiction in the first person - I mean my mind is now going blank.",
        "I mean there are great first-person writers.",
        "You know, I mean I would often look at the most unlikely choices.",
        "I mean, read Beckett, for example, who was a great first-person writer; or Proust wrote marvelously in the first person.",
        "I mean it doesn't have to be historical fiction, but just look at sort of how that voice develops and how a person constructs that kind of narrative.",
        "And often the writers you learn from are the ones you're least likely to think you're going to get anything from.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "It's a rebellion that takes place against the British, and it's simultaneous with sort of a rebellion within a marriage.",

        "My question is where's the key to the clubhouse?",

        "The magic clubhouse that, once you're published, you get into as an author.",
        "But until you're published, they hide it.",
        "I've been told by several published authors that my writing is publishable quality, and so where I'm at is I need editing then that is at that level.",

        "And I realize that a lot of times people find out you're a writer, they walk and they say, oh, I have this book.",

        "So I understand there's that problem.",
        "But for someone like me who really, you know, that's what I need probably to push me over the final hurdle; it's very frustrating.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, you know, the thing about editing your work is that once - I mean you don't really need someone to edit an entire novel.",
        "Once someone shows you how to do a page or two, what line editing is like, how you change a sentence, how you revise, how you cut extra words, how you get rid of what you don't need, you can take those lessons and apply it to the rest of the book.",
        "So it might be intimidating, for example, to ask your best friend to edit your novel.",
        "But it might be worthwhile to take a weekend writing workshop or a week-long summer workshop and get a teacher and just say show me with 10 pages, show me what to do with the first 10 pages.",
        "And I think after that you can take those lessons and apply it to the novel and it'll be much, much better.",
        "It's - I think that you also asked a two-part question, and that is about publishing.",
        "And that, boy, I wish I had more advice for you.",
        "But, you know, when I first started publishing in pre-history - it was 1973, and it was a whole different world.",
        "I mean publishers weren't owned by corporations, and editors could make decisions on their own and marketing wasn't such an issue.",
        "So it really is a brave or something new world of publishing.",
        "And I no longer know what to tell young writers about how to get into that world.",
        "Well, I've done the workshops when I can.",
        "And I just went to our local Pacific Northwest - I live in the Pacific Northwest - we had a conference here, and I've had some really good friends who've taught me a lot about line editing.",
        "It just - sometimes it just seems like the publishing world is so incestuous.",
        "Unless you know somebody who knows somebody who's willing to speak up for you, you really don't have a chance of getting the foot in the door.",
        "So it's probably just a matter of - what is it, Seuss was turned down 24 times, and so I'll keep plugging away.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "I think William Kennedy's first novel was turned down many, many times and it finally got published.",
        "I mean you can only take heart and keep writing.",
        "I mean there's just nothing to do but just keep writing and keep that faith, however you can do it, to just keep on going.",
