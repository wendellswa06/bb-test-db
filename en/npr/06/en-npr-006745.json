        "Amongst orthodox Jews between 18 and 40, it was 79 percent.",
        "Those people will largely take over the leadership of groups like AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Congress.",
        "It will move these organizations further to the right more and more to a position in which they support Israel, right or wrong, as a Jewish state not because of its liberal democratic value.",
        "And that will further alienate the large majority of fairly secular, liberal-minded American Jews.",
        "Alan Dershowitz, you just got back from a trip to the Middle East, where you met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
        "Is there a serious concern there over the future of U.S.-Israel relations?",
        "There is, of course.",
        "I think Benjamin Netanyahu feels that he has enormous support in Congress and enormous support among the American public.",
        "He frequently cites polls that show that support for Israel is actually going up, while going down among some liberal Jews.",
        "Now, I think one of the reasons it's going down among liberal Jews is not that Israel is not as liberal; it's that the liberals and particularly the left radicals on college campuses have excluded Israel from the discussion and made it into a pariah state.",
        "This is NPR News.",
        "Peter Beinart, have you been surprised by the reaction to your article -Leon Wieseltier, for example, in the New Republic - that publication that you used to edit - called it an example of faux courage.",
        "The head of the Anti-Defamation League, Abe Foxman, who we invited to be on this program with you, but he wasn't able to do so, has also lashed out at you.",
        "Are you surprised?",
        "What struck me about the piece is actually how much the intellectual debate has moved, how commonplace criticism, including harsh criticism, has become in the United States particularly in the blogosphere.",
        "To some degree, I think that's very good.",
        "To some degree, I actually worry that we are moving towards a situation in which the bi-national state position.",
        "The position that there can be no two-state solution, but there should be one bi-national state between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River is picking up steam.",
        "And it has made me even more concern that unless the major Jewish organizations define Zionism more broadly so that it includes the kind of critical Zionism, the passionately critical Zionism that Alan Dershowitz had advocated that, in fact, we will find ourselves stuck between an uncritical Zionism and the increasing non-Zionism of a one-state solution.",
        "That's Peter Beinart.",
        "He is the author of the article, \"\"The Failure of the American Jewish Establishment.\"\" You can find it in the June 10th issue of the New York Review of Books.",
        "We also spoke with Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz."

        "Now, if it seems like our current crop of representatives are more prone to scandal and corruption, well, they've got nothing on the men and they were mainly men who served in Congress in the old days.",
