        "They might gain a point or two on the achievement tests that we work with, or they might lose a point or two.",
        "But they're not making progress.",
        "And Karl Alexander noted it led to unequal outcomes later.",
        "Only about 4 percent of the children from lower-income households - we call them the urban disadvantaged - only about 4 percent of those youngsters finished college, baccalaureate degree.",
        "Alexander says that kids from better-off families don't lose so much learning over the summer.",
        "Their experience is just altogether different in this respect from the poorer children.",
        "They continue to improve their skills over the summer months, and it shows up tangibly in their test scores at the beginning of the new school year.",
        "You said that the lower-income children had gained maybe a point in achievement over the summer.",
        "What about higher-income kids?",
        "Were you able to measure that as well?",
        "What we find is that the higher-income children, on average, improved their skills to the extent of 45 points cumulatively, over the elementary school summers.",
        "Lower-income children are basically flat, zero.",
        "And it turns out that that 45-point differential in reading comprehension captures almost the entirety of the increase in the achievement gap across social lines, from first grade through fifth grade.",
        "So lower-income children are falling behind; there's no question about that.",
        "But they're falling behind over the summer months.",
        "In your study, you compared lower-income students who dropped out of high school, and middle-class students who continued into college.",
        "What did you find?",
        "What we find is that the difference in their achievement scores as ninth-graders, in the first year of high school, it's a very large - it's about a five-grade differential.",
        "And two-thirds of that difference as ninth-graders traces back to their differences in summer learning patterns over the elementary school years.",
        "Two-thirds - that's really quite extraordinary."

        "What we encourage, and the best schools do, is not only add extra core academic support time but much more enrichment opportunities for students.",
        "So students are getting more arts, more physical education, more hands-on learning opportunities - a whole array of music and diversity of programming that is really engaging them, building a love for learning.",
        "And that's what you need; you need the combination.",
        "Because the fact is, children without resources are competing with those who have them.",
