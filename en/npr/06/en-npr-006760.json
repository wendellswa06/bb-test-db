        "I mean, you're talking about people who even at the end of the day are still overweight.",
        "Maratos said she'd be more impressed if patients on Rimonabant lost 24 pounds at the end of two years on the drug instead of 12 pounds after one year, but earlier studies indicate that people taking Rimonabant for two years merely maintain their first year weight loss.",
        "They don't continue to lose.",
        "Maratos also worries that 2 or 3 percent of people taking Rimonabant suffer depression and she points out that patient demand for a new weight loss drug will be enormous, especially if it's touted as doing other good things.",
        "So you have to balance the effectiveness of the drug with patient-induced demand in the community with the potential long-term side effects of the drug with the fact that even a study of a thousand or 2,000 patients for five years wouldn't tell you what's going to happen when the drug is released into the community and potentially there are 20 million people taking it.",

        "In the 1990s, as a member of a commission on women in the military under the first President Bush, she fought against allowing women to fly combat aircraft.",
        "And now, she believes the rules pertaining to ground combat are not being followed.",
        "They are being circumvented, they're being deliberately broken, they're being redefined without authorization by the secretary of defense and without the required notice to Congress."

        "If that co-located soldier is a female soldier, no matter how brave and courageous she is, no matter how hard she tries, she would not be able to evacuate that soldier on her back because that's the only way you can do it in combat under fire.",

        "Women may not be assigned to units that have a mission of direct ground combat.",
        "So that's roughly equivalent to saying women may not be assigned to infantry units.",
        "We think that's probably the way the nation would prefer it.",
        "And while women have extraordinary capabilities, and they certainly spend an extraordinary amount of their time in difficult situations and often in harm's way, they are not deliberately and systematically assigned to units that would be involved in an attack.",
        "But there's - in speaking to women who've actually served and looking at their experiences, it seems that the regulation is out of step with experience of women on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "I mean, there are cases where women were actually going into homes in direct combat situations."

        "But then when the question is posed to the group how is the first in determined, and even if it were determined on a rotating basis, do women participating in the rotation, the answer is no. Because the policy is clear enough about what we intend, so that those who are operating understand, even in ambiguous situations, that they would not place the woman first through the door.",
