        "It's precisely for these reasons that the commanding officers who set up this barracks say it's the best place for wounded Marines to stay while recuperating, better even than home, where a Marine suddenly cut off from his unit and facing an uncertain future is liable to feel extremely isolated.",

        "LINDSEY PAGE: The summer was a particularly tumultuous time for kids from low income backgrounds.",
        "Upwards of 20 percent of kids who at the time of high school graduation say that they're continuing onto college, about 20 percent of those kids don't actually show up in the fall.",
        "So the melt that we're talking about here, one in five kids they're saying who get into college in the spring actually decide for some reason not to go.",
        "Yes.",
        "So that's one in five on average.",
        "Page and Castleman are using data from a national survey as well as a smaller study that is focusing on Boston.",
        "They're finding a number of things.",
        "So the rate of summer melt varies a lot among kids; it's more likely among students who have weaker grades, more likely among low-income students, and it's most likely among students who are going to community colleges rather than to elite schools.",
        "In fact, for those kids, the rate of summer melt is even higher.",
        "Here's what Page told me.",
        "For kids who are intending to enroll in community colleges, the rates of what we're calling summer melt are particularly high.",
        "So a few moments ago, I quoted a rate of about 20 percent overall.",
        "When we look specifically at kids who indicate intentions to enroll in a community college, the rate of summer melt is more like 40 percent.",
        "So low-income students - students going to community college - these are the kids who are not taking that final step.",
        "Why not?",
        "Page and Castleman think it's probably a variety of factors.",
        "These kids often may not have role models, they may not have resources.",
        "Some of them may be the first in their families to be going to college.",
        "Many of these kids don't have peers who are going to college, and it's tough to be making plans to leave home when your girlfriend or your boyfriend is staying back home.",
        "Are all staying behind.",
        "Right.",
        "And there are a lot of things that students who are heading to college me to do over the summer - they need to finish paperwork, they need to handle financial aid, and students from low-income families seem to have a harder time navigating those challenges."

        "OK.",
        "Some of those problems seem hard to actually confront.",

        "So high schools often don't see kids as being their responsibility and the colleges don't see these kids as being their responsibility as yet.",
        "Now in fairness, both these institutions are trying to bridge the gap, and at Fulton County, Georgia researchers actually ran an experiment one summer.",
        "High school counselors typically work, you know, a nine or 10 months schedule.",
        "These schools brought the counselors back over the summer to reach out to the students who are heading to college.",
        "And what they found was that the kids from low-income families took up his offer in droves and not only that, it drove down the rate of summer melt by 8 percentage points.",
        "So instead of a 40 percent summer melt rate, you might be talking about a close to 30 percent summer melt rate, and that's huge.",
        "OK.",
