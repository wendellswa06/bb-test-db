        "I think it's horrible for the caucuses and I think it's very damaging for the future of the Iowa caucuses.",
        "But maybe in the future a little less hype about the caucuses wouldn't be such a bad thing, says Dennis Goldford of Iowa's Drake University.",
        "Given the fact that the caucuses have become such a media event and bear more political weight than they really should, it's probably about time that this happened to the caucuses.",
        "So while Iowa may have an asterisk this year, come 2016, candidates will likely troop back out to the state's pizza joints and pancake breakfasts, armed with the knowledge that in Iowa anything can happen.",

        "It's a 500-page report that lists, sort of in detail, the abuses that took place here in Bahrain during and after the protests: detentions; torture inside of detentions - you know, people being beaten with rubber hoses, sleep-deprived, insulted, threatened with rape; people who got fired from their jobs in the thousands - people who opposed the government; houses of worship that were torn down, you know, as a way of what they called collective punishment for anyone who opposed the government.",
        "And then what it did was, it issued a lot of recommendations for the government of Bahrain to try to reconcile what's happened.",
        "There was fear of a whitewash, I guess, because the government had commissioned this, but it doesn't sound like it was.",
        "Now, what were the reactions to this?",

        "He kind of maintained that, you know, these abuses were committed by, you know, a handful of bad apples, and were mainly the responsibility of outside interlopers like Iran.",
        "But you have opposition groups who are actually pretty happy with how detailed the report was.",
        "What they said they wish they could have seen was a more, you know, naming names - you know, who was responsible for this abuse - because what they say is that if you don't do that, it basically gives security forces license to continue.",
        "And that's actually what we saw yesterday, in a small village in Bahrain that's known to oppose the government.",
        "A man died under questionable circumstances.",
