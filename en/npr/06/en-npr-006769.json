        "Now, he followed it up about an hour later with that speech that we just heard to the troops.",
        "It's not really a speech.",
        "It was kind of a 10-minute thank you for their service, where he fell back on his usual position, which is those decisions about troop levels will be based on what the commanders on the ground tell him.",
        "But still, he seemed to be sending a signal that they're looking for ways to be able to say, okay, things are doing well enough in Anbar province, so we can start lowering the number of troops.",
        "And the president has been talking a lot about Anbar province, calling it an example of the success that he would like to see all over Iraq.",

        "This is a place that was known as kind of a hotbed for al-Qaida fighters.",
        "And the president likes to note that a year ago, a lot of people were saying Anbar is lost.",
        "But a troop surge actually started here earlier than this summer's troop surge in Baghdad and in other places across the country.",
        "And the Sunni leadership, as the White House puts it, made a calculation that it is worth standing up to al-Qaida and fighting with the Americans against al-Qaida.",
        "As a result, the number of al-Qaida attacks have fallen, daily al-Qaida attacks have fallen drastically here.",
        "But again, you do have an extra 4,000 troops here.",
        "You know, it's interesting that the president did not go to Baghdad at all.",
        "So when he met with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, it was up to the prime minister to get to Anbar to meet with Pres.",
        "Bush.",
        "That's right.",
        "Maliki, of course, Shia coming to Sunni territory.",
        "And the president had a series of meetings.",
        "First, he met with General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker.",
        "Then he met with some of the Iraqi national leaders, certainly Prime Minister Maliki in that lunch.",
        "Then he met with Sunni tribal leaders.",
        "Finally, he had a meeting where Maliki was at the table and those tribal leaders.",
        "And you could see the president trying to push them together.",
        "Telling Maliki that the Sunnis are taking steps, you need to take some more steps.",
        "So it was a very overt attempt at helping the reconciliation process here by the president.",

        "You know, this is what a crackdown does.",
        "If you arrest thousands of people, fire thousands of people, detain them, torture them, no matter what kind of a report you issue or apology you issue later, you know, it's pretty clear to people that going out in mass numbers is going to end up very badly.",
        "And so you're not - probably not going to see mass protests in Bahrain again.",
