        "Educating our legislators about HIV.",
        "And also letting them know that, yes, there are - there is sex going on in prisons.",
        "We have a hard time here in this state convincing our legislators that people are actually having sex in prison.",
        "You know, you're a reverend and you approach this issue of HIV from a faith-based perspective.",
        "So some people say, you know, homosexuality is a sin.",
        "That may not be applicable to the cases of rape, but some people may feel, hey, consensual sex, they get what they deserve.",
        "I'm just saying things that other people are saying.",
        "And does that - do you think there's prejudice in the way people are treating this issue?",
        "Well, it could be.",
        "But my position, I'm a minister true enough, but I think I'm a little different type of minister.",
        "I - even working with the churches - I just think that churches and other people, we've demonized sex in such a way to make people think that people can't have sex, are not having sex, and it's a certain group of people.",
        "And it's not any of that to me.",
        "It's more of people being unprotected in this hour.",
        "I'm not concerned about who people sleep with.",
        "It's not my business.",
        "But what I am concerned about more than anything else is that condoms is available for people to be safe.",
        "Let's talk about that availability.",
        "I understand that the state of Illinois has been resistant to your efforts.",
        "So what have your conversations been, or what's your approach to advocacy?",
        "Well, my approach now, I - in our state, I have to admit that in IDLC here, we're working toward educating the people and not condemning even those that don't really understand.",
        "So I'd rather take that approach than to just say that it would never happen.",
        "So we are working at doing different programs and trying to come up with a, what we would call a demonstration project.",
        "It may be one of our jail sites, to start some type of distribution in the jail, on the jail level.",
        "So we are having conversations at the AIDS Foundation about things like that, about presenting these things to our legislators instead of just saying, they would never, you know.",
        "Because I'm seeing change here in this state.",
        "I'm seeing information being put in prisons throughout the state for the families of incarcerated people.",
        "Never seen that before.",
        "There's legislation that has been passed, the African-American Response Act was passed in '05 here.",
        "And in that legislation, there's language about prevention in prison.",
        "So our state is beginning to do more - some more work around prevention and testing in prison and peer-to-peer education in prison.",
        "So I have to work with them now, because it appears to me that they are getting on board on some levels.",
        "The condoms is something we're going to have to work on.",
        "And we don't have a problem here at ALC in educating our legislators around this subject.",
        "This issue might be even more controversial when it comes to women, because there are incidences of prisoner rape in women's prisons between prisoners and guards.",
        "There's also consensual sex between female prisoners and guards, and then there are consensual and non-consensual sex between women.",
        "Have you addressed the issue of women prisoners at all?",
        "Now, in this book, \"\"Last Harvest,\"\" you follow a group of developers who are working on a project.",
        "They start with a cornfield in rural Pennsylvania and they developed that into what you are calling a neo-traditional community.",
        "Tell us what a neo-traditional community is.",
        "What does it look like?",
        "No, not at this point as far as condoms.",
        "No, we haven't, but I'm so looking forward to the conversation in our groups.",
        "We're beginning to meet here - when I say meet, I'm talking about bringing in community advocates from all over different communities.",
        "Bringing them together to start talking about, when we present this legislation to our legislators, what are going to have in it?",
        "I'm sure that we need to have some language in there for females as well.",
        "And I'm sure it'll be there.",
        "So no, we haven't started it, but it will be part of the package.",
        "Because you're absolute right, it's not just the male-to-male, it is, you know, it is officers and, you know.",
        "So we have to kind of make sure that that's in the agenda, in the plan."

        "I would like to see prevention throughout the states, all states.",
        "We don't have many prevention tools, but what we have should be for everyone, not just for people in the community or in the prison, because I don't separate the communities.",

        "The reaction from people in AA was probably, I would say, tilted to the negative.",
        "Tilted to the negative, because it violates tradition, or because they see real purpose in anonymity?",
