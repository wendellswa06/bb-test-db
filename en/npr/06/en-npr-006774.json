        "And they needed camps to house the workers and to be headquarters for where the trucks would do all this driving.",
        "These guys built the camps in a big hurry, within a month or six weeks late in the summer of 2003.",
        "And they had to keep these camps going and feed everyone, and provide the vehicles, and that sort of thing.",
        "So what did they do that was fraudulent?",
        "Well, the jury believed the charge of the two whistleblowers, one guy a subcontractor for Custer Battles and the other an employee, that they created a number of subsidiary companies in the Cayman Islands.",
        "Bill mills is what the lawyer for the accusers called them.",
        "And used these entities to draw up fake invoices from whole cloth; sometimes for several tens of thousands of dollars.",
        "Some of them for 1.2 million and very large amounts like that.",
        "One of the dramatic allegations that came up in the trial that the jury accepted completely was that a particular invoice contained one line item for a bunch of forklifts to be leased to the CPA, to the American-led occupation authority.",
        "And it turns out that these forklifts had been swiped from the now defunct civilian Iraqi Airline at Baghdad International Airport, where Custer Battles had another job going on.",
        "The forklifts were swiped.",
        "They were painted blue and leased at the cost of some hundreds of thousands of dollars back to the CPA, and then billed for these large amounts of money.",
        "Now, how did Custer Battles explain these actions?",
        "Well, the defense said, in general, that this entire misadventure was the product of confusion during a chaotic wartime moment.",
        "It was the product, too, they say of spite.",
        "They charged that Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Isaacson were disgruntled former employees who turned around and sued them and tried to blow the whistle on a perfectly legitimate piece of work.",
        "And there was testimony that they did an okay job on setting up these camps for the currency exchange.",
        "Now, this was the first case of war profiteering in Iraq to go to trial.",

        "I mean, when they're talking about things like increasing the percentage of parts of a vehicle that have to be made in the United States, are these fundamental changes or just a way for the administration to say, hey, we took a hard line, and we got a new deal?",
        "I think a lot of it is to say, we took a hard line, and look what we did.",

        "But second, the political pressure to convict and punish him is overwhelming, and I just can't imagine that the judges would resist it even if they thought that he deserved acquittal, which is also hard to imagine.",

        "No one can say that a conviction and punishment would be unfair even if some elements of the process itself are unfair.",

        "Of course, there's an irony here because Saddam is, in a way, being punished in part because he's an opponent.",
