        "And it's another distinction we have to make.",
        "There is a public aspect of this, which you say is probably outmoded, or at least for a lot of people it ought to be.",
        "There is also an internal anonymity that remains important.",
        "Yeah, I would - I think it is important, because that is really, to me, what the core of the program is about, is about a certain sense of, you know, kind of coming in and being able to sort of take off the backpack of one's self, you know, and sort of say, you know, whoever I am out there, I don't have to be that in here.",
        "I can just be, you know, this person.",
        "I don't have to keep up a facade.",
        "I can say I - is going on to me, and that that's not going to - that that's going to be treated with a certain amount of courtesy.",

        "Here's an email we have from Angela in Gadsden, Alabama: I will celebrate 20 years clean and sober this month if I don't get stupid between now and the 26th.",
        "My understanding of the tradition of anonymity has deepened and broadened over the past two decades.",
        "Where I once was terrified to let anyone know I was in recovery, now I essentially don't care.",
        "I believe the extreme social stigma of having an addiction is a thing of the past, and while those in recovery who choose to be public must take care not to speak as if they represent any viewpoint but their own, I don't think it's detrimental to any 12-step program to have members who live their life in recovery out loud.",
        "In fact, it may inspire someone to try our way of life.",
        "And that's an important point, that if people can become public examples, maybe they can inspire other people to get some help.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's great, and I think that's basically my attitude, too.",

        "Wonderful, thank you.",
        "I think it's important to note the 12th tradition.",
        "It states that anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all the traditions, and ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.",
        "So it's not so much about the stigma as it is about being one of many.",
        "And whether you're a writer for the New York Times or a pop star or just a janitor from Edmond, Oklahoma, when you're inside the rooms of AA, you're just one of many, a recovering alcoholic.",
        "That's my first point."

        "My second quick point is if somebody was to go public and announce that they're a recovering alcoholic in AA and then they relapse, what kind of image does that give Alcoholics Anonymous?",
        "I'd like to address those questions, because, I mean, they're both things you hear a lot.",
        "And his first point I think is true, and I think that's what I was talking about a second ago, about the 12th tradition being this - much more of a central pillar of AA.",
        "The second thing is that, you know, you hear this a lot from people, that, you know, there are these celebrities that come out and - come out of rehab and, you know, whether they say they're in AA or not, you know, the next thing you know, they're back on the cover of the National Enquirer, and that this is something that gives AA a bad name.",
        "And, you know, I'd heard it for 15 years, and I didn't really think too much about it, either.",
        "I thought that that was, you know, sound thinking.",
        "But in writing this piece, I realized that, you know, that what that argument does is actually make an argument for people to give AA a good name by coming out, if you're somebody who has long-term recovery and who has a fairly - you know, a stable and reliable recovery practice.",
        "You know, if people have - if the public have an idea that AA is about a life of constant relapse, which is something that focus groups have, in fact, established, that that is a public perception, then it seems that, you know, people who do not live that life, who have successfully, you know, licked any - any number of addictions, that, you know, it makes sense for them to come out and say no, no, no, you know, I am 15 years sober.",
        "And, you know, this program works, and it's great, and, you know, that's all.",
        "I am not a celebrity who just came out of, you know, Betty Ford an hour ago and I'm, you know, going to leave the studio and go, you know, go to the nearest bar.",

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Great to be here on the radio with you, and Mr. Colman, I applaud your efforts of openness.",
        "Unfortunately, openness for me - which that's part of the AA meeting where we share our stories, our experience, strength and hope so that we can help others - that openness now is a curse for me."

        "I'm so sorry.",

        "And because my story has a spiritual element to it, also, very surprising to me is the number of people who've written me to say that they, too, have had spiritual experiences but just ignored them, or nobody paid attention to them, or it was viewed as unimportant and that now they could - it validated many people now.",
