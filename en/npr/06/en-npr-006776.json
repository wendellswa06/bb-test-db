        "Okay.",
        "But my problem with the spiritual experience - I have to say this, because it's so critical - is you can never promise a spiritual experience.",
        "But what you can promise is that if you practice, consistently, true, radical acceptance and willingness to have the life that you have, even though it's terrible, it's hell, but you practice acceptance, you'll be transformed ultimately.",
        "Everyone will be.",
        "And it's true not just in my treatment, but AA, and any real effective treatment forces you to confront the reality of the moment.",
        "And we're talking today about the value of anonymity.",
        "You said it was important, for many years, to retain that anonymity, to maintain the integrity of your research so it wouldn't be attacked, or you wouldn't be attacked, and the research would stand on its own.",
        "As you look back, what was the value of anonymity to you?",
        "You know, I believe being public about private parts of your life, when the private parts of your life are stigmatized by the public, should be very strategic, and that it's often a mistake, and many people - particularly people that I treat - are often too public.",
        "And so they get rejected before someone gets to know them.",
        "And I'm Michele Norris.",
        "So it can be very valuable in relationships where people already know and value you, to find out things about you that may be stigmatized in our culture.",
        "But to tell them a stigmatizing piece of information before they know you usually - not always, but usually backfires.",
        "Would you agree with David Colman that the stigma attached to alcoholism that was once so pervasive is a good deal less than it used to be?",
        "I loved hearing it.",
        "I think it's absolutely true.",
        "We're way far away from that on severe mental disorders, unless - we live in a culture where if you can't prove that brain abnormality caused it, our only alternative appears to be to be judgmental of the person with a disorder.",
        "And so I think alcohol has gotten past a lot of the stigma, obviously not all of it, as you can tell by the caller who got fired.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting to me that some degree of the reduction of stigma to alcoholism is the result of its - our understanding of it as a disease, whereas mental disease, always accepted as a disease, is still stigmatized."

        "Alcoholism can be learned.",
        "Dysfunctional behavior can be learned.",

        "So as a culture, we've sort of gotten into this idea of if you can prove you have a disease, you're a good person.",

        "So I'm in favor of getting rid of these kind of judgments and just asking: What's the cause of the problem?",

        "Well, first of all, I just want to say how much I enjoyed Dr. Linehan's article and hearing about her philosophy, because I think it is very important.",
        "And I think the idea of being able to come forward and sort of say, you know, this is who I am, and this is who - you know, I'm going to accept it, and, you know, I suggest you do the same, I think that's an incredibly empowering experience.",
        "I've had my own spiritual experiences doing the exact same thing, and I think that, you know, if you don't accept yourself in a - you know, some aspect of yourself, then you are - I can't use a four-letter word, but you're not in good shape.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "So, you know, I learned to accept myself when I realized that I - there was no question that I was gay, and I did it again when I realized that I was an alcoholic.",
        "And I'm sure I'll do it some other times, too - grudgingly, but ultimately very happily.",
        "And so I really applaud Dr. Linehan in coming forward on that.",
        "And I do think it's interesting the way - the process by which we kind of identify things as a disease or not a disease is an incredibly murky territory, and I think it's interesting that, you know, alcoholism has been able to kind of pave a route towards public acceptance by calling it a disease, which in some ways does acknowledge that there is some element of severe compulsion to it that does manage to override our free will."

        "It's interesting, because sometimes I wonder if, you know, calling things a disease is actually a route towards them not being seen as a disease - that is, you know, homosexuality was considered a disease until the early '70s, when the - when it was finally dropped as being seen that way by the - you know, the institutionalized psychiatry world.",
        "And I think that that ultimately actually helped its acceptance, being - perhaps being seen as a disease for a while.",
        "And I do think that you see these other things - when you are able to label something something and say this is what I have, this is what I am, this is what I suffer from, and these are its aspects, and I'm a human being just like everybody else, you know, you're sort of forcing people to sort of sit back and say okay.",
