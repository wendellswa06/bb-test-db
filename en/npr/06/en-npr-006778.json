        "O'ROURKE: Yeah.",
        "I like that you brought up costs because it's not an inexpensive proposition to guarantee everyone in this country health care - primary health care, prescription medication health care, mental health care - in a state whose largest provider of mental health care is the county jail system right now - reproductive health care so that every person can make their own decisions about their own body and have health care that allows them to do that.",
        "But far more expensive than doing that is the status quo.",
        "It costs us $110 to lock someone up who for their schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or clinical depression literally in Texas gets arrested on purpose.",
        "And this is not an uncommon thing.",
        "It's not right.",
        "It's immoral.",
        "It's unconscionable.",
        "But it's happening in this state.",
        "For a fraction of the cost, we could provide world-class outpatient mental health care either through an employer-sponsored health care plan or a Medicare for America plan that we've described where if you're uninsured or cannot afford your co-pays today, you can enroll in that program and not have to worry about a co-pay every time you go to the doctor or to the therapist or to a family planning provider.",
        "Tell me how the arithmetic works, though.",
        "Are you saying that bringing more people into your Medicare for America plan will do what?",
        "I mean, how does it increase the - how does it decrease the overall costs?",
        "Because it seems to me you still have two dual administrative systems - one for private insurance and one for the publicly funded option that you're talking about.",
        "So how does that bring costs down overall?",
        "O'ROURKE: When tens of millions of Americans are now able to go to a doctor and don't receive their care on an emergency basis in the ER, when those with mental health care challenges are able to see a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist instead of getting arrested on purpose, we as taxpayers save in the billions of dollars when you look at this over the next 10 to 20 years.",
        "You're right.",
        "Private insurance has a higher administrative cost - something like 16% compared to Medicare's 2%.",
        "We envision that most of the millions of our fellow Americans who are uninsured today will enroll in Medicare.",
        "And that's a saving over private insurance.",
        "But I also want to make sure that I'm listening to our fellow Americans, tens of millions of them.",
        "Many of the members of unions who fought for health care plans that they like, that work for them and their families - if they want to keep them, I want them to be able to make the choice to be able to do that.",
        "And yes, over the long term, this country saves.",
        "This country produces better health care outcomes.",
        "OK.",
        "But some of your fellow Democratic candidates have identified specific funding streams.",
        "They say there's - particularly Elizabeth Warren.",
        "She said specifically, a tax on the highest earners.",
        "You're not prepared to identify...",
        "O'ROURKE: Yes.",
        "...A specific funding source for this.",
        "O'ROURKE: Sure I am.",
        "If we took a corporate tax rate that under the $2 trillion Trump tax cuts, the benefits of which flowed to corporations, flowed to the very wealthiest in this country - if we took that corporate tax rate that had dropped from 35 to 21% back up just to 28%, we would generate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years.",
        "If we were to tax returns on capital at the same rate that we tax ordinary wage income, the income that is being earned by our server here at L&J, we would generate hundreds of billions of dollars.",
        "And yes, if we were to add a transactions tax on Wall Street transactions, a wealth tax to address the fact that you have the greatest divide in wealth inequality in this country's history right now in 2019, not only would we generate the revenue to be able to pay for these programs - we would also address something that is a threat to our democracy and a threat to everyone in this country - being able to see a future for themselves and their kids in this country.",
        "So yes, we can pay for this.",
        "And those are the streams that we would look at."

        "They think, they're just locked out, these people and these people whose job is to serve them don't understand them.",
        "And on top of that, it's all about educating the audience about the things that they need to have, that are important, right?",
        "And this is one example of why we created Global Grind in the first place.",
        "We always know that there's events that happen that this audience gets behind, whether it's Katrina, whether it's Jena Six, and there hasn't been a place online to show the power of that voice.",
        "So for the countdown for it to change for example, there could be a story from a CNN, from a New York Times, and all the traffic and activities that's generated on Global Grind - when they go to look and see where the source of that is, Global Grind becomes synonymous with the voice of the urban audience.",
