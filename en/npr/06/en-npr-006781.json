        "What I mean by November 5th strategy is a lot of people who have been through an experience of a lifetime with this historic race, what do you do with them on November 5th?",
        "I think it continues to give us an opportunity for them to voice their feelings about what's coming forward, right?",

        "He was just caught, you know, consorting with prostitutes, but he had the decency at least to give up his office.",
        "We're involved in a real constitutional clash between not just the three branches of government, executive, legislative, and judicial, but between federal authority and state authority.",
        "I called it a clash instead of a crisis because I don't think we should be so quick to buy into Governor Blagojevich's argument that he had to do something - he had to make this appointment because otherwise, there would be a crisis because Illinois would have only one senator, and it can't survive with one senator.",
        "Right.",
        "And in fact, in Washington, Senate Democrats said that they wouldn't seat Roland Burris.",
        "Nothing against him personally, but just because he was appointed by Blagojevich.",
        "And then the press conference got even more surreal, at least to people who don't normally go to Chicago press conferences, and when Bobby Rush, Congressman Bobby Rush was in the audience, and he was called up to the podium to make some comments, and then basically accused Senate Democrats of being racist if they denied this African-American his Senate seat.",
        "It's the worst possible argument you want to hear it if you are the incoming president, Barack Obama.",
        "Barack Obama's case to the American people was not, you have to elect me and make me the first African-American president.",
        "And to hear Bobby Rush say, no senator could possibly vote against Roland Burris because it would be a lynching if they did is just not the message that the president-elect wants to send.",
        "And in fact, the president-elect from Hawaii was very quick to issue a very clear and unequivocal statement saying he has nothing against Roland Burris, but Roland Burris should not take this seat.",
        "Rod Blagojevich should resign, and in fact, the Senate should refuse to seat any choice made by Governor Blagojevich.",
        "The Senate has now been given a cover by President-elect Obama to say, look, if President-elect Obama says we can vote against Roland Burris, then I guess we can vote against Roland Burris.",
        "Just on a lighter note, you have a photo up at politico.com of a giant tomb Roland Burris has built in a cemetery for himself and his family, and it's emblazoned with the word trailblazer on it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And he left room because he was hoping they could also engrave governor on it.",
        "I mean, Roland Burris is not a bad guy in Illinois terms simply because he served three terms as comptroller and one term as attorney general and was never indicted for anything.",
        "He's been out of politics for a while, and you can see from his point of view, this is my way back in.",
        "In retrospect, I think he's going to regret having accepted it.",

        "So it's going to be mostly not about him.",
        "But there will be some discussion of some of the things that he did as a federal judge in New York that involved signing warrants, that involved surveillance, that involved detention, issues that will plug him into the history of the Bush administration on those issues.",
        "But Judge Mukasey is not seen as someone who just, you know, rolls over and does whatever the Bush administration wants him to do, right?",
        "He is seen as an independent mind.",
        "That's right.",
        "And that's why I think, ultimately, he will be approved both by this committee and by the full Senate.",
        "Chuck Schumer, after all, who is one of the most vociferous critics of Alberto Gonzales on this committee, is the senator from New York, has known this judge for a long time and believes that he will be a fair referee, a good umpire, and that, while he's conservative, while he does not share Chuck Schumer's philosophy on many of these issues, he will not, as you put it, roll over for the Bush administration."
