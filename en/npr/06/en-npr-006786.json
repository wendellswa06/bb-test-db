        "Are you worried, though, about the future of the church right now, as people turn away amidst the controversies?",
        "You know, I do see a great degree of disaffection, of maybe - you know, it's not even opposition among the people, but maybe a lack of a sense that it's relevant to their lives.",
        "But among many young people in particular, I see a sort of a rediscovery of the great tradition of the church.",
        "And I think what we're seeing is the preparation of a creative minority within the church so that the church will be smaller, radically different, perhaps, on an administrative level, but hopefully much more a force for prophetic good in our country and much more an agent of the tradition that we've been entrusted.",

        "So how did fruit get so sugary?",

        "What you're looking at is natural varieties, which are puny, which are tasteless, which have no smell.",
        "And the farmers were like, we can do better than this.",

        "Under the federal program that allows you to consolidate your debt, students and parents can take all those loans and bundle them into one fixed rate loan.",
        "And they can stretch the payments anywhere from 10 years to 30 years, depending on how much debt they had.",
        "So it really is a way to let people sort of, instead of having all of these loans out there, have one fixed payment every month that they know, and then perhaps lower the payments to give them a little breathing room.",
        "So that sounds like a good idea.",
        "What's the catch?",
        "Well, for some it may not be because clearly if you lengthened the loan you're going to pay more in interest payments.",
