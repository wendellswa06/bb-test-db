        "Last month, the country hit its highest unemployment rate in almost two decades, 7.6 percent.",
        "Roland says that means Medicaid roles go up.",
        "For every percentage-point increase in unemployment, about a million more people would qualify for Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program, nationally, and about 1.1 million more would become uninsured.",
        "More demand, less cash, that leaves states looking to the federal government for help, especially to the federal stimulus package.",

        "And at first, I didn't want to put it in the show.",
        "I said, everybody knows that joke.",
        "Well, of course, the joke that you know you think everybody knows, but everybody doesn't know it.",
