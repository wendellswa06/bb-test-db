        "It simply has not.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's a good question, and probably at the center of the security debate over the last few years has been the issue of whether or not there is a paper trail, whether or not there is a voter verified paper record.",
        "At this point I think there are about 26 states that require voter verified paper records on their machine, and there are another ten who although it's not required by law statewide their machines do have voter verified paper records.",
        "What we found interestingly is that the voter verified paper record by itself doesn't necessarily provide any extra security value.",
        "And I think that's one of our most important finding.",
        "If you want paper to have a security value, you need to audit it.",
        "You need to check it against the electronic record, which in most states is the official record.",
        "You can check a very small percentage of them to do that effectively to have confidence that the votes that were recorded were recorded correctly.",
        "However, one of the big problems is that currently very few states do that.",
        "I think of the 36 states where paper exists statewide, only about a third of states are auditing those paper records.",
        "And what about the hackability of these machines?",
        "Well, we spent a long time working on that.",
        "We spent about a year and a half on that question.",
        "And what we determined in the end is that there are enough points of vulnerability that in fact somebody could hack into machines and take over machines and affect the way they're recording votes.",
        "And again I would say that there are things that can be done to make that much less likely.",
        "One of them, one of the most important ones, is especially when there is paper trail, that you're auditing the paper, because even if something like that is done, if voters are checking their paper records, it will make it extremely unlikely that somebody can get away with an attack like that.",
        "Now, how were your finding received on Capitol Hill?"

        "New York City put in place a paid sick days law which covers every worker in the city, guarantees more than one million access to paid sick time and the rest access to unpaid sick time.",
        "That means you can't lose your job if you're sick or a family member is sick or needs medical care.",
        "Portland and Jersey City did the same things.",
        "Then Rhode Island, most significantly, became the third state in the country to have a family leave insurance program in place.",
        "Which means that workers there would be able to take time when a new child joins the family or when a family member is seriously ill.",
        "This seems really counterintuitive.",

        "This was a winning issue for Dan Malloy in Connecticut in 2011; this was a winning issue for Bill de Blasio in 2013 in New York City.",
        "And as we move towards 2014, it is in elected officials' interest to look at these policies as something that's good for workers, good for businesses and good for their communities.",

        "And you can certainly understand.",
        "At a time of a bad economy - if you're a business owner - and suddenly someone can call in sick, you do have more costs associated with these leave policies.",
        "Isn't this a burden at a really bad time?",
        "Actually, we can tell from the data from San Francisco, which put the nation's first paid sick days law in place in 2006, from D.C., which has had a paid sick days law on the books since 2008, from Seattle, which implemented paid sick days in 2011 and from Connecticut, that actually businesses don't suffer when paid sick days are in effect and that the very jobs that you would expect to retract because of paid sick days burdens are actually growing in numbers in all of those places.",
        "So, this idea that what's good for workers is bad for business actually turns out not to be true if you look at the evidence.",
        "And it's very much in businesses' interests to make sure that workers can take the time they need and come back to work without getting their co-workers sick, while they're being more productive and where they can take care of themselves and their families without worrying.",
        "Are there other states or cities that you see gearing up to maybe pass leave policies in the next year?",
        "So this rail project was a favorite of prior governors, right?",
        "Why is Newsom downsizing the project?",
        "Well, because, as he alluded, it's really expensive and way behind schedule - the original cost estimate was $33 billion back in 2006 for San Francisco to Anaheim in Orange County, later from Sacramento to San Diego.",
        "But at one point, the project ballooned up to nearly $100 billion.",
        "And even though Jerry Brown lowered that projection a bit, the fact is the money simply isn't available right now, in large part because Republicans in Washington cut off funding after they took over the House during the Obama administration back in 2010.",
        "But it is important to say that Newsom's office is making clear he's leaving open the possibility of the full project in the future.",
        "For now, he is, I guess the phrase is, re-prioritizing.",
        "So help us understand - because he says part of the rail project will be built, the part that goes through Central Valley.",
        "Why is he focusing on that section?",
        "What's going on with politics there?",
        "Because the money's largely there, first of all - there has been money identified, including $3.5 billion or so in federal government money that was previously given to the state - if you think all the way back to early 2009, the stimulus package during the Great Recession - or the great - yes, the Great Recession, not the Great Depression.",
        "And so there's that and state bond funds that will help build the project from Bakersfield to Merced in the Central Valley.",
        "Now, it's been criticized as the train to nowhere.",
        "Newsom says that is offensive to a region that is largely not growing anywhere near as fast as some of the coastal areas - Silicon Valley, the Bay Area, etc. And so Newsom is saying this is going to be an economic boost to an area that really needs it.",
        "Stepping back from California for a second, this was supposed to be a model for other projects nationwide.",
