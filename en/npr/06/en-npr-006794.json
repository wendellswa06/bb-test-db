        "Good to be with you.",
        "Part of what the president had to say late in his speech on Wednesday was this: He was talking about the debate having to do with the character of our country and he was speaking to critics who argue that the health care plan would put too much power in the government's hands.",
        "Let's listen to some of what he said.",
        "You see our predecessors understood that government could not and should not solve every problem.",
        "They understood that there are instances when the gains and security from government action are not worth the added constraints on our freedom.",
        "But they also understood that the danger of too much government is matched by the perils of too little.",
        "And E.J., he went on to say that markets can crash without the leavening hands of wise policy.",
        "Monopolies can stifle the competition and the vulnerable can be exploited.",
        "Do you think what the president had to say changed any minds there in Congress?",
        "Well, I think it may have been the beginning of an argument to the public, to the American people about their broader sense of politics.",
        "You had gone through a couple of months where much of the sloganeering on the right was the same old anti-government stuff.",
        "And finally you heard President Obama, in what I thought was both emotionally and intellectually the most powerful part of the speech, say wait a minute, we have a different view of government.",
        "I have a different view of government.",
        "It's necessary we've used it successfully in the past.",
        "This other view is simply wrong and it was a kind of aggressive -but quietly aggressive - argument that said we have different take on how you improve the lives of Americans.",
        "And David Brooks, President Obama there making a direct reference to Senator Kennedy, the late Senator Kennedy, who had fought very hard for this and had a vision of government as being this advocate for the poor and the downtrodden.",
        "Right, though that's where Obama wanted to come out.",
        "This part of speech was, I was told, the most important emotionally for him - the party really cared about because it was his broader vision.",
        "And you know, he had come at a point where health care has followed the AIG takeover.",
        "It's followed the auto industry - a great deal of concern that the government was taking over everything.",
        "And I think what he wanted to show was, on health care and on other issues, he's not a libertarian anti-government person but he's not a big government orthodox liberal.",
        "Being Obama he always wants to put left and right on one side, and then find the pragmatic sweet spot in the middle.",
        "That's how he conceives himself and that was what he was trying to express there on health care and more broadly.",
        "The president also offered a promise to use what, David, in your column today in the New York Times you called the dime standard.",
        "Let's listen.",
        "I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit now or in the future, period.",
        "And to prove that I'm serious there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised don't materialize."

        "That is not new.",
        "That's pretty well been known, even before these nuclear talks got going years later.",
