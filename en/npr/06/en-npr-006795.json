        "Well, so I should say that this is research that we conducted in a collaborative team with other folks at UC San Diego, as well as University of Michigan and Princeton, and what we did is study the security of the Sequoia AVC Advantage Voting Machine, which, as you said, is an older design.",

        "And so, there was a lot of language here, the language about government, the language in favor of the public plan, though quickly saying that's negotiable.",
        "And I think what he did is, he united sort of middle of the road Democrats with the liberals in saying wait a minute, we've got another enemy out here.",
        "The enemy is - are those who want to kill this bill, the enemy of the Republicans who are distorting what we're up to.",
        "And so I think he achieved his political end.",
        "The fact is he is for a moderate bill.",
        "The biggest problem I think for liberals is not really about the public plan, it's the lid on spending at $900 billion.",
        "And I think the 90 billion a year - where I think they are going to have problems with covering people kind of in the middle of the middle class at that rate.",
