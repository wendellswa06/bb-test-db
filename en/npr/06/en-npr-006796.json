        "And I would suspect you would see a more - somewhat more diverse institutions just as society changes.",
        "But I think Morehouse will be, even 10 years from now, more seen primarily as the college of choice for African-American men, and that students of other races and ethnic groups who come - as they do now - will come because they want that experience - that they want the Morehouse experience, and the values, the traditions, and messages that we tailor for our students who are mostly African-American are messages that are good for males of any race and background.",
