        "But Abbott realized that his daughter was actually very, very bright, and he felt that she was not going to get the education that she deserved.",
        "So as well as writing books and things, satirizing this state of affairs, he engaged private tutors, and he made sure that his daughter had the sort of education that he felt she deserved, rather than the sort of education that his society was willing to give her.",
        "So he, you know, he took action as well as just writing.",
        "But he - Flora?",
        "Well, you were saying that you thought it was too much, and it's funny because when I read it, I didn't feel that way.",
        "And maybe we have a difference of opinion because we, you know, I'm a woman, and so, for me, I felt sort of like, oh, I have a friend here in this author, who, you know, who really is blasting this point home.",
        "Yeah, I think...",
        "I think - go ahead, Dr. Stewart.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's right, but I think the audience at the time was rather polarized, because some people got this.",
        "Some people realized that this man is - he's writing satire.",
        "He doesn't actually believe this himself.",
        "In fact, he believes the exact opposite of this.",
        "Quite a lot of people took it rather at face value and felt that because he was making this point, over and over and over again, during the course of the book in various ways, that actually this - he was saying just how things should be.",
        "And he went to some lengths in the second edition, which is published a year later in 1885.",
        "In the presses, he added a new section saying, in fairly gentle terms, basically, pointing out that he was acting in this fictional setup, that he was acting as a historian of the events that has happened in Flatland.",
        "And a historian's job is to report events.",
        "It is not to advance his own opinions.",
        "So in a gentle way, he was saying, come on, guys, haven't you noticed?",
        "You know, this is satire, I don't mean this.",
        "I think people who knew Abbott would have realized, because they knew what his attitude - I mean, in general terms, he was fairly enlightened socially.",

        "That's right.",
        "And, OK, now - again, you can read that two ways because you can say, well, women are not great at intellectual activity, but they're fantastic at emotional things.",
        "He wasn't really quite trying to say that, but this was the prevailing view in Victorian times.",
        "And so he set up Flatland so that it reflected the state of affairs but - I think, particularly since he's putting it near the end when everything's coming to a climax.",
        "He's sort of finally revealing to you what the women of Flatland are really like, and you realize that actually there are more dimensions to them than the physical.",

        "And I think - you know, I mean, when I read it, I was about 16, and it took a little while to kind of figure out - I had to reread it several times to start to see the depth of the thing.",
        "But I - he's actually very, very sympathetic to the - to Flatland's women and to Flatland's lower classes.",

        "And, actually, we saw the satire in it.",
        "And you have to remember when it was written.",
        "I think it's pretty obvious that he's trying to show the treatment of women.",
        "I think he's doing everything he can to show how everyone's treated, not just women, but the caste system in England and the monarch being a character.",
        "How did it affect you?",
        "Did it make you stop and think about things?",
        "Yes.",
        "We actually did a lot of thinking about - it was hard, I think, to perceive, from our point of view, a visualization of it.",
        "You know, you - when you start reading it, you go, well, those little, you know, pictures on the page, so to speak, dots and lines and things, but - at least in the one we read.",
        "But it was really difficult for the mind to perceive it, and you had to really stop and ask yourself: What do they mean?",
        "How can there be no other dimension?",
        "And it's thought-provoking, and I sincerely believe he was trying to show how women were being treated, by satire.",
        "You know, the - that was an interesting part to me, how he actually went through and explained how to think about Flatland, that you could bring your nose down to the table...",
        "Thanks, Wanda."
