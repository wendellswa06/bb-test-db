        "How young do you think somebody - what age could you start to read \"\"Flatland\"\" and appreciate it, do you think?",
        "I think that even at the age of 10 or 12, it might be that the mathematical side of it, the scientific side is actually - that's the easy part of the book, in a sense.",
        "That's the part that - it may be an area of human activity that only some of us feel comfortable with.",
        "But it's not - it doesn't require the sort of sophistication that social satire does.",
        "So the first time a young person reads the book, the social side of things might go - they might not be terribly aware of it, or they might feel it's just sort of part of the story to make things go.",
        "But I think, certainly, you know, there is no reason why a 10 or 12-year-old shouldn't read it.",
        "By the time you're 13 or 14, it's entirely suitable.",
        "I mean, I read it when I was about that sort of age, and maybe slightly older, and could've read it earlier.",
        "If someone had given it to me when I was about 10, I would have loved it.",

        "Hi.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I just wanted to mention the sort of follow-up piece by Rudolf Rucker, called \"\"Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension,\"\" which picks up sort of with the same arguments as \"\"Flatland.\"\" Then also, to give an example of how the two-dimensional to three-dimensional allegory can be used to imagine a model of expanding space, if you imagine the three-dimensional sphere passing through the two-dimensional plane of Flatland, and then just imagine the space inside the sphere without the sphere, then imagine that happening at every point in that two-dimensional space, then convert that allegory to the same thing happening with four-dimensional space entering our three-dimensional universe, you get a pretty good way to picture expanding space.",

        "Yeah, it is.",
        "It is.",

        "The line gets mad whenever someone introduces the idea that there's an extra dimension.",

        "Is there any final message, Ian, to you in this book?",
        "Is there any over-encapsulating message that you could sum up simply, here?",

        "A surprising number of people think that since elections are on Tuesdays, by Saturday all that can be said has been said and nothing more should be said.",
        "As a person who's covered politics for decades, I don't believe that.",
        "Saturday after the election and the Saturday after that are good days to talk politics and we need to talk.",
        "We've just done it again - played another round in our biennial Ping-Pong match in which we deliver a stinging rebuke to people in power, vote lots of the other guys into office and then two or sometimes four years later we send another strong message - you weren't listening.",
        "And deliver a serious blow to the new guys and vote the others back in.",
        "And as discouraged citizens have repeatedly told reporters, nothing changes.",
        "In fact, the debate does change.",
        "The issues and the emphasis do change.",
        "The stories covered in the news will change as the new leaders put their party's gloss on events and how to respond.",
        "As we know, there are many differences on big issues, on immigration, taxes trade, health insurance, but those policy debates, while important, seem to be somewhat removed from the daily lives of American citizens.",
        "And something that is very big in those daily lives has not changed for a very long time, and that is income.",
        "Wages have been stagnant for years - for decades - so when politicians and analysts tell us that unemployment is down, job numbers are up and the stock market is going up and down, but mostly up, when we hear numbers that say the economy is improving, too many Americans still say not my economy.",
        "Common sense would seem to dictate that if there are ways to restore prosperity, good jobs and bigger paychecks to all those good, hard-working people, our leaders should talk.",
        "They should confer and consult and maybe even compromise - maybe deliver at least some of what voters want.",
        "We've heard from leaders that they plan to talk and look for common ground.",
        "Now we wait for a couple of years and see if this time they really mean it.",

        "President Trump hasn't seen or read it yet either.",
        "Here's what we do know.",
        "The Justice Department never in the course of this nearly two-year investigation vetoed or overruled the special counsel Bob Mueller in any major investigative step he wanted to take.",
        "There were no serious disagreements.",
        "So how much should we expect to learn from Attorney General William Barr?",
        "I was at the Justice Department for a while today, so was the attorney general, Bill Barr.",
        "So was the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein.",
        "I'm told that they were secreted up in their offices higher up in the building, trying to figure out what part of this report to make public to Congress and eventually to people like us.",
        "We're told that could happen as soon as this weekend - not today.",
        "Tomorrow is still on the table.",
        "But they're reviewing it very closely with an eye toward providing what they call principal conclusions reached by the Mueller investigation.",
        "So if there are no more indictments expected out of the special counsel, does this mean that President Trump and his campaign have been cleared of wrongdoing?",
        "Not so fast.",
        "We know dating back four decades or more that the Justice Department interprets the law to mean that a sitting president cannot be criminally charged.",
        "You cannot indict a sitting president, according to Justice Department interpretations.",
        "That means that even if the special counsel had gathered evidence of wrongdoing, criminal wrongdoing by the president, he would not be charged until he left office.",
        "The other fact that's important here is that multiple investigations are ongoing and that the investigation by the Bob Mueller team has already resulted in criminal charges against six people in President Trump's inner circle, from his national security adviser to his campaign chairman to his longtime fixer, Michael Cohen.",
        "So it's not as if the Trump inner circle has not been damaged or dented by this investigation."
