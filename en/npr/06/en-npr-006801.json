        "Actually, we can tell from the data from San Francisco, which put the nation's first paid sick days law in place in 2006, from D.C., which has had a paid sick days law on the books since 2008, from Seattle, which implemented paid sick days in 2011 and from Connecticut, that actually businesses don't suffer when paid sick days are in effect and that the very jobs that you would expect to retract because of paid sick days burdens are actually growing in numbers in all of those places.",
        "So, this idea that what's good for workers is bad for business actually turns out not to be true if you look at the evidence.",
        "And it's very much in businesses' interests to make sure that workers can take the time they need and come back to work without getting their co-workers sick, while they're being more productive and where they can take care of themselves and their families without worrying.",
        "Are there other states or cities that you see gearing up to maybe pass leave policies in the next year?"
