        "So you first studied yogurt bacteria in mice.",
        "How did you do that?",
        "Well, let's have a few definitions to begin with.",
        "Yogurt refers to a product obtained from fermentation of milk by cultures of bacteria.",
        "Common bacteria in yogurts are streptococcus thermophilus and, another one with a bigger name, lactobacillus.",
        "We wanted to understand the effects of yogurt strains, as you said, on both the structure and the operations of our gut microbes, and we set up an experiment with two arms.",
        "On the one hand, we had mice that were raised under sterile condition.",
        "They're called germ-free mice.",
        "In a particular stage of their life, we introduced a collection of 15 normal members of our human gut community.",
        "By the way, their genomes were completely sequenced, so we knew all the genes in this model community of our human gut bacteria.",
        "And we studied these mice for a time, looking at the operations of this community, and then assessed the impact of introducing the bacterial strains that are present in a popular, commercially available fermented milk product.",
        "At the same time, we were studying a group of adult, healthy identical twins.",
        "And we followed them for a period of time, sampling their gut communities, and then administered the same commercially available product and looked at the impact of consuming that product over time, and then had them all stop consuming the product and looked to see whether the live bacterial strains associated with the product disappeared in a predictable way.",
        "Oh, so...",
        "So that was the setup.",
        "That's the setup.",
        "What else did you find?",
        "Well, we found in both the mice and in the humans that consumption of these live bacteria didn't really disrupt the representation of preexisting bacteria in the guts of humans or mice.",
        "It didn't affect the representation of genes.",
        "Rather, it affected the way these communities operated, specifically the pattern of expression of microbial genes involved in certain aspects of metabolism, most notably the metabolism of complex sugars, polysaccharides.",
        "And what we saw in mice we also saw in humans, which gave us encouragement because we felt that, in this field, where lots of claims are made about the health benefits of probiotics, it's very important to be able to establish a rigorous testing scheme, where we could, under very controlled conditions, look at the impact of these strains on gut communities, take the lessons learned from these models and then apply it in an informed and directed way to humans.",
        "Just so we understand, when I eat a little bit of yogurt, the bugs that are in the yogurt, the microbes that are in there, are just a tiny, tiny fraction of how many microbes are in my gut.",
        "Maybe you can explain the scale here."

        "Absolutely.",
        "So a typical helping of yogurt will have a few billion bacteria.",
        "Now, of course that's a large number.",
        "But consider for a moment the fact that our human guts are home to tens and tens of trillions of microbes, largely bacteria.",
        "So, really, it's a small fraction of the population.",
        "And what we noted in mice and what we noted in humans shouldn't be surprising.",
        "We dosed the mice at a level that's equivalent to the dosing in humans, and there wasn't a change in the overall architecture, the structure, of these communities.",
        "Rather, through processes that we don't fully understand, there was a form of communication between the yogurt strains and the normal resident bacteria in the gut.",
        "And that communication resulted in a change in the properties of the gut communities; notably, it affected the way these communities processed polysaccharides.",
        "Why is that important?",
        "Well, polysaccharides, which are common components of our diet, are molecules, large molecules that have complex chemical linkages.",
        "We don't have the dining utensils necessary to break down these polysaccharides on our own.",
        "Rather, we depend upon our gut bacteria to mobilize these utensils - they're actually enzymes - to break down polysaccharides in ways that are useable to us and to them.",
        "So we see...",
        "And what are the polysaccharides we're breaking down again?",
        "Well, in this particular case, the change involved a series of polysaccharides that are common ingredients of our foods.",
        "I'll give you their names.",
        "Xylans, these are present in fruits and vegetables, milk, honey, wheat.",
        "Pectins, they're prominent in apples, plums, oranges, carrots.",
        "They are the jelling agent used in jams and jellies.",
        "And the other type of polysaccharide, again, common in our diet can be classified as fructans.",
        "They're present in wheat, barley, garlic, onion, asparagus.",
        "And again, these are normal components of our diets.",
        "These are components that we depend upon our gut microbes to break down.",
        "And the introduction of these yogurt strains appeared to improve the capacity to break down these components of our diet.",
        "They not only appeared at the level of gene expression, but we actually measured the products of digestion in these mouse models, and they were very informative.",
        "They confirmed what we saw at the level of gene expression and told us that, yes, in fact, a small number of bacteria ingested can affect the properties of a gut community.",
        "But - yeah.",
        "Of course, once the twins stopped consuming yogurt, the strains in the yogurt rapidly cleared from the system.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So how long do the effects last?",
        "And how quickly do they get cleared?",
        "Well, in all cases, within about two weeks, the bacterial strains that were contained in this fermented milk product fell to below the limits of detection in each of the seven sets of twins that we studied.",
        "So to get any gut benefit here, does it matter how much yogurt I eat?",
        "Is there a minimum effective dose to actually do what you're getting at here?"
