        "We really don't know the question of dosing.",
        "We really don't know the effect of the diets of the people who are consuming the yogurt on the effects of the yogurt strains in digestion of other types of food in our diets.",
        "We hope that these mouse models will allow us to answer the questions of whether a particular type of yogurt or fermented milk product has similar effects on people having different dietary habits, different ages - the types of questions that are going to be important to get answers to if we rigorously assess some of the health claims that are made by manufacturers of probiotics.",
        "We're talking with Jeffrey Gordon from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.",

        "Good.",
        "What's up?",
        "Well, I had a question about the different types of yogurt.",
        "I know when you walk into a yogurt aisle at any Wal-Mart or any kind of big-box store, there's so much selection.",
        "I was wondering if there's one type of yogurt that's better for you than another, and really what it is in the yogurt that we should looking for in the label to find out what it is really that gives us these probiotic benefits.",
        "Well, that's a wonderful question and one of the reasons that we embarked on this set of experiments.",
        "We really wanted to create an analysis pipeline, where we could use models - in this case, an animal model where we reconstructed a human gut community - to answer some of the questions that you ask.",
        "We do know that individuals vary in terms of their collection of gut microbes.",
        "Even genetically identical twins have somewhat different collections of gut microbes.",
        "We know that diet plays an important role in shaping the structure and operations of these communities.",
        "There are different types of yogurt.",
        "There are different types of fermented dairy products.",
        "As I said in the beginning of this episode, there are - a minimum of two types of bacterial strains that are required to be present in a fermented milk product in order for it to be labeled yogurt.",
        "There are some types of products that have more than these two strains.",
        "You can also, as you know, go to supermarkets and various stores and pick up probiotics that have a variety of different components.",
        "We really don't have sufficient information to answer the question you have asked.",
        "We do, we think, have a set of tools in a new toolbox to address this.",
        "How do foods and how do gut bacteria interact with one another?",
        "Is the nutritional value of food influenced, in part, by the microbes we normally harbor?",
        "Can it be further modified by these live microbes we ingest deliberately?",
        "And in the future, if we open up a medicine cabinet in the 21st century, can we find - should we discover a series of new probiotics that can enhance the nutritional value of the particular diets that we consume?",
        "Well, you mentioned the off-the-shelf probiotics.",
        "I know a lot of people are interested in that.",
        "If you take probiotics in capsule form, is it different somehow than eating yogurt in the morning?",
        "That also is a great question.",
        "And just relating to the episode that preceded this one, it's going to be very important for the formulation of these products to be carefully validated.",
        "Is there a set number or an indicated number of live microbes in that formulation as advertised?",
        "Do we know the genome sequences of the bugs that are contained in these products?",
        "Is manufacturing such that from lot to lot we have consistency?",
        "I know that issue of consistency is taken very seriously by the manufacturers of a number of yogurts.",
        "But as you indicate, probiotics are sold widely, they're advertised having very - a variety of different health effect.",
        "And for those claims to be validated, we'd need the types of tools that we described in this study and others.",
        "Now African-American women are twice as likely to die as other women from HPV.",
        "What could be done to prevent it?",
        "Is this really the best way, this kind of early screening through the new test?"

        "Well, actually, Dannon funded part of our research in order to construct this type of analysis pipeline, to test the types of claims that are being made, not only by themselves but by others.",
        "I do think that this particular study indicated that there's an effect on the digestion of a component of our diet, polysaccharides.",
        "There have been other studies in mice, for instance, that shows that certain consortium of bacteria that are found in fermented milk products, including products made by Dannon, may modulate immune function in a way that would be beneficial, at least in the setting of colitis.",
        "So I think that there's much to learn.",
        "I think we have to be very rigorous in terms of testing the claims in order for the public to gain additional trust that we should be equipped to address the complexity of our gut microbial communities in the form of representative animal models, learn from those models, and then design, execute and carefully interpret clinical studies.",

        "And people on different diets have different gut structures.",

        "So as Dr. Hutcherson explains, the most common culprit in cervical cancer is something called the human papillomavirus, or HPV.",
        "It is extremely common in teens and women in their early 20s.",
        "In most cases, probably more than 70 percent of those cases, the immune system will totally eradicate the virus.",
        "So it's not one of those viruses that you carry on for the rest of your life.",
        "In a certain subset of those women, this virus will remain in the body, and those are the ones, those persistent strains, that we are most concerned about.",
        "And they tend to be of the high-risk variety.",
        "What I advise women to do is if you are 30 or older, when you go in for your yearly Pap smear, it is extremely important to ask your doctor to do a test for the human papillomavirus, a HPV test, in addition to your Pap smear.",
        "And the reason for this is a certain number of Pap smears will come back negative when, in fact, you are still at risk for cervical cancer.",
        "Doing the HPV with the Pap smear increases the chance that you will pick up these high-risk strains and precancerous lesions of the cervix early so they can be treated and you will not develop cervical cancer."
