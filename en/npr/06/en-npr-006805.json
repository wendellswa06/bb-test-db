        "The current president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, is a liberal, and all three of the inter-Korean summits have been done under liberal presidents because they're in favor of engaging with North Korea and giving them incentives to give up their nuclear weapons.",
        "Now, before Moon Jae-in were two conservative presidents.",
        "They were unwilling to engage with North Korea.",
        "And, like the protesters, these presidents are staunchly anti-communist and in favor of a close military alliance with the U.S.",
        "So while President Moon's ruling Democratic Party hailed the summit as an historic feat, the conservative opposition Liberty Korea party today slammed the summit as a show of fake peace - that's a direct quote - and blamed Moon for caving in to Kim Jong Un's demands.",
        "Well, let's talk about the North Korean side.",
        "Now, I think most people know that the North Korean media, which is tightly controlled by the government, reported extensively on the summit.",
        "What did they say?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's very notable that they reported in detail on the summit, especially on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's pledge, which he made in writing, to complete nuclear disarmament.",
        "And that really commits him.",
        "He's on the record as telling this to his people now, and North Korean media published the whole joint declaration.",
        "There were long broadcasts and lengthy printed reports with lots of pictures and lots of attention to detail, which the South Korean media also gave to things like the menu at the banquet.",
        "Oh, interesting.",
        "Well, what about the South Korean media?",
        "What did they say?",
        "Most of the op-eds about the summit said the meeting was significant.",
        "But it was not enough, they said, to allay the suspicions of South Korean citizens who have seen North Korea pledge peace before, but, you know, not make good on it.",
        "A lot of people in South Korea are aware that a summit is going to happen or is - you know, is expected to happen between President Trump and Kim Jong Un.",
        "So basically, this was sort of a prelude to that.",
        "And, in fact, President Trump tweeted that he spoke today with both President Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to coordinate as they set up the summit - probably in the next month or so.",
        "And finally, what about the regional players - the other regional players like China and Japan?",
        "What's been the reaction there?"

        "China is North Korea's main ally, and it hailed the courage of the two Koreas' leaders for holding this summit, and they're clearly pretty happy with the result.",
        "And that's because their chief concern is that they do not want any conflict or instability on their doorstep.",
        "And it's clear that the summit, you know, lowered the temperature in the neighborhood.",
        "And remember that a year ago, China's ties with both North and South Korea were really bad because they were not happy about North Korea having nukes, and they were also not happy about South Korea installing U.S.-made anti-missile batteries.",
        "So since Moon Jae-in became president, and Kim Jong Un said he was willing to give up his nukes, ties with both Koreas have actually gotten quite a bit better.",

        "President Trump and his White House have offered conflicting messages this week about the extent of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign.",
        "But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others have warned that Russians are already at work to influence this year's elections.",

        "...Little media project with just 10 or 12 working in the Moscow office and about 20 people who are writing for us in the United States.",
        "USA Really was formed by the Federal News Agency, which has ties to Vladimir Putin's government.",
        "Malkevich also works for that government as an adviser on mass media, though it's unclear what the exact connection between his website and the Kremlin might be.",
        "Malkevich spoke to us from the offices of USA Really in Moscow and told us his team wants to tell stories that mainstream American media won't tell.",
        "We're interested in making media for all, people from left side to extremely right.",
        "In our country, in Russia, we have a lot of American media speaking about Russian problems, about Russian life, so maybe it is our answer.",
        "Malkevich says he's heard the claims and criticisms of Russian interference in American politics, and they're just fiction - or bad history repeating itself."
