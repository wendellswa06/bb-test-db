        "When we asked directly if Russian misinformation is aimed to influence elections, Alexander Malkevich scoffed.",
        "You're thinking about American people, American citizen as very weak people because you suggest that a little media from Russia appears and all Americans who reading our articles are immediately influenced.",
        "They cover a lot of, I mean, everything from major news stories of the day involving the Trump administration and Congress to minor local news stories that can sort of fit into the conspiratorial, very divisive cultural criticism that is sort of characteristic of a lot of these Russian media organizations.",
        "Lachlan Markay is a White House correspondent for The Daily Beast.",
        "He's covered USA Really and told us how stories on their website can aggravate divisions in America.",
        "One that really stuck out at me was a story about the FBI honoring its LGBT employees.",
        "And there was a story, in very poorly written English that wondered why they were honoring the gay and lesbian people who worked for the FBI but not, quote, \"\"the straights\"\" who work for the FBI.",
        "That stuck out at me because it was a weird story in broken English written about an issue that tends to stoke political and cultural divisions.",
        "And that was something we saw a lot of in the social media disinformation campaigns during the election was the discussion surrounding things like Black Lives Matter, which were very much in the news and very divisive.",
        "And it's very easy to sort of stoke outrage from either side on an issue like that.",
        "So the idea of running a story like that would be to - what?",
        "- have it retweeted, passed along by email, Facebook, other social media platforms to as many people as possible.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think it appeals to a certain subset of, you know, if you're not being too charitable, trolls that inhabit sort of social media and digital spaces, something that is likely to be shared and passed around among, you know, say, a hardcore group of right-wing political commentators.",
        "It probably won't have much reach outside of that.",
        "But for a site like that, if you're able to get a more popular but perhaps equally fringe-oriented news organization - a place like Alex Jones' Infowars or The Gateway Pundit or some of these popular but fringy pro-Trump organizations.",
        "If you get one of them to pick up on it, you could potentially expand the reach of some piece of content dramatically.",
        "Don't they also run articles that might appeal, if that's the word, to people on the left?",
        "They do.",
        "And I think that speaks to a broader and very fascinating phenomenon of the last two or three years in American politics of the melding, sort of, of elements of the far left and far right on issues such as military non-interventionism or free trade.",
        "I think there is a strange confluence that you see on other Russian media channels, such as RT, that very often do take a, in some senses, left-wing position on certain - especially geopolitical issues.",
        "I think you saw that a lot on Syria, for instance.",
        "People who were disinclined to support military intervention or further military action happened to be aligned, in many cases, with the position of the Russian government."

        "Michael Cohen's expected to say that the bad far outweighs the good in Donald Trump and that since taking office, Donald Trump has, quote, \"\"become the worst version of himself.\"\" Michael Cohen, in his prepared testimony, will go on to say that, quote, \"\"he is capable of being loyal.\"\" That's Donald Trump.",
        "But he is fundamentally disloyal.\"\" He also describes Trump as very sensitive to any suggestions that he's not smart.",

        "Which is your past experience with Michael Cohen, right?",

        "Well, there are multiple versions of Michael Cohen.",
        "And we're going to see a different version of Michael Cohen today.",
        "Michael Cohen in the past has, for many years, been Donald Trump's so-called fixer - the person and the lawyer who would go out of his way to try to fix problems - financial, legal - that arose for Trump and his organization.",
        "And that's not a role he cedes to playing until he was confronted with possible criminal or legal problems that arose over the course of this investigation.",
        "Well, let's talk about one of those legal problems.",
        "Cohen has admitted to participating in a crime, a campaign finance crime, covering - paying what was, effectively, an illegal campaign contribution - paying to cover up one of Mr. Trump's affairs right before the election.",
        "What does he describe as President Trump's role in that alleged crime?",
        "So in his prepared testimony, Michael Cohen is expected to say that Trump personally signed a check from his personal bank account to reimburse money to Michael Cohen for hush money.",
        "That's hush money that Cohen later pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations for.",
        "But according to several media outlets, what's especially new and interesting today is that Cohen is expected to list several documents, including copies of checks and financial statements, that support his testimony that Trump's personal bank account provided these funds.",
        "And these checks were written after he became president, as late as August 2017.",
        "He's also expected to go into great detail about the payments he made to Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump before he was president.",
        "He's going to say that the president directed him to make these payments and describes it as a, quote, \"\"criminal scheme.",

        "But I don't think we could really get to the heart of what a big bombshell this is.",

        "He's also bringing documents.",
        "And documents, generally, are the gold standard when you come to testify as evidence of the fact of what you're saying is true.",
        "How, in this prepared testimony that's been published in full by several news organizations, does Cohen try to link the president to Russia's effort to help elect President Trump in 2016?",
        "One of the big questions during the campaign and ever since has been what foreknowledge, if any, Donald Trump had about the WikiLeaks release of Democratic National Committee emails.",
        "That's been one of the major issues over the last few years.",
        "And Cohen is expected to say that as a presidential candidate, he knew that Roger Stone was talking to Julian Assange about this WikiLeaks drop of DNC emails.",
        "He also is expected to say that Trump knew about the release of hacked DNC emails ahead of time.",
        "And also, with regards to these Trump-Moscow negotiations during the campaign, he says Trump knew of them, knew of this business project.",

        "Cohen says Trump never expected to win.",
