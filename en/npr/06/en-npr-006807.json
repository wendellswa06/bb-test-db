        "And it was very exciting, although not really for the U.S.",
        "There was some bad luck.",
        "They lost one of their competitors before the event even began, had to add a new team member.",
        "And then, they had two fabulous, really three clean jumping rounds from the U.S.",

        "team finished fourth.",
        "There was an individual from the U.S.",
        "team, Becky Holder, who was in second place after cross-country and was really poised to take an individual medal.",
        "And then her horse, in the morning - you have to trot for the vets.",
        "This is the idea of this three-day event is that your horse can have the presence when they're fit to run, gallop really four miles, they can do this dressage test, then go gallop a cross-country, and then come back and have the stamina left, the ability to do the stadium jumping.",
        "And her horse did not trot for the judges Sunday morning.",
        "So she didn't even do the stadium round.",
        "What is it like as these different events are going on?",
        "Describe the scene for us a little bit.",
        "It really was - I can only describe it's like a world's fair for horse people.",
        "To have 50,000 people - and the Kentucky Horse Park is 1,200 acres.",
        "So it is an enormous place.",
        "But there are - you know, there was an equine village where there were demonstrations and vendors and, you know, things that you could do, things for kids to do.",
        "You could -there were places where you could sit, ride or rein, for all these, you know, English people, ride English - you know, to try a Western horse.",
        "There were mechanical horses that you could try.",
        "Literally, there are a couple of different places there are mechanical horses you could sign up to ride these fancy mechanical horses that you could tell you, you know, what - where you were sitting wrong or using your leg wrong.",
        "Lots of things to buy.",
        "Horse people love to buy things for their horses and for themselves.",
        "Lots to eat, lots to drink.",

        "They didn't like that very much.",

        "Oh, just wander around and see the scene?",
        "You can wander around and see the scene.",
        "And as I say, there is a ton to do.",
        "Now, the other thing I should mention is that many of the horse organizations are housed there at the Kentucky Horse Park -the United States Equestrian Association, the United States Dressage Association, United States Pony Club, the American Saddlebred Association.",
        "So they're all on the ground there.",
        "Their headquarters are there.",
        "There's an enormous museum of the horse that's an affiliate of the Smithsonian.",
        "We actually spent a good hour there and didn't get to see all of that.",

        "It is.",

        "But again, I think the type of horse that it is, it can do some things unbelievably well and I think other things probably not quite as well.",
        "But it was funny at the very end, the rider was so excited that he threw off, you know, his hat and with such big flare that he terrified his horse and he almost fell off.",

        "And the horse maintained perfect form.",
        "It just took my breath away, the whole ride.",
        "Yes, he was showboating, I believe.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "For people who don't ride, the one-tempi changes are one of the very difficult things that they do in very upper level dressage where the horse changes the lead of his canter at every stride.",
        "And it's something that only the very, very, very top horses can do.",
        "And indeed, the Spanish rider did it with his reins in one hand, which was kind of -which I think some judges might have found that, perhaps, in the world of, you know, kind of buttoned-up dressage, maybe a little bit much."

        "The World Equestrian Games, all of the riders actually have to qualify, and it's the top riders of the world.",
        "So you might get seven riders in one country and no riders from other countries.",
