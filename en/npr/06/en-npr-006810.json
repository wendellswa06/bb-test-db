        "Sometimes the laughter is nervous, and he likes to try to make you think.",
        "His new book is, in part, a memoir of his friendship with Richard Pryor, but it also describes his life and work, his belief that stand-up is the only place in the entertainment industry where a black man can speak honestly, and the battles with Hollywood that illustrate his point.",

        "We were allowed to study the machine by Andrew Apell(ph), who bought the machines at auction when a county in North Carolina decommissioned them.",

        "Tell us what you did.",
        "So what we found is that an attacker who has brief physical access to the machine the night before an election - for example, when it's left unattended outside a polling place - is able to manipulate the machine in such a way that he can induce it to misbehave the next day, on election day, and appear to run the election faithfully but then shift votes at the end of the day from one candidate to another.",
        "And in this way, the findings dovetail with those that previous studies have found for other voting machines, and in fact for other studies of the same voting machine, but along the way we had a couple of different features to - what we found that we think have larger implications for voting security.",
        "Such as?",
        "Well, first, our study, unlike most of the previous studies, was conducted without source code.",
        "Source code is the blueprints that specify how a machine's software behaves, and the voting venders, and in fact most software manufacturers, keep the source code carefully guarded."

        "They don't distribute it or make it available to researchers and certainly don't make it available to attackers, and because many of the previous studies actually have used the source code because they were conducted under the aegis of, for example, a secretary of state who was able to negotiate access, some critics, some venders, some voting officials, in fact, have argued that these studies represented an unrealistic amount of access, that the researchers could study the machines using information that would simply not be available to actual attackers, and that therefore the breaks that they described would not have been found by those attackers.",
        "So you were able to go in without having to have that propriety source code.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The only thing that we had to study was the physical artifacts themselves, which is something that an attacker could get, again, by, for example, taking a truck to a polling place and stealing a machine.",
        "And it might cost a little bit more.",
        "The information is in form that's less convenient and less accessible, but I would argue that the cost in time and money for our study was still quite reasonable and small compared to the amount of money that people actually spend on elections.",
        "Well, if you could get - steal a machine - I shouldn't say steal a machine.",
        "If someone could steal a machine, or you could buy a machine and look at the machine and not have to have the source code and then go in and hack the machine the night before, it doesn't say very much about the security of electronic voting, does it?",
        "Well, I think more than that, what it says is, first of all, that writing software and designing systems is hard, and software has bugs, and that's not altogether surprising.",
        "Certainly all the software that we use every day has bugs, and perhaps what it says more is that relying on either having software and systems that are perfect and never make mistakes or on having the system make mistakes only in ways that attackers would not be smart enough to be able to find, for example by stealing and analyzing a machine, is not a good way to build trust in elections.",
        "So what would be the best way to do that?",
        "What would you recommend for - your best list, your best way to run an election?",
        "So I think what we need is we need some system whereby the voters can see an independent record of their vote so that they can check is actually what is recorded the way that they intended the vote to be cast, and right now the best way that we know how to do that is with paper.",
        "In other words, if I see that I wanted to vote a particular way, and I see paper that has that writing, then I can check that that's correct, and then that can be counted separately from any sort of machine misbehavior, whether intentional or unintentional, later by the voting officials or by other observers.",
        "So if you had a paper ballot that was marked, and then that ballot was kept and fed through the machine and stored later, you'd have a paper record, and you'd be able to match and verify what it said on the machine versus what you put on the paper.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And at the very least, you would have two independent records - namely, what the machine thinks the outcome the election was and what the stack of paper thinks the outcome of the election was, if you recounted it all by hand.",
        "And you would be able to compare and, in an ideal scenario, to perform audits that give you statistical confidence that the election was, in fact, decided the way that you think it was."

        "If I hear you saying that basically any machine can be hacked because they're computers, and these machines are secured, it says to me that remote voting, like we talk about possibly some day Internet voting, is an even less secure way of voting, and we shouldn't be aiming for that.",
        "Would that be correct?",
        "So Internet voting brings a whole bunch of additional complications, but certainly Internet voting in the typical formulation, where people actually vote at home on their home computers, is voting with computers, because computers are involved, and so all the same risks apply, and all the same reasons apply why you might want to have paper records, at least as an additional component.",
        "When you vote on the Internet, you have the additional complications, for example, of having the votes transmitted over a public network that someone might want, for example, to shut down to keep certain people in a district that he knows to lean the wrong way from voting.",

        "Since we happen to use those machines in Louisiana, my question is, is that if you manipulate one machine, can you use that same information to manipulate the machine next to it, or would you have to create a different thing for the different machine?",
        "Are the machines unique?",
        "Good question.",
        "So I should say first that the version of the Sequoia AVC Advancers that we studied is not exactly the version that's in use in Louisiana, and so the particular flaw that we exploited, we don't know whether it applies to the Louisiana machines."

        "Beyond that, based on the machines that we studied, most of the hard work that's required to come up with the attack is something that can be done once for the particular class of machines.",
        "Okay.",
        "The particular thing that you need to stick into the machine the night before, when you have your few moments' access, is slightly different depending on the machine that you're - the actual physical machine that you're working on, but that's not really a lot of work to produce.",
        "But once you've figured out what you're doing, you would have to have access to each machine.",
        "That's right.",
        "This is not a wholesale attack in the sense that it's possible to take over an entire county's machines without having to manipulate each one.",
        "But would anybody who operates the machine know that it had been hacked?",
        "Our demonstration attack, as far as we know, leaves really just one small signal that something is not quite right, and we think that that might easily be missed.",
        "Otherwise, it's a perfect simulation, as far as we know, of an election, and certainly an attacker who was more motivated to keep his attack stealthy might be able to improve on what we did.",
        "Could you make it show any number of votes that you want to, from one to, what, a million or a thousand more in the machine?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We are effectively, and this is the other new twist to our findings - we're effectively running arbitrary code on the machine despite the fact that we're not injecting code, and so we are able simply to rewrite the machine's conception of what has happened, of what votes were cast and how they were cast, however it is that we want.",
        "So we can have a machine report that of the five votes cast four went to Benedict Arnold and one went to George Washington rather than all five to Washington.",
        "Or we could claim that, in fact, a million votes had been cast.",
        "That is, of course, something that might stand out when the officials are looking at their machine."
