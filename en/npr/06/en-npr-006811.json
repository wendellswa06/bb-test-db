        "Yeah.",
        "That would be, as we say, a dead giveaway.",

        "We haven't timed the actual procedure that's required.",
        "There's a certain element of practice.",
        "You have to pick some of the locks that are on the outside.",
        "But certainly it's a paralizable operation in the sense that if you have 100 machines all in a warehouse, then you might have 10 people go in and each one do 10.",

        "I mean, it's sort of low-payoff behavior.",
        "To affect one machine in one precinct is going to have a real minimal effect compared to, say, hacking into the central tabulation machines in the state capital.",
        "Well, you might want to ask Norm Coleman about that in Minnesota.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I know that, I know that, you know, there's a lot of people who think that, you know, impact on a few individual machines, you know, could have a big effect."

        "And then the other comment I've got is on the notion of having a sort of a receipt.",
        "You know, we've got several hundred years of practicing elections, the whole point of which has been to keep the ballots secret, to not have any kind of proof as to how a particular - which way a particular person voted.",
        "You know, the notion of that was to prevent voter fraud.",
        "You give him a receipt, they take it back to, you know, whoever put them up to this and they can prove how they voted…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…you know, in order to get their payoff or whatever.",
        "The whole notion was to keep it secret.",
        "This really hasn't been an issue until, you know, the last few years, where suddenly now the entire process has become untrustworthy.",

        "Do you have another trick up your sleeve here?",
        "Well, I should say that the one trick that we have already had up our sleeve is that the voting machine that we studied, the AVC Advantage, when we were performing the reverse engineering, we discovered that it included a defense that appeared to prevent exactly the attacks that we were able to carry out.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I don't - you know, I can't speak for others.",
        "I mean, I can speak for what I've experienced, but I - you know, I can - I don't know.",

        "It's interesting, though.",
        "You say when you were starting out in Los Angeles, there were times when you would deliberately try to make your audience uncomfortable.",
        "And the way that that defense worked was that the traditional way when an attacker, for example, finds a flaw in Windows or Firefox or some other software program, that he takes advantage of that flaw is that he loads into that program's memory new code, new machine instructions that specify how he wants that program to misbehave.",
        "And then he uses the flaw to induce the program to run that code effectively.",
        "This is like installing a new program on your computer and having that program run.",
        "And then the program does whatever it is that the attacker wants to have happen, to send out spam, for example.",
        "The Sequoia AVC Advantage does not allow that.",
        "It has a defense where it will simply not execute new instructions, a new program loaded into its writable memory, the memory that we're able to affect.",
        "The only place that it'll load programs from is from the writable - sorry - from the unwritable, read-only chips that are stored inside the machine that we would have to open up the case to replace by hand.",
        "So you sort of have invented sort of a vaccine to prevent the infection?",
        "So in a sense, I think the designers of the AVC Advantage thought that they had…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…created this vaccine.",
        "But, in fact, using a new technique called return-oriented programming, we were able to work around that.",
        "I see.",
        "And the way that return-oriented programming works in the somewhat morbid analogy that my co-author, Alex Halderman, came up with is the way that a kidnapper, instead of writing down a ransom note in his own handwriting, would take magazine headlines and cut them up and rearrange the pieces to form the message that he wants to send.",

        "We don't believe that return-oriented programming can be effectively defended…",
        "Wow.",
        "…defended against.",
        "But the - kind of the bigger lesson with this sort of attack that recombines instructions that are already present and puts them together to create the functionality that we actually wanted to induce the machine to undertake, the vote stealing functionality, is that it wasn't actually devised until 2007, which was some two decades after the machine was created.",
        "And so what this really says is that when you design a voting machine that's going to have a service lifetime of two decades, three decades, even more, you have to design to defend not against just the attacks that you know about, but even attacks that haven't even been devised, unknown attacks.",
        "And that, to us, seems like an extremely difficult engineering challenge because you have to build in effectively security tolerances that we don't really understand.",
        "All right.",
        "And so we think that the right way to proceed is to sidestep this whole thing and, again, to go to paper.",
        "To go to paper and then do the - and then you have the ballots and you'll have the ability to re-read them over and over again.",
        "And you can actually take the paper offsite, right?",
        "You can store the real ballots, the used ballots someplace else and be able to read them again.",
        "That's right.",
        "I should mention, by the way, in answer to the call, that I didn't mean to imply that there's a receipt that the voter gets to take home, because, again, that is exactly what enables vote buying or voter coercion.",
        "You either have what's called the voter-verifiable paper audit trail attached to these electronic voting machines that's sort of under glass in a printer where the voter can observe, but not manipulate or take home that printout, or you have paper ballots.",
        "And in either case, this has to make it back to county headquarters and be audited and recounted.",
