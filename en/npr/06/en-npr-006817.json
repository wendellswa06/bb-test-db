        "Right.",
        "He's expressing, I would say, the more optimistic point of view.",
        "You do get a more mixed point of view when you talk to US military officials who are engaged in the training, and they say that there is progress with these troops.",
        "But they do their job with a lot of support from US troops.",
        "Even those Iraqi units who are operating on their own have American forces to call for backup and for the kinds of special equipment that they don't have.",
        "So while what the president says is true, they're making progress, there are a lot of major concerns still with those Iraqi security forces.",
        "He went into a lot of detail about military preparedness.",
        "There had been this comment from the US commander over there, General George Casey, in September, testifying before a Senate panel.",
        "He said that there was one combat-ready battalion of Iraqi forces.",
        "This is only 700 men, and the president went into some detail about what that meant.",
        "Not every Iraqi unit has to meet this level of capability in order for the Iraqi security forces to take the lead in the fight against the enemy.",
        "As a matter of fact, there are some battalions from NATO militaries that would not be able to meet this standard.",
        "What he's saying it means is that these guys are able to take over, in a way, sooner, in a way that would eventually relieve US forces of some of those duties.",
        "But he wouldn't set a timetable.",
        "We really don't have any more information than we had before on when US troops are going to pull out.",
        "He did say that there is--and he did indicate that the White House has released this 35-page plan called our National Strategy for Victory in Iraq.",
        "He noted this at the White House Web site, whitehouse.gov, and there are more specifics there.",
        "That's right.",
        "While there are specifics, the outline is still very, very general and it really falls along with the president's plan from 2003.",
        "And the bottom line is failure is not an option."
