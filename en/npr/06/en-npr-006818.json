        "Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's announcement Friday of her retirement sets the stage for a potentially epic political battle for the future of the court.",
        "President Bush says he wants a new justice confirmed by the Senate in time for the start of the court's next session, which begins three months from now.",
        "In the past, the president has also said he would like to appoint someone in the image of conservative Justices Antonin Scalia or Clarence Thomas.",
        "Such an appointment would almost certainly prompt a protracted debate in the Senate and possibly a filibuster that would make a speedy confirmation unlikely.",
        "Coming up, a report on how special interest groups are preparing for the confirmation process, but first, we're joined by WEEKEND EDITION legal adviser and University of Colorado law Professor Mimi Wesson.",
        "Mimi, welcome back to the program.",
        "Thanks, Liane.",
        "First, give us a brief perspective on Sandra Day O'Connor's 24 years as a Supreme Court justice.",
        "Well, first, Liane, this battle over the future of the court comes at a time when its prestige is pretty low among the American people.",
        "In a recent Gallup poll, only 41 percent of the respondents said they had a great deal of confidence or a lot of confidence in the court.",
        "So that's a real low point for the court's public image.",
        "So in this context looking back over Justice O'Connor's career, one of the questions that many are asking is: Was she inconsistent or was she just nuanced?",
        "Public perceptions about the court often seem to think that the justices are dictators.",
        "They just decide cases the way they strike them at the moment.",
        "They're not applying any overarching timeless principle.",
        "So that's a damaging perception.",
        "And some would say that Justice O'Connor's reputation as a swing voter contributed to that reputation.",
        "Her mantra as a justice was always, `Stay close to the record,' meaning look closely at the precise facts of the case before you.",
        "And so she often saw and acted on distinctions that others saw as small ones.",
        "Anthony, before we let you go, do you mind if I ask you - just comment on the overall environment.",
        "You know, often, when there's kind of a big, international event like this, it kind of takes over the imagination of the people.",
        "And I just wondered, did you get a sense of that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I mean, there were lots of events here.",
        "There were prayer meetings, there were - you know, near city hall, and there's a huge floral display made up of flowers in the shape of the Korean peninsula.",
        "And, you know, while the outside world looks mostly at the nuclear issue, this is a divided country.",
        "People here have families that have been split up because of the Korean War for more than 70 years.",
        "And so the issue of ties between the two Koreas sort of took the spotlight here.",
        "And it was very emotional, and the focus was a little bit different from the outside world."

        "Joining us to discuss this news, is Dahlia Lithwick, she's legal analyst for the online magazine Slate, and for us here at DAY TO DAY.",
        "And Dahlia, first give us some background, what was the policy on detainees before - regarding the Geneva Conventions.",
        "Well Madeleine, you'll remember in 2002 the Bush administration announced that the Geneva Convention simply do not apply to al-Qaida because \"\"They were illegal combatants, they didn't wear uniforms, they didn't represent a nation state.\"\" And at the time, Alberto Gonzales, now the Attorney General, dismissed them as \"\"quaint\"\" - they were just irrelevant to this new kind of war.",
        "So, even though the administration said, look we're voluntarily complying with the basic rights guaranteed in Geneva, they really made a point of saying Geneva does not apply to these people.",
        "And in fact, they set up these military tribunals - these commissions at Guantanamo Bay - precisely because they wanted to create some new form of law, that didn't necessarily offer all the protections that would have been guaranteed under the Geneva Convention."

        "It was interesting Madeleine, Tony Snow today said \"\"This is not really a reversal of policy\"\" but in fact it's a sea change.",
        "The truth is, if the administration had agreed all along to be bound by the Geneva Conventions, we wouldn't be having many of these arguments in the first place.",
        "So, I don't think it's fair to say this is a tiny tweak, this is a major concession that they have very, very hard-fought, but lost.",
        "The point that, as a matter of law, Geneva does not apply to these detainees.",
        "And I think that this is a big concession, it needs to be recognized as that.",

        "Well that's right.",

        "And the court said, not only are we going strike down these military commissions, that Bush had sort of invented to try the detainees at Guantanomo, but expressly said Article Three of the Geneva Conventions.",
        "It's called the Common Article 3, because it's in all of the conventions.",
        "Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions does apply to these detainees, and that the detainees can mount challenges in Federal Court.",
        "So it was a very, very clear renunciation of the Bush tact that said, they don't need to abide by Geneva.",
        "And in response to that, I think we had today's announcement.",
        "And what are the implications of today's announcement, because simultaneously, we've got hearings going on on Capitol Hill, dealing with this very issue.",
        "That's right, I mean we know at the most basic sense, that Article three of the Geneva Conventions prohibits torture.",
        "We are less clear on the sort of procedural rights - Geneva guarantees, sort of, basic legal rights... The quote in Geneva - and it's a little fuzzy, is - these are rights that are \"\"Judicial guarantees recognized as indispensable by civilized people\"\".",
        "So what does that mean?",
        "We're not clear, but it probably means that the objection that the Supreme Court had in Hamdan, to some of the aspects of these military tribunals.",
        "For instance, defendants could be barred from attending their own trial, evidence obtained by torture could be used against them.",
        "Those kind of things probably exceed that notion of what are sort of basic judicial guarantees.",
        "So, certainly Congress is now going to fight that out, you know, what are the parameters of fair trials under Geneva.",
        "But at least the question of, can Congress sort of write Geneva out of the picture, is now off the table.",
