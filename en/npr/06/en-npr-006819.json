        "Talk a little bit more about the past court term.",
        "Of course, you mentioned the Ten Commandments case which got a lot of attention, but there was also a case in which the court struck down federal sentencing guidelines, and there was a medical marijuana case in California.",
        "Do you sense a theme in any of these cases?",
        "This last term was so rich in material and many sort of interwoven themes that could be pursued, but I myself was struck by how other justices, not just Justice O'Connor, are often wrestling with this question about how particular to be when you're deciding whether two cases that are similar ought to be decided the same or whether there's some important difference between the two of them.",
        "In the medical marijuana case, which had to do with an important project of the court's conservative wing which is called federalism, the court was trying to decide whether Congress had the power to regulate a very small localized activity, the cultivation and consumption of marijuana by patients who had medical prescriptions that were actually recognized in the state of California.",
        "The federalist view would have been that--or the sort of pure federalist view would have been that the Congress doesn't have any power here, but Justice Scalia voted with the court's usual liberal wing to uphold the California law because he thought the cases were different.",

        "What does it mean to you when that term is used?",
        "Well, it used to mean willingness to strike down state or federal government acts on the grounds that the Constitution forbad them, but the president has both criticized judicial activism and said that he wants more justices like Scalia and Thomas which leads me to wonder, like: Wouldn't it have been activist to strike down a federal statute regulating the use of marijuana, as Thomas would have done in the medical marijuana case?",
        "Wasn't it activist to interpret the Constitution to strike down federal sentencing guidelines and throw the federal criminal courts into disarray as both Scalia and Thomas voted to do?",
