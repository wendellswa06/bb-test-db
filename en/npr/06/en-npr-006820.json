        "Yes.",
        "And there are six of them.",
        "You know, you have a problem with just four wheels on your car spinning helplessly--imagine adding two more that Opportunity has.",
        "And then you throw in the fact that you can't pull over a bunch of guys to help you rock the car back and forth, and you really are faced with a big problem: how to get unstuck without digging yourself even deeper.",
        "Well, how did the rover get stuck in the first place?",
        "Well, it was sort of a combination of bad luck and, I think, a bit of carelessness.",
        "Opportunity has spent the last 16 months rolling around the flat surface of a martian plain.",
        "And with this unimagined longevity of the rover, NASA controllers were getting a little bit confident, maybe overconfident in its ability to conquer just about any terrain that it found.",
        "And they wanted to cover as much ground as possible.",
        "So mission controllers had the rover set to something called blind drive mode.",
        "Now you know already from the name that there's going to be trouble here.",
        "Blind drive mode means that the Rover was moving very fast, covering almost 700 feet, and not paying a lot of attention to the terrain, since NASA hadn't had very much trouble navigating before.",
        "Well, as can be expected, on its way toward visiting its third crater, it got bogged down on a small sand dune--not really much of anything, about a foot high--and it couldn't get out.",
        "The wheels just kept on spinning.",
        "And you know from driving your own car, you don't want to continue spinning those wheels because you just dig yourself in deeper.",
        "So they took quite a bit of time to figure this out.",
        "They took a few weeks, in fact, to figure out just the right way to spin the wheels to get the rover out of this sand trap.",
        "And they solved the problem.",
        "And it really turned out to be an interesting story because it turned out that this sand was a much different kind than they had encountered before.",
        "And having learned this lesson, the blind drive is now off, the kids have given back the car keys, so to speak, and the rover is working again.",
        "So that's a relief.",
        "They just figured out how to move the wheels in the right way to get it out?",
        "Yeah, they had--you know, they didn't want to sit there wasting time and effort in digging the rover in.",
        "They had to figure out the right sequence of wheels and how many turns, and which wheel to turn when to get it out of this trap, which they did.",
        "So NASA has been pretty successful with its missions to Mars, and it's planning another one soon.",
        "Right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And actually, they've got a couple more lined up in the near future.",
        "There's this Phoenix mission that's going to be a stationary robot that will explore the northern plains of Mars, sort of like the area on Earth that would have permafrost on it.",
        "And they're looking for that permafrost because they have a shovel here that they want to dig down into the soil and look for ice, water ice, which would mean that possibly, you know, life might have existed there in the past or maybe even in the present.",
        "And then there's another rover that's scheduled to launch in 2009.",
        "This will be like a science laboratory on wheels.",
        "And they will look specifically for signs of life on Mars.",
        "And those things are coming up, and more ahead.",

        "Two restaurant operators confirmed to NPR that they had delivered carryout lunches to guards in this way in the past.",
        "They wouldn't agree to be interviewed on tape or let their names be used because they don't want to risk losing business they get delivering food to prison employees.",

        "He's at the National Guard Hospital, which may indicate either that it's just tests, which is what the official announcement said, or that it's something that was immediately life-threatening.",
        "Has the king, in his 90s, actually been the person who's been running Saudi Arabia?",
        "Well, yes, he has.",
        "The king is also the prime minister, and he just did a Cabinet shakeup.",
        "He appointed six or seven new Cabinet ministers just last month.",
        "I don't know how many hours a day he's able to focus on business, but he's the boss.",
        "And is there a transition plan in place in the event of his death?",
        "There is, which he created.",
        "He put in place, maybe six years ago, a succession law generally referred to as the allegiance law, which created a committee of 35 senior princes whose job it is to manage the succession."
