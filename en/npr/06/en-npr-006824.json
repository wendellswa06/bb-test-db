        "If that timeline is right, the United States and its allies have only about a year and a half before they'll have no opportunity to block Iran from building a bomb, should it decide to do so.",

        "There are key officials in the regime that have thought since day one after the 1979 revolution.",
        "So, disproving that theory in their mind is a Herculean task.",

        "When you have over three decades of not talking, when you have over three decades of politicians in both Washington and Tehran making careers out of proving how nasty they can be to the other side, it gets very difficult for leaders, both in a democracy like ours and in an authoritarian regime like theirs, to be willing to take risks for peace.",
        "It's much easier to escalate the conflict.",
