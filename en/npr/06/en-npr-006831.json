        "Closing arguments are to be delivered today in the first war crimes trial held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
        "Salim Hamdan was one of Osama bin Laden's drivers.",
        "He's charged with conspiracy and material support for terrorism, and if convicted could face a life sentence.",
        "The government says Hamdan was part of bin Laden's inner circle, and that he'd sworn a personal oath of allegiance to the al-Qaida leader.",
        "The defense says he was just a lowly hired driver.",
        "NPR's John McChesney reports.",
        "Much of this proceeding has been shrouded in secrecy.",
        "The prosecution presented 14 witnesses, most of them FBI agents.",
        "Four of their witnesses were anonymous.",
        "The defense presented eight witnesses, and two of them testified in closed session because the government said their testimony should be classified.",
        "And two other defense witnesses were so-called high- value detainees who answered questions only in writing.",
        "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed architect of 9/11, said that Hamdan was only a driver and wasn't educated enough to participate in planning attacks.",
        "That's correct.",
        "Actually, later that day, the Marines attempted to take the memory cards away from me to delete the images.",
        "I notified them that they were not within their legal grounds to do that.",
        "I believe that they got information from their commanders that that was correct, and so at the time, it was left alone.",
        "I spent the next four days editing the images, waited until the family members of the Marines who had been killed - made sure that they had been notified.",
        "I made sure that all of the images that I was going to publish did not display any identifiable features, any nametags, anything in which the family members could recognize these men, and made sure that I was in compliance with the media hold-harmless agreement, which is a document that you have to sign as an embedded journalist which provides certain rules for your time embedded.",
        "And then you decided to put some of these images on your Website.",
        "Correct.",
        "I actually set my website up so that people couldn't accidentally stumble upon the images.",
        "I set it up so that the front page of my website had a disclaimer, that you were about to witness graphic images that included death and, you know, portrayed this day.",
        "You could click on this link.",
        "It would take you to another page in which there was another series of disclaimers and written text about the day before you finally saw the graphic images.",
        "And tell us what their reaction was, first, from the Marines you were embedded with.",
        "The Marines I was embedded with supported me.",
        "I showed them the images that I'd had taken.",
        "I showed them the text that I had written.",
        "I showed them the blog post before it was actually published, and the ones that I spoke to all supported me.",
        "They said they could not identify their friends.",
        "They felt that I'd done, you know, a dignified documentation of what happened that day.",
        "And then from the chain of command.",
        "Several hours after posting the blog, I got a phone call from the chain of command in Camp Fallujah.",
        "They told me that I needed to immediately take my blog offline and that I had violated a rule by displaying photos of killed or injured Marines.",
        "I immediately said that there was no such rule and that I was absolutely sure of this because I'd signed all the documents.",
        "Within 10 minutes, they'd arranged a special convoy to remove me from my embed and take me back to the main base to await air transport out of the area."

        "I've gotten dozens and dozens of emails since this has happened from military public affairs officers all around the world who have said that this was not the intended use for this clause and that this clause was set up to prevent photographers from taking pictures of vehicles that have been damaged by IED and roadside-bomb attacks, thus giving the enemy information on the placement of their bombs and how, you know, how to better place their weapons in the future to cause the most damage, not for the situation that they applied it in my case.",

        "Just hours after the bomb blasts, it was reported by New York Times, Washington Post, Reuters.",
        "There was no strategic tactical information, and this has been confirmed by many people in the military who have written me and said that they've reviewed my photos and my posts personally and that there is no information that they could find in it that would be of any use to the enemy and no information that really was new information, nothing that had already not been described.",

        "Vickers of the 1st Regimental Combat Team who knew two of the Marines killed at Karmah and said photographs of his dead comrades displayed on the Internet for all to see desecrated their memory and their sacrifice.",
        "Quote, \"\"Mr.",
        "Miller's complete lack of respect to these Marines, their friends, and families is shameful\"\".",
        "Captain Vickers said, how do we explain to their children or family these disturbing images just days after it happened?",
        "Well, all I can say to that is that I have, since this incident, been in touch with friends and family of these men, and I can tell you that they don't all feel the way that a lot of people believe that they would feel.",
        "I think there's a lot of different ways of looking at the subject, and I think not everyone believes that showing images of someone in the way in which they died desecrates their memory or does anything other than respect and honor the sacrifice that they gave for our country.",
        "There have been some who are angry with you, though.",
        "That's correct."

        "To ignore something just because it might upset certain people I don't believe is a fair representation of the truth.",

        "In what way?",
        "Well, they, you know, they removed me from my ability to report in Iraq.",

        "Correct.",
        "And I think another really important thing to look at is the different ways in which they can prevent images from being seen by the public.",
        "I mean, the first kind of commonly used approach is trying to make sure that photographers and journalist don't end up in areas where major attacks will happen or, you know, they don't end up on major military offensives.",
        "If they do, the other line of response is to try to keep you in a vehicle or to keep you from accessing the scene to take pictures.",
        "If you end up there, like I did, to take pictures, they can attempt to take your memory cards away from you, and then if you finally get the pictures out to the public, they can make sure that you're not able to report again.",
