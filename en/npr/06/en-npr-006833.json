        "NPR's Debbie Elliott was in court when the verdicts were read and she joins us now.",
        "And, Debbie, what a remarkable fall for the man who was the face of New Orleans, as we all remember, during Hurricane Katrina.",
        "It really is.",
        "With today's verdict, Ray Nagin becomes the first ever New Orleans mayor - or former mayor now - ever convicted of federal corruption.",
        "This happened to a man who, when he first won office back in 2002, he was a political outsider.",
        "He campaigned that he was a businessman; that he was going to bring order to city hall, he was going to clean things up.",
        "So this was certainly a stinging defeat for him.",
        "Nagin had staked his defense on his own credibility.",
        "He took the witness stand in hopes that he could convince the jury that he wasn't actively involved in city contracting decisions, that somehow he was just doing his duty when he would put his signature on the contracts in question.",
        "All along he has denied taking bribes, saying that contractors were making, quote, \"\"legitimate investments\"\" in his family's business.",
        "Well, remind us of some of the charges which he's now been convicted.",
        "Bribery, conspiracy, money laundering, honest services, wire fraud.",
        "You know, throughout this trial, prosecutors painted this picture of what they called was a mayor on the take.",
        "He was profiting from his public office by accepting money, free gifts.",
        "He took some trips paid for by contractors to places like Jamaica, Las Vegas, New York, Chicago, all at a time when these certain businessmen needed something in exchange from the city.",
        "Five former associates of Ray Nagin's, who had either pleaded guilty or been convicted themselves, took the witness stand, testified against him.",
        "And then there was a bit of paper evidence backing everything up, as well; for instance, bills showing that he took his family to extravagant dinners and then charged it to a city credit card.",
        "I recall Ray Nagin as a very composed, cool man.",
        "As he heard the verdicts, what was it like in court today?",
        "Also very composed and cool, did not show a whole lot of reaction.",
        "Now, I was sitting behind his wife who did flinch the moment she heard the judge read that first guilty verdict.",
        "And then by the time, you know, all 21 were read, she was, you know, reduced to tears and was being consoled by some other family members or friends.",
        "Nagin passed by her, patted her hand, said: Hang in.",

        "The border has never been well defined.",
        "You may know there are property farms where part of the farm in the northwest is in Canada and part of the farm is in the United States.",

        "Routinely, we have small helicopters that come and draw up hockey bags that are full of BC Bud, a very lethal type of hydroponically grown marijuana.",
        "We know methamphetamines of all kinds are coming through ports and between the ports.",
        "It's important to understand what those things are.",
        "But, also, importantly, an opportunity to expose this technology and its capability to the local, political and law enforcement infrastructures.",
        "Because we had the Predator deployed to North Dakota during the floods this spring, we were actually able to assist the state of North Dakota by flying overhead missions with the Predator, supporting their emergency operation center and response and recovery people on the ground.",
        "And a hypothetical, though, I mean, considering you have the capability, really, to, I don't know, zero in on a dime from, like, five miles up or more, hypothetical - that library on the border - half in the United States, half in Canada - does the Predator B have the capability to look inside that library and see who's there?",
        "No.",
        "You know, it's really not that kind of thing.",
        "This is a concern that people do have.",
        "They're afraid that these unmanned drones are going to be able to go over their houses and see who's in there, see what they're doing.",
        "So, it feels like an invasion of privacy.",
        "In addition to that, are there missions that require probable cause?",
        "You know, we use the unmanned assets in exactly the same way as we use the manned assets.",
        "We really use the aircrafts and the sensors to support on-the-ground interdictions.",
        "And they're used in areas where, and only in areas, quite frankly, where we expect there's some elicit activity going on."

        "And that evidence can't be used in other proceedings.",
