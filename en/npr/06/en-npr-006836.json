        "Well, thank you for having me on here.",
        "Senator Tester, you and Harold Ford, Jr. are my two favorite Democrats.",
        "My question for you is, it seems to me, and I'd like your comment about this, that you and Barack Obama and even a Harold Ford represent a new generation of Democrats who weren't brought up in the sort of the '60s cultural wars that have so defined our politics.",
        "You know, Clinton and Gingrich they didn't just - they didn't oppose each other, they hated each other.",
        "And it seems, you know, how much of this, you know, with the western Democrats and you a representative of the West and this post-Baby Boomer Generation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, first of all, thanks for the kind remarks.",
        "Harold Ford is one heck of a good fellow and I like him a lot too.",
        "You know, I think, you know, and it's probably my strength in the State Legislature - especially early on when the work term limits, you could really see this between the Democrats and the Republicans where they developed interpersonal relationships.",
        "And quite frankly, they could disagree without being disagreeable.",
        "And really, and really move forward on agendas without getting personal about it and without, you know, being you know, being against the person rather be opposed to the policy.",
        "And I am, you know, I'm going to take those kind of workability type values here to Washington D.C.",
        "And I think that, you know, as I - and even it doesn't matter if you're talking about the folks on the street in Montana to the people who are regular folks.",
        "When you're talking to the folks here - I mean, it just happened this morning.",
        "We had a little bipartisan caucus and talked about budget and how important it is to have a budget that works for people and this balanced.",
        "And you know, I looked around earlier and I saw Democrats, Republicans both nodding in their heads.",
        "So we need to get together.",
        "We may have different ways of getting there.",
        "We may have different ways of getting there, but if we understand, it isn't a problem.",
        "It doesn't sound, Senator, as if you're a take no prisoners Democrat.",
        "Well no, I mean I think you got to treat people with respect and then I'll treat you with respect back.",
        "And I don't think you would compromise your values, but I do think that there's opportunities to work together and you need take advantage of those.",

        "Well, thank you very much."

        "Okay.",
        "When you got assigned a committee, Senator Tester, you were assigned to the Agricultural Livestock and Irrigation Committee.",
        "That's all right up your alley, isn't it?",
        "Well, it is up my alley, but I didn't get assigned to that one.",
        "Oh, you didn't?",
        "Definitely Senator Baucus is a Democrat from, he is a senior senator from Montana.",
        "And he's on that committee already.",
        "And typically, they don't appoint two senators from the same state and the same party to any one committee.",
        "There's a few exceptions to that, but well, agricultural, livestock and irrigation is right up my alley, Neal.",
        "It's a, you know, I'm a family farmer dry land agriculture in north central Montana and we raise a few cows, a few hogs, and it's a farm that's been in my family where we're the third generation and we're looking to make the transition to my daughter and son-in-law, which will be the fourth generation.",
        "So agriculture, family farm agriculture in particular, is near and dear to my heart.",
        "And who's taking care of that farm while you're here in Washington?",
        "Well, we're, the kids are helping and then we're getting back as much as possible, not only to do, you know, meet with constituents, but also make sure the farm is still there.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "And we'll go to Sam.",

        "I just wanted to ask you, senator, there are some things that have come up that I feel are really Democratic Party initiatives, but things that the Republican Party has over the time kind of painted as anti-Democratic, such as, you know, pro-guns.",
        "We here in the West, we like to go out hunting and especially, I would imagine, from the state of Montana.",
        "And so I'm just wondering if you see things like that coming up, where the Democrats can really have a chance to take back those issues, show that we do support families, we do support, you know gun rights when it's reasonable.",
        "And things that could help you energize the center, people who are reasonable, about these kinds of things and get them to vote Democrat.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I do.",
        "I think it is particularly applicable to us in the West to, you know, that where we like to go hunting, we like our outdoor activities and we truly respect the Second Amendment.",
        "I would tell you that I had a hard time - I mean I'm, I literally made my living with the gun for 20 years.",
        "My wife and I ran a small custom butcher shop on the farm, and we were still accused, just because we are Democrats, of being anti-gun.",
        "I don't - I really see the gun issue as being more urban versus rural than it is Democrat versus Republican in all reality, even though the parties have laid claim to, you know, if you're anti-gun, you're a Democrat.",
        "I don't see that at all.",
        "I mean I know far - in fact, I don't know anybody in Montana that's anti-gun.",
        "And I know Democrats and Republicans, so - and that's not to say there isn't a couple, but there's not very doggone many, so…",
        "I think, you know, to get to your point, Sam, I do think there's an opportunity to take some of those issues back that make sense for regular folks.",

        "I think it gives us a great opportunity to solve a lot of problems that can't be solved by one party or the other, that has to be solved by working together.",
        "And one of prime example of that is, you know, a budget that is balanced that makes sense - you know, a fiscal responsibility, so to speak.",
        "It's going to be a lot of work to get a balanced budget, and it's not going to happen overnight.",
        "It's going to take several budgets to get to that point because we've gone that far down.",

        "The Montreal meeting, sponsored by the United Nations, is looking past the Kyoto Protocol.",
        "That agreement was set up in 1997, but many of its provisions just went into effect last February, and some of them run out in 2012.",
        "The US never signed on to the agreement, saying mandatory limits on the emissions of carbon dioxide would wreck the US economy and put it at a disadvantage against developing countries like China and India, who are not included.",

        "Well, what would you say is the mood at that conference?",
        "Well, I think with the exception of the US, as you already pointed out, there is actually a pretty good spirit of cooperation, and I think a set of decisions will probably come out of the meeting that begin the conversation about what should happen next.",
        "And since the Kyoto Protocol was talked about many years ago, isn't it true that emissions have actually gone up in many of these countries who have signed on to it?",
        "Yes, it's true, although I think we have to give countries the chance to reach their emission targets, which they don't really have to meet until 2012.",
        "Now will all of them meet those targets?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "Will some of them?",
        "Probably.",
        "And more important, I think, is that almost all of them are making a really serious effort.",
        "What kinds of--then what kind of agreement do you see coming out of this meeting?",
        "Well, I mean, there won't be any specific agreement.",
        "This meeting was really to launch actually two different processes to think about the future.",
        "One of them would be under the Kyoto Protocol, and it would apply to developed countries only and would really talk about what kind of process so that another set of numerical targets could be agreed upon well before 2012.",
        "The other one, and actually in many ways, I think this is equally important, would take place under the convention, which is sort of the mother agreement, to which the US is a party.",
        "And in this one, there is an attempt by all countries except the US to agree to start a conversation about approaches other than targets and trading that could actually move us toward meeting the goal of the convention, which is really to get to a stable climate.",
        "I'd heard word that there would be sort of a splinter group of members called the Asia-Pacific Partnership, which was going to hold its own meeting in Australia in February.",
        "Well, that's an interesting point you raise.",
        "The US, because it doesn't really want to do things under even the framework convention to which we are a party, did decide to try to work with a group of countries including Australia, Japan, China and India, in this Asia-Pacific Partnership, and they will be having a meeting in Australia in January.",
        "But I think it's interesting that all of the countries with the exception of the US also believe that a truly global approach is important under the convention, and they are all supporting the beginnings of this conversation under the convention, except the US, who will go to the Asia-Pacific Partnership--after all, it's their initiative--and will try to get something done.",
        "But, you know, the Chinese representative at the meeting said what could happen under the convention is going to be much more robust and result in much greater emission reductions than what could happen under the Asia-Pacific Partnership."
