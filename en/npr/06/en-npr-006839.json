        "Well, you know, it's very hard, I think, for people to think of the beginning of a process as a real concrete result, because, of course, it isn't, and it's going to take some time until you get one.",
        "But I mean, for those of us who are close to the process, a decision to move ahead and negotiate something more concrete is at least a step in the right direction.",
        "But you might argue that that's what you said in 1999--you personally.",
        "That's what happened in 1992 when we started going through this whole thing.",
        "Well, it's true, and the result of that was Kyoto, which, for all of its flaws and despite the fact that some countries may not meet the target, has actually resulted in quite a bit of activity, some of which is positive.",
        "The EU trading system is really positive.",

        "I don't think it would have happened without the Kyoto Protocol.",
        "But we still do have all those--a lot of countries, like Canada's, I think, emissions were up by 25 percent.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, Canada, which did sign on, has been moving in the wrong direction.",
        "The US, which didn't sign on, has been moving in the wrong direction.",
        "China and India, which are expected to grow, have been growing at pretty rapid rates.",
        "So yes, we're not a lot closer to actually solving the problem.",
        "Are they at least sympathetic about the problems, these big countries that...",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, I think they are, but one thing I can say for those who signed on to the Kyoto targets, I think most of the countries did not understand that it was actually quite difficult and that it really takes a lot of time to turn these ships around.",

        "Yes.",

        "I think the answer is no, which suggests that you need slightly longer time frames and a much more robust set of milestones along the way.",

        "Those drainage systems are managed in some cases by county governments."
