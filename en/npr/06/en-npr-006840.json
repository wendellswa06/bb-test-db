        "She's got a very loyal and large base of voters around the country that listen to what she says and that she can harness for various causes, but in terms of setting herself up to actually run for president and be the leader of the Republican Party, I don't think she's really doing that.",
        "And John Weaver, whose work for the McCain campaign ended before Palin was picked, says he doesn't see signs that she's laying the groundwork for a White House bid.",
        "Had she really wanted to play, become president, or play in the party for the long term, she would've set about repairing the image that came about from the 2008 campaign and doing so in a way that allowed her to become fully informed about national security and foreign policy issues, as well as economic issues.",
        "And there's no evidence that she's pursued that path whatsoever.",
        "Palin still has about two years to figure this out.",

        "It found that people who got Medicaid coverage were more likely to use health services in general, less likely to suffer from depression, and less likely to suffer financial problems related to medical bills than those who remained uninsured.",

        "When you make emergency room care free to people, they consume more of it.",
        "They consume 40 percent more of it, even as they're consuming more preventive care.",
        "And so one of the main arguments for how Obamacare was going to reduce health care costs is just flat-out false.",
        "Cannon says the study will likely further hurt President Obama's credibility for vowing that expanding Medicaid would help get people out of emergency rooms.",
        "But what's likely to bother the administration even more, he says, is what it may do to the half of the states that have yet to adopt the Medicaid expansion.",
        "This study is going to make it less likely that the 25 states that decided not to expand Medicaid are going to change their minds and expand Medicaid.",
        "Perhaps ironic, however, is that this study doesn't come as much as a surprise to those people who actually Medicaid programs around the country."
