        "So I want to start with one voice we heard there, the chief of Veterans Affairs, Eric Shinseki.",
        "He testified on Capitol Hill before some pretty upset lawmakers, and the issue, of course, the allegations that VA officials at medical facilities were covering up delays in patient care, delays that some 40 people may have died waiting for care.",
        "Now there's news today that the secretary has accepted the resignation of the department's top health official, and we'll have more on that throughout the program.",
        "But David, you know, my colleague Robert Siegel interviewed Shinseki a week or two ago, and when it came to the topic of his resignation, here's what he had to say.",
        "As long as the president feels that I'm serving him well and serving veterans well, there's work to be done.",
        "Yeah, he's in hot water.",
        "He's been there since the beginning.",
        "So I don't know if I'd necessarily want to bet on him.",
        "But, you know, I do have some sympathy for the VA.",
        "It's obviously not a good thing to doctor and cook the books, but you - there is a certain fundamental reality here, which is the number of primary care visits over the last three years at this place rose 50 percent.",
        "The number of primary care physicians rose nine percent.",
        "And so there's just a backlog, and if you put a sort of standard in place that you have to see everybody in 14 days but you don't provide enough physicians to actually do that, well, people are going to start cheating.",
        "And so there is a more fundamental problem here than just the cheating.",
        "And E.J.?",
        "Yes, I think we have failed as a country to respond to the fact that after two - a very long period of war, we have a lot of vets who need care.",
        "I think one of the few good things about this awful mess is that it's the first scandal in Washington that - where the response is thoroughly bipartisan.",
        "Both parties are angry, not - there isn't even agreement on whether Shinseki should resign.",
        "John Boehner, the House speaker, said early on, well, no, I don't think Shinseki's resignation is the proper response here.",
        "So I think that we are - I hope that we look at what we're spending and whether we're doing enough for vets out of all this.",
        "I hope Shinseki manages to fix some of the things that are wrong.",
        "I think his problem is he's a decent man who, when he says I'm mad as hell, sounds so calm and quiet that he doesn't sound like he's mad as hell.",

        "And maybe that's a virtue, but it comes off in a crisis like this as something that doesn't play on the media.",
        "I want to move on briefly to the congressional midterm primary season because we've got two campaigns, one from this past week, one coming up, that people have been looking at as a way of kind of reading what's going on between the Tea Party and the Republican establishment.",
        "One is Nebraska GOP primary winner Ben Sasse and then next week's showdown in Kentucky for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.",
        "And you're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.",
        "So Schiff has said that the complaint I just referenced is his kind of road map.",
        "The complaint lays out a number of individuals, which I'm sure you'll see in coming days and weeks, that the House will try to subpoena or to hold depositions with.",
        "Late this week, three committees sent subpoenas to Secretary of State Pompeo for documents, and they set dates for depositions with a list of five State Department officials.",
        "Among them is the former ambassador to Ukraine and a number of other diplomats.",
        "One of those diplomats, for example, is Kurt Volker.",
        "He's the former special envoy to Ukraine.",
        "Now, he resigned his position as special envoy on Friday as the fallout from this scandal spread.",
        "Schiff also announced a closed briefing with the inspector general of the intelligence community next Friday, October 4.",
        "You'll recall that the inspector general of the intelligence community has called the complaint - the whistleblower complaint both an urgent concern and said that it appears credible.",
        "So how do we expect this to play out?",
        "People are - I find that even members of the public who I've spoken to over the course of the week are very interested in the timing of all this.",
        "What can we expect?",
        "Well, there's no set, exact timeline.",
        "But Democrats want this investigation to move pretty quickly.",
        "Democrats, generally speaking, are hoping to complete this investigation and potentially even have a vote on articles of impeachment if they feel that's warranted by the end of this calendar year.",
        "Congress is currently in a two-week recess, though, so they're kind of trying to deal with both their recess duties and this ongoing investigation.",
        "Some Democrats are worried, for example, that Congress not being in session, this issue might lose a little momentum.",
        "So they're trying to keep that momentum going by holding these depositions, by holding these hearings.",
        "That is NPR's Tim Mak.",

        "But electric and interesting is not always politically wonderful, you know, especially when you're trying to reach voters who have some concerns about the man at the top of the ticket.",
        "And so what the campaign is trying to do is put Mrs. Obama in a kind of a softer light, put her in venues.",

        "It's hard to tell how much of that attention is confected, how much of it is real, how much of it is shared by the principles, which is to say the two Clintons and Senator Obama.",
