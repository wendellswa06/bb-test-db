        "I ascribe it to the fact that he has a Ph.D. from Yale.",
        "And that's - that tends to be the profile for Tea Party.",
        "If you're an angry outsider, including Tom Cotton, who's running also as a conservative candidate and a populist outsider who went to Harvard Law School, it seems to be very necessary to have an Ivy League pedigree to be a true Tea Party outsider these days."

        "He became a minister, a Presbyterian minister, served out the rest of his life as a minister in various locations and really learned something from the scandal and from his participation in the meetings that led to the break-ins."
