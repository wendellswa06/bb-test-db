        "But at the end of it all, she was approved for the study.",
        "She would be given two doses of the hallucinogen in two separate sessions, with trained guides sitting with her as the drugs took effect.",
        "Now, what she's about to describe is an intense drug experience, a trip.",
        "It's also a science experiment.",
        "Her experience began in a windowless room.",
        "The setting is basically a room, an office or a hospital room, and it's been decorated with sort of lots of hangings, and it looks like a sitting room.",

        "It started out being very ecclesiastical.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "The music became very absorbing and involved.",
        "I mean, it went to symphonic music, which I prefer and which was much better, and then kind of world music, you know, things that were more kind of indigenous-type music from foreign countries.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "It was a journey.",
        "There was a progression of things that happened.",
        "There was one that was very particular in which I was being confronted by a little boy with a slingshot who had his arm sort of braced in a tree and was ready to shoot a pebble at me.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "And then that was one image.",
        "And then something funny happened, and I started laughing.",
        "And my laughter was then jewels, like sparkling jewels or a starlight pouring out of a sky - an aperture in the sky.",
        "I can't verbalize it because people want it to be described as though it were a dream, and it's not.",
        "It is actual.",
        "So it is as real as my sitting on the bed clutching this microphone, and it's all entirely real."

        "Usually, these are folks who have emotional disturbances already in place and you superimpose - like an LSD - on someone that's a schizophrenic, and you don't know what you're going to get.",
        "Because that's almost the definition of hallucinogens is you go in and you scramble the chemistry of the brain.",

        "Remember all those questions Erica Rex had to answer before her session about voices in the TV and coded messages?",
        "Those were meant to screen out people who might have trouble.",

        "Charles Grob is at UCLA, and he's one of the few researchers actually studying medical uses of psychedelic drugs.",
        "Even he agrees there are reasons to be cautious but thinks federal regulations are still too strict."
