        "He referred to shoring up the capital of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
        "Capital is basically money on hand, a buffer against a company's losses.",
        "And as NPR's John Ydstie reports part of the concern over these two companies is that they've been required to have very little capital.",
        "Right now Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have between 80 and 90 billion dollars in capital.",
        "That sounds like a lot of money.",
        "The problem, says Christopher Whalen of the research firm Institutional Risk Analytics, is that the two mortgage giants have exposure to nearly $6 trillion of liabilities, almost all in the nation's shaky housing market.",
        "If you were going to really adequately capitalize Fannie and Freddie, you'd have to go out and raise hundreds of billions of dollars.",
        "If they were a bank, they'd have four or five hundred billion dollars in capital to support $6 trillion in total footings.",
        "So that's why people are right to be concerned.",
        "And it's why their share prices dropped into the single digits last week.",
        "Whalen says Fannie and Freddie shareholders were afraid that the companies' meager capital would be wiped out as the housing market deteriorates and they'd be left with shares worth nothing.",
        "Whalen believes that is the scenario that will eventually play out, despite the strengthening of Fannie and Freddie share prices in the past couple of days.",
        "The equity holders have my sympathy.",
        "If they can get a little pop this week and get out, you know, recover some of their scalp, they should do so.",
        "I would not want to see anyone sit with the equity of these two institutions 'cause I think they're both going to be wiped out.",
        "So why did Fannie and Freddie's government regulator allow them to have such low capital requirements - about a fifth of what's required of commercial banks?",
        "The answer: political power, says former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.",
        "It was more profitable for the shareholders to operate with low capital and they had enormous political power in Congress and were able to persuade Congress to establish a capital regime that was very, very favorable to them.",
        "And the people who lent the money were prepared to accept the low level of capital because of the implicit government guarantee."

        "The model allowed Fannie and Freddie to take more risks and do it with money borrowed at very low interest rates because of the government's backing.",

        "I haven't examined the facts of the case.",
        "So I can't speak about the specific case.",
        "But the question that you raise is a question which any mental health professional needs to ask, but beyond that, any university administrator needs to ask when someone is asking - is acting in a bizarre fashion.",
        "The problem isn't that people come up with the wrong answer.",
        "The problem isn't that - is much more, that they don't ask the excellent question that you've just asked.",
        "Well, Dr. Bursztajn, the question goes - these were administrators, and they had questions.",
        "You can't make somebody go to the doctor, can you?",
        "You cannot make anyone go to see a physician.",
        "Moreover, we do attempt to do our best to respect the autonomy of any individual suffering from whatever illness they may be suffering from.",
        "The question which needs to be asked, though, is with - especially with certain forms of severe mental illness - is whether the person's autonomy is sufficiently diminished by the mental illness itself that some proactive steps need to be taken."

        "Generally, in my 30 years of experience in psychiatry, clinical psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, most people who are mentally ill will respond to honest encouragement and support, but some will not, and then the question becomes: What do you do with people who will not respond to encouragement or support because their mental illness impairs them from being able to recognize the fact that they are mentally ill and that they do need help, or their sense of hopelessness frightens them to the extent that the only solution to hopelessness is denial?",
        "There is - there are any number of different thresholds at which mental health professionals cope with such questions about their clients, about their patients.",
        "But should there be questions asked, that if you have concerns about this, you may want to institute - the profession may want to institute a series of - a capacity for a mental health professional to call up and say: My patient, Mr. Jones, ought to be placed on the list that if somebody conducts a background check to see if he can buy a weapon, the answer is no or at least not for the next six months.",
        "There's always the balancing between very legitimate public safety concerns on the one hand and avoiding undue stigmatization and breaches of confidentiality on the other hand.",
        "The problem with having a too-low threshold for breaching confidentiality is that that would tend to scare away from seeking help precisely those people who may benefit the most from being helped.",
        "So for example, some people who are paranoid, if they have a sense that there's a place where they can talk freely and honestly, may eventually be open to treatment.",
        "On the other hand, if there's a sense that the very act of seeking help will expose them to public scrutiny and, from their perspective, an invasion of property, an invasion of their privacy, then they will avoid seeking help.",
        "And as your initial question points out, and this is very important, so I'm glad that you began there, the person in question that we're speaking of is not someone who ever saw - as far as we know.",
        "I mean, that may change.",
        "But at least as far as we know he never saw a mental health professional.",
        "So it's important that we don't lose the opportunity for being able to proceed with a therapeutic model by proceeding to have a paper-thin threshold for violating clinician-patient confidentiality in the mental health area.",

        "And he raises a good point.",
        "Ted does raise a very good and very important point, which is that there is a scarcity of resources and that as a society we have not made mental health be a major priority.",
        "Moreover, whereas people who have other kinds of illnesses, such as, for example, cancer, usually have intact families that are able to advocate for them.",
