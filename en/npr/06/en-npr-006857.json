        "The shooter in Tucson last month was tackled when he stopped to reload.",
        "That came after he'd already gotten off some 30 rounds, killed six, and injured another 13.",
        "In response, there are now efforts - in Arizona, in New York State, in Florida, among other places, including Washington, D.C.",
        "at the federal Capitol - to ban or restrict those kinds of high-capacity ammunition clips.",
        "Stephen Hunter argues that would not stop most criminals but could harm people who buy guns for self-defense.",

        "Stephen Hunter's op-ed, \"\"Why 33 Rounds Makes Sense in a Defensive Weapon,\"\" appeared in the Washington Post earlier this month.",
        "You might also remember him as the former chief film critic for the Post.",
        "He earned the Pulitzer Prize in that role.",
        "He's also a well-known novelist and joins us from a studio at member station WYPR in Baltimore.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Thank you so much, Neal.",
        "It's good to be here.",
        "And why - most police officers carry semi-automatic weapons with 10 or 11 rounds in a magazine.",
        "Why do you need 33?",
        "Well, most police officers have several reloaded magazines on their bodies.",
        "They have - they're almost all wearing body armor.",
        "They have tasers.",
        "They have batons.",
        "And most important of all, they have a button by which they can call 50 men with sub-machine guns to get there in about three minutes.",
        "So their fight is going to be a lot different than my fight or your fight or Joe Smith's fight.",
        "He'll be alone, in the dark, in his house.",
        "He'll be on the street.",
        "Well, he probably won't be on the street.",
        "He'll be in his house.",
        "He'll be scared to death.",
        "He'll be in a very weird, twisted, crazed world of the gunfight, where his fingers aren't working, and his mind isn't working clearly, and he can hardly breathe, and he can hardly think, and people in the dark are shooting at him.",
        "The one thing he does not want to do is try and get through a reload.",
        "If you look at the literature of gunfights, you see that if you run out of ammo halfway through the fight, you're in very serious trouble, and the best thing about the 33-round magazine, or any extended magazine, is that in those circumstances you're not going to be betrayed by your technology.",
        "You're going to be spared that ordeal.",
        "We know that the shooter in Tucson - you pointed out the difficulties of reloads.",
        "Well, he was trying to reload and had difficulty.",
        "That's when he was tackled and stopped.",
        "And a lot of people had said: Wait a minute, if he'd only had 11 rounds, that might have meant a lot more people lived."

        "He was being assaulted by other people in the area, and whether or not he was -he certainly wasn't able to shoot to kill.",

        "That's not to defend him or to suggest that, you know, these things should be widely available and that everyone should get one with their free lunch, but if a gun owner who thinks seriously about the scenario that he might face, it seems to me, has a very good need to have such a thing.",
        "Are you aware of any circumstances where a gun owner has needed that kind of ammunition load to defend themselves in a house?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Not a week ago, in Sterling, Virginia, three men assaulted a house, and the homeowner defended himself.",
        "He wounded two of them and drove the third away, and that guy is now an all-points-bulletin fugitive.",
        "And I don't know if he had an extended magazine, I don't know exactly how that particular fight went down, but I'm betting that at a certain point he wished he had an extended magazine.",
        "Now, the point here isn't - here's something I would like to get to, which is that nobody can predict the fight.",

        "It's going to be its own spontaneous, hysterical explosion of violence and mayhem at close range.",
        "If you're facing that, you're far better off to prepare, as we do in all stages of our life, for what would be called the worst-case scenario, and it doesn't matter what - you know, if you're - what the numbers say.",
        "You can always end up fighting multiple antagonists in the dark.",

        "And under those circumstances an extended magazine would be a superb defensive tool, and it's a very cheap investment for the gun owner.",

        "They'll have a vault under their bed, and it'll contain a pistol, it'll contain a cell phone, it'll contain a flashlight, and it's - and many, many times it'll contain an extended-round magazine because, you know, as I've been trying to make clear, nobody wants to reload a gun in the middle of a fight.",

        "Much to the dislike of most weapons owners - I must admit I am a weapons owner, and I don't like the idea of any part of a weapon being limited in any way by anybody.",
        "But I must disagree with the speaker on the requirement or even the advice that you should have an extended magazine.",
        "In my line of work, anything more than whatever the magazine's typical carrying load is, i.e., whatever is in the handle, would be anything for an assault.",
        "If I'm sitting in my house and you're suggesting that I prepare for the worst, then I should clearly have (unintelligible) machine gun.",
        "That's illegal by law and for good reason.",
        "If I require any more ammunition than that, then I would assume it's for an attacking purpose, an offensive capability, not just defensive.",
        "I was wondering what your idea is on where to draw the line.",
        "I can take my call, or I can take my answer off the air.",
        "All right, Nick, thank you.",
        "My answer to that would be that this fellow sounds like a young dynamic man who shoots a lot, who is very familiar with his guns, and he is capable of running a defense with a 15-round magazine.",
        "When he runs out of 15-round magazines, I'll bet you anything he's practiced, over and over again, the reloading drill, just as he's practiced the clearance drill, just as he's gone through his house in the dark and gotten himself acclimated to the various angles that he'll have to shoot from and the - what items of furniture are concealment, as opposed to what items of furniture are cover - that is, are capable of stopping an incoming bullet.",
        "In other words, he's probably very serious about self-defense as a mission.",
        "More power to him.",
        "I think - I wish him luck, and I'm certain he will prevail."

        "But really what this whole debate boils down to is that because this deranged individual in Tucson used an extended capacity magazine, this is what the anti-gun forces have gravitated on in this instance.",

        "And then Spirit and Opportunity came along in 2004 about the size of a golf cart.",
