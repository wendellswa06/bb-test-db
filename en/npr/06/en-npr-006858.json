        "And except in the narrow circumstances that I've illustrated for you, the stable self-defense situation confronting someone who is not a gun athlete, except for that one particular niche in the spectrum, they are generally useless and they generally play no part in - they're sitting in drawers.",

        "However, there was this gem at the end of the column: People can use semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, but women generally don't care to put in the training needed to master them.",
        "And further: When the question arises of who needs an extended magazine, the answer is, the most defenseless of the defenseless.",
        "No statistic was given to support this unnecessary claim, leading me to conclude that the statement was Hunter's personal opinion when it came to women and guns.",

        "Well, it's funny because that line I had really written because women can't use that heavier weapon, or less likely to use the heavier weapon.",

        "Every kind of life that we know here on Earth requires three things.",
        "It requires some kind of a solvent, liquid water in the case of here on Earth, sunlight or some form of energy and then organic molecules.",
        "And we know, at this point, that Mars has got at least two of those three.",
        "There is sunlight there.",
        "There's also volcanism or ancient volcanism and, thanks to Spirit and Opportunity, we know that there used to be liquid water flowing across the surface.",
        "So the big thing is to now look for the signs of organic molecules, so Curiosity is going to drive around.",
        "It's going to be able to dig into the soil, drill in the rocks, fire a laser at rock faces and look for the vaporized elements that come off and really look to see if the building blocks of life are actually present there in the landing spot.",

        "Well, right now, it looks like, from the initial hazard camera images that are aimed at the wheels, that we are on a hard, flat surface with little uniform pebbles everywhere.",
        "So, at the moment, I can't think of a better place for that rover to go driving.",
        "In the distance, we see some sand dunes and, beyond that, I'm looking at one of the images coming out from the forward camera, the forward hazard camera, and there is a three mile tall mountain directly in front.",
        "So this rover is going to be able to drive for maybe - I think the last I saw - about 30 meters per day, potentially, so at least for the near term, we're going to stay in one spot and look to just be very, very careful about what do we see around us?",
        "We're at the edge of a big alluvial fan and what that means is that water is potentially drawn material out of the nearby crater rim and brought it down to about where we're landing.",
        "So, by looking at the surface around us, we could potentially sample what was up there in that crater rim.",
        "So there's great science to be done without moving anywhere at the moment.",
        "Now, from Spirit, of course, and Opportunity, we saw color pictures from Mars, but I now understand that those color pictures weren't necessarily accurate in terms of the true colors that were presented.",
        "You were part of a team of scientists that developed a sundial that'll help calibrate the color of the Martian landscape images so that, in fact, Mars can be seen in its true colors.",
        "How did you do that?",
        "Well, there's a calibration target and the idea is, if you think back to days of film when you would take a photograph of a landscape here on earth and you would take your film into the color lab to make prints, the lab technician would look for things like trees, green grass, blue sky, ways to make sure that the color calibration had been done correctly.",
        "Of course, we don't have any of those things on Mars, so we needed to send something along that had known regions of particular colors and gray and black and white so that we could actually effectively calibrate out the true images, the true colors on Mars because think about this.",
        "Mars has got this atmosphere with dust all through it, so right now, we're on a surface where you've got sunlight filtering through this red dust.",
        "So if you want to know what kinds of rocks you're looking at - well, you can't just tell from the color because, right now, everything has got this red shade draped over it.",
        "So we've sent this calibration target, which has a post in the middle so that we can see what these colors look like in direct sun and in shadow.",
        "Well, that's what a sundial is, so in fact, the fellow who first thought of turning this into a working sundial was Bill Nye, the Science Guy.",
        "And he thought, let's take an opportunity for this little dry technical instrument and turn it into a means of outreach to the public.",
        "Tyler Nordgren is professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Redlands and he's answering our questions about the Curiosity rover that landed on the surface of Mars today."

        "The asteroid belt is actually a huge region and so, even though there are lots of asteroids out there, they turn out to be very, very far between, so in particular, the Galileo spacecraft, which was sent out to Jupiter to go into orbit around Jupiter - NASA had to specifically target it in order to get it anywhere near an asteroid.",
