        "And I wrote it.",
        "So I was sitting in the Anspacher, the very theater where we are world premiering \"\"White Noise.\"\" And there is a moment in that play, the \"\"Father Comes Home From The Wars\"\" play, which takes place in the 1860's in America where the main character, Hero, is imagining the future.",
        "And he's trying to imagine what it's going to be like to be free.",
        "And if he is free - if I'm free, I think he says - I'm paraphrasing - you know, and I'm walking down the street, say I'm coming home from work, and I got stopped by the patrollers, and they'll say, who do you belong to?",
        "And I'll say, well, I belong to myself.",
        "And he wonders if that will be enough for them to - the patrollers to let him, you know, go on home.",
        "And his friend that he's talking to, Smith, doesn't know if that's going to be enough to have him feel safe, protected and respected.",
        "And so watching that moment in the play night after night after night in 2014, I said, oh, wow.",
        "I'm going to write a play about the future.",
        "And I started writing \"\"White Noise\"\" from there.",
        "Wow.",
        "That - first of all, there's so many difficult ideas in this.",
        "I don't want to give it away because it's both fascinating and cringe-inducing.",
        "I mean, it's like this real-life, real-time experiment.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And one of the things that's both fascinating and cringe-inducing - there's so many things - but how quickly Ralph takes to the role...",

        "Right.",
        "What are some of the things that fascinated you?",
        "Well, one of the things that I hold dear and that I told the actors and I tell them every day - but I told them on the first day of rehearsal, and I just wanted them to know how much I love deeply each of the characters and how the world that they live in, the world which is much like the world we live in today - the world has pushed each of these four characters into a corner - into an opposing corner, if you will.",
        "And I want them to work through their stuff.",
        "And for me, that's one of the most important things about the play.",
        "And it surprises me, I guess, how during the rehearsal process, which was very deep and intense but without unnecessary drama.",
        "And we had some intense discussions about who we are and race and privilege and what does that mean.",
        "And a lot of times, it wasn't easy.",
        "But we had them.",
        "We had to.",

        "One of the things that fascinated me was how many of the things that you wrote about in prior plays that people felt were just crazy or outrageous or over-the-top have now become...",

        "...True.",
        "Like, for example, in \"\"Topdog/Underdog\"\"...",
        "Yeah.",
