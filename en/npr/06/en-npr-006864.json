        "A state representative who's a Democrat - his name's Patrick Hope - said he's going to start the impeachment process today.",
        "And he plans to introduce a resolution in the House.",

        "But there's also a lot of politics involved.",
        "One of the reasons for amassing all this aid, you know, right on the border is to try to tempt the Venezuelan military forces or shame the Venezuelan military forces who are propping up Maduro.",
        "They want the top officers to turn against his government, to allow this aid to start flowing into the country to alleviate the suffering.",
        "And you know, that would be one way to bring about regime change, which is what the Trump administration and the opposition is really pushing.",

        "They're supporting Maduro.",
        "And so the problem here is that - because of that, you know, Maduro's still in power, he still controls the country.",
        "And there's really kind of no plan B for getting this aid across the border into Venezuela.",
        "OK.",
