        "You mentioned one of the factors in the debate, and one of the factors in Gingrich's big win the week before in South Carolina, was the revelations about the - about the - excuse me, the revelations about the income tax and Bain and losing jobs and that sort of thing.",
        "You mentioned Mitt Romney doing a much better job in the Florida debate.",
        "But have you checked your own investments?",
        "You also have investments through mutual funds that also invest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)",
        "And Newt Gingrich, not as sprightly, not as adept, not as agile as he was in the South Carolina debate.",
        "Absolutely not, and the look on - I mean, the thing we just heard about Mitt Romney, it came following Newt Gingrich attacking him on investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, you know, that's the illegitimate child.",
        "And yet Romney with opposition research just came back at Gingrich, and Gingrich was just confounded, had no response, looked like he just lost his mojo, and really, for the rest of the debate, he just seemed more on the defensive.",
        "And the talk about moon colonies and things like that, he seemed to lose his way in Florida.",
        "And 99.99 percent of the ads that were run by the Romney campaign and by the super PAC supporting him were negative.",
        "There was one ad, I think, in Spanish on the radio, that was positive for Romney.",
        "But other than that, it was a barrage of negative ads.",
        "And as you say, Newt Gingrich, well, sounded very defensive.",
        "Lincoln once said if a man won't agree that two plus two equals four, you'll never win the argument because facts don't matter.",
        "Romney's the first candidate I've seen who fits the Lincoln description.",
        "And whining about your opponent outspending you five to one, well, that was the fact, but you're not going to win a lot of elections that way.",
        "True, but money doesn't always win elections, as President Phil Gramm would say or, you know, the people who have poured in tons and tons of money.",
        "So just to blame it on money is not a sufficient answer for why Gingrich lost so badly."

        "And, you know, Gingrich, to say that Romney's a liar, and, you know, facts are facts, and he's distorting the facts, but look, Newt Gingrich did have investments in Freddie and Fannie, he did resign from the speakership in somewhat of a disgrace.",
        "So all the things that Romney said - many of the things Romney said about Gingrich were absolutely true.",
        "And they will go on to Nevada and Maine and then on elsewhere.",
        "We'll be focusing on that later.",
        "Meantime, there still are two other Republicans in the race, and essentially Rick Santorum and Ron Paul decided hey, let's skip it.",
        "Well, why not because Florida - violating party rules, Florida was a winner-take-all primary.",
        "So in other words, unlike most of the other early states, like we saw in New Hampshire, like we saw in South Carolina, you win a percentage of the vote, you get a percentage of the delegates.",
        "In Florida, it was winner-take-all.",
        "All 50 delegates go the winner.",
        "So if you're Rick Santorum or Ron Paul, don't have a lot of money, don't have the greatest organization, you're not going to finish first, let alone second, why compete in such an expensive state?",
        "We'll see how they do in caucus states, which divide their delegates proportionally, when we get to this weekend and talk more about that.",
        "In the meantime, Mitt Romney has sometimes been, well, criticized for being out of touch, the $10,000 bet, that sort of thing.",
        "This morning on CNN, he did not do himself any favors in an interview with Soledad O'Brien.",

        "They're doing just fine.",
        "And of course he meant to say he's fighting for the middle class, but - I'm not concerned about the very poor?",
        "Well, he did say after that, my real focus is the middle class.",
        "But again to say that I'm not focused on the very poor is again one of those class/wealth problems that Mitt Romney seems to always stick his foot in.",
        "In the meantime, we have some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question.",
        "We also have a result in Oregon.",
        "We want to quick talk about that later?"
