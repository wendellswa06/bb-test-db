        "Why do you think it's important, if you think it's important, for a blog like yours to be recognized, you know, as part of the African-American blogging community?",
        "Well, you know, when I started doing the blog, I think three or four years ago, it was something I added on to the Web site because it was just basically a vanity site to promote the work that I do.",
        "And my Web designer suggested that I add this.",
        "My Web designer was a black - is a black gay man, who encouraged me to create this vehicle, this community for people to have.",
        "And it didn't occur to me at the time how important it would be but I think he was right about that.",
        "And I think it's important for the overall black community as well because the LGBT, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender community, often gets ignored in the larger black community.",
        "And the black people often get ignored in the larger gay community, too.",
        "So it's good for people to have a space where they can feel that they are a part of something that is for them.",

        "I don't just mean people who are fans but people who may, as you mentioned earlier, disagree with you and that may come and only post on your comment's page when they say well, gosh, I fundamentally think that he's wrong?",
        "Well, you know, I'm always amazed what a proprietary interest people have in my blog, in my Web site.",
        "You know, people write in to tell me things that they disagree with and tell me what they think I should be doing or what they think I should be writing.",

        "Even when somebody's calling me out because I've done something wrong or something they think is wrong, I love that interchange.",

        "How important do you think it is, really, to have a presence online as well as in all the other forms of what you do?",
        "I think it's critical for me because, you know, I'm a lecturer, I'm doing the TV stuff, I'm occasionally doing radio and writing books at the same time.",
        "All these things are synergistically connected.",
        "They're all interrelated.",
        "And to the extent that someone can get access to me from one medium or another, I think it's useful because they all help to support the other from a business perspective, from a message perspective, from a branding perspective.",
        "It's just a no-lose situation.",
