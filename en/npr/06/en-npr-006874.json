        "Is there an art to packing things well and making sure that you can pack as much as you need in as small amount of space as possible?",
        "What is the best way to fill that suitcase?",
        "Well, there are really only two things that I would label as tricks, other than just plain, good old common sense.",
        "First of all, you shouldn't let any spaces go unused.",
        "So if you're packing a pair of running shoes, say, don't forget there's a lot of space inside those shoes that you could use to pack stuff - so things like that.",
        "And I guess the main trick is how you deal with clothing, because most people don't know how to pack clothing very well.",
        "They fold each item individually, pack them in a stack, and then force them into the bag, somehow, which is just about the worst thing you can do as far as packing clothing goes.",
        "So there is a technique for packing clothing.",
        "It's called bundle wrapping, and it's a way of putting all your clothing in a bundle, for want of a better word, that keeps it from getting wrinkled and crumpled and also takes up less space.",
        "When you're talking about bundling these items, are you talking about, for instance, taking a shirt, putting the bundle inside the shirt and then wrapping one sleeve over - one sleeve over the shirt tail up and over the bundle and then the collar - is that what you're talking about?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Or you're talking about instead of rolling it from the bottom?",
        "No.",
        "I'm not talking about rolling.",
        "Rolling is better than individually folding and stacking, but it's not much better.",
        "So, no, you've described it pretty well.",
        "If you think of laying a shirt flat on your bed and then placing this bundle where the chest would go and then gently wrap the sleeves around the bundle, and then bring the bottom up and wrap it around the top.",
        "Shoes, they take up a lot of space.",
        "They do.",
        "They're the single, bulkiest item, and the biggest secret there is just not to take too many shoes.",
        "I guess, never take more than two pairs of shoes.",
        "And frequently, I take one pair of shoes.",
        "In lots of business situations these days, you can buy shoes that are quite dressy looking and yet their internal construction is more like a high-quality running shoe.",
        "And I find that that works for most things."

        "I have to interrupt you and, you know, someone may snatch my feminist card from me, but there are women who are listening, thinking: One pair of shoes for an entire week, is that even possible?",
        "Well, of course, the ladies do tend to complain a little more about that constriction than others.",
        "But even women mostly can get by with a pair of low heels and a pair of, sort of dressy, strappy kind of sandals.",
        "I mean, those two things will handle most kinds of travel that you want.",
