        "No, and I agree with you, but the president did say, to the horror of many progressive Democrats and liberal Democrats in Congress, the president did say that we will have to cut back, make cuts in Social Security and Medicare.",
        "Not every Democrat agrees with that.",
        "Those of us on the outside, we're looking forward to hearing what he means by that in detail.",
        "I hope that that turns out to be right because Medicare is unsustainable, and there's no argument about that.",
        "We've got to do something about it.",
        "We can agree or disagree on what to do, but it's getting old for Democrats to say we're not doing anything, we're not changing anything.",
        "Now, as far as the election is concerned, you know, Ken, usually when the incumbent's up for re-election, the election is about his record.",
        "And if Republicans can keep the election about President Obama's record, about his policies and the effects of those policies, Republicans are going to win the election.",
        "Which is - provides us with a perfect transition point to ask you: As you look around at the Republican field, again you had briefly considered being part of that field yourself and decided it against it in the end.",
        "But as you look around, who looks well-positioned to you?",
        "Well, most open nomination contents since I've been involved, and that goes back to 1968.",
        "In fact, our nomination contest looks more like Democratic presidential nominating contests often look: no real frontrunner, large field out of which comes in 1976 Jimmy Carter, who this time in that (unintelligible) had like one percent of the vote.",
        "1988 comes Michael Dukakis, unknown to most people at this stage in 1987.",
        "1992 Bill Clinton, who nobody gave a shadow of a chance at this point in 1992, in 1991.",
        "Two out of three of them won.",
        "They were special circumstances, but every presidential election is a special circumstance, so I'll grant you that.",
        "Is there anybody who you would think about endorsing at this point?",
        "Well, at this point, I have not endorsed anybody.",
        "I don't have any current intention of endorsing anybody.",
        "In 2008, I never endorsed anybody for the nomination.",
        "So I don't feel like I have to, but I certainly don't feel any time pressure.",
        "The field is still growing, and so I don't have any intention of doing anything anytime soon.",

        "Yes, sir.",

        "But my question to you, Governor Barbour, is the way that things are working out right now, some people are talking about Governor Perry might get in, and that would kind of, you know, mix the field up somewhat.",
        "But in the event that, say, Michele Bachmann should win, do you think there's any chance that they might ask Senator Rubio from Florida, who I consider is one of the brightest young men I've seen come along in a long, long time.",
