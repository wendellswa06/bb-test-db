        "If somebody's got some kind of health problem, the country ought to know it.",
        "And then, voters will determine has that person been able to deal with it, has it had any adverse effect on their behavior or on their decision-making.",
        "And I can't see anything in Michele Bachmann's career, including all of those foster children she and her husband so courageously took in over a period of years.",
        "I can't see any adverse effect, and that's the question here.",

        "At least one top Republican did, too.",

        "But at the end of the day, this is a compromise between the two sides, something we see too little of in this town, to address a major national challenge, and that is the debt threat confronting the country, something if we don't deal with it effectively is going to lead to a fiscal crisis.",
        "None of us know when, but we know with assurance that it will.",
        "So, you know, to me, the options here are pretty clear.",
        "Either we find a way to come together and do something significant, or we're going to let this country drift right off a fiscal cliff.",

        "I've asked people to remember that we're slated to spend well over $10 trillion in those accounts.",
        "So 500 billion sounds like a lot, but as a percentage of what's slated to be spent it's relatively modest.",
        "So, you know, that's true in so many of these circumstances.",
        "There are things that are tough for Democrats to accept because they are very significant spending cuts in discretionary spending, as well as entitlement reform, but on the Republican side, there's revenue, and that's hard for them to accept.",
        "And, you know, at the end of the day, it's going to take doing things that all of us have a hard time accepting to meaningfully reduce the debt load on this country, which is now a comparison to our gross debt, 100 percent of the gross domestic product of the country, which virtually every economist has told us is unsustainable over time, will weaken our economic position, will reduce economic growth, will cost us jobs.",

        "So - but it really was on party lines.",
        "But I have a sense that, for the most part, this was a vote that they needed to have, because if the Republicans in the House are going to compromise and they may have to, these are the votes they need - somebody said - to get it out of your system, because it's not something they would like to do.",
        "But they want to go on the record saying, this is what our core principles are.",
