I mean, look, first of all, this is the Political Junkie segment of TALK OF THE NATION, and by talking about - in political terms, if the president thought he was, perhaps, losing this argument - and, perhaps, there will be a cap plan coming from the White House - but my sense is that it seems like with the Democrat - with the Republicans losing the momentum, with more and more polls showing that the Republicans in the House...",

        "Listen to him.",
        "Default is no better an idea today than when Newt Gingrich tried it in 1995, is that it destroys your brand, and it would give the president an opportunity to blame Republicans for a bad economy.",
        "Look, he owns the economy.",
        "He's been in office almost three years now, and we refuse to let him entice us into co-ownership.",
        "Co-ownership of the economy that the - some Republicans apparently willing to go over the brink and hit - go over the - go through the debt ceiling and go into default.",
