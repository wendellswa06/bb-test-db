        "Well, we do know that because there's cesium and iodine in the environment that they did have releases from these facilities, and that portions of the fuel were uncovered and were damaged.",
        "So we know that material got out.",
        "Right now, it looks like what are called the volatiles are the ones that spread the farthest, but they pumped an enormous amount of water in to cool these facilities.",
        "And again, it shouldn't be surprising that within the basements and in the sumps that there are probably small amounts or potentially larger amounts of fuel particles that have been pushed through the system.",
        "Were - then there's the problem that over the weekend, Japan officials reported that radioactive water in one of the reactors, unit two, was 10 million times higher than normal.",
        "Just a few hours later, they came back and said: Oh, no. That was a mistake.",
        "It was only a hundred thousand times higher than normal.",
        "First, it's a little alarming they can make a mistake of three orders of magnitude.",
        "And the other is, isn't a hundred thousand times above normal pretty scary too?",
        "Certainly, it is a level that would cause a considerable amount of concern, and when you're dealing with very, very high levels of radiation, you can have difficulties with instrumentation response.",
        "So, again, some of this is just sort of a natural - unfortunately, a natural occurrence in dealing with emergency situations.",
        "Then, we hear from the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that three reactors there are in a meltdown state or partially melted down.",
        "We had a partial meltdown at Three Mile Island, and that scared a whole lot of people.",
        "Three of them at least partially melted down.",
        "Well, that is correct, and again, because we have cesium and iodine released into the environment, we do know that the fuel was damaged.",
        "And so you can describe that as a partial meltdown.",
        "It's like removing part of the tin can - although it's not tin, it's zirconium - around the fuel, and then the fuel can disintegrate and can fall into the bottom of the reactor vessel.",
        "So we do know that it's happened.",
        "But what we have seen so far is that the containment and the reactor vessels have largely remained intact, and so the bulk of that material is still within the reactor facilities themselves.",
        "Let's get some questions from callers.",

        "Sure.",
        "My question is about the endgame here.",
        "Are we - are they trying to stabilize the reactors and return them to service?",
        "And if not, why don't we give them the Chernobyl treatment, for lack of a better term, and just do something to kill them and seal them so they're no longer a problem.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The reactors at the - the reactor at Chernobyl, as memory serves, was buried in cement and boron.",
        "So he asked a very good question.",
        "And the first point was to stabilize them.",
        "And what they need to do is to put them in a condition where you don't have to worry about a new little nuclear reactor occurring at some point in time under any sort of cover.",
        "So what they want to do is remove as much of that contaminated sea water, put in fresh water.",
        "And they will have folks - individuals that have specialization in a field called criticality take a look at it and determine what's the best way to keep these reactors in an inactive state and then how to best go about putting some sort of cover or isolation.",
        "But that's going to take some time.",
        "In the short term, it's cooling them and getting fresh, clean water into the facilities.",
        "And as far as we understand, there's no thought of restoring at least these three reactors to service.",
        "Is it all six?",
        "I believe, at this point, the discussion - when they started putting sea water into the units, at that point in time, they knew that they would be done in terms of their service.",
        "And I've certainly heard that discussion with the three.",
        "I've not heard it about the others.",

        "Please have your guest explain the difference between radiation and radioactivity.",

        "So things that are radioactive emit radiation, and that radiation can be alpha, beta, gamma, neutrons and a host of other particles.",
        "And we tend to, unfortunately, use the terms interchangeably.",
        "Why do we keep hearing different methods of measurement?",
        "We keep hearing about Becquerels and sieverts and all kinds of different things.",

        "Over the years, they have looked at improving the safety and operating circumstances for these reactors.",
        "And the push recently has been on what are called passively safe systems where you can remove a large number of pumps and design your facilities so that you actually don't need human intervention for some period of time, typically a few days, where gravity forces water into cores.",
        "And there's a number of designs that are out there.",
        "There's some new novel the small modular reactor designs, which make the cores smaller and also in a safer configuration.",
