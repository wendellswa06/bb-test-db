        "In fact, the first one - well, the other accuser to come forward in 2005 was attorney Tamara Green.",
        "She heard excerpts of the then-DA's press conference, and she could just tell from his tone that he was not going to be filing charges against Cosby.",

        "That's when another 10 or 11 other women come forward.",

        "And then Associated Press decided to get some documents from Andrea's court case unsealed.",
        "There were motions that had excerpts from his deposition in the case.",
        "And a federal judge in July of the next year allowed those to be unsealed because he said Cosby had given up his right to privacy by all the public scolding he had done to people through the years, so that narrowed his right to privacy.",

        "What changed between the first trial and the second trial?",
        "I think the prosecution had a - ran a much better case the second time around.",
        "They put a sexual assault expert up first to testify about rape myths and debunking rape myths and, you know, all of the victim behavior that might seem odd to you, like waiting to report it to authorities or reporting it at all is the norm for sexual assault.",
        "So she kind of set the stage for the jury to say, you're going to hear some strange things, but this is the normal thing for sexual assault victims.",
        "And then, this time, five other women were allowed to testify as opposed to one from the first trial.",
        "And it was like one, two, three, four, five they testified, and then Andrea.",
        "I find myself wondering how covering this story affected you all these years.",
        "I mean, you were threatened by Mr. Cosby's representatives, according to your reporting - not just the fact of that, but also just engaging with this kind of conduct for all these years.",
        "And I did find myself wondering how it affected you.",
        "You know, it really affected me back in 2005 because I was completely shocked by it, and I was very disillusioned.",
        "And it was something I'd never experienced before working in journalism.",
        "You know, it was also the national media - you know, the coddling and the giving in to Cosby, you know?",
        "I was getting on all these national talk shows at night, and the bookers were telling me that Cosby's people were pressuring them not to have me on.",
        "And that's when I heard the phrase trading up, where you give up one story to give a better one.",
        "And soon enough, I wasn't on there anymore.",
        "So I was really disillusioned by the whole experience.",
        "Well, you know, of course, as you report on this, to this day, Bill Cosby through his representatives denies this aggressively.",
        "His wife made this kind of a very aggressive argument that there's racial bias at work.",
        "You know, but other people say no. Actually, his profile in American life is quite unique.",
        "To the degree that you can, having lived with this for so long, take a step back, like, what is this about?",
        "What does this say?",
        "Is it about wealth?",
        "Is it about what?",
        "What's it about, really?",
        "Well, I think - and I tried to examine this somewhat in the book - it's also about the inherent distrust we as a society have of sexual assault victims when they come forward.",
        "I think a lot of the men are in these journalism organizations making the decisions, and I - so I think that's a huge part of it."
