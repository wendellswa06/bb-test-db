        "media attention, obviously, around the issue of Darfur, around labor rights, but I think it's been pretty much contained.",
        "Now, Bob Costas of NBC interviewed President Bush on Sunday and asked him about his meeting with the Chinese President Hu Jintao, and the president, our president, Bush, said he urged China to use its clout to help ease the Darfur crisis.",
        "What has really been the U.S.",
        "position vis-a-vis China in terms of trying to, you know, negotiate with China on this issue?",
        "Well, the U.S.",
        "has not wanted to push China too hard, in part because of the level of economic interdependency that exists now between the United States and China.",
        "It is true that the U.S.",
        "has been trying to get China to use its clout with the Sudan, but I think that one of the things that many people in the United States don't appreciate when we're looking at China and its foreign policy is that they are very much affected by the whole notion of the non-intervention in the internal affairs of various countries.",
        "Now, for many of us, we may just assume that this is an opportunistic ploy, but it's much more complicated given China's history of having been torn up by European countries and dominated by the United States.",
        "So, the Chinese are very, very reluctant to intervene, whether it's in the Sudan or anywhere else.",
        "And in fact, it's very interesting.",
        "When President Bush was criticizing the Chinese, the Chinese response - which could've been to say, look into your own house, President Bush - was simply to say, countries should not involve themselves in the internal affairs of others.",

        "I think it's very important, actually, to keep the pressure on China, but I don't think, as I've said many times to you in our discussions, that the Bush administration has much moral authority to do that, particularly in light of Iraq.",
        "But I think that people, regular people here in the United States, actually do.",
        "And whether it's pressure that we put on corporations that are investing in China, or just visible political pressure, that the Chinese do respond.",
        "They don't necessarily respond the way that many of us may think that they should, and they don't necessarily acknowledge that they are responding, but they do respond to pressure.",
        "And in fact, some of what they've been saying to the Sudan, the government in Khartoum, over the last number of months, seems to indicate that some of this pressure has been working.",

        "And then what happens, fairly quickly, is what is described as fatigue.",
        "I wouldn't really describe it as that, but there's a lack of interest and a lack of commitment to the survivors.",
        "We certainly have seen that in 9/11, with the survivors, including the people that went to offer assistance.",
        "I think that what we've seen in Kenya and Tanzania is exactly this, but it's compounded by another factor, which is that this took place in Africa.",
        "And when things take place outside of the United States, there is very often, unfortunately, a numbness that we have here, a reluctance to respond - not a reluctance, it's just - we disconnect.",
        "And I think, frankly, people have forgotten about this and think that it was, well yeah, it was unfortunate, but it was basically just some Africans.",
        "So, I think a combination of those two factors leads us not to think about the ramifications and not to think about taking care of the people that survive these disasters.",

        "Do we know anything about whether or not that's the case?",
        "We can only just surmise that given the length of time that existed from when this accident took place and the charges being brought, it's highly unlikely that this is just an accident or it's a coincidence.",
        "It's probably an example of political repression.",
        "And so I think we have to remember, we have to set this in the context.",
        "We have a regime in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, that for quite a number of years has been extremely repressive against opposition.",
        "It has done what it can to play up to the United States and particularly, and most recently, the Bush administration, to prove itself to be a loyal ally.",
        "But domestically, that is within Ethiopia, it's been very repressive of any and all opposition, whether demonstrations, the struggle of the Oromo people or any example of people speaking up and challenging the regime.",
        "So, I think that the circumstances would lead most reasonable people to believe that, yes, this was an act of repression."
