        "...it gets down to it.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",

        "Hi, Jim.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you, Ira?",
        "Hi there.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I - OK.",
        "I have a question about the route that they're proposing for this.",
        "Right now, a train from San Diego going to Bakersfield has to stop in Los Angeles, offload to a bus, and the bus goes over the Grapevine on the interstate.",
        "I understand, looking at The New York Times map, this looks like it's going around, more like through the Tehachapi Pass, which is only slightly less steep than over the Grapevine.",
        "And I'm wondering how they're going to do this with a high-speed rail.",
        "They feel that, look, we need to hold, we need to stem the damages to fewer than 39 seats because that'll make John Boehner of Ohio the next speaker of the House instead of Nancy Pelosi.",
        "So they're pulling back and they have to defend a certain amount of seats.",
        "I'm afraid I'm not intimately familiar with the engineering details of that.",
        "I mean, I certainly know the Tehachapi route in general.",
        "You know, one of the challenges they face in California - and I think this has been one of the reasons why there's been some controversy about that project - is that because of the mountainous nature of the terrain there, they're going to require a lot of tunneling, which is, of course, more expensive than building, you know, out over the flat plains.",
        "But again, as I mentioned earlier, the Californians and the various people working with them have been studying the route alternatives for some time, doing engineering alternative analyses to figure out what's going to be the best compromise in terms of cost and performance and all the factors that go into deciding the route.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Of course, if you're going to build a high-speed rail that gets you to the outskirts of a city, then take as much time to get from the outskirts to the train station, you'd rather have a spur, would you not, that takes you right down to the midtown or wherever you're going to be left off?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that's - I would say from a worldwide perspective, that's certainly what has happened, is that routes are designed to go downtown.",
        "But actually, when you bring up the idea of a spur, I'm reminded of the French system, which, of course, is one of the early and the most well-developed systems in the world.",
        "And they have a really beautiful system that's been developed where pretty much all of their lines go through the Charles de Gaulle Airport on the north side of the city.",
        "But they also have a couple of spurs that go into downtown terminals.",
        "So you can board a train in downtown Paris and go to various points in the country.",
        "But you can also fly into Charles de Gaulle Airport, and it's amazingly convenient.",
        "You walk - you get off the plane, you walk down the hallway in the terminal, and you literally go down two sets of escalators, and you're on the platform waiting for your train."

        "I was out in Los Angeles just this last weekend and saw in the newspaper that the French had asked to - well, they volunteered their expertise for building this, and they were turned down.",
        "And I was wondering, is this hubris on our part, particularly after all the talk we've heard about the French just in the last five minutes?",
        "Yeah.",

        "Dr. Barkan, what do you say?",
        "Well, I'm not familiar with that report.",
        "I wonder if there's not more to the story.",
        "What's happening, I think, in a number of systems around the country is that the French and various other international companies and consortia that have developed expertise in high-speed rail technology over the last half century are very interested in the markets that are potentially developing in the United States, and California kind of being the leader in this regard, there's a lot of interest in that.",
        "And I, yeah, you know, I'm not familiar with that particular point that this listener is - this caller is raising, but I can envision possibly that there was a series of proposals requested and, perhaps, somebody else - somebody else's proposal looked better than the French.",
        "Maybe the Japanese looked better than the French proposal.",
        "That's the way the marketplace works.",
        "How did America lose its way in the railroad business?",
        "I mean, we were in the forefront, right, in the 1960s with everybody else, and then poof.",
        "Let me respond to - first of all, to the premise that we've lost our way in terms of railroads.",
        "This country has - this continent has the best freight railroad system in the world.",
        "You know, we look enviously across the various oceans to high-speed rail systems in Asia and Europe and think, you know, we would like to have that here in the United States.",
        "But they turn around and look back at us and say, we wish we had the U.S.",
        "freight railroad system, which is the most efficient and economical system in the world.",
        "So it's important to understand that when we say we lost our way, we lost our way with regard to our passenger rail system, but not our freight rail system.",
        "In fact, that's gone, you know, in exactly the right direction for the last 40 years.",
        "Regarding what happened with our passenger rail system, it's a complicated question.",
        "And, you know, I've talked about this with my friends and colleagues here.",
        "And there's a variety of things that I think conspired to lead to that situation.",
        "As you say, in the 1960s, we were among the leaders.",
        "We had our Metroliner program.",
        "The Japanese were, of course, developing their Shinkansen.",
        "The French were developing their high-speed TGV.",
        "But the financial condition of the railroad industry, especially in the northeast corridor, was in rather dire straits in that period of time.",
        "And so - and I think the understanding of the potential role of high-speed trains as part of a larger transportation picture kind of got lost because of so many other crises related to the rail industry at that time.",
        "And so we had to kind of put our high-speed rail plans on hold to sort out the whole freight railroad situation, which, among other things, resulted in deregulation of the freight railroad industry and their regaining the health that they're exhibiting today.",
        "I think also - I think we still didn't understand in this country that highway transport and air transport weren't going to be able to fulfill our transportation needs in the future.",
        "Obviously, the price of petroleum was far less then, and our roads were less congested, and our airways were less congested.",
        "But all that - those things have changed in the ensuing 40 years."
