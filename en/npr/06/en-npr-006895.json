        "What I saw on my three trips to Iraq - 2004, 2005 and 2006 - was Marines doing the best that they could to try and execute their security and stability mission, but really in kind of a policy and strategy vacuum.",

        "Now, even if Republicans only win half that, or the Democrats only lose half that, that's still 45 -because math was always my forte - and so 45 is enough to give the Republicans the majority in the House.",
        "Nate Silver of the New York Times does the 538 blog, says that up to 50 seats are in jeopardy.",
        "Now, that's an unusual number, but we've seen it before.",
        "The Republicans picked up 52 seats in 1994.",
        "It's doable, but that would be something.",
        "In the Senate they would need 10 seats to take over control of the United States Senate.",
        "Again, what does that look...",
        "They need 10, and there are some numbers that are looking a little bit better for the Democrats.",
        "Barbara Boxer seems to have a solid, even though a narrow, lead in California.",
        "But again, in Wisconsin, that's not looking great for Russ Feingold.",
