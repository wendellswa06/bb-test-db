        "Mr.",
        "Chabot, since January of 2009, we've heard a lot of Republicans talk about how the deficit has gotten out of control, how spending has gotten out of control.",
        "We really didn't hear the Republicans saying those words, using those words when the Republicans and president - during the Bush administration, when there was a lot of spending out of control and stuff out of control.",
        "And also, a lot of Republicans are talking about ethics and earmarks and things like that, another thing that the Republicans didn't speak of in the old days.",
        "Have the Republicans learned their lesson from what got them kicked out of power in 2006, and do we think things change if the Republicans take over control next year?",
        "Well, I think a lot of us were talking about the spending being unsustainable and not under control when Republicans were in charge.",
        "Now for a few years, Democrats had had control of the House and - well, not the Senate, but the House for 40 years until '94, the Republicans took over.",
        "We hadn't had a balanced budget in 30 years.",
        "We got the budget balanced.",
        "But then unfortunately, Republicans went off the rail, too, and we spending far too much, and there were a number of us more conservative Republicans that were screaming and yelling.",
        "We didn't get a lot of attention.",
        "And we would urge President Bush to veto these appropriations and spending bills, which he wouldn't do because as long as he was getting funding for the war in Afghanistan, the war in Iraq and Homeland Security, he was really, I think, pretty much willing to let Congress spend whatever it wanted to.",
        "So I wasn't satisfied.",
        "A lot of conservative Republicans weren't.",
        "But you're right to the extent that in the mainstream press, you didn't hear much attention about spending.",
        "Relative to ethics, the thing that I remember, particularly, was Nancy Pelosi, when she became speaker, saying that she was going to drain the swamp and, you know, all that sort of thing.",
        "Well, there are some pretty big critters still swimming around in that swamp in Washington."

        "So, the ethics weren't what they should've been under Republican control, and they're not under Democratic control.",
        "But sides, I think, have been guilty and remiss in that area.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line, and we'll go to Phil(ph), and Phil's on the line from Cincinnati.",
        "I've heard a lot of people, and, you know, they equate, they say, well, you know, the economy hasn't been good the past two years.",
        "You know, therefore, you know, we're going to go back to the way the things were.",
        "And really, you know, looking at a lot of the history of Mr. Chabot's votes, I've just seen that he has not been a person, you know, to really stand up for the regulation that's needed, and we've seen what that's caused.",
        "Well, if I can respond.",
        "Generally, when you have a call like that says, well, I've always been a supporter, and I'm not anymore, and here's why, you can almost guarantee that that's never been a supporter.",
        "But relative to the banking comments that the gentleman made, I was one of the folks who voted against the bank bailout, for example, the TARP bill where we - and that was a bill that both the Bush administration and McCain and Obama, when he was in the Senate, pushed.",
        "I opposed that, as I opposed the auto bailout.",
        "I think the last thing we need to do is to have large segments of the American economy taken over by the government, which isn't the most efficient institution to be running these things.",
        "You know, and that's what we've seen.",
        "We've seen a huge power grab by the federal government, whether it's banks, whether it's the auto industry, insurance; now health care, which is about 17 percent of the American economy, is now moving, more and more, into the government's hands.",
        "I think this is - it does not bode well for the country, especially if we're ever going to get this economy moving again and get the American people back to work.",
        "And that's the key issue.",
        "You know, there's all this business about foreign money going into campaigns, and these - they're side issues.",
        "The important thing is getting this economy moving again and getting the American people back to work, and they're doing a very poor job of that right now in Washington."

        "He's the Republican candidate to try to get his old job back, representing the First District of Ohio.",

        "Thanks, Neal, I appreciate it.",
        "And why don't we begin where former Congressman Chabot left off, the health care vote.",
        "Is that something that has been an albatross around your neck in this election?",
        "No, I think there are a lot of questions about the health care vote.",
        "I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about what's actually in the health care bill.",
        "But when I go out there, and I talk about the fact that insurance companies will no longer be able to cut you off because of preexisting conditions, when I talk about Congress finally paying for Medicare Part D and making sure that prescription drugs are going to seniors, as was promised by Congress, when I help people understand the rescission policies and the fact that insurance companies can no longer cut you off if you actually get sick and help them understand that in 2014, there will be a very competitive market so that they can go out there and purchase health care that they can't do right now, people tend to be very favorable.",
        "They react unfavorably if it's called a government takeover of health care or, you know, it's a mischaracterization of what's actually in the bill.",
        "But once they understand what's in it, you know, I find that people are very receptive.",
        "Last time around, everybody thought it was a close race.",

        "But my question is probably what - a lot of people out here are just overwhelmed with how weak your stance is against the Republican Party.",
        "It seems that you do not even begin to comprehend the depth and the scope of the criminality that we went through in the last 12 years, and we're a bit perplexed out here.",

        "When I got to Congress, we passed Wall Street reform, and I think that is the appropriate regulation of the financial services sector that will prevent this type of recession from happening again.",
        "So I point out those things.",
        "I talk about, you know, the policies that led to this structural deficit that we have, the policies that led to tremendous job loss and the policies that took us down the wrong road in housing, and we're all paying for it in our neighborhoods through foreclosures.",
        "So, you know, I have brought that up, and I will continue to bring that up because I think there are really - very real differences between kind of the laissez-faire attitude of the Republicans and, you know, what we're trying to achieve.",
