        "Glen Moberg of Wisconsin Public Radio moderated that debate, and he joins us now from member station WHRM in Wausau.",
        "And Glen, nice to have you with us today.",
        "You can get a word in edgewise on this broadcast.",
        "You might think that, and a lot of people probably did.",
        "But there was a sense - and perhaps not particularly accurate sense - that Burr was considered to be very vulnerable.",
        "His numbers weren't very good.",
        "Of course, nobody else's numbers were particularly good, either.",
        "But the sense was that perhaps the anti-incumbent fever would outweigh the anti-Democrat fever.",
        "And if you look at the most recent polls, that doesn't appear to be what's happening.",
        "So what do the numbers tell you?",
        "Well, Burr started out with a slight lead, which isn't surprising.",
        "He's been in Congress since '94.",
        "And in the Senate, he's finishing up his first term.",
        "He has great name recognition.",
        "Elaine Marshall's been on the scene for a long time.",
        "She's been Secretary of State since 1996.",
        "But that's not exactly a kitchen table sort of position.",
        "You know, people don't really know her very well.",
        "He came into this with a huge war chest.",
        "She came into this with anemic fundraising at best, and it hasn't gone any better since then.",
        "And she went through a bruising primary and a runoff, which pretty much depleted what little cash she had.",
        "So not surprisingly, he's been on the air since early August with - I think he's on his third or fourth ad cycle now.",
        "She has just gotten to be on the air, just in the last few days.",
        "And when we look at the polls, 30 percent of people still don't know who she is.",
        "So, you know, I heard Ken talking about whether or not it's all money, and sometimes it's not.",
        "But in this case, it pretty clearly is, because people just don't know who she is.",
        "Ken?",
        "Laura, from the beginning, it seemed like Democrats were really confident that Richard Burr could be knocked off.",
        "And, again, this is a Republican year, yet his numbers have never looked that overwhelmingly strong.",
        "And what is this about Richard Burr that just seems to give the Democrats a chance - you know, the thoughts that he could be taken?",
        "Well, he - you know, he's a low-key guy.",
        "He's not a polished politician.",
        "He doesn't seek out the spotlight.",
        "You don't get a lot of press releases from his office touting the accomplishment of the weak.",
        "And a lot of people don't think much about him positive or negative.",
        "But on the other hand, that's not necessarily a bad thing this year.",
        "You know, he is around a lot.",
        "He does great constituent service.",
        "And he is not - I mean, despite the fact that he does vote pretty closely with his Republican Caucus in the Senate, he's not what you would call a raging ideologue.",
        "I mean, he's a really - a pretty focus guy, but a pretty low-key guy when it comes to sort of public relations."

        "I think perhaps the Democrats simply - we'll say underestimated, you know, his appeal to the average voters, especially folks in rural and small town areas where he's very popular.",
        "But there was, just two years ago, a senator - now Senator Kay Hagan surprised a lot of people in this state with an insurgent challenge to an established Republican.",
        "Is that a model that Ms. Marshall may be looking towards?",
        "Well, I'm sure it probably is, and I'm sure that gave her hope.",
        "But it's a very different story.",
        "I mean, on one hand, in 2008, you had President Obama to bring young voters and African-American voters to the polls.",
        "And they overwhelmingly voted for Hagan, as well.",
        "So that was a huge part of her win.",
        "Number two, with Elizabeth Dole, you can make the argument she was a celebrity and she didn't spent enough time in North Carolina - which, indeed, they did make that argument.",
        "With Richard Burr, it's really hard to make that argument.",
        "He is not at all a rock star, a celebrity, and he is back in the state on a pretty regular basis.",
        "One other race we wanted to get to you about the North Carolina: House race in the second district, Democrat Bob Etheridge, the incumbent, challenged by Republican Renee Ellmers.",
        "What's going on there?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, Bob Etheridge was confronted by a conservative activist/citizen journalist, and this was this summer.",
        "And Etheridge reacted to him, kind of smacked him and grabbed his arm.",
        "And, of course, that was kind of went viral all over the Web.",
        "But it was, perhaps, not a big deal.",
        "No charges were filed.",
        "But it was a complete about face from his very sort of avuncular, gentle-uncle kind of, you know, image.",
        "And so, you know, that helped Renee Ellmers - who's a first-timer, a Tea Party candidate - to raise some money.",
        "And then she turned around and released another ad recently, the victory mosque ad, which was put together by Carter Wrenn, who's a long-time Republican consultant in North Carolina.",
        "He's a guy who did that ad for Jessie Helms with the hands...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...about affirmative action.",
        "The same guy - put together this ad about why hasn't Bob Etheridge wade in on whether or not New York should have a mosque near ground zero.",
        "And, of course, it has nothing to do with the price of tea in the second district.",
        "But it did get a lot of attention, and it got a little bit more money.",
        "So now she's running some more ads.",
        "And as you can well imagine, that clip of Etheridge being rude to that kid is running on constant replay on a lot of stations.",
        "Laura Leslie, we'll be interested to see what happens election night.",
        "Thanks very much for your time."

        "Well, the very fact that he served, what, three terms now indicates that, yes, he's been around for a long time.",
        "But he is unpredictable, and he has taken positions that have alienated both Democrats and Republicans and liberals and conservatives throughout the year.",
        "He tries to keep himself fresh.",
        "He makes a point of visiting every county and holding listening sessions each year.",
        "And that's 72 counties in Wisconsin.",
