        "Well, 97 percent of what I would hear from the Marines that I spent time with - and I spent time mostly with staff sergeants and below, so, you know, the young guys that were out on the streets, actually, trying to do their mission and come home safely - not a lot of focus on politics.",
        "And I have to say that from 2004 to 2006 - and the Marines I keep up with now in 2007 - I think that there is kind of a resignation.",
        "And Marines will fall back on what Marines do.",
        "They say, you know, it is our job to go out there and follow our orders and try and execute our TTP - our tactics, techniques and procedures - the best as we can and move on, and we don't dwell on the big picture stuff.",
        "But privately, you know, either without the reporter around or when my camera is down, people would, you know, express some frustration that this was kind of, you know, a Sisyphean sort of a struggle.",
        "Now, Jonathan, has race ever entered into any of the scenarios that you've been in, either with soldiers, government officials, fellow journalists, locals?",
        "You know, both of you were African-American, how was that played out if it all for you, Jonathan?",
        "Well, I would say - well, first of all, the staff here, at least here at NPR, they've given - we have a rotation of reporters and producers and chiefs that come in and out.",
        "And they've - I found out very soon that they give us all nicknames.",
        "And my nickname is Ali(ph).",
        "And some of the staffers told me that they didn't even know what my real name was because they called me Ali.",
        "And one of the reasons why they called is because I have a darker skin complexion and they say that I look like some of the Iraqis that you would see now.",
        "As a matter of fact, my nickname was Ali Basri(ph) because they thought that I look like somebody from Basra.",
        "Hmm.",
        "But, yeah - yeah, go figure.",
        "So - but - I was asking them when I first got here, you know, what do you know about African-Americans what have you.",
        "And candidly, some of the staff were saying that, well, we know what we see on TV.",
        "Now, the Iraqi staff was saying that the people of color - Hispanics and what have you soldiers that they run into they know they're nice.",
        "But the average Iraqi just knows what they see on TV.",
        "And, quite frankly, some of the stuff that they see on TV they get in any American movie that you've seen, they've seen it.",
        "And some of the images they have of African-Americans are not that flattering.",
        "When you think about this, Brian, in terms of the breadth of reporting that Americans have done on war, what historical comparisons can you make to Vietnam?",
        "That's really, really interesting and sort of bedeviling.",
        "I mean, in Vietnam, there was a much greater access to all kinds of things.",
        "And, you know, just reading a quote by one of my idols, Gloria Emerson, who is in Vietnam in 1970, '71, '72.",
        "And she said, we use helicopters like taxis.",
        "There was no embedding right there is now, there was no vetting process.",
        "So there was much greater access to pretty much the range of what combat activities and support activities.",
        "Now, you pretty much, if you want to be up close and personal with U.S.",
        "troops, it's a pretty kind of controlled situation and you need to do that through the Department of Defense and through, you know, the various offices in Sepik in Baghdad with which maybe Jonathan knows a bit more about.",
        "But…",
        "I'm all too familiar what Sepik, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it sounds like very briefly protocol and paperwork."

        "Now, I think that since the war/occupation isn't necessarily going the way that commanders would like to go.",

        "Well, I think there should be the consequence, but first we just had to fulfill our role as required by the law, and our role was to understand what happened leading up to the storm and what happened in the 14 or two weeks after the storm.",
