        "In the west, the dictator's forces are shelling the remote town of Zintan and are in firm control of Tripoli, the capital.",
        "In Misrata, the rebel's main western enclave, Gadhafi's forces still control the airport and all access to the city except the port, which Gadhafi has tried to mine and which he sporadically shells with heavy artillery.",

        "Air Force Major General Mark Ramsay, the glass is half full.",
        "NATO's chief of operations and intelligence says Colonel Gadhafi now is unable to effectively command his forces in the field.",
        "Take communications - Gadhafi, Ramsay says, now has to use unsecured phones and couriers.",
        "He has to resort to all sorts of measures that no military professional wants to resort to.",
        "From the old fashioned runner system, wireless communications, runners, those types of things.",
        "I wouldn't say he's in the 1860 Calvary mode, but it's getting pretty close to that.",
        "In addition, General Ramsay says, Colonel Gadhafi is having huge problems resupplying his troops with the basics - bullets, food, spare parts -essential to sustaining any military campaign.",

        "Gen.",
        "RAMSAY: Every day he wakes up, he has less fuel, he has less ammunition, he has less ability to control the forces he's got.",
        "And we're seeing that play out on the ground very vividly in that it's pretty obvious the balance is tipping not in his favor.",
        "Yet the Libyan military has proved an adaptive, crafty enemy for NATO.",
        "After NATO destroyed or damaged some 260 of Gadhafi's tanks and armored personnel carriers, he changed tactics.",
        "He effectively deployed mobile mortar and rocket teams in modified pickup trucks and other vehicles that more easily blend in with the civilian population.",
        "It worked against rebels in the east and civilians who'd risen up against the regime in Misrata.",
        "Tara Lovestead is a chemical engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colo.",
        "She and her colleagues are looking for the chemical signature of a high, so that instead of relying on people to determine cannabis impairment, a standardized test might, one day, do the trick.",
        "We like to know the human error and the limitations of the human opinion and want to make it as scientific-based in fact as we can.",
        "It's actually really hard to do this kind of research because Lovestead works in a federal lab and, federally, cannabis is considered a Schedule 1 substance.",
        "So even though she's in Colorado, getting a hold of a sample of THC for research purposes is just as hard as getting a hold of heroin.",
        "Right.",

        "We just don't know whether or not that means they're still intoxicated or impaired or not.",
        "A leading research group found evidence of THC in the blood of frequent smokers up to a month after they stopped consuming.",
        "And, in other people, blood samples showed no trace of THC, even though the researchers had just watched them smoke joints.",
        "There's no quantitative measure that could stand up in a court of law.",
        "Now, people like Lovestead are setting the standards for a reliable breath test starting with the fundamental physical properties of THC.",
        "But, in the meantime, back at the hotel, this course is the best there is.",
        "And, at least, now, the officers know what pot strains like OG Kush and Skunk Dawg actually smell like.",
