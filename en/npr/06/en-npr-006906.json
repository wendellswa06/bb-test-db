        "Exactly.",
        "She doesn't drink, and she doesn't like parties.",
        "She's - after all, she's a very bright woman, and she - her idea of a good evening is a quiet dinner party with some intelligent friends.",
        "So she has to find some way to occupy her time.",
        "And what she does is take up, as a hobby, inventing.",
        "She sets aside one of the rooms in her house and puts up a drawing table and all the tools, the right kind of lights.",
        "There's an entire wall of technical reference books on one side of the room.",
        "And she sets herself keeping busy in these off-hours, trying to come up with new ideas for inventions.",
        "And she goes to - I'm sorry.",
        "So she's at a party, and she meets the man who's going to make history with her.",
        "She has begun to be very interested in the war, which began, of course, in Europe on the first of September, 1939.",
        "She's been following the story, of course, because her country was occupied by Germany, and therefore is part of the Axis empire at this point."

        "She's particularly interested in the submarine warfare that's going on between the German U-boats and British shipping, because when she went to all these fancy dinner parties with her Austrian husband, he, after all, was talking to German admirals, German officers, German technical specialists about the kind of problems they were having with, for example, torpedoes and submarines.",
        "So she knows a lot about this.",
        "And it's particularly interesting to her and horrifying to her in the summer of 1940, when the German U-boats begin torpedoing the ocean liners that are carrying English children out of England to safety in Canada, to get away from the blitz which had begun, the bombing of London and the bombing of England.",
        "One ship in particular, in September of 1940, was torpedoed with the loss of the lives of 99 children, and she's horrified.",
        "And she thinks: There must be something I, Hedy Lamarr, can do to stop this terrible butchering of children.",
        "And then at this dinner party, just a few weeks later, she meets a young avant-garde composer named George Antheil, who happens, at the age of 18 - this is his technical expertise, from her point of view - to have been an inspector in a bullet factory in the United States during the First World War.",
        "Well, as he said later, well, that was the only person she could find who had this particular set of skills.",
        "So she says, let's get together and talk about this.",
        "She's also concerned about making her breasts larger, and he happens to have written a series of articles in Esquire - while he's scratching around for a living - about how certain hormones can enlarge the breasts.",

        "You tell it better than I do.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "So they get together over a series of evenings, and they start thinking about: How could you build a torpedo that could be made more accurate?",
        "And they think: all right, radio guidance.",
        "Yeah, but it's easy to jam a radio signal.",
        "And this is where Hedy's invention comes in.",
        "With - for reasons that are not quite clear in the record - but I think there are some antecedents to it in her own past - she comes up with the idea that if you could make the radio signal jump around from frequency to frequency at a fairly fast rate, at least a few dozen times per second, that someone trying to jam the signal won't be able to find it."

        "And if they broadcast a big, noisy signal that covers the whole range of frequencies, it will just occasionally sound like a little blip on the one or two or three or 10 or a hundred frequencies that the signal is bouncing around them on.",
        "This is her crucial invention.",
        "And they do, together, get a patent on this idea and its manifestation in a torpedo design, and this brings in George Antheil's interests.",
        "He's someone who, in the course of his avant-garde composition, was once faced with a problem of how do you coordinate the playing of up to 16-player pianos.",
        "He never succeeded, really, in doing that, but he did learn about the idea of using a scroll of paper or some other kind of tape that's punched with holes to convey the signal to this piano of which key to play.",
        "And by adapting that so that the whole signal and electronic signal to be produced, they devised one form of their invention which is the one they use in their patent to show that it's a practical idea.",
        "But you couldn't cram all of that into a torpedo.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "This turns out to be the disaster from the Navy point of view.",
        "The Navy officers who are involved in looking at this invention don't really get the idea that this player-piano system is just one idea, that there are many different ways to make this happen.",
        "As Antheil wrote later, you could have put it on a piece of wire and run it through a mechanism the size of a wristwatch, which is true.",
        "But the Navy didn't see it that way and said, how are you going to put a player piano in a torpedo?",
        "And they threw the invention away.",
        "But many years later, it got picked up.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "But after the war, and unfortunately, after the invention had - their patent had expired in the 1950s, a curious electrical engineer with a long Hungarian name, which I can't even pronounce - but he was the son of a series of counts and counts going back in history came - was handed this expired patent.",
        "And the Navy said, can you use this to make a jam-proof signal for a sonobuoy, a buoy that would float on the water, send down sonar signals if it registers that there's a submarine underneath, would then transmit the information to a plane flying overhead using frequency hopping to make the signal unjammable.",
        "He says, sure.",
        "And he built - designed such a system.",
        "At that point, the military picks up on this technology because one of the fundamental problems with military communications is you don't want them to be jammed.",
        "And so you find ship-to-ship radios that were on ships during the Cuban missile crisis, control systems for missiles - from the ground to the missile.",
        "Ultimately, GPS, the signal that comes back to Earth that we use to read the GPS information is frequency hopping.",
        "And you - and then in the 1980s when this technology was declassified, it was no longer secret, it began to be picked up first on car radios and then on cell phones, wireless telephones, Bluetooth - for a different reason.",
        "Now, the problem is you have a fairly low-powered signal going around from, let's say my cell phone to the central tower, and the problem is if everything's on one frequency, they're all going to be interfering with each other."

        "Well, she lived long enough to see her work bear fruit.",

        "And she was pretty invisible for the rest of her life.",
        "So she wanted recognition that in an interview for a magazine in 1990 when she was then approaching her 80's, she said, people seem to just take and take and they never give back.",
        "She really was unhappy about it.",
        "Fortunately, some of the early pioneers of wireless computer systems picked up on the fact that this had been Hedy's patent all those years ago and started a quiet movement to get her some kind of recognition.",
        "And in 1998 when she was, I think, about 80 years old, she finally was awarded a Communications Pioneer Freedom Foundation award and was delighted with it.",
        "But when they called her up to tell her about the award, Hedy being Hedy, she said, well, it's about time.",
