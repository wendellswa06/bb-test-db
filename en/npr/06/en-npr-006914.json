        "But that scenario is a little too clever for the election committee, says Tim Stubson.",
        "I don't think that there is the unanimity of purpose among those 73 members to carry out a strategy like that.",
        "Now, think about things from the governor's perspective.",
        "Does he want to select the least conservative of the three names he's given - the one closest to his own Democratic leanings?",
        "Or would he fear that a moderate Republican incumbent would be harder for a Democrat to defeat when the seat comes up for election in 2008?",
