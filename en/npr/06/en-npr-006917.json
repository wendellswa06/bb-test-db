        "He wasn't expected to win Wisconsin but did worse than the polls were predicting and failed to pick up any delegates.",

        "I mean, when you look at what the states that are voting on April 19, which is New York, and then April 26, which is mid-Atlantic and kind of Northeast, Donald Trump's going to do extremely well.",
        "And so he is going to have a run then followed by Cruz is going to have a run.",
        "It's going to go back and forth for a while.",
        "So this is - we are - this is far from over.",
