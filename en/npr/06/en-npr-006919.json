        "A few months ago, we did a story about Americans' drinking habits that got a lot of people thinking.",
        "The bad news was that many Americans are drinking more than one or two drinks a day, which is the upper limit of what experts think is safe.",
        "And this means that many who think of themselves as social drinkers actually fall into the category of excessive drinking.",
        "Today in Your Health, NPR's Allison Aubrey follows up on this story asking a new question - if you're drinking too much and want to cut back, where can you go for help?",
        "The thinking about alcohol dependence used to be very black and white.",
        "There was a belief that there were basically two kinds of drinkers - alcoholics, who needed treatment, and everyone else whose drinking was OK.",
        "But that dichotomous yes-no, you have it or don't, is inadequate."
