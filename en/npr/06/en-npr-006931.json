        "You know, I think the biggest thing is that actually they kind of connect to all of the different issues that are impacting the Great Lakes, right?",
        "So they become a way for invasive species to move from one area to another because the species will actually cling to the plastic and move with the plastic.",
        "And so, essentially, the plastics themselves kind of almost become this conglomeration for all of these other issues.",
