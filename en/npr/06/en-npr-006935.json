        "NPR's John Hendren spent a day with the General in Baghdad.",
        "As he begins his latest visit to Baghdad, General Abizaid says he has one major goal for this year, that 2006 will be the year in which the United States shifts the balance of the war to Iraq's new government.",
        "For the past nearly three years now we have been in the lead in counter-insurgency operations in the country, and in 2006 it's our task to move from being in the lead to being in support.",
        "And shifting this balance is a very easy thing to say but a hard thing to do, especially with institutions that aren't quite mature enough to handle the pressures of a national insurgency such as that what exist here today.",
        "In many ways progress has been sluggish.",
        "Lights throughout the country routinely go dark without warning.",
        "The Shiite areas to the south and the Kurdish areas to the north are relatively quiet.",

        "You know, I can think back to how things were three years ago, when I first came here in April of '03.",
        "I remember saying too, there was a tank right outside this building firing its main gun round down the road at some target.",
        "There weren't people moving around, it was clearly a war zone.",
        "There was no Iraqi army, there was no Iraqi police, there as no order anywhere.",
        "Now, the great unknown during this particular period is how is the government going to shape up?",
        "As Abizaid speaks across town, Iraq's ruling Shiite Muslim coalition announces the latest sign of political progress.",
        "Two days after the December parliamentary election was certified, interim Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari is appointed to serve Iraq's first full four-year term heading the government.",
        "The U.S., meanwhile, intends to cut troop levels this year, but Abizaid is making no promises.",
        "I can see some circumstances, as anybody else could, that if the situation were to get worse in some areas we would have to ask for more troops.",
        "And if we have to do that we'll do that.",
        "You can see a scenario where the country moves towards civil war because of sectarian pressures becoming too great.",
        "I would say these are low probability events.",
        "He urges those in Congress and elsewhere who are calling for U.S.",
        "withdrawal from Iraq to be patient.",
        "People who want to rush this thing are making a mistake.",
        "The difference in the confidence of the commanders in the field who are doing the job and the lack of confidence I sense in some quarters, in Washington in particular, always puzzles me."

        "You saw women have access to even abortion in Tunisia years before they had legal access to that in other countries in the West.",
        "And although there are conservative elements within Ennahda and, of course, within other Islamist parties in Tunisia that would like to see, I think, some of the existing laws that are to the benefit of women rolled back in that country, Ennahda itself has say we're not going to do that.",
        "We're not going to change the laws as they relate to women.",
