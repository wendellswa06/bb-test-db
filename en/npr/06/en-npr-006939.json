        "An we heard both candidates just now addressing the immigration issue.",
        "Interesting to hear Barack Obama taking McCain on directly before this audience, which he must know is a key constituency in November.",
        "Yes.",
        "Obama went on the attack.",
        "He's been very aggressive about an issue that McCain has really been strongly identified with.",
        "But Obama sees an opening here.",
        "Right now, in some polls, he's leading among Hispanic voters 2-1.",
        "And when he said that John McCain abandoned his stance - he said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation - he was referring to a moment in a Republican primary debate where McCain was pressed on this and said, if your bill came up for a vote, would you vote for it?",
        "And he kept on saying, well, that's a hypothetical question, it won't come up, we failed.",
        "And the questioner was very persistent, and McCain really committed one of the most basic errors of a candidate - he answered a hypothetical question, and he said no. And now Obama's going to punish him for it."

        "Now, as - if you look at the candidates' positions on immigration, is there a major gap between what Barack Obama is saying and what John McCain is saying?",
        "There really isn't, and you can't really say that McCain switched his positions.",
        "What McCain did is the bill that he proposed and sponsored had a path to legalization for undocumented aliens.",
        "Also, it had some border security measures.",
        "He hasn't given up on the path to citizenship, but now he says we have to secure the border first because if we don't, Americans won't support comprehensive immigration reform.",
        "Both these candidates are for the same thing - a path to citizenship that doesn't reward people who came in illegally.",
        "But McCain did change his emphasis, and Obama sees that as an opening especially with this key battleground demographic group of voters, and he's pushing on it.",
        "When Hispanic voters are polled on what issues are most important to them, what is the main issue?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",

        "Hispanic voters also care about Iraq; they are disproportionately represented in the Armed Forces.",

        "[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: According to the Department of Defense, Hispanics are actually underrepresented in the active forces as a whole, compared to their numbers in the civilian population.]",
        "However, in the latest Pew poll, I should tell you that immigration is one of the very, very few issues where McCain has an advantage over Obama.",

        "Wearing a casual brown turtleneck, Mr. Putin walked with Mr. Bush along the Black Sea and joked around with him as they were checking out a model of the 2014 Winter Olympics to be held here in Sochi."
