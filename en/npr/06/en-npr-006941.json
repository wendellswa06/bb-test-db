        "Thank you very much.",
        "So aside from his crude language, for which he's apologized, why do you think that Jesse Jackson was right?",
        "Well, I'm not sure that he was right.",
        "I think that he just voiced something that a number of people have been saying, and I actually was led to write the article not based on what he said, but based on what I'd been hearing for the last couple of weeks from actually younger activists.",
        "I mean, people have made this to be a generational issue.",
        "But in the last couple of weeks I'd heard much the same thing from - from other folks, who just seemed to have a problem with where they thought Jesse Jackson was - I mean, I'm sorry, Barack Obama was going.",

        "Sure.",

        "I think people - you know, first of all, Barack Obama has given that speech a number of times since he's run.",

        "I mean, that was the first black church in Chicago that Barack Obama was speaking at after the Jeremiah Wright incident, after the Father Pfleger incident.",
        "So people were looking on that day in particular, a number of people, that looked to see what he would do on that day to distance himself from that kind of thinking.",

        "You know, it could have been a speech on love for America, you know, could have been a number of things, on patriotism or whatever it is.",
        "But that, you know, sacrificing black fathers on, you know, on that day, on the day when you should be honoring them, you know, it was a - just sounded a bad note.",
        "But I think it was more indicative of other issues they have with him and not specific to that particular speech.",
        "And that, again, is sort of a revival of the arguments - well, Bill Cosby had raised several of the same issues.",
        "This is, though, you're saying, a much more political concern, that by saying that where he said it, to whom he said it, Senator Obama was sending a message.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think there is a fear that he was trying to play out to another audience and not necessarily the people in the pews.",
        "You know, one of the arguments I make , you know, if the people who really needed to hear that message, you know, were in church, then we probably wouldn't need to hear that message.",
        "And the message probably wouldn't be necessary in the first place.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But you know, had he done it the next day, somewhere else, I don't think you would have heard the firestorm at all from anybody.",
        "I think it really was about place and time and opportunity and, you know, what you could have done with that, you know, with that world stage on that day, when everybody was really looking for him to come out and distance himself from Reverend Wright.",
        "There were other opportunities there on that day.",
        "But again, I think it's indicative of people really just having a real difference, you know, a reasonable difference, in how to win at this point.",
        "And I think that's what the real argument is about, that Jesse Jackson and those who are on the more left side of the Democratic Party, particularly those who are African-American activists, and you know, not just African American but other activists and people who are, you know, very much active in the community and in social programs, have a fundamental problem with this idea that he is moving to more of a centrist position.",
        "And that whole idea of the post-racial position, too.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, you know, a number of people have just, you know, scoffed at the post-racial thing, you know, that it never really existed, that you're never beyond race in this country.",

        "But maybe for other people, you know, who are not black, the feeling is that, you know, getting beyond race means that my comfort level has increased, that, you know, I can criticize without being called a racist, that, you know, I don't have to deal with this race issue anymore.",

        "I think, you know, as Jesse Jackson said, one of the problems with that is, you know, does that leave out the foundational issues that are still inherent in this country that add to some of the problems?",
        "But, you know, again, I think that that particular speech and that particular subject is really slightly tangential to the argument that are a lot of people who are sitting on the sidelines right now who are usually part of the game and all the activists who are generally very active and very well connected to campaigns are not as connected to this one.",

        "And there were other ways to do that without having to focus on black pathology, particularly on a day when, you know, you generally celebrate what people are doing right.",
