        "So I think people who are hardcore liberals who support him seem to embrace him as a hardcore liberal.",
        "But if you really look at the way he's voted over the years, you know, he looks at the left, and he looks at the right and seems to come to some sort of elegant middle.",
        "And sometimes it's a little left of center, but at least it's after looking at both sides.",
        "And I think that's something to be praised, not to be attacked.",
        "But I think those people who perceive that he is more left than he has been in the past are probably upset.",

        "Not necessarily Obama's problem, but it's part of their problem that they aren't as close.",
        "So they don't necessarily trust strategic moves that they aren't privy to, and that's part of the...",
        "Joe...",
        "That goes to, you know, Obama's running for President of the Unites States, not of the Black Congressional Caucus, not of black America, and we as African-Americans need to recognize what the brother has to contend with and be supportive of that, you know.",

        "I mean, that's only realistic.",
        "But, you know, obviously, he's running for president of the Unites States, and what the liberal wing of the party is going to have to get with is that, you know, if he doesn't win, the question is moot, you know, to quote Jesse Jackson on something else he said on \"\"Saturday Night Live.",
