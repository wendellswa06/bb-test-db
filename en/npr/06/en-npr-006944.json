        "You're right though, even the best behaviors can be taken too far.",
        "And whether that's your knees or time, sometimes we all need to learn a resolution to let go just a little bit of even the more positive elements in our life.",

        "We need to prepare for the long haul, the changed lifestyle, just as Karen discussed.",
        "And we should keep in mind that even if you're not successful this year, our research shows that virtually everyone who doesn't succeed this year will try again next year.",
