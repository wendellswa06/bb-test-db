        "What I discovered in actually trying to do a Michael Crichton novel is I discovered quite a lot about his research technique which I'm sure he used for \"\"The Andromeda Strain.\"\" He was a veracious reader and he tended to read very highly technical scientific stuff, and you can see in \"\"The Andromeda Strain\"\" where he's been delving deeply into material that the public really didn't have any idea about.",
        "And for example, he obviously had read and knew a lot about the Army laboratories in Fort Detrick, Maryland, where the researchers, even back then in 1969, were working with space suits and dealing with extremely dangerous organisms.",
        "Back then, they had been working on biological weapons.",
        "Right.",
        "Really nasty stuff.",
        "Michael knew quite a lot about hits and he knew that the labs are divided into these levels, levels one through four.",

        "And - but, you know, after hanging out in these labs and writing about them in a non-fiction way for \"\"The Hot Zone,\"\" I could see exactly what he had learned.",
        "But what he did was he turned it into a - just a dynamic page turner, a real thriller.",
        "And it purports to be an after-action report.",
        "This is what the government does when there's a secret, classified action and they write up a classified report.",
        "Right.",

        "It's a little small cylinder of transparent plastic, it's about the size of a peanut and it's honed down to sort of chiseled point.",
        "And right on the point, there is a black dot about the size of a poppy seed, and it's a sample of monkey liver.",
        "Now, as I said, it's been completely sterilized.",
        "The monkey liver was infected with Ebola Zaire virus originally, the hottest of the strains of Ebola - 90 percent fatality rate in humans.",
        "Now, this little object that I'm describing is used to prepare a sample for an electron microscope which can magnify a virus particle, you know, 20,000 times or more till it looks like the size of a golf ball.",
        "And now, in \"\"The Andromeda Strain,\"\" Crichton describes this object exactly.",
        "So you knew he had seen it but he gives it this wonderful thriller twist.",
        "Instead of the virus sample being this little black dot of tissue, he's got a glowing green which is cinematic.",
        "It's amazing that you brought that, Richard, because I thought this was actually one of the most telling parts of the book, of how skilled Michael Crichton is at describing science.",
        "Because I was reading it enraptured with the process of preparing a sample for an electron-scanning microscope, that's incredible.",
        "I mean, that can be very dull very easily and he did make it so visual and the picture that I had in my mind really was pretty similar to now what I see it is.",
        "It's pretty cool.",
        "He's very talented at that, you know, and all through the book, in just a few words, a few sentences, he can describe something that you might think I need to study biology or something for.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And he has a wonderfully visual imagination, and that's what propels his language into these descriptions that you can just see in your mind's eye, you know, his description of the Wildfire Laboratory at Flatrock, Nevada where you go down underground and there are these different levels.",
        "The other thing that I thought was striking about \"\"The Andromeda Strain,\"\" which actually adds to its realism, now, is the curiously anachronistic computer printouts that you see.",
        "Yes.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "I love it.",
        "This is state of the art in 1969, right, when computers would spit out these reams of paper with these little X's all over them."

        "Right.",

        "And he says, you know, you might think it could come from outer space, like we, you know, something foreign.",
        "This one actually came from the Earth.",
        "I mean, this is fascinating, you know, that the Earth somewhere maybe thousands, millions of years ago, a strain of bacteria got kicked up into the atmosphere, lived up there for a while, stayed up there, mutated, and came back and attacked us again.",
        "And sure enough this week, we saw a research that sort of talks about this not as Andromeda strain, but as a possibility for evolution.",
        "Of bacteria being up in the cloud.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Kicked up from Earth, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And nowadays, of course, we're finding out that bacteria have this amazing ability to live in environments that we would have assumed are completely hostile to bacteria.",
        "Michael, I think, was tapped into the zeitgeist at the time, at least in advanced science circles, where already, scientists were beginning to talk about the possibility of new and emerging infectious diseases that could enter the human population and sweep through it.",
        "In particular, there was Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel-winning bacteriologist, who I'm pretty sure Michael had read, and maybe even have known him personally.",
        "But Joshua, in about 1966, predicted that bacteria would evolve resistance to antibiotics and that he thought that a new virus would be likely to come along out of the natural ecosystems of the world.",
        "And he predicted that it would be a sexually transmitted virus and it would be highly lethal.",
        "That was a prediction of the HIV virus decades before it occurred."
