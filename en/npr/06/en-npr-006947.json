        "Yeah.",
        "Well, Michael Crichton had a - he faced a narrative problem here in \"\"The Andromeda Strain,\"\" which I've heard filmmakers in Hollywood when they're doing a great virus movie - you know, a panic in the streets, virus movie - they call it the problem with the third act.",

        "And I think Crichton neatly sidestepped that problem by - I don't want to give too much of a spoiler away, but let's just say that...",

        "No, because anybody who told me I was going to be writer when I was 15 I would have disbelieved it.",
        "But I think in retrospect, it certainly did because when I turned to non-fiction writing, the story of an Ebola outbreak, when I heard it, Army soldiers had been involved in it.",
        "And they were wearing spacesuits at the time, and people were white-knuckle scared.",

        "But I wonder if you know more about that, Richard.",
        "Well, I think he certainly did.",
        "I think he saw human beings as being very frail and weak, and he included scientists in that category.",
