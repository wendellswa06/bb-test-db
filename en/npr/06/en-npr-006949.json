        "Yeah, I've been talking to the Coast Guard the last couple of days about this.",

        "And it is just huge.",

        "I've been driving around looking at these big industrial sites, and a lot of them are still inundated.",
        "And so it's just not clear yet what might've ruptured, what may be leaking or have just gotten loose after this storm.",
        "And what could make things worse - I mean, there's some of these so-called Superfund sites, which we know are contaminated because they're called that.",
        "They've been flooded, which I gather could make things even worse.",
        "Yeah, there are at least 13 of these Superfund sites that were hit by Harvey.",
        "The Environmental Protection Agency has only been able to reach two of those so far.",
        "They've tested them, and they seem OK.",
        "But 11 other of these Superfund sites - they are so flooded, so dangerous to get to that the EPA issued a statement saying, we just can't get to them; it's still too dangerous.",

        "What we are doing quite awhile ago is recording individual neurons and then - so neurons are the cells of the brain, and we record activity, the electrical activity as each one fires, and what we found is that as you move your arm in different direction, these neurons seemed to be quite sensitive to that.",
        "So each neuron has the, what we call a preferred direction, that likes to fire in a direction of arm movement.",
        "Right.",
        "And then once we know which direction each cell likes to fire in, we can add responses from many of these cells together, and get a very accurate representation of what the arm movement is.",

        "Well, to get a really high density arm trajectory of the path of the arm, it takes about 30 to 100 electrodes recording about that many neurons.",
        "Well, that sounds like a lot of detailed work to get this set up.",
        "Well, actually, that's why it's taken about 20 years, so that we are - could develop this technology to allow us to record all these cells at the same time.",
        "Right.",
        "And I guess you also need the cooperation of the monkeys.",
        "At what role do they play?",
        "Well, initially we had the monkeys working at what we call, open loop conditions, and they didn't even really know that we're recording the nodes from their neurons.",
        "And one of the big advances was to close the loop, to give them an indication of what the signal was that we are recording from their brain.",
        "And once they do that, they could actually learn to use this device and improve the way their neurons fired.",
        "So, how - walk us through this experiment and how do you train them to associate their thoughts with the movement of an arm.",
        "It's seems - that's hard.",
        "Well, the first thing we had to do was to familiarize them with the whole concept of controlling the tool.",
        "In this case was a robot arm, and what we had them do is move the joystick back and forth, and that joystick was linked to the movement of the arm, and they learn just by moving the joystick that they could bring food to their mouth.",
        "So, that gave them the general idea what we wanted them to do.",
        "And then what we did, is we implanted these electrodes in their brain and had them basically think about moving the arm, and what we did is we held a piece of food up in front of them, and then we moved the arm for them, and as we did that, we saw that neurons in their brain fired as if they were imagining that they're actually moving that.",
        "And once we saw the neurons fire, we knew to recognize those and use those in our control scheme.",
        "And then we just proceeded step by step.",
        "So, first we had the animal move the arm to the vicinity of the food, and then stabilize the arm, and then learn to close the grip around it, and finally to bring the arm back to the mouth.",
        "Wow.",
        "And they were rewarded with..."

        "How long did it take you to train the monkeys to actually make the arm work?",
        "Well, that's sort of a tough question to answer, because as we are training the monkey, we're also doing a lot of debugging of both our equipment and software.",
        "So, that ended up taking a few weeks.",
        "But I think that if we're to do it again, right away now that we have everything fixed, we could probably do it in two to three days.",
