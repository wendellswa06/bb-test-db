        "No, but sometimes we've had monkeys last as long as seven years with the electrodes implanted in their brain.",
        "The longevities of these electrodes have been increasing over the recent years.",
        "I see.",
        "Because, I understand, early on that was a real limitation of the work.",
        "Well, still a limitation in that scar tissue tends to form around these tiny electrodes, and then our signal degrades.",
        "And actually the signal does get a little worse, but we can still use some aspects of it.",
        "Mm.",
        "Well, let's go to the phones here.",
        "Our number is 1-800-989-TALK.",

        "Good.",
        "How are you?",
        "Very well.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "I'm just curious if this research is sort of going towards paralysis victims perhaps?",
        "Looking at perhaps through these signals and reconnecting to limbs - any sort of research towards that?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you very...",
        "Thanks.",
        "Michel, I want to go really quickly back to the negative reaction.",
        "Well, that's exactly what we're trying to show here.",
        "We want to help patients that can't move their arms, or that have amputation of the arm.",
        "So, what we're showing right with this research is that, you know, that we can do self feeding basically."

        "Mm.",
        "And there have been some experiments in human beings, right?",
        "Well, how do the monkey experiments compare?",
        "So, we're using the same exact electrodes that have been implanted in a number of humans.",
        "And those humans were able to control cursors in a computer monitor.",
        "I see.",
        "So, what's the difference between that and the robotic arm?",
        "Well, there's a big difference between working in a computer and working a physical device.",
        "This physical device you know, doesn't work exactly the way we command it to.",
        "There's things like marshmallow sticking to the hand, or fruit slipping from the gripper, and actually the monkey has to learn to handle all these conditions.",
        "Right.",
        "And when I reach out and touch something of course, I get feedback from my fingers, is - and that helps me manipulate whatever I'm holding.",
        "Do the monkeys get any kind of feedback from that?",
        "Well, right now, the only feedback the monkeys get are - is from their vision.",
        "As we increase the complexity of the task, and start using fingers in a dexterous way, we fully realize that we're going to need to have tactile sensation.",
        "And what we hope to do is use sensors in the prosthetic fingers, and then take that information and feed it back to the brain, stimulate sensory regions.",
        "Ah.",
        "And that's another wiring job.",
        "Is that more difficult?",
        "Well, it's going to be another challenge.",
        "But hopefully, if we start simple, we'll be successful.",

        "I've very enjoyed hearing about the monkey robotic successes that you've been making, and I just a bit - wanted to get a bit of a monkey off my own back.",
        "And that's about a very serious threat to the northeast watershed, involving the fracturing of gas, using the exemption of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, which could potentially threaten everything.",
        "And wouldn't we be better off putting a robotic monkey's arm down there, instead of trying to mock around with threatening the greater watershed like that?"

        "Bye-bye.",
        "So, tell me about how many other people, or how many of the labs are doing this kind of research around the world.",
        "Well, there are a number of other labs doing this similar approach, but what's really exciting is the whole field of what we call neural-engineering, that's just exploding now.",
        "This whole idea of linking engineering with neuro - basic neurosciences are really hot topic, and the community is growing explosively.",
        "And obviously, you have some very practical end points here.",
        "But what are you learning about the brain in the process of doing this?",
        "Well, so the technology we've developed allows us to record from a group of neurons simultaneously, and that's much more representative of how the brain really functions.",
        "Every time we do anything, there's millions and millions of neurons that change your activity, and the better we can sample that network activity, the better we can understand what's going on.",
        "And we're just beginning - very early stages to try to understand the brain from this perspective and this prosthetic success is an example of that.",
        "Any prospect of doing this with essentially remote sensing of the brain, not having to put electrodes into it?",
        "Well, so a number of groups have been trying to do this from outside the brain with EEG, and there has been some limited success.",
        "But I think the kind of details we really need to get full prosthetic control, is going to require this kind of technology.",

        "Is there anything we can learn about what's going on inside of the monkey's brain, and possibly other animals and you know, what could that potentially lead to?",
        "And when words like miraculous or stunning start flying around, they'll attach themselves to the coach we now think of as nondescript."

        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "As we study movement, and as it becomes more and more complex, we realize that a lot of these relational movements are really the output of our intentions.",
        "And if you link intentions a little bit more, you start to get things like consciousness, decision making, intention to move, and we are working toward that.",
        "Of course, it's pretty hard to assess consciousness in a monkey, because we can't speak to them.",
        "But as these experiments progress to humans, I think we can really begin to attack some of these issues.",
        "Mm.",
        "So, yeah, I guess that would be interesting, if you could actually get in and study that.",
        "But maybe not electrodes.",
        "This probably may not be the way to get into that sort of topic.",
        "So - so...",
        "So, actually we are really interested in learning how these network properties produce things like learning, and thinking, and decision making.",
        "So, we're actually working real hard to understand how groups of neurons interact to produce this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And along those same lines, do you have any idea whether the monkeys perceive that the arm is moving is their own arm, or do they just sort of see it as a video game?",
        "Any way you can suss that out?",
        "Well, we can't ask them.",
        "But what we see is that the monkeys seem to embody this device, and that they do seem to consider it as part of their own body or at least are very comfortable with it, because they do things like, lick the hand when it has marshmallow residue, and they use the hand to shove food and rearrange it around inside their mouth, and they can stop and control it very easily.",
        "Mm.",
        "And what happens to their comparable arms when they're manipulating this robotic arm?",
        "Well, we just have them gently restrained and some tubes along the side of their arms.",
        "And although the monkey may squirm a little bit to get comfortable as he's doing the task, most of the time he's pretty quiet and doesn't really try to move his arms.",
        "So, it's not the same exact electrical signals that they'd be using to try to move their actual arms.",
        "No, it's pretty clear that they can disassociate driving their own arms from driving the robot arm.",
        "Ah, very good.",
        "Let's take one more call.",
        "This is Jason in oops - yeah, Jason in Portland, Oregon.",
