        "Well, exactly.",
        "Someday we'd like to be able to take this (unintelligible), and for instance patients that are paralyzed, we'd like to re-activate their own muscles, instead of having them use (unintelligible) prosthetic device.",
        "That turns out to be a bit (unintelligible) of a control problem, but a lot of people are working on that right now.",
        "Ah, that's fascinating.",
        "That would indeed be great.",
        "Well, thank you very much for coming in.",
        "We've run out of time, but it's a really interesting conversation and as things progress, perhaps you can come back and give us an update.",

        "As NPR's Mike Pesca reports, Mr. Bradley is not what you normally see on the sidelines.",
        "Average build, average face, no scars, no marks, no hair - Bob Bradley would be a police sketch artist's worst nightmare.",
        "Trim and neat, Bradley speaks softly and slowly.",
        "His sartorial choices run to the navy blue track suit and the other navy blue track suit.",
        "In a sport where national team coaches act and are treated like royalty, Bradley is the competent civil servant.",
        "Or, as he suggested to the press corps yesterday, that's what he'd like us to believe.",

        "It can't be overdone.",
        "But certainly the ability to, in words, be able to put everybody on the same page and give a thought that everybody can understand and embrace, that's pretty important",
        "It's clear he's not Vince Lombardi.",
        "But he's also not Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots coach to whom Bradley is sometimes compared.",

        "The director makes a point of humanizing soldiers on all sides of the conflict, and when the Chaplain leads them all in a midnight mass, in Latin as it was then said all over the world, no man's land briefly becomes common ground.",
