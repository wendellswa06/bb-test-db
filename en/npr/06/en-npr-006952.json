        "Well, look, you know, we have been very vocal in our support for DREAMers solution that is permanent.",
        "And - so we can get a - I think, an answer for the DREAMers.",
        "But at the same time, you know, the president, I think, is being politically shrewd in leveraging this important issue in a way that would allow him to deliver on his campaign promises.",
        "That's not really a misstep.",
        "That's standard operating procedure in Washington to leverage one issue for another.",
        "Right, but that's - might sort of placate his base or support his base.",
        "But if you're trying to bring people into the tent, if you're trying to bring Latinos into the Republican Party - and it's had trouble doing that - isn't this problematic?",
        "Of course it is.",
        "Look.",

        "And so they are now being much more aggressive.",

        "Look.",
        "We feel that no society can flourish when a significant part of its members live under the threat of being deported, especially those that - where the decision was made for them.",
        "There is political will on both sides.",
