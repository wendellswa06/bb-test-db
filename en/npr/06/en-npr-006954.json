        "women's gymnastics team that competed so successfully at the last Olympics, 3 of the 5 people on that team were girls of color.",
        "It's an extremely expensive sport.",

        "You know, these are also people who, you know, Gabby Douglas made no secret of the fact that this was tremendously costly to her family, but somehow she was able to get there.",
        "So what's the difference, you know what I mean?",
        "Well, obviously, it's - even for wealthy families, these things are going to be extremely expensive.",
        "She's not wealthy.",
        "But, I mean, there's - the action - the commitment has been there from her parents.",
        "I mean, you're talking in many cases with soccer about people who have come to this country with nothing or people who have almost nothing and their kids are wonderful, wonderful players, but they can't get into that system.",
        "It's a big - obviously, you're looking at a much bigger pool - in gymnastics where you're - it's a tiny group of players - athletes.",
        "With soccer, it's a massive, massive group.",
        "And yet, these kids don't have a shot at even just the basic level of organized soccer that gets you seen to that level where Gabby Douglas is training in a high level play for the U.S.",

        "Ninety percent of them would go to El Tri, not just out of loyalty but also because, frankly, El Tri's going to be a better team than the U.S.",
        "But then, you know, and I also have to say, Mexicans are so happy that the United States is not going into the World Top.",

        "(Laughter) All right.",

        "The women's team went undefeated in 2015 and won the World Cup.",
        "So, AJ, is there something that the men can learn from the women, or is the same problem going to catch up with them?",

        "And what's your take on it?",
        "Yes.",
        "So obviously, the Girl Scouts are not going to be happy about this.",
        "I want to give them credit.",
        "They have certainly done a lot in the last couple of years to try and boost membership.",
        "It's no secret that membership for both the gender scouting sort of organizations have been down over decades.",
        "It's just, you know, it's something that's very difficult to modernize.",
        "So they have definitely done their part.",
        "They brought in consultants.",
        "They diversified their programs.",
        "But what they did is that they took away some of the attention from outdoor activities.",
        "They took away some of that attention from some of the more adventurous programs.",
        "Like I said, it went to other things, but so the Boy Scouts, seeing their numbers go down and seeing their own numbers being hurt by some of the more recent scandals, thus is a perfect opportunity for them to come in.",
        "They have the outdoor stuff that a lot of young women are going to be interested in.",
        "And most importantly, they have the Eagle Scout designation.",
        "And that is something that the Girl Scouts have not been able to replicate, even though they have the wonderful Gold Award.",
        "In the culture - in our culture, it is not as prestigiously sort of looked at as that Eagle Scout award, and that is the big thing.",
        "But, you know, Gustavo, do you want to talk about that for a second?",
        "You know, they - but the Girl Scouts have other things which is that they have a track record - it's - an incredible number of women in high levels of achievement have been Girl Scouts.",

        "But I have seen so many young women be transformed by the Girl Scouts.",
        "And I've seen like - they do - they've always been a far more progressive organization than the Boy Scouts.",
        "What amazes me most about this is how much the Boy Scouts has changed within a generation.",
        "About 25 years ago or so, there was a national story that came out of Orange County where there was two scouts who were atheist and they just - they would not say the Pledge of Allegiance or they wouldn't say under God in the Pledge of Allegiance, so the Boy Scouts at the time booted them.",
        "In a generation, now you've gone from such like backward opportunistic ways to the Boy Scouts saying, hey, like, let's also include girls in there as well.",
        "And, of course, it's all for money.",
        "It's all for getting more membership in there.",
        "But yeah, I mean, people - the Girls Scouts is an amazing organization.",
        "They really focused on, yeah, let's teach our young women out there of all colors, of, you know, of everything, let's teach them skills that they're going to go out and, you know, make better people in society.",
