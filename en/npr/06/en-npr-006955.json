        "Les, what do you think about this?",

        "She's never gotten into scouting.",
        "Thank God we haven't had to cross that bridge yet.",
        "But honestly, I think she'd be more interested in what the Boy Scouts offer than what the Girl Scouts offer.",

        "She's very adventurous.",
        "She wants to try things.",

        "I mean, so I think that what the Boy Scouts offer will be far more interesting to her than what the Girl Scouts offer.",
        "And I know it's a massive generalization, but I think this is something that she would think was a lot of fun.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks.",
        "What's the money - is the money specialized - sometimes they say and this will go to pay for something specific.",
        "Obviously, a lot of people on social media, a lot of people in the general conversation sort of, you know, thinking that this is going to somehow rend the gender binary because we're going to have boys in the Girl Scouts and, you know, boys and girls, and they could just be anywhere together now.",
        "I think what people forget is that girls have been in Boy Scouting programs now for a century.",
        "You know, they allow girls in the venturing program.",
        "And so it's really not - yes - is it a big move?",
        "Yes, but it's not unprecedented in their history to have girls participate in their activities.",
        "I think people forget that.",
        "I confess, I was one that forgot that, so thank you for bringing that up.",

        "I love it.",
        "I know people are criticizing it because he gets the attention, not other rappers of color.",
        "I'll say what I said on Code Switch a couple of months ago.",
        "Sometimes you need those people to go out and to places or to people that don't want to listen to your message.",

        "These people worship him as a god.",
        "And for him to be saying all those things about our current president, it comes as a shock to them, but they listen to him.",
        "They would not listen to the people.",
        "So good job, Eminem.",
        "Because you agree with him, but what if you didn't?",
        "Would you be offended?",
        "If I - if he supported Trump?"
