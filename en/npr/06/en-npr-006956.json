        "What other trends do you see?",
        "Well, there are several things going on.",
        "We see - there's been a good deal of legislation as it relates to immigrants in the past several years, and I think that reflects a frustration with what has not happened at the federal level.",
        "While immigration policy is the providence of the national government, the - dealing with the people that are here falls pretty much to state government.",
        "And we saw this past year, for example, more than 1,500 bills were introduced in legislatures on that subject and just about 250 of them were enacted.",
        "These go both ways, that is some of them are - create greater sanctions, particularly sanctions on employers of illegal immigrants, but some of them also are aimed at providing basic services to people.",
        "A little bit later, we'll be checking in the state of Arizona, where one of those laws takes effects on January 1st.",
        "But immigration is one big area -not unconnected to it, I guess, is the issue of driver's licenses.",
        "No, that's true.",
        "The driver's license issue has been really spurred on by the real ID question.",
        "It was enacted by the federal government, requiring the states to adopt a much more secured driver's license as a means of identification at least for federal purposes, for example, getting on an airplane, entering a federal building, things like that, that the regulations that would govern that were supposed to be out last May from the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "They have not come out to date.",
        "The law is supposed to be implemented in 2008.",
        "It probably will not be because of that, but the states are paying a good deal of attention in that area, a number of them have.",
        "Actually, six state legislatures last year passed a statute that forbade their vehicle licensing department from complying with the Real ID Act, while several others have moved to create an enhanced driver's license on their own that can be used, particularly, for cross-border purposes.",
        "Washington, Vermont and Arizona have already done that, upgraded it.",
        "So we'll probably meet whatever national standard we'll ultimately adopt.",
        "Here's an interesting one: In an effort to reduce youth access to alcohol, drivers under the age of 21 in New Hampshire will get a driver's license that is vertical compared to the horizontal version for those of legal drinking age.",
        "A New Hampshire, of course, enacting that, I think - in a lot of states - I know in Maryland, they have the picture reversed the other way if you're underage.",
        "I think, yes, several states have done that.",
        "What we're seeing is the driver's license being used since it's become a common form of identification.",
        "But we're seeing more distinctions or gradations in the licenses and I suspect you will see even more of than in the next decade.",

        "And we're seeing it here in Casper.",

        "What happens if everybody quits smoking?",
        "What are they going to start taxing then?",
        "I think the rationale for a lot of these laws is there are people who have to work in those bars and restaurants who may not want to smoke and, well, they get to, anyway, thanks to you and they can get cancer that way.",
