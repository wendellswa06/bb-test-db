        "And in a couple of years' time, as I understand the federal law, you're going to have to use your regular passport anyway.",
        "Well, that would cut the second one, the optional passport one, would also function as a passport.",
        "Oh, I see.",

        "There are several states are moving to differentiate it in licensing system.",

        "Where the matter stands, though, is the federal governments of both countries have to agree to that, have to agree to what the province and the state have worked out.",
        "We'll see, I think, a lot of action in that area in the next year or two.",

        "Twice?",
        "So there is a warning, and then the second time you will just lose your business license.",
        "Well, no. The first case would be a suspension of business license of around 10 days and then the second offense would be revocation of the business license permanently.",
        "And what's been the response to this legislation?",
        "Well, there's been all sorts of responses especially from the business community, which is really shuddering at the thought of what this might mean to their ability to hire workers and also on the state's economy.",
        "As you probably know, Arizona has a very large illegal immigrant population.",
        "About 500,000 of the state's 6 million residents are illegal immigrants.",
        "That comes out to about one in 11 people in our state.",
        "And they also make up a very significant portion of the employees, which is somewhere around 10 to 12 percent of our workforce, three million workforce, is - are illegal workers.",
        "So there's a potential that a very large segment of our, you know, working population could be removed from employment.",
        "When we did a show down there in Arizona, we had a representative of the farming community on.",
        "And I don't think is unique to Arizona, but he said that crops around the country are largely picked by illegal workers.",
        "And are farmers feeling the pinch especially here?",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "This is - in Arizona, what we - southwest corner of the state, the Yuma area, is the produce capital of the nation.",
        "If you're eating lettuce this winter, most likely it came from Yuma, Arizona.",
        "And a very significant percentage of those workers who picked that food are undocumented workers, most of them working with fake papers to get jobs.",
        "And there's been a chronic labor shortage in that area for years because of changes in the workforce demographic.",
        "And now, once you stepped up in immigration enforcement, and this new law is about to take effect in January 1st, farmers are very worried about who's going to be picking up that lettuce.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And also, I guess the phrase that a lot of people - or the word that a lot of people are going to be looking into very carefully is knowingly."

        "That's right.",

        "It's a high standard to prove that someone actually knowingly hired an illegal worker.",
        "But nevertheless, the employers are very worried that even though that is the standard, they could get snared, they could be brought to show that they knowingly hired a worker, that there could be someone, you know, was in the company who claims that they overheard that kind of a conversation.",
        "And, you know, the penalty will be very severe.",
        "But that is the standard that you have to show that you actually knowingly hired an illegal worker, that you had knowledge.",
        "Well, that may be difficult to prove.",
        "I guess we're going to have to wait and see on that.",
        "Right.",
        "One of the things that's happening because of that is employers who are very worried about, you know, potentially losing their license, they're calling in workers, you know, reviewing their I-9 forms over the forms that all employees have to fill out, showing that - attests that they have legal authorization to work in the United States.",
        "A lot of employers have been going through those records, reviewing them and calling in employers where they see - employees where they see - think there might be some problem.",
        "And some of those workers in that process are admitting that they are illegal.",
        "Now, those employers have knowing - you know, have that knowledge so they're firing those workers on the spot.",

        "There's a significant legal challenge.",
        "As all the major business groups here is on the chamber of commerce, the contractors association, restaurant and hotel associations, they have all banded together and filed lawsuits at federal court.",
        "The first lawsuit that was filed was tossed out on a technicality and then it was refilled, and there was a request to put it for a temporary restraining order that would have essentially barred the law from taking effect temporarily, but that was thrown out on Friday.",
        "So as it stands, it looks like the law will go forward.",
        "Those lawsuits will continue to make their way through the court system.",
        "But as it stands, it looks like they'll - will have this go on effect on January 1st.",
        "Daniel Gonzales thanks very much for your time today."
