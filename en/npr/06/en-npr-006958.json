        "That'd right.",
        "As I've mentioned, there are over - it used about 250 new immigration-related laws this year.",
        "A number of them are of that nature, employers sanction or putting more burden on employers to make certain that the people they are hiring are here illegally.",

        "Here's an e-mail we have from Rich(ph).",
        "California's minimum wage rises from $7.50 to $8, he notes, tied with Massachusetts, who's the highest in the nation.",
        "Chicago imposes a five cent tax on bottled water, that's a 30 percent increase on the cost a case, he notes.",
        "And New Hampshire begins recognizing same sex civil unions with all the rights and privileges of married couples.",
        "And, William Pound, there's - this was of course the issue of a lot of legislation just a few years ago and it continues to be.",
        "It does, not only in New Hampshire but Oregon; has a law taking effect in a civil union area.",
        "We see, actually, the laws cover a wide range -and interestingly, they don't all become effective in January 1st.",
        "We think about that because, as you mentioned at the beginning, the New Year.",
        "But in fact more laws become effective on other dates during the year.",
        "Actually, probably more on July 1st as that on January 1st.",
        "But they cover…",
        "They could take anytime they want to, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The legislature - the State Constitution may specify 60 or 90 days after a adjournment of legislature or after an act, but - or the legislature, being in many states, put on what is called an emergency clause that says the law shall take effect upon signing by the governor.",

        "And this follows a grand and still evolving scandal involving one of the oil companies there.",
        "We have lots of the correction being exposed as we speak and more to follow, I'm sure.",
        "We all are sure but at least we're making a step in the right direction.",
        "And an effort to take that money out of the hands of politicians is being forwarded, and that is a fair elections referendum that would essentially fund the political campaigns and take the money away from lobbyists being able to provide that money to politicians.",

        "It certainly has been.",
        "We - not only Alaska, but Oregon has an ethics law, a much stronger ethics law for the legislature that they enacted which will take effect.",
        "We've seen a lot of movement in that area in recent years, tightening up of what's acceptable, whether that be in terms of campaign contributions, placing limits on them or particularly in terms of gifts to members and also in how much time must go by when someone leaves the legislature before they may engage in lobbying activity.",
        "On the voting front, there's a lot of it.",
        "A lot of it has focused on voter ID.",
        "A number of states have enacted identification laws for voting.",
        "It is also related to primary elections as well, as we've seen the movement to this buildup in late January or early February of Super Tuesday or whatever it is when so much of the presidential primary may be done.",
        "Super Duper Tuesday, yes.",
        "And that's almost all been done by state legislation.",
        "Yeah.",

        "That's right.",
        "You can find a Mayo Clinic, I believe, in Jacksonville, Florida.",

        "All businesses of Arkansas will have to collect taxes at the point of delivery; i.e., if we deliver a product to any town in Arkansas, we have to collect taxes for the city, county and the state tax rate and pay them to each municipality.",
        "Clearly, in many cases, it will take much more effort and dollars than collected.",
        "This will easily mean that even in a tiny state like Arkansas, we will have to track the tax rates in over 125 different localities.",
        "It doesn't sound like Dennis is too pleased about that."
