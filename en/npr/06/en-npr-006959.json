        "And one way or another, a lot of this new information is being provided by the federal government or it's mined from government data.",
        "Why is it being made public now?",
        "Well, there's a big push for better hospital quality for a couple of different reasons - one of them is quality for its own sake, of, let's say, treating patients better, getting patients better treatment.",
        "The other part, though, is actually an effort to keep costs down or to keep the growth of costs down.",
        "There's a fair amount of evidence that in the long run, good medicine begets good health.",
        "And, of course, good health means you spend less on health care.",
        "Now in the past, hospitals, and doctors for that matter, have resisted efforts to publicize data on the quality of health care, no?",
        "Well, I mean, bad publicity or a poor showing in some kind of a comparison can be embarrassing.",
        "But on the other hand, as several experts have pointed out, that that embarrassment can spur improvements like nothing else.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Can spur improvements, because the hospital down the street is going to say - the studies show that we are better at cardiac care than General down the street.",
        "Competition is part of it.",
        "But also, just for its own sake, I think a lot of hospitals, hospital administrators and doctors and nurses, like to believe they're good at what they do - and most of them are.",
        "And if somebody's watching them, and they know somebody's watching them, they may try just a little harder, still.",
        "You wrote in your article that a lot of hospitals now compete for patients across the country, not just - even in their own communities.",
        "How are they doing that?",
        "Well, you see it in a number of different ways.",
        "You see some Hospital systems are expanding quite literally and building new hospitals in nearby areas, or expanding the reach of their existing hospitals in one way or another.",
        "You also see some of the big-name hospitals are opening satellite campuses or facilities, sometimes far from their home base.",
        "Places like, for example, the Mayo Clinic or the Cleveland Clinic, or some of the big New York hospitals?",
        "No problem."

        "Well, you know, it was a two-week challenge from Lee Zion of Lafayette, Minn.",
        "And it involved a story.",
        "I said you wake up trapped in a round room with six doors.",
        "A voice over a loudspeaker tells you that five of the doors are booby-trapped and will bring instant death if you try to open them.",
        "Only one door provides an opening that will get you out safely.",
        "He said the doors are evenly spaced around the room.",
        "They look exactly alike.",
        "Your only clue is that on the wall between each pair of doors is a large letter of the alphabet.",
        "And going clockwise, the letters are H, I, J, K, L and M.",
        "I asked, which is the correct door that will get you out and why?",
        "And the answer is the door's the one between the M and the H.",
        "If you write the word out between M and H, you get the word mouth.",
        "The puzzle said only one door provides an opening, which is what a mouth is.",
        "And a door with out written on it will naturally be an exit.",

        "So how did you figure that out?",
        "I took to actually drawing out a diagram of the puzzle.",
        "And I figured there had to be a reason why M and H were the two ends.",
