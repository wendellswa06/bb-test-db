        "A very simple or a straightforward way of doing that is to look at how many patients or what proportion of heart attack patients, for example, survive for 30 days after hospitalization.",

        "But again, if you've got a specific condition, especially if it's a complex one, or you have multiple conditions, you need to look beyond just the reputation of the hospital as a whole, or beyond a simple ranking of whether it's the best in the state or the fifth best in the state or something like that.",
