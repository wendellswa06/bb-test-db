        "Thanks, Mark.",
        "We mentioned emergency rooms earlier.",
        "You say they all have an ER level?",
        "What does that mean and why is it important?",
        "ERs are rated according to the complexity of the cases they can take care of.",
        "The most obvious is a trauma center, which can take care of all kinds of crazy things that may happen in a car accident or even in penetrating trauma.",
        "But let's go one step past that.",
        "The fact of the matter is there is an ER of your dreams.",
        "There's the ER that's perfect for the problem you have.",
        "So, for example, if you're having a heart attack or a stroke, you want to know -and this data is available for hospitals - you want to know how long it takes from the time you suffer your symptoms until you get treated aggressively for either the heart attack or the stroke.",
        "That is lifesaving, and that data is available, and some ERs are really good at it and other ones stink.",
        "On the other hand, if you got a little cut in your hand, you may not want to go to the level one trauma center because you may want to get the more convenient care that's available near your home.",
        "So take the time today.",
        "Go visit an emergency room, but do it in the middle of the day.",
        "Here's the real key, Neal.",
        "You don't want to go there at 4 in the morning, obviously - it's not convenient for anybody.",
        "But in the middle of the afternoon, emergency rooms are generally quiet because the doctors' offices haven't closed yet and they've cleaned up the mess from the night before.",
        "So in the middle of the afternoon, pop by, see what kind of a place is it?",
        "What kinds of lines are there?",
        "Is the place clean?",
        "And these are the kinds of small bits of homework that make a huge difference for the entire system.",
        "Because, you know what, if a hospital sees that people don't want to go to the emergency room, guess what they do?",
        "They fix their ER.",
        "Let's get Charles(ph) on the line, Charles with us from Phoenix, Arizona.",
        "Yes.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was calling - I lost my father four years ago; went to a community hospital for bypass surgery - not emergency.",
        "And even with a cardiologist - who is a cousin - at Johns Hopkins and a professor, didn't obviously know the right questions to ask, and died from an adverse medicine interaction that the hospital didn't even test for, which obviously they now have instituted that.",
        "But it seemed to anybody that we have spoke to, that there was fairly - it should have been a fairly common test, but we didn't know at the time to ask for, that caused his death.",
        "And then the time of year, the day of the week, being it was a Sunday night, a Father's Day that he started having that adverse reaction and the nurse gave him Tylenol rather than doing any kind of tests.",
        "And I was wondering, like, how - for specific, like, you're not - all said, you know, ask the questions, but even some of the questions are even too specific, sometimes don't even know.",
        "And I'll take that off the air, I guess.",
        "Okay, Charles.",
        "Thanks very much.",

        "In fact, we estimate that 40 percent of Americans, two out of every five people listening to this broadcast, will have their lives changed adversely by medical error.",
        "It includes people who are dear to you, probably to everybody.",
        "The question is what do you do about it?",
        "We wrote the \"\"Smart Patient\"\" for the Joint Commission - that's the group that credits hospitals and they're sort of the patients' safety champion for the country - and they spent a lot of effort into trying to figure out what questions to ask.",
        "And there are, by the way, routine questions that are worth asking that we on the inside know to be true.",
        "And I think that if folks get more comfortable pushing some of those buttons - day of the week surgery is a good example.",
        "A lot of folks know that you don't want to buy a car on a particular day of the week.",
        "There are equal rules, by the way, on surgery.",
        "I would not have surgery on a Friday afternoon because that's when all the emergencies come pouring in - if you need heart surgery, which is what I do.",
        "But the reality, Neal, is that most Americans spend more time figuring out what kind of kitchen appliance to buy than the type of hospital they're going to go to.",
        "And the little bit of extra homework that we can do on that makes a huge difference within the hospital system.",
        "As was discussed early on the same program, hospitals change behavior based on the biases of their patients.",
        "They know a lot of folks say, well, you know, that's cheating.",
        "They're sending out the harder cases.",
        "Well, God bless them.",
        "That's what they should do.",
        "If you're not good at a particular difficult case, you should shift it out.",
        "And if someone's keeping track and someone's asking tough questions, then you're going to do better off by shipping those patients out that we saw this experience in the first major database in the country, which is the New York State Database on Cardiac Surgery Mortality.",
        "And I'm at New York Presbyterian Hospital; we had pretty good numbers.",
        "And we saw a lot of very difficult cases coming our way.",
        "And you know what?",
        "It was okay because we had the capability as a major transplant center to cope.",
        "(in play) Hm.",
        "Why not be an important driver, a catalyst for change?",
        "Only 10 percent of you got to be involved.",
        "That will be the tipping point for health safety in this country.",
        "But 10 percent of us have got to wake up and start auditing the system."

        "MRSA is really getting out of hand and people are suffering long life consequences and sometimes unfortunately, even having their life cut short because of it.",

        "I mean, how can you not get a second opinion?",
        "This holds true, by the way, with asking some of the difficult questions like what's your infection rate?",
        "And by the way, if the person you're talking to or the hospital that you're working through doesn't know their infection rate, doesn't know their mortality rates for the procedure you're going to have, then you shouldn't have the procedure there.",
