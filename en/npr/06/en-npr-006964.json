        "You absolutely want that person involved in your care.",
        "A hospitalist is somebody who lives in the hospital, who knows how the hospital functions, knows the ins and outs of how to take care of folks who are in the hospital, and can help your primary doctor manage you while you get there.",
        "Here is the old fashioned model.",
        "You go see your general practitioner, he diagnoses you with some problem, let's say hormonal.",
        "You get admitted to the hospital and then all of a sudden, you have to get squeezed in around their schedule.",
        "So while they're back in their office seeing the 25 patients they're going to see that day, they'll either pop in early on and see you, or late in the evening and see you, and they're not focused on you the whole day long.",
        "The intensivist or the hospitalist only takes care of folks who are in the hospital.",
        "Their primary motivation is to make sure you get the best in-hospital care possible and then transition your care in an orderly fashion back to your family doctor, and that is very important.",

        "So their care was absolutely wonderful.",
        "The nurses were unbelievable.",
        "But my question is that their doctors were also unbelievable.",
        "What happens if you really, really like that doctor, really want that doctor because they have got a good record, they handle their patients wonderfully.",
        "But maybe the hospital they're at isn't on the wonderful list and they don't operate anyplace else.",
        "Then what happens?",
        "And I can take your answer off the air.",
        "Okay, Linda.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Well, I'm going to be a little harsh here, Neal, but I want to speak honestly to Linda's concern.",
        "One of the ways that we judge how good a doctor is, at what hospital - is what hospital they practice at.",
        "If you're not taking the time to investigate the hospital that you're practicing at and not taking the extra effort, putting in the extra quarter to go first class to make sure your nursing is as good as you are, then I don't think you're doing the best that you can."

        "And one of the biggest problems we have in healthcare in America is that too often, physicians think their primary responsibility is to do what they're trained to do, which is to make sure we deliver the best care that we can.",
        "But we have an additional obligation.",
        "As a professional class, we have a civic responsibility to speak up when the system itself isn't working, and making sure that nursing care is as good as the care we provide is one of those obligations.",
        "So Linda, if your doctor is great but they haven't taken the time to be at a good hospital, sign up to be part of great nursing or fix the nursing where they are, then you should rethink choosing them to do the surgery.",

        "I'm a nurse in Hood River, Oregon.",
        "My suggestion is to talk to the nurses.",

        "If a hospital has the magnet status, that's a good sign of happy nurses, which results in good patient care.",
        "That's an award given by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, an affiliate of the American Nurses Association to hospitals that satisfy a set of criteria designed to measure the strength and quality of their nursing.",

        "Fully endorse it.",
        "The magnet hospital status can be found, by the way, at nursingworld.org.",
        "It's a very difficult credential to get.",
        "Hospitals have to work very hard to prove their nursing is of that caliber and it's one of the great ways of figuring out if you've got wonderful nurses.",
        "But I want to go back to the biggest point is that they came in to the hospital with loved ones and they stayed with them.",
        "Having a witness, a caregiver, somebody who's going to be there when you're in your time of need is incredibly important.",
        "The doula movement, for example, with women having children has become a very powerful one.",
        "And the reason I emphasize this is that when everyone's moving around at 100 miles an hour, having somebody there does two things: it helps, you know, pick up any loose ends.",
        "But think of the conversation you have with people taking care of you.",
        "And we know as physicians that 50 percent of what we tell you is forgotten or not understood.",
        "Fifty percent.",
        "Neal, that's pretty frustrating.",
        "What if half of the show was not listened to by the folks out there?",
        "Well, then, you know, you wouldn't do such a good job, perhaps.",
        "You'd cut it short.",
        "So if you've got somebody with you, the physician takes a little extra time to fully explain it because they think you're going to do your homework right.",

        "He was deported alone.",
        "Since then, Elmer, with the help of lawyers and advocates, has been trying to reunite with Marisol in the United States.",

        "And I'd like you to answer Julie's question, Dr. Oz, but also broadly, more broadly - when is it worth it to go across state, across the country or in her case, overseas?",
        "So let's tackle the overseas issue first.",
        "There are some groups - the Joint Commission, by the way, is one of them that actually credentials hospitals internationally.",
        "So in many countries of the world, you can at least find out if the hospital where this procedure is being done is an accredited one by a U.S.",
        "organization.",
        "That's a pretty good step in the right direction.",
        "Generally speaking, if the procedure is being limited in this country because technology is not here, that's defensible, I think, for wanting to leave the country.",
        "But overall, I'd much rather - folks think of it this way - you never want to be the first person.",
        "Right.",
        "Because the first person is where we learn and figure out what we made right, what we did wrong, and thus the improved version is what we actually use on folks as the procedures mature.",
        "The FDA is a conservative organization and I may be naive and criticize by some of you for believing this, but I think they do a pretty good job making sure they do their homework.",
        "And they generally approve technologies that deserve to be approved in a timely fashion.",
        "Across the board in this country, what I always tell folks is if your ailment is a less common one, for example, a young person needing a hip replacement, go to the literature and find peer-reviewed papers, papers published for doctors by doctors, and look at the names and the institutions where they're published from.",
        "Those are the hospitals where you want to go have that procedure done if it's a new one because those are the hospitals that have already accumulated 50 or 100 cases.",
        "Remember, most of the common procedures that we do in this country - and I'm a heart surgeon.",
        "I do several hundred open-heart operations a year.",
        "If I was going to give you an operation that I do three times a year, I probably won't do it quite as well.",
        "That should be the general rule of thumb for most folks listening on.",
        "Look at the numbers of cases that are generally done.",
        "If the institution that you're considering doesn't do a proportional number of those, perhaps the most or one of the most in the region, you probably should look elsewhere across state lines.",
        "All right.",
        "Julie, good luck."
