        "I'd have to say no, but it doesn't have all the notes of the scale.",

        "When the Eiffel Tower was first built, it was built for a world exposition.",
        "And it was the first time that a contingent from Indonesia came with their gamelan instruments, and it was the first time, really, that the West was really exposed to it.",
        "Claude Debussy was very much influenced by these sounds.",
        "There's actually a piece in \"\"Tower Music\"\" called \"\"Continuum,\"\" where I have a modern, like, sort of like a minimalist kind of vibe going on, and then I insert an Indonesian Gamelan-type melodic and rhythmic materials.",

        "Well, look; I think at the end of that segment, we just heard somebody basically say we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it, which is more or less the caricature of what the Democrats did and something Nancy Pelosi said in the few days before passing the Affordable Care Act.",
        "It seems to me that what Republicans have been missing in this process is a substantive argument for the bill that they're advancing.",
        "And so there's this very abstract debate going on about whether we should pass a bill or not pass a bill.",
        "And there's no one telling the public, these are the problems; this is how this bill might solve those problems, and here's what we should expect it to achieve.",

        "Well, they made this promise - repeal and replace, repeal and replace.",
        "They said for seven years, we're going to repeal and replace.",
        "So it's kind of understandable that Republican leadership feels, we have to do this, or we're going to get creamed.",

        "Who knows what the reason is for passing it?",
        "Who knows why this would supposedly make things better?",
        "And there's a lot of information out there about why this would make things worse, like throwing 22 or 23 million people off of health insurance within a decade and cutting Medicaid by a huge amount.",
        "So you know, in the end, it is doing something even if it's something that the base doesn't like - really what the Republicans want to do."
