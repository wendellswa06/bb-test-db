        "I think, I sure saw some of myself in that character, and I think, in fact, a lot of other people did too.",
        "Is that what makes us cringe, and at the same time, is that what makes it work?",
        "Well, I suppose there's a bit of that on both sides, that you recognize the behavior.",
        "I think that the piece, not unlike, like something I think that's out there right now in movie theaters for people, Brokeback Mountain.",
        "People go to a movie like that and they see the unrequited love in that rather than just the specifics of, here's two, you know, sheepherders from the 1960's, I don't have any identification with that, and yet I understand the idea of falling in love with someone and not be able to be with them.",
        "And that's what I think that any number of people in any number of situations can look at a piece like 'Fat Pig' and say, that's me, in the general sense.",
        "And I think that's the best quality that theater or literature or the cinema can have, is that something very specific can speak to a general audience because of the nature of what the themes are.",

        "Carrie's calling us from, is that Golden Hill, California?",
        "Yep.",
        "Golden Hill, that's part of San Diego.",
        "Okay, go ahead please.",
        "Um, well I just wanted to say that I finally saw In the Company of Men, after my friend said, no, no, no!",
        "You have to see it, but you're going to freak out!",
        "And I freaked out, because I loved it.",
        "I really thought it was amazing.",
        "My question is that, you know, you create these characters that are, many of which are unfortunately fairly, are fairly true to life.",
        "I mean, you didn't make these people, but unfortunately they remind us of others.",
        "Why do you think people have such a reaction towards you in general?",
        "I think that, yeah, a lot of what people see is, in a character they see, you know, something that, as you say, something that rings true to them, and yet they don't really want it to be true.",
        "They understand the behavior and go I've seen that sort of person'.",
        "I've been accused of a lot of things, but no one has really looked at the work and said that it's, they might say it's far-fetched, but they don't say it's science fiction.",
        "They don't say those people just don't exist on our planet.",
        "And so for me, it's really -- I think to them, I'm always looking for something that's unique; a different approach to a love story or a different approach to the workplace, that kind of thing.",
        "That's my job -- to spin a new tale, you know, or take an old tale and spin it in a new way.",
        "But I think that some of the techniques that I use, where I, I try not to be too judgmental with characters or stories, and the one that you mentioned, In the Company of Men, is a good example of a story that doesn't end the way we've traditionally been brought up to believe stories end.",
        "That the bad guy, as it were, doesn't get his just reward for being bad; at least not in the, you know, 90 minutes that we watch him.",
        "So I think that kind of thing is unsettling to people.",
        "How I often wrap up, or choose not to wrap up a story, that's -- I think people will allow a lot to happen during the course of a movie or a play or a book.",
        "But in the end, they want to be satisfied that all those, the strings have been tied so that they can put that back on the shelf or leave the cinema and not have to deal with it.",
        "But often I kind of leave this unwrapped package in their lap and say okay, this is your mess now.",
        "I just brought up the questions, now you figure it out."

        "Whoa.",

        "Boy is that cruel.",
        "That is, you know, that probably is some of the cruelest writing that I've done.",
        "I've done some stuff that I would think of as brutal and tough and also, you know, surprisingly tender.",
        "I mean, tender for me anyway.",
        "But that character in particular, Chad, played by Aaron Eckhart, someone I've worked with a number of times, I think he was probably the more, most outright cruel person because he's so aware of what he's doing and has the ruthlessness to go through with it.",
        "Then he, in the first 10 minutes of the film, he tells us what he's going to do, and I think, again, story-wise, we're used to things happening: he'll fall in love with the girl, he'll get into a car accident and have an epiphany, something, you know, there'll be some story change, but he tells you in the first few moments, this is what I'm going to do.",
        "And then he proceeds to do it.",
        "And you kind of stand back and go, oh my gosh!",

        "Well, they're also fun to write.",
        "You get to write all those good lines.",

        "I think it's very hard in this society today to take the time to be caring, to worry about other people.",
        "And, you know, relationships take work.",
        "And that's not just, you know, love relationships, but work and friends, and you have to, you know, give of yourself.",
        "And I think people do a lot of just getting by.",
        "And, I think that's a pretty real and cruel thing that people do, is they just slide by with enough effort to make it into the next day.",
        "So I just tend to chronicle that, and not put a, you know, a spin on it that says that we're, we should be better or we will, or, you know, there's a chance around the corner that we'll be better.",
        "I kind of call them as I see them, and yet I, at the end of the day, I feel like a person who always hopes that things are going to work out for people or for myself, but with a completely clear-eyed view that things often just don't.",
        "Taking notes there, Carley?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, in the production of The Distance from Here, people, you know, often, are just, like they feel, the audience feels walloped.",
        "They just feel like they've been sucker-punched.",
        "Well, then my work here is done.",
        "And the producer said that his goal in producing the play is that people will come to see it and then they'll go home and hug their kids.",
        "That's not such a bad thing.",
        "I mean, that's, then my job is well done.",
        "Because it...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...I certainly think that, you know, that you do look at a, at that particular play, I mean that play is much closer to me in a lot of ways than other things I've written.",
        "Because, it's more the way I grew up.",
        "Certainly not exactly that way, but I grew up around the kind of people in The Distance from Here far more than the kind of white collar, urban living characters that I've written a great deal about.",
        "So that, those kids who are parentless or at least fatherless and, you know, kind of moving just from day to day through a sort of very lower middle class America, a very marginalized, almost invisible population, it's very hard to be positive, or to feel, you know, that anybody does care about you.",
        "And so, you know, charting that world doesn't mean that I hate them, although if I'm honest, as I said in the preface, they're the kind of people that I probably would sit far away from at McDonalds.",
        "And yet I feel some affinity for them because I saw that hopelessness even back in school, where they just, you know, they weren't thinking about what college are they going to go to, they were thinking about what crap job am I going to get so I can get an okay car, and, you know, make it through the week."
