        "The voices of Barack Obama, Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton and John McCain.",
        "Slate's John Dickerson is in Iowa where the caucuses are less than a week away.",
        "John, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is now about one day old.",
        "In the campaigning you saw yesterday, how did it - how did it affect what's going on?",
        "Well, every candidate addressed in their remarks.",
        "It was the first thing they talked about here on the stump in Iowa.",
        "And it broke down a couple of different ways.",
        "Hillary Clinton has been making the case that she'll be ready as president on day one.",
        "And this is a message that sort of meshed nicely with what she's been saying.",
        "It's a dangerous world.",
        "You need somebody who has experience.",
        "That's the core of her message.",
        "John McCain, also in Iowa yesterday, was talking about how he's been to all of these different places in Pakistan.",
        "He has a long history of studying the country - he first went there in 1978 - and again stressing his experience on the issue.",
        "Rudy Giuliani has a new ad about the danger of terrorists that came out before this assassination.",
        "And so he too was talking about the danger from terrorists and living in a dangerous world.",
        "And so they were all trying to see this news into their core message.",
        "So I know it's hard when you're covering a lot of different candidates and driving from a event to event to actually sit down and try to get some sense of voters.",
        "But do people in Iowa think this is an important event for those of us here in the United States?",
        "They do think it's an important event, but it wasn't - among the few voters I talked to, it wasn't the first thing they were talking about.",
        "They are focused on health care and the economy and the Iraq War.",
        "But when John McCain spoke, he, in fact, took note of that and said here's why Pakistan is important to you.",
        "He's been doing a little bit of an educational message there to explain why voters should care about it.",
        "Yes, you're on the air.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "Well, it was obviously a monumental failure when it was tried - when they tried to push through some form of a compromise.",
        "Bush fumbled it quite nicely, and then Congress followed in right behind him in fumbling it.",
        "And it's something that has proven to be very polarizing, and in an election season like you have right now I think both candidates have tried to stay away from things that were absolutely polarizing, if that makes sense.",
        "And that's it.",
        "I mean, we've unfortunately been through a two-year-long election cycle of the least amount of substance that people have seen in a very long time.",
        "No one has really come out with - other than John McCain - I mean, he tried a couple years ago.",
        "But nobody's really come out with a comprehensive plan to solve the problems that we're having with immigration.",
        "So that's the answer.",
        "It's just too hot-button, and they just left it alone.",
        "Michael, even some Latino Republicans said that - we were talking to someone at the Republican Convention who was like, oh, yeah, it's just too - it's too hot.",
        "But, you know, you think about the fact that Obama is the son of an immigrant and Senator McCain leads a state that's a third Hispanic, and it really is even more remarkable.",
        "So do you see any trends in the future - in future - in the next, say, mid-term elections?",
        "Do you expect immigration to come back on the table or is it out of the rotation for a while?"

        "I think the future is going to look a lot like the present.",
        "You know, the reality is that the Republicans were trounced in the congressional elections of 2006, in part because of the movement of Latino and Latino voters away from the party based on the party's immigration stance.",
        "And Senator McCain has sort of been hamstrung by that history because if you look at his view relative to his party, he's much more nuanced, but he can't sort of play up those nuances because this is a base election for him.",
        "He has to get the Republican base out.",
        "Regarding Senator Obama, you know, he doesn't want to bring it up too much either because he doesn't want to be seen as someone who is potentially favoring minorities over white voters, and that's part of his deregulization(ph) strategy.",
        "So that's it.",
        "The Republicans going forward will continue to be chasing based on the proposals we saw in the run-up to the 2006 election, and I'm not sure we're going to see very much on this issue.",
        "Perhaps on the margins, but not too much substantively in the years going forward.",

        "Just quickly, Michael first, then Princella, this is a big issue folks are going to have to deal with, in part because the economy means that more than ever.",
        "There'll be people who get a large amount of money of their living expenses out of social security, so how do you see this coming up in the future?",
        "Well, this is the really - you know, you would talk about third rails in American politics, you know.",
        "Really smart people in the past few years have been saying that some combination of the following will have to be done with regard to social security, and that it rising the retirement age, lowering benefits and increasing taxes.",
        "And, you know, if you look at what's going on right now, you know, in economic boom times perhaps people are more willing to at least listen to the notion of privatizing it, although that's still very controversial.",
        "But in very tough economic times, which we are likely to be in for the next few years, at least, you know, retirees and people near retiring age are not at all excited about the notion of engaging in some sort of privatization act.",
        "So I just think that social security would just continue to limp along as it is right now until there's a crisis.",
        "Princella?",
        "Well, they absolutely need to do something about social security.",
        "This is something that politics absolutely does not need to be played with.",
        "You know, the term privatization has become so polarizing, as has universal health care.",
        "I think it's important that people are able to understand social security.",
        "I think a lot of people don't understand both plans.",
        "I know the plan that should be pushed forward is allowing people to invest their own money.",
        "Now some people call that privatization, but if you - if people are allowed to invest their money into what's called an annuity and then take that annuity and have it paid out once monthly to these people, then what that does is it actually it solves both the Democratic and Republican argument because people are receiving money each month.",
        "But at the same time, it's their own money.",
        "And not only that, they are able to pass that down to their own children.",
        "And I think that's something that, you know, it's turned into a Republican versus Democrat issue.",
        "But it really shouldn't be.",
        "People should be allowed - right now, you have a system that people are paying into something that they're not getting much out of, and by the time someone like me, who's young like me, is able to need social security there's going to be nothing there.",
        "I mean, I don't understand the problem with allowing somebody to invest their own money into something that's not going to run out.",

        "No.",

        "You know, when they're having a hard time paying their mortgages or paying tuition, you know, I don't think voters are trying to hear large-scale fights about whether or not people should have access to guns or whether or not people should have access - women should have access to abortions.",
        "I just think that for many people those two issues do not climb very high up the list with regard to what's going on - sort of bread-and-butter issues for voters.",
        "And so I think candidates are taking a cue from that, and they don't want to wade into those waters either unless they absolutely have to.",
        "But Princella, weren't these hot-button issues supposed to be the ones that people made their minds up about?",
        "And not just, you know, you know, sort of the vague sense of whether someone would do well in general as a leader?",
        "It seems as if that kind of big bubble of, you know, this person is good overall, has really overwhelmed issues-based voting, for better or worse, and I'm not saying it's one or the other.",
        "It has, but I think, again, I mean, you kind of answered your own question earlier when you just - this environment is a bit different, and I think Mike's right.",
        "I think at this particular juncture, there is a bloc of voters that are voting on that, on abortion or on gun rights.",
        "And there are some people - I mean, I don't think that's ever going to end.",
        "There are some people who absolutely, that is always going to be their number one issue is abortion.",
        "And some people, their number one or two issue will be gun rights.",
        "But I think what those issues have served for in this cycle, because of the looming economic crisis that has pretty much swallowed and encompassed this whole race, I think those two issues have served as base unifiers.",
        "You say it hasn't gotten a lot of national prominence, but if you go to these rallies, if you go to a GOP rally, they tout the fact that Sarah Palin has five kids, one of them with Down Syndrome, and that, you know, she chose to have the baby, knowing that the baby had disabilities.",
        "So they are hitting that pro-life aspect.",
        "At the same time, if you go Obama rallies, you hear Hillary Clinton talking about, quote, you know, the woman's right to choose.",
        "And so they've rallied their bases with it, but they don't want to come out in national presidential debates and talk about it because they know first and foremost in most people's minds is this economy.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, you guys stay with us.",
        "Again, we're talking to Princella Smith and Michael Fauntroy about hot-button issues.",
