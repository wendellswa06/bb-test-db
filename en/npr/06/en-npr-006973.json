        "Yeah, in Brainiac I tell the story of, you know, sitting next to a guy on a plane who pretty much only decides if he's going to talk to me about his job working at Francis Coppola's winery if I can answer this movie trivia question correctly, so our whole conversation is determined by my one answer.",

        "Ken, the reason I'm calling is I wonder isn't life boring for you since everything you hear and see and comes on TV or the radio, it seems like you already know it, so…",

        "You know, even somebody who seems to know it all, you know, probably really knows, you know, nearly nothing.",

        "But he was going on and on saying, you know, I can read these four books about Elizabeth Taylor and I might get one new fact out of this.",
        "He calls them those four-star things, that there are fewer and fewer of these that he can find.",
        "That's certainly a center of the trivia mind, you know, the desire to boil everything, all kinds of knowledge, down into some beautiful little crystal and perfect trivia factoid.",
        "And obviously some kinds of knowledge don't condense that well, but that's definitely a passion of the trivia fanatic.",
        "Is there new trivia, though?",
        "Yeah, I talk about that in book.",
        "You know, it does become where you'll hear the same old chestnuts over and over, but, you know, you just have to think a little harder.",

        "Yeah, that's a good question.",
        "I don't know.",
