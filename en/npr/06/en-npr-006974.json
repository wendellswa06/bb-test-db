        "But it's true.",
        "Like one of the reasons that trivia and things like that have always appealed to me is because, you know, they're sort of like puzzles.",
        "You know, they're sort of like pencils games you go into with a sharpened pencil and, you know, your tongue sticking out of the corner of your mouth.",
        "And that's sort of how the SAT test felt to me, I hate to say.",
        "As an indifferent student myself, but a very good tester, I appreciated your comments on the degree to which you can read the question to get the answer."
