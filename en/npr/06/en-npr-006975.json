        "Yeah.",
        "Many people don't realize that, but, you know, you watch Jeopardy and the very good players are maybe guessing, I don't know, a third of the time maybe, just based on little cues and little clues in the question.",
        "And I think you can often do the same tricks on standardized tests.",
        "There's a process of deduction that you go through with one particular question about which you had no idea on the clue on on Jeopardy - and I think it was an important question at some point, win or lose question on the test -this having to do with Renaissance lovers.",

        "Yeah, there's a very - a daily double with a lot of money and a lot at stake on the line.",
        "And it's a question where I really have no idea who the two literary lovers are in question - the medieval lovers - and, you know, I just end up spending the ten seconds going through, you know, dozens of pairs of medieval lovers in my head trying to figure out which fits the clue and why they might be asking the question this way.",
        "And not until the very end do I settle on, you know, Abelard and Heloise just as my time is about to expire.",
        "Yeah, the answer is blah, blah, and you're stretching out the syllables just to work it in.",

        "Have you taken a leave of absence from your job as a computer programmer or have you quit now?",
        "You know it was always a leave of absence, but a very indefinite on.",
        "And I had such a good time, you know, working from home, working on Brainiac, you know.",
        "You get to see your son grow up instead of always being at the office, and I guess you gain 10 pounds because the kitchen's right there.",
        "But I have really liked not working for the man anymore, and hopefully the book will do well enough that I can continue to write because, frankly, I was a pretty lousy computer programmer.",

        "Are there ever any arguments about whether a particular fact is entirely accurate or whether the question was phrased properly?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Ken, in your book you describe a couple of - it seems you can't go into any situation of an ongoing trivia contest of any sort without people remembering the famous gaff of aught-six(ph) or something.",

        "She was talking about obviously trivia is, as far as we understand it, an English language, American culture, or I guess in her game a British and Canadian culture as well.",
        "You throw in Trivial Pursuit, you have to know how many provinces border the Great Lakes and that sort of thing.",
        "But it's interesting, there are different kinds of puzzle games.",
        "Sudoku, which is getting very popular now, there's a game that comes without cultural baggage.",
        "You define trivia as cultural literacy.",
        "That's a very similar kind of puzzle, but without the cultural baggage.",
        "The cultural baggage is a real problem with internationalizing trivia.",
        "And in the book I mostly focus on American trivia because I was pretty ignorant as to the world of trivia at large, except that I knew that quizzing was very big in English pubs."
