        "What did the director of national intelligence have to say about this?",
        "Well, just so we can sort all this out, these newspaper stories revealed details about two different programs.",
        "So, let me deal with the first one really quickly.",
        "It had to do with collecting information on all the phone calls coming in and out of the U.S.",
        "It was revealed after the leak of a classified document that showed the ruling of a special court called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.",
        "And the court gave the government permission to collect all that information in the form of something called metadata.",
        "Now, metadata looks a little like your phone bill.",
        "So, it shows the calls made and duration, and that sort of thing.",
        "And then there was a second program that was revealed in the Washington Post and The Guardian newspaper.",
        "And that's the one that the director of national intelligence focused on.",
        "He said the program, which, as you said, is known as PRISM, was misrepresented in the media reports.",
        "OK.",
        "How?",
        "How misrepresented?",
        "Well, the newspaper articles said that the PRISM program tapped directly into the computers of major Internet companies like Google and Apple and Facebook and it collected information on foreign users.",
        "Now, the companies flat-out denied that and denied that they were letting the government tap into their servers.",
        "And so there was this conflict between the media reports and the companies' denials.",
        "And it looks like the companies were right.",
        "The director of national intelligence provided clarity by saying that the newspaper reports were wrong, that PRISM wasn't a program exactly.",
        "It was a tool, an internal government system.",
        "And it allows an analyst to integrate information gleaned from the Internet companies and from other various government databases.",
        "So, Clapper is saying it's not a data-mining program as the newspapers were reporting.",
        "And he also said that the information isn't taken directly from the Internet companies' computers.",
        "Instead, the government has to go to this special court - the FISA court, get a warrant to get the companies to turn over the information.",
        "And Clapper said that permission, in order to get it, they have to prove to the court that they have a foreign target that's important to a national security investigation.",
        "He said Americans couldn't be intentionally part of these searches."
