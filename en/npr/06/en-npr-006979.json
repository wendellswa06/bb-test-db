        "Well, that's what everybody wants to find out.",
        "And they just revealed it this last week, and they redefined the word material.",
        "It used to be purely fabric, and Speedo had a material made where it's polyurethane surrounded by fabric.",
        "If you threw the Laser suit in a pool with no swimmer in it, would it float or sink?",
        "Well, by FINA's own definition, it would not be able to float.",
        "At this point in time, I would have to say, it does not float based on FINA rules, but that issue is still being debated.",
        "Because I'd read in the last couple of days some question about whether this thing may be more buoyant than other full body swimsuits.",
        "It has to have zero buoyancy.",
        "The construction of this allows for the swimmer to maintain his or her body position throughout the competition because of some rigid construction, some panels that allow the major muscle groups to centralize in the core area.",

        "That would be a good way to describe that.",

        "You know, I first saw these full body suits introduced, I think, a couple of Olympics ago.",
        "And, when I saw them, I thought to myself, why do they even allow this?",
        "Why don't you make everybody swim as stripped down as you can get?",
        "Oh, wouldn't that make viewers go up?",
        "Well, I don't know if it would, but at least everyone could see, you know, what was going on.",
        "And that's how they used to do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's the technological progression.",

        "Then, all of a sudden, the dawn of silk suits came about.",
        "But the real question here is, does all of the athletes have equal access to the same technology?",
        "And that's really a tough one right now.",
        "You know, just to take a step further, some federations throughout the world, you know, are already linked to certain sponsors.",
        "Over in Italy, all their athletes must wear their sponsored swimwear, which is not the Speedo, and that's creating turmoil within the athletes now because, you know, they're tied to their sponsor.",
        "But there is this new material out there that FINA allowed to come into it.",
        "Well, I guess the question of access is two things.",
        "One, this suit costs, I think, more than 500 dollars each, so not everyone would be able to afford it.",
        "And two, they are brand new, and I certainly couldn't go into a local swimming store and buy one.",
        "They're not generally accessible yet.",
        "But hasn't Speedo said they will make them available to any Olympic swimmer who wants one?",
        "That's my understanding, that they will do that.",
        "That is required by FINA.",
        "You know, the cost factor has a tremendous ripple down effect into the age group and the grass roots of this.",
        "It has proven that athletes will go faster in this.",
        "You know, it becomes a have and have not.",
        "There will be legislation banning it at certain levels of competition, in order to create more of an even playing field.",
        "This suit itself only lasts for six to 12 wears.",
        "Michael Phelps could theoretically go through three or four swim suits at 500 dollars a pop at the Olympics.",
        "Brent, have you tried this suit yourself.",
        "My guess, I could probably not fit in one.",
        "They had to measure me three or four times.",
