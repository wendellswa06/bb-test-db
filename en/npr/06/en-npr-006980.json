        "Turner was also unhappy that his study was used to suggest that people with depression should choose talk therapy over drugs.",
        "Why should we be recommending this other treatment when it might be just as fraught with publication bias as the drug literature is?",
        "So Turner and a team of researchers decided to find out.",
        "The team reviewed 55 National Institutes of Health grants awarded between 1972 and 2008.",
        "The grants funded clinical trials of psychotherapy for depression.",
        "Turner says the results of nearly a quarter of these trials never got published.",
        "And when you bring in the unpublished data, it brings down the apparent efficacy of psychotherapy for depression.",
        "The same way it brought down the apparent efficacy of drugs for depression.",
        "Steven Hollon of Vanderbilt University is one of the new study's co-authors.",
        "He says the results should reduce unjustified criticisms of drug treatment.",
        "There was a bit of a negative vibe for medications when the notion of publication bias came out, and this article, if anything, kind of evens up the playing field.",
        "And Hollon says the presence of publication bias is not an indictment of either talk therapy or antidepressant drugs.",
        "In both cases, there are enough good data there to tell us that those treatments work.",
        "They're efficacious.",
        "They're just not as efficacious as we think they probably are.",
        "In both cases, the true efficacy is probably about a third less than we think it is.",
        "Hollon says the published literature may have led psychiatrists and psychologists to be too optimistic about the depression treatments they offer.",
        "But he says that's less likely to be a problem for patients.",
        "When people are depressed, they usually underestimate.",
        "They're usually unduly pessimistic, and the biggest problem we have in depression's getting people to avail themselves of treatment, whatever it is.",
        "And if anything, it takes people longer to get into treatment than would be good for them."
