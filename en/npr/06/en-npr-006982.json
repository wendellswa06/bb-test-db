        "The doc can tell you that up to 1 in 4 patients with chronic pain can experience opioid dependence, and depending on your risk factors - family history of addiction, mental health issues, other chronic issues - that can put you at higher risk.",
        "On the other hand, I say, I'm in agony here; my back is killing me.",
        "And what I would say is, let's try some other options first.",
        "We absolutely want to treat your pain, but we want to do it safely.",
        "If opioids are warranted, though, we're not saying use them in isolation.",
        "They should be used in combination with things like exercise therapy or a nonsteroidal medication.",
        "Some doctors have expressed concerns over the recommendation that limits the amount of opioids that doctors should prescribe.",
        "It limits them mostly to a three-days' worth quantity.",
        "Don't the guidelines make it difficult for people in that case who don't have easy access to a hospital or live in a rural area to get that prescription renewed?",
        "So we heard that feedback, and so there's now a range of up to seven days.",
        "We want to make sure patients have appropriate access, but we also want to limit the number of patients that become addicted.",
        "And having too many days of medication can put you at risk for addiction.",
        "One of the criticisms that was voiced about the first draft of the guidelines was that a lot of these are based on expert decisions but not on very clear experimental proof - just how effective the non-opioid drug is compared to the opioid drug.",
        "Is there room for more science here before guidelines get more detailed?",
        "So there's room for more science as we continue to revise and update the guidelines, but given the number of Americans - 40 dying a day from opioid overdoses - we have enough evidence today about the risks that we feel it is prudent to warrant guidelines today.",
        "That being said, I can tell you, as a practicing physician, many of the guidelines I use are often based on low-quality evidence.",
        "And that does not mean bad evidence.",
        "That just means there's not a lot of randomized controlled trials - things like handwashing, you know, after a viral illness (laughter).",
        "That (laughter) there aren't randomized studies of handwashing to show.",
        "Not with handwashing with a viral illness for treating patients, you know?",
        "And I don't think if somebody came in with vomiting and diarrhea and I didn't wash my hands after seeing them and seeing another patient that patients would appreciate that.",
        "But we know the risks are significant, and the benefits are great if I'm going to wash my hands.",
        "So things like that - a lot of the times common sense or the best available evidence we have - is what drives these decisions.",
        "There are doctors who treat a lot of patients with pain who have a stake in the guidelines coming out of the CDC.",
        "There are also pharmaceutical companies that make the medications that are being being prescribed.",
        "Have you felt in this process that you have either indirectly or directly been working against those drug companies in trying to draft new guidelines for prescribing opioids?"
