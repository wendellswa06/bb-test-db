        "A pretty typical dilemma, says psychologist Laura Kastner, who, for more than 30 years, has been helping parents work toward more calm in the home.",
        "Kastner is a clinical psychologist in Seattle and she teaches at the University of Washington.",
        "In this situation, she says, both mother and daughter have gotten tangled up in what Kastner describes as emotional flooding.",
        "And when we flood, we are having neurons fire in this emotional part of the brain.",
        "And so our heart rate goes up.",
        "We have distorted cognitions.",
        "You know, we think in terms of black-white terms.",
        "So if I'm good, you're bad.",
        "And they're both doing that at the same time, right?",
        "It's the worst time in any intimate relationship.",
        "You know, the daughter feels attacked.",
        "She's just innocently sitting there, you know, trying to get her hair done.",
        "And the mother sees her new sofa about to be ruined.",
        "Over the past decade, researchers have provided Kastner and other psychologists with biological evidence that explains why teenagers see things and react to things so differently than adults.",
        "Take, for example, facial expressions.",
        "They're more likely to see, for instance, a classic face that depicts surprise as anger and hostility.",
        "Pediatrician James Chattra is in private practice in Redmond, Washington.",
        "He describes how, at about age 12, the teenage brain begins a massive shift in the prefrontal cortex, or the thinking part of the brain.",
        "Sometimes that prefrontal cortex that allows us to take a break, stop and think, is not working as well.",
        "It's going through this amazing pruning and rewiring shift.",
        "So it becomes this compelling picture of if you know that these neurons are getting wiped out in large amounts, what do you do as a parent?",
        "Chattra and Kastner agree.",
        "For starters, parents have to understand the neurological changes occurring in their teenager, changes that cause teens to take big risks and sometimes even do dangerous things.",
        "Like this scenario, says Kastner.",
        "Say your child goes to a sleepover.",
        "The kids sneak out, go to someone's house, and spray shaving cream all over the house and cars.",
        "The police come and give them a tongue lashing and send them back to the host family, who promptly delivers them home to you in the middle of the night."

        "The natural reaction for parents, says Kastner, is to say: What were you thinking?",

        "They were running like wildebeests in the canyon.",

        "You know, the children that we've been bringing out, we placed a meal in front of them, they don't know what to do.",
        "They're just shocked because they have not seen that much food in months if not years.",
        "Once you have gotten the people out of Homs and taken them to some part of the city or some part of the region where there's relative safety, what more can you do for them?",
        "Well, what we've done is to insure that everybody that does come out receives a family ration that will last them for a month.",
        "Other agencies, other U.N.",
        "agencies, we're working with as well provide them with nonfood items, with clothes, with cooking sets, with blankets, et cetera, so that they can set up a new life elsewhere, perhaps with relatives or in one of the shelters that we also support throughout the (unintelligible)."

        "Have you been allowed to see them?",

        "Is there concern among the relief groups there that these men may be in peril, that something could happen to them that would be beyond your control?",
        "Certainly, you know, there is a lot of nervous faces when they first come out, but people are choosing to come out and they are aware of the agreement that opposition inside of Homs and the government have made and how it works.",
        "At the moment they are following the process that has been agreed by both sides, and yesterday, we've already seen more than 100 men go free to join their families throughout Syria and that's going to continue over the coming day.",
