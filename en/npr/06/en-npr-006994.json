        "The woman on the other end of the phone, the social worker at the agency, kind of brought me back to reality when she said, well, I wasn't sure whether I should tell you, but what if you were walking down Fifth Avenue and you ran into someone who looks remarkably like you?",
        "And at that, you know, I started crying.",
        "Suddenly, this fear that an alternate version of myself was out there in the world, and it kind of drove my paranoid thoughts, thinking, you know, did my parents know about this?",
        "Was this orchestrated in some way?",
        "What else is there about my life that I don't know?",
        "You know, I thought I knew who I was, and suddenly my identity was - my sense of identity was, you know, changed dramatically in that one moment.",
        "And, I mean, I really broke down in tears.",
        "I just collapsed on the floor.",
        "And then, once I calmed down a bit - and the woman at the agency had given me two phone calls.",
        "She gave, some sort of, two phone numbers - Elyse's phone number and her phone number.",
        "And I went to pick up the phone to call the social worker, thinking, of course, I have 50 zillion questions to ask.",
        "And I accidentally - or perhaps it was a Freudian slip - called Elyse.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And you're suddenly hearing a voice, which is your voice.",
        "And I answered, hello?",
        "And I said, you know, is this Elyse Schein?",
        "And were you born October 9th, 1968?",
        "In a way, I've really still didn't believe it was true.",
        "I mean in a way, I still don't believe it's true.",
        "I still feel like we made the whole thing up.",
        "But then I look at Elyse and I realized, you know, we couldn't have made up such a crazy scenario.",
        "Anyway, so we did talk on the phone and, well, I definitely had reservations and was still slightly, you know, afraid of what this meant for my life.",
        "At the same time, I was excited talking to someone who I did feel this - some intimate, immediate connection with.",
        "So eventually exchanges of phone calls, e-mails, you two finally meet at a cafe in the East Village in New York and are astonished by your similarities and by your differences, you know, gestures.",
        "You realize that gestures, all of a sudden, that you thought were uniquely yours, weren't.",
        "That's right.",
        "Two days after we first spoke on the phone, we were face-to-face.",
        "I was face-to-face and encountering, as Paula said, an alternate version of myself.",
        "And I felt like I was able - say that we both felt like monkeys in a zoo as we began to examine and compare every part of really what makes us who we are."

        "And what Paula said that the reason that she pointed that out is that - Paula?",

        "And then, it was interesting as we did find, as you've said, the similar manners is we both just stipulate a lot when we talk, we're both very animated and expressive, we're both - we both kind of mock-type while we speak, often as we're thinking things sometimes.",
        "We each tilted our heads to the side as we were growing up.",
        "And then, what was also fascinating was, I mean, we really just hit it off immediately and started, you know, trying to catch each other up on the past 35 years of our life.",
        "And I felt like saying, you know, so Elyse, what have you been doing since we last saw each other in the womb?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Which is an odd thought, but it turned out, again, uncanny similarities.",
        "You both suffered from depression in college.",
        "You both took up very broadly similar careers; both interested in the same kinds of movies.",
        "Elyse, you were studying to be a film director.",
        "Paula Bernstein, you write about film.",

        "I could almost hear her thoughts: If I were you, I would have a better apartment, I would.",

        "And I did sense that though, you know, her line of questioning was, you know, wondering how I could live the way I did.",
