        "And Elyse, this idea of a twins study - controversial in the 1960s, when it actually happened - it's almost horrifying to contemplate today.",
        "That's correct.",
        "But even at that time, it was not common practice to separate twins and certainly there was no other study of its kind because it's completely - as we all know, it's unethical to separate twins, you know, purposely for a study.",
        "All other twin studies that have come since are retrospective.",
        "And this is Paula, adding that in fact, Dr. Neubauer did try to recruit other agencies to be involved in the study, and none of them agreed.",
        "Also, it's interesting to note that Dr. Viola Bernard never had any substantiated research to back up this theory that she had.",
        "You know, so it was more kind of based on anecdotal experiences.",
        "Even more bizarre, it turns out all the conclusions and findings and the notes from these studies are locked up in academic archives until much later some of them will be available until you are both 98 years old and will, I'm sure, be most interested to look at them by that time.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It's Paula, and I'm determined that we're both going to - I think we have good genes and we come from good stock, and we're going to stick around until we're 98, and we're going to be crotchety old ladies, and we're going to go to those archives and find out what it was all about.",
        "Or even better, somehow, they will realize that they should be open to the twins and other - the triplets, and that we will gain access to these closed archives which are under the auspices of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, which, you know, for all intents and purposes exists to benefit these Jewish children and families.",
        "Benefit Jewish children and families.",
        "This was an extremely prestigious adoption agency as well.",
        "And at the same time, as you come away from your research into this and thinking about it, Elyse, I think it was you who mentions in your book, you can't help but thinking that you'd be candidates for research of Josef Mengele.",
        "Well, that's correct.",
        "Well, we both realized that, that we both - well, I think it was in Paula's section when she says that…",

        "Right.",
        "And certainly, Mengele was fascinated by twins and did conduct obviously monstrous, twin studies, which were, you know, were far more horrific than anything we've experienced.",
        "But certainly - along the same lines and the fact that we are both Jewish and twins - you know, no doubt, we would have been of great interest to Dr. Mengele.",
        "And it is kind of horrifying to think that even after World War II that a Jewish agency like this in particular would not have, you know, looked to the past and really questioned the ethics of conducting such a study.",
        "We actually came face-to-face - we interview with Dr. Peter Neubauer, who was the impetus behind the study.",
        "And even today, he's a sprightly 93 and he expresses no remorse about the study that he conducted.",
        "And, you know, he seemed to express regrets simply about that he couldn't publish the results of his study of which he seemed to be so proud.",

        "Can you characterize any inner kind of experience?",
        "Well, since my mother died when I was 6, then, you know, in my late 20s, and I began to say to friends I feel like I'm missing a twin.",
        "So then when I learned the news, my identity shifted and then, you know, I felt very relieved to answer - this is Elyse speaking - and that I felt relieved to answer a key element or, you know, resolve a key element of my identity that I - not only did I suddenly have a twin, that I was a twin."

        "Yeah.",

        "Or, you know, when I would repeat to friends, I feel like I'm missing a twin, it was simply a metaphor.",
        "And for all I knew that, you know, was something that all people felt as part of the human experience.",

        "Well, when you look at images of twins on the sonogram, sonogram images of twins together in the womb, you often see them interacting.",
        "So to me, it's not surprising.",
        "You know, and there's a lot of psychological studies that show, you know, what occurs in the womb.",
        "We often have - can have memories of that or that has an impact on our lives.",
        "So it's not surprising that a twin, you know, that we might have had a sense, or other twins - you know, there are twins whose twin died in utero and oftentimes then, you know, their parents will discuss it with them and they said that they sensed it.",
        "It's hard to, you know, scientifically document that, but that we have heard tales of that.",
        "And…",
        "And your sister?",
        "And this is Paula now.",
        "And I have to say, you know, it's so hard to look back and say - you know, I always had intense friendships, for instance, but it's hard to attribute that to having lost my twin.",
        "You know, in that, a lot of young girls have intense friendships, so I certainly had abandonment complex, I think, at times.",
        "You know, even with friends, leaving a party not saying goodbye, you know?",
        "I would feel rejected, and I sometimes attributed that to being adopted.",
        "But I didn't want to read too much into it.",
        "And I think, truthfully, when one of the issues that Elyse and I had had early in the relationship was that as difficult as it was for each of us to adjust to this new identity in this new relationship, for Elyse, on some level, it made sense and it explained a mystery in her life.",
        "And there was this sort of elation that she describes in the book about, you know, unraveling this mystery that made some sort of sense, whereas it just didn't make sense to me and it felt so unreal in a way that it was hard for me to accept it.",
        "Yet, you write later in the book about, you know, the difficulties of accepting the, you know, the sequence of identities and the sequence of abandonment.",
        "You were separated from your twin - from your birth mother, then from your twin then from your foster mother, and then your adoptive mother died when you were young.",

        "Yes.",

        "I was more relaxed knowing the truth about that I have had a twin.",
        "So - whereas I felt that I was less relaxed, knowing that it made my life, you know, that it brought more of a sense of anxiety about identity that in that, it - you know, it was, I mean, I think it was unnerving to both of us, but in some ways, it clicked for Elyse more.",
        "Well, it was unnerving when she became a reality.",
        "That was complicated.",
        "But when it was - when I got the letter and I found out I had a twin, I was elated simply knowing the truth.",

        "How do you compare yourselves as not growing up as twins to those who did, growing up, always knowing this?",
        "Well, we actually, we had a funny experience - this is Elyse - of interviewing twins, you know, who were separated but also twins who were raised together, who are a constant curiosity for us.",
        "You know, we wonder how it would have been.",
        "You know, would we have been dressed in the same clothing?",
        "And when we interviewed one pair of adult twins, twin women, then, you know, we asked them if, you know, what they thought of Viola Bernard's theory, and if they agreed that being raised as twins then, you know, made it difficult for them to develop their own identities, and if they were a burden on their families?",
        "And they said yes to both counts.",
        "But when we said, could you imagine growing up without your twin?",
        "They said we wouldn't trade it for the world.",
        "So we certainly have had to get used to, you know, being compared, you know, if I - so that, you know, I am the Bohemian twin, you know, because Paula is married and has two lovely daughters, my nieces, and I'm more, you know, on my own and free to travel and go about, so then, you know, we don't like to be pigeonholed.",
        "And that's something I'm sure even twins raised together don't like, but we're really not used to it.",
        "Right.",
        "And then - this is Paula now - we're seen in comparison to each other.",
        "And so, for instance, friends who knew me during my 20s, you know, saw me as kind of a Bohemian living in the East Village and being a freelance writer and going to, you know, film openings and that sort of stuff."
