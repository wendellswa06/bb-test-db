        "This is Paula, and no, we were relieved to know that our adoptive parents did not know that we were a set - one of a set of twins.",
        "They were not offered twins nor do they know anything about a study.",
        "And the way the study was able to conduct - be conducted without the adoptive parents' knowledge was that when children, who were, you know, one of a pair of twins or triplets were adopted, the families were told your child is already participating in a child development study.",
        "They were not told what the purpose of the study was, so the researchers would often go from one home to the next, sometimes on the same day, seeing, you know, both, you know, each twin and a pair without the families' knowledge.",
        "In our case, I should say that we were dropped from the study quite early on so our - in fact, we were studied really well.",
        "We were in foster care, so our parents really knew nothing about the study because by the time we were adopted, we had been dropped…",
        "And…",
        "…because - and that is a question that we've never entirely been able to answer, which is one of the reasons we'd like to get into the archives as well.",
        "There was also this agency, it was later driven out of business in no small part because of lawsuits from people who weren't informed of their medical backgrounds, of their parents which might have helped them deal with things in their life.",
        "Indeed, it was a history of them lying to your adoptive parents, lying to you, until they finally came clean.",
        "Correct.",
        "In fact, in 1983, there was a law that, a New York state law that legislated that all adoption agencies in the state had to reveal all medical information to adoptees and adoptive families.",
        "And I, in fact, contacted the agency in 1987 or 1988 and they did not tell me at that point that I had a twin nor do they tell me that our birth mother did - was diagnosed with severe mental illness.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Okay.",
        "I have a 6-year-old twin boys, and they're just starting their school career.",
        "And not that we were a part of a study when they were born because they did come quite early until we are watching all of that developmental stuff, but now we're kind of babbling in trying to decide - do we separate them in school?",
        "Right now, they are separated, but they are having a tough time with that, you know?",
        "Is separating twins really the best thing to do for them, you know?",
        "Or, do they need to stay together so they can keep that connection, or is it really better to, you know, let them find their own identities.",
        "Well, this is Paula, and it's interesting.",
        "I have sort of first-hand experience with this.",
        "I was just - I just spent the morning with a very old friend of mine who has identical twin girls, who are four and a half.",
        "And we were discussing this very issue because they're going to be going to kindergarten next year, and she does plan to have them in separate classrooms.",
        "And we were saying that it really depend - I mean, she agreed with me that it really depends on the children and on their relationship.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think, you know, you as a parent know that better than anyone else.",
        "You know, I think - if possible, I think it's great for them to venture around their own and be in individual classrooms.",
        "But I think the exception is if it really is going to be traumatic to separate them in which case, I don't think you want school to be a traumatic experience.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "We ran into this problem last year.",
        "We tried and start them in kindergarten last year, but we were told within two days old - you are too soon, you know, you need to go back.",
        "And we, this year, we wanted to put them together and they - the school kind of wouldn't really allow us to do that.",
        "They were like, nope, we think they should be separated.",
        "When - we were thought - thinking, you know, they really should be together.",
        "And I think it's really up to the parents…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…I mean, it should be up to the parents who know children the best."

        "Would you ever consider doing one of those things?",

        "And I think growing up separately or just because of our personalities, we're not really interested in it.",
        "I think now, personally, I would be interested in attending such as festival to gawk at the other twins.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I'm curious by these festivals in the same way that the public is fascinated by twins.",

        "Well, you - it's Paula - and you happen to be right in that they are highly genetic and that not just anecdotal experience that Elyse and I do fall very closely on political and religious beliefs, but in research, the data has actually shown that that is the case as well, that they are largely hereditary, which is not to say you're born a Democrat or Republican, but you are born with a proclivity towards certain traits that will veer you in a given direction.",
        "You know, either you're more close minded versus more open minded -no, more free thinking, more traditional, those sorts of traits - more empathetic, more, you know, all of those characteristics lead one in a certain direction politically and religiously.",

        "It might have been bipolar or severe depression - we really can't be sure.",

        "She had been in and out of the mental - this is Paula now - she had been institutionalized for many years and was really unable to take care of herself, so there's no way she could have taken care of us.",
