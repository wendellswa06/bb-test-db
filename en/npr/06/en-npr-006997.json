        "But you two have lived this intimately now.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, I think clearly, we're not born as blank slates as I once believed and as the general public once believed.",
        "For instance, when I was adopted in the late '60s, I think my parents really believed that that it was all nurture and all environment and - but at the same time, we're not born with a blueprint to, you know, our future personality.",
        "That, in other words, there is no mathematical equation, you know, that DNA plus environment equals identity or personality.",
        "And I think it's the interplay between, you know, between nature and nurture.",

        "Where does Ralph Ellison fit in that pantheon?",
        "A very interesting question.",
        "He doesn't fit absolutely comfortably next to Langston Hughes because - although Langston Hughes had helped him a great deal when Ralph first came to New York in 1936 and supported him for many, many years as a fledgling writer, eventually Ellison, who had Olympian standards that grew only taller, I think, as he became more successful, ultimately came to despise Hughes as an artist, to think of him as unimaginative, repetitive, pandering to the masses.",

        "Like Jackie Robinson, he forced Americans to think in a different way.",
        "He won - when he won the book award, the National Book Award in 1953 - of course Jackie Robinson was - broke the color line 60 years ago - he would have not enjoyed that comparison either, I don't think."

        "I was surprised how at every stage of his life - from his birth in Oklahoma in 1913, where he lived for about 20 years and Tuskegee and then coming to New York City and becoming a writer and so on, at every stage - he really fought all sorts of demons, really, and a lot of it having to do with his childhood - the death of his father when he was three, the abject poverty in which he grew up with his mother; and his desire to succeed, to reclaim his father's legacy, if you like.",
