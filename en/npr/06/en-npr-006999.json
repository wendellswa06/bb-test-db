        "But I just think that it's very interesting how on both books, I think, hit on the experience of African-Americans in this country, you know, back in the time period of the '40s and '50s, that context, but also today; it spoke to the black experience today and how are they are just completely different.",
        "You know, in one case I noticed that the character in (unintelligible) Bigger Thomas, he was visible at all times.",
        "And I think that added to his pressure in living everyday life in Chicago, whereas of course Ellison's character, who is nameless, is invisible in essence and he's striving to be seen as a human being in his nation and not just as a problem or a worker or a nameless label.",

        "Yeah, quick critique and an excellent one.",
        "Yes, I mean, the novels are linked but what jumps to my mind as a biographer is the fact that Wright was the person who set Ellison on the course to becoming a writer, asked him to write his first short story, which was published posthumously - but still, that's how he got started.",
        "So he would have written \"\"Invisible Man\"\" fully conscious of what Richard Wright had written?",

        "Ellison was always quick to deny that he learned much from Richard Wright, but that is not the case.",
        "And Angela is right in connecting the two novels because they both come out a common pool of experience as it is represented, you know, by two significant African-American and American writers.",

        "We appreciate it.",
        "Okay.",

        "And there's this odd - what did he think of this idea of authenticity?",
        "I mean, he certainly was looking for it in that first short story, yet \"\"Invisible Man\"\" - a different take, completely.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, I think, there's a gap between the story \"\"Hymie's Bull\"\" that was subsequently published by John Callahan in his edition of Ellison's short stories called \"\"Flying Home.\"\" It's a different - that's heavily influenced, I think, by Ernest Hemingway.",
        "It has a kind of detached manner and so on.",
        "Ellison had not yet worked through a number of things that he would work through.",
        "One would be a pro-communist phase where his aesthetic is dominated by, you know, radical socialism.",
        "And then an emancipation from that form of what he would regard as bondage to his - creating much more complicated characters in much more complicated fictional situation.",
        "He became very much interested in myth and symbol and allegory.",
        "And what he set out to do in \"\"Invisible Man\"\" - in addition to writing a novel which he hoped would be the great American novel - he also wanted to do two things.",
        "One, to tell a story of the black everyman, but as Angela had said, I mean, this is an educated every man.",
        "And at the same time, to write a story that was universal, absolutely universal that would resound across countries and so-called races."
