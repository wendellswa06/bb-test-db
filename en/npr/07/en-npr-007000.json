        "I wanted to discuss a little further his separation from Richard Wright.",
        "And I'm wondering - I know he had written an essay saying he couldn't be a party to him anymore - how he felt about Richard Wright's derogatory stance against writers like Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and even later, Toni Morrison.",
        "Richard Wright's…",
        "How Ralph Ellison felt about Richard Wright taking a negative stance towards those great women writers.",
        "Well, I would have to say that he would have shared Wright's opinion about the writers.",
        "In fact, if one goes through Ellison's body of work, public and private, you do not find much praise.",
        "You hardly find any praise at all for black writers, male or female.",
        "But I do make a point in the book how when the great wave of women's - black women's writing surfaced - say around in 1970 - and reached its highest point with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Toni Morrison, Ellison had no part of that and he wanted no part of it.",
        "He did not understand it and he did not sympathize with the writers.",
        "And that was, I think, an enormous loss for him - an enormous loss.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Particularly, Hurston, you said - I forget who you quoted in the book, but you said they thought this would be something that would be very attractive to him and he just seemingly rejected it out of hand.",
        "It was either R.W.B Lewis - I was quoting from Yale or Nathan Scott.",
        "I think it was Nathan Scott.",
        "Yes.",
        "Nathan Scott, the professor of theology and literature from the University of Virginia, and before that Chicago.",
        "He said, you know, he tried to interest Ellison in Zora Neale Hurston, thinking that, you know, they both love the blues and so on, and folk ways.",
        "But no, as far as Ellison was concerned - Ellison had his pantheon, the pantheon of great writers, and he - and there was no black American, no black at all in that pantheon.",
        "They could never make it.",
        "We're talking about Dostoyevsky, T.S.",
        "Eliot, Hemingway, Faulkner, Andre Malraux, Joyce.",
        "I mean, it's a reasonable pantheon.",
        "They're pretty good writers.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're pretty good writers.",
        "But he made a distinction that I thought - I sometimes think was unfortunate, or is unfortunate between ancestors who - to whom he looked up with pride, and relatives - like Richard Wright and Langston Hughes - for whom he had really very, very little time."

        "But I'm a little nervous because I'm always trying to encourage readers to not believe that they'd need to know the biography of the author to understand the work, and particularly, I think, with minority authors.",
        "People tend to read them more as almost ethnographic studies than as works of literature.",
        "So I guess, I'd love to hear Professor Rampersad comment on, what the - this new biography helps us do in terms of reading the novel?",
        "In what ways does it change his own reading of \"\"Invisible Man\"\"?",
        "Well, I have had various people read the book and say that -perhaps it's immodest of me to say it - and they tell me that they will, from this moment on, read \"\"Invisible Man\"\" differently.",
        "What I try to do is to go stage by stage through the years as \"\"Invisible Man\"\" is being written, and to look at the choices, the artistic choices and thematic choices that Ellison makes and relate them to, you know, to his serious intellectual concerns.",
        "This is a man who made himself into a first class intellectual in the - in liberal Western tradition, and he wanted to bring all of that learning and philosophizing, if you like, into this masterpiece that he believes he was writing.",
        "I would like to think that if you read the biography, certainly, in those chapters, you would find useful illumination of the novel.",

        "I believe so.",
