        "For scientists these days, probing the secrets of plants at the genetic level is all the rage.",
        "Here's NPR's Joe Palca to tell us about two especially interesting plants.",
        "If you're wondering how exactly it is that plants help fuel the world, Jody Banks has the answer.",
        "When you burn coal today, or actually the fossil fuel, the fossil is a fossil of the relatives of Selaginella.",
        "Jody Banks is a botanist at Purdue University.",
        "Selaginella is smallish plant, about six inches tall.",
        "It's found all over the world.",
        "Banks says Selaginella represents an important step in the evolution of plants.",
        "It's one of the first to develop a system of tubing for transporting water and other nutrients from one end of the plant to the other.",
        "You can only reach a certain height before, you know, you have to be able to - you have to have tubing to conduct the water from the ground to the top of the plant.",
        "If you remember your high school biology, those tubes are called xylem and phloem, and plants wouldn't get far without them.",
        "Besides tubing, Selagninella has something else you should know about.",
        "Now we're going to talk about plant secondary metabolites.",
        "Okay, wait a minute.",
        "Let me get myself seated comfortably.",
        "Okay.",

        "As Banks reports in the current issue of the journal Science, Selaginella is chockfull of genes that make these secondary metabolites.",
        "So what that means is that Selaginella is likely to make many, many, many secondary compounds, and they're most likely going to be unique.",
        "Another important plant getting a genomic working over is amborella.",
        "Victor Albert of the University at Buffalo says amborella doesn't look all that important.",
        "It basically just looks like a small tree or shrub with fairly non-descript leaves and relatively non-descript flowers, and it produces berries.",
        "But those non-descript flowers turn out from one of the first flowering plants that evolved on Earth.",
        "Somewhere around maybe 130 or more million years ago, the flowing plants first emerged.",
        "And the flower was a great innovation.",
        "At the House of Commons in London last week, Scottish parliamentarian Ian Blackford made it very clear why.",

        "But Chengdu emerged pretty much unscathed.",
        "This is a huge city, with a population ranging from four to 11 million, depending on how much surrounding area you include.",
        "And it's safe to say the population of Chengdu will balloon as the people displaced by the earthquake make their way here to the big city.",
        "Chengdu is a boom town.",
        "There's lots of foreign investment here.",
        "Intel is here.",
        "Motorola, Microsoft - many others.",

        "And if you find something that looks old, it probably isn't.",
        "Case in point: When I was here in April, we went to a tiny street that's considered the beating heart of old Chengdu, the last remnant of the old city.",

        "They've all been torn down, and they're getting rebuilt in the old style - beautiful homes with brick and curved roofs that are tiled with decorative trim on the outside.",

        "It's essentially a reconstituted old street.",
        "Most of the buildings here are essentially redone.",
        "In some cases, it's because the original quality of the construction is not that good.",
        "But I think there's also just a preoccupation with newness, a feeling that old things are just not worth saving, and people are ready to move on.",
        "There's not very much sentimentality about saving old buildings.",
        "This street's being marketed to businesses who might want to come here as an irreplaceable symbol of old Chengdu - historic, irreplaceable, but it was torn down and rebuilt.",
        "Yes.",
        "And you walk through here, you can't help but think of where are the people now who used to live here?",
        "And I imagine they're out in the countryside or in the suburbs in much less expensive quarters.",
        "The thing is, of course, that in all of these old neighborhoods, this land is right in the center of town, and it's become extremely expensive.",
        "And I think in many of these neighborhoods, the developers have made a lot of money by turning this into upscale shopping areas.",
        "And one of the reason the developers make so much money is that the residents often get less than market value for their homes, and so many of the residents often complain that they're not able to buy new housing with the amount that they're given.",
        "Here's a building that has a metal sign above the gate and Chinese characters.",
