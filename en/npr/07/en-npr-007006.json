        "And it's hard to answer at this point in time.",
        "But certainly, the fact that these two individuals have been indicted and do have ties to Giuliani does raise the prospect of perhaps the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York looking at Giuliani more closely.",
        "All right, let me ask you both what strategies you see playing out on Capitol Hill, at the White House, either end of Pennsylvania Avenue.",
        "Sue, are you starting to watch a strategy take shape for how the three committees conducting this inquiry are planning to proceed?",
        "Well, it is interesting because I think that one of the debates that the Democrats have had internally is how narrow or expansive do they want to keep this impeachment inquiry.",
        "And over the course of this break while the committee has continued its work, I think Adam Schiff, the chairman of the committee, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still maintain that they want to keep this impeachment focus almost uniquely on this question of whether the president sought interference in the election and the Ukrainian connection.",
        "They might face some resistance to that from Democrats more broadly in the party who might want to expand the scope of this investigation as more and more of these details come into play.",
        "So I think discipline among Democrats is going to be one of the things we're looking for.",
        "But I would also say on the other end, for Republicans, I think one thing this recess has taught us is that - don't expect much of daylight between the rank and file on Capitol Hill and between the president.",
        "Republicans have been outpolling in the House in swing seats and in competitive districts.",
        "And the message that they are getting is you better stick with this president.",
        "I've even talked to a lot of lawmakers' aides, who said the message they've - their lawmakers have heard over the break are not just stick with them, but you should be fighting harder for them.",

        "Ryan Lucas, over to the president and his allies, I want to play quickly a piece of tape from the president.",

        "Now on the non-cooperation front, we've already seen cracks in that though because we had, for example, today, Marie Yovanovitch testifying.",

        "With prices falling, people are continuing to be foreclosed on, and he sees bringing down mortgage rates as a way to not only end foreclosures, but get more people back into the housing market, which will bring up the prices of homes and maybe stabilize the housing market a bit.",
        "Some people are quoted as saying that this could get rid of half of the housing inventory out there?",
        "Well, I'm not sure if we know how much inventory it might get rid of, but obviously, it's going to - if you can get a cheaper loan, you can afford a bigger mortgage, and you can afford a more expensive house.",

        "It's basically - the Treasury can't bring down the rates itself.",
        "What's it's going to do is encourage banks to bring down the rate to as low as 4.5 percent by offering to buy the securities underlying those loans at a price that's equal to 4.5 percent.",
        "So, in other words, they're basically telling the the banks, hey, if you make a loan, we're going to pay you at a rate 4.5 percent, so you're guaranteed that yield.",
        "And so, that's going to make banks more willing to decrease their loans to that amount.",
        "So, how would that affect the credit crunch, though, because I think the problem now is that banks are just unwilling to provide credit to possible home buyers."
