        "And slowly they began to embrace it, and that's where the whole notion of planting a garden came from because I found that in my own kids, when they were involved in the process of growing and harvesting their own food, and they were engaged, they actually embraced the idea.",
        "And I thought, well, if I didn't have this figured out with all my education and all my exposure, you know, there are probably other parents and families out there who needed help, as well.",
        "So I thought that a garden in the backyard of the White House would be a wonderful way to begin a conversation about what we feed our kids and their overall health.",

        "They tend to change more quickly than adults, and that's one of the reasons why we started with children and working on the issue of childhood obesity because children are not so hard-wired as adults.",
        "And it took about a few weeks, maybe a month before they started getting used to the taste of fresh-squeezed juice rather than juice out of the can.",
        "And once they understood what was at stake for them - and I say this a lot to kids, I always ask the question would you water your plant with a soda.",
        "And kids naturally respond well, no, that would be silly.",
        "But when you explain to them that that's really what they're doing to their own bodies and that their bodies are living organisms, and they respond to what we put in them and, you know, how we nurture them, kids, the light goes off, the light bulb goes off in their heads, and they start to think differently about what they want to eat.",
        "So...",
        "A month can be an awful long haul.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "A lot of aw, moms.",
        "Well, over the span of a child's life, a month isn't that bad, and I think that's one of the things, that's really the hard part is that, you know, we don't - as parents we don't want our kids to be miserable, you know, and that's the tough thing about this challenge is that, you know, a lot of parents are just tired."

        "It's a little over three weeks until Election Day, but people across the country are already voting.",

        "Wonderful to be with you.",
        "Can you give us a way to measure how widespread early voting is and how this compares to past election years?",
        "Well, I start with that last question first.",
        "In 2008, roughly 30 percent of the votes were cast prior to the election.",
        "In 2012, it was 32 percent.",
        "A couple more states have come online.",
        "We have about 13 holdout states that don't offer any form of early voting yet, but just looking at the fact that a few more states have come online and popularity of early voting tends to increase, even if a state doesn't change its law, I would project about 34 percent of the votes will be cast prior to Election Day in 2016.",
        "That number may change a little bit on the estimate, but I think that's where we start from.",
        "That's about a third.",
        "That's pretty big.",
        "Yes, and in some states, it will be much more than that, and some of the key battleground states like Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada - you could see 50 percent, even two-thirds or more of the votes cast prior to Election Day.",
        "You say that the percentage of the electorate that seems to be voting early or seems to be edging up - you said you think it might be around - what?",
        "- 34 percent?",
        "Is that because early voting is more popular?",
        "Anything we can glean from that?",
        "What's very interesting about this election is that we're seeing uneven activity in voting across the country.",
        "So in the South, in places like Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, for example, we can see interest is up over 2012, in terms of early voting activity.",
        "But then you look at the Midwest, and it's exactly the opposite.",
        "It's the Democrats who have lowered interests, so we can see in Iowa, the early voting numbers among registered Democrats are much lower than they were in 2012.",
        "And in Ohio, we can see places like Cuyahoga where Cleveland is and Franklin where Columbus is.",
        "We can see much lower levels of early voting activity than in 2012, and if we take a big step back, and we sort of take a look at the big picture, we'll see increased voting across the board, not only early, but also on Election Day in the Southern states.",
        "But yet, in the Midwest, we may see early voting levels lower and then overall turnout levels lower as well.",
        "Have there been any events so far that seem to have had an effect on requests for absentee ballots?",
        "We do have data out of North Carolina and Georgia where we know the absentee ballot requests by gender, and looking at the gender on - by date, I can see that following that first debate, the number of women that were requesting absentee ballots increased significantly and their share of the - all of the early ballots went up about 4 percentage points."

        "So it would be extremely difficult for a party to manipulate the election outcomes for a presidential election because we run our elections at the local level, so there would have to be some sort of conspiracy that stretches across multiple counties in some of the key battleground states, and you'd have to have in many cases Republican-elected officials because in many places we have partisan-elected officials who run our elections in this country.",
        "You'd have to have Republicans who are complicit in this rigging of the election, but, of course, there are instances of fraud that happen.",
        "But by and large, these are things that happen predominantly at the local level and when they do happen, they actually - they happen in the mail balloting.",

        "And, David, what is it exactly that the president says he so urgently needs from the Congress right now?",
        "Well, Melissa, what the president really wants is a long-term extension of the temporary powers the Congress granted the executive branch last summer which basically permit the kind of warrantless wiretapping his administration had secretly carried out for five years until The New York Times revealed what was going on.",

        "But not from the House, and the House is balking at taking that Senate bill and just approving that again.",

        "Because the House passed its own extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act - what's known as FISA - back in November and it intentionally did not include in it any immunity for the telecommunications firms.",

        "And what's more, they refused to simply take the Senate-passed bill with immunity and hold the vote on it.",
        "That bill would likely pass if they did but they insist on more time now to merge the two bills like three weeks more time, but President Bush did go along with a 15-day extension of the current law so that the Senate could finish its bill but he now says he'll veto any further extension.",
