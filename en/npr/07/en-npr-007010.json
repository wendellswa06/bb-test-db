        "That's all you basically needed, but you've got to have a lot of outfielders.",
        "And the goal was trying to be at bat.",
        "So if the pitcher swung and you hit it, the catchers, if they either caught it on a fly or on one bounce, you'd lose your bat, right?",
        "So your goal was to stay at bat, and we would play that in our neighborhood all day long - girls, boys, it wouldn't matter.",
        "All you needed was a bat and a softball.",

        "And our hope is that other networks will follow suit, because what Disney is able to do because it's such a big player in the market is that the folks that want to market are going to have to change the nature of their food in order to pass the standards at Disney.",

        "Right.",

        "We try to, you know, have a big tent and to use sort of the carrot mentality, that we want everybody in the table - at the table in whatever way they can because if we're slowly starting to change the culture, if we're slowly starting to have a set of different conversations around the dinner tables and around the schoolyard and among teachers and, you know, kids heading to college, this is the kind of momentum that changes demand, and then those that are supplying will have to respond.",
