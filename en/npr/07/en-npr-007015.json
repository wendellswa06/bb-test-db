        "If we can have a band-aid at this point which would allow a significant number of those people to not spend so much time in prison away from their children and learning how to become prisoners again, then I think it's great until we have a larger effort to reduce these draconian sentencing measures across the country.",
        "Well, I think that's not the way to do it.",
        "These guys are some of the same kind of guys you just said were coming back to New Orleans.",

        "I'm kind of in the middle on that because I would agree that, of course, you're going to have to have - if this were to somehow find its way into law past the issue of valuable consideration in the Transplant Act, I think that you'll definitely have screenings that would allow you to determine just as you would if you were in a regular hospital environment, if you had a normal organ donor, which organs were usable, et cetera.",
        "But I think that I would agree with John in that most of the offenders that we talk about today are very, very low-level guys.",

        "So if you have an opportunity perhaps this could be part of true rehabilitation, teaching people to give to keep other people alive.",

        "I know you say that - some of you agree that selling organs might be the way to go, but prison term as opposed to…",
        "Well, it's obviously - it's probably not going to happen.",
        "I don't think there's enough muscle behind it especially if it's one state.",
        "But it's something that's worth getting out into the discussion for the simple reason that there are too many people in prison for small reasons.",
        "And as for what they're going to do when they come out, and I certainly take E.R.'s point, we also need more prisoner reentry programs to address that part.",
        "Now, whether that's going to happen, that's another question."
