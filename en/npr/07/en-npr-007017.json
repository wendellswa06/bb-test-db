        "So with radar and sonar and lasers and I think 15 computers, it can basically find its way around and just take you anywhere.",

        "Well it was eerie.",

        "And it's a pretty aggressive driving car kind a like a New York cabby, so because they had to win a race, so it takes off fast, it stops fast, it swerves around things, so it's an interesting experience.",
        "I take it's not going to be available on the market anytime in the near future?",
        "Well, they're saying within 10 years, which considering what a leap this is in technology that I'm - that's pretty impressive.",

        "They claim they're still alive, but the buzz on the floor is that the format wars are coming to an end.",
        "As you know, on Friday, last Friday, Warner said it will no longer be supporting HD-DVD format, which has been competing with Blu-ray.",
        "Blu-ray currently has about 70 percent of the content, so the thought that HD-DVD could survive with just two studios and 30 percent of content is rather dim.",

        "Now, again, the folks that one would think would be lying in the coffin refuse to acknowledge that they're dead.",
        "There is some possibility that they would continue to operate and people would get dual players.",
        "There are a lot of people that have HD-DVD players that might have bought them over the holidays, but at the moment and just like within politics, sometimes the frontrunner can go behind but at the moment it seems pretty likely that the Blu-ray format is going to survive.",
        "And in fact, the - Howard Stringer, the CEO of Sony began his talk by saying I'm feeling blue and he didn't meant that he was depressed, that meant he was elated because they are backing Blu-ray and they think that they are winning.",
        "And so you predict though if that is what happened, those people who bought those HD-DVD players for Christmas, they're going to turn out to be junk?",
        "Not quite.",
        "You can watch standard definition discs from them, they're going to look great because they upscale on a high-definition DVD, so your standard def DVDs will look good.",
        "And, right now I believe it's Paramount and University - and Universal still have contracts to produce HD-DVDs, so they will be creating content.",
        "Maybe you'll just fall in love with Paramount and Universal titles and won't want to watch Disney or others, but look, I think that consumers benefit by this war ending.",
        "I don't have - I don't care, personally, which one wins.",
        "They're both fine, but it's got to win for the industry to move forward, and I think most people in the industry know that.",
        "Most consumers know that they want to be able to go into a store, buy a player.",
        "They want to go to another store and buy a disc or rent a disc and know that everything is going to work together.",

        "They keep the first few minutes of thousands of movies on their discs so as soon as you press play, you get the movie, and then at the background, the rest of it downloads.",
        "So in there, you get a seamless download experience.",
        "You're not sitting and waiting for it to happen.",
