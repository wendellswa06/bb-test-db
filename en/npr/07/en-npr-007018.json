        "Yeah.",

        "They have cameras and infrared that can read your hand gestures so you can slide things around on the wall.",

        "Service.",
        "The idea, you go to a retail shop, you have this table, the surface like a table, and you would use sort of iPhone-like gesture - they wouldn't say that - to manipulate what's on the screen.",

        "This is a pretty grand comment here.",
        "I think WiMAX is going to ultimately kill terrestrial radio broadcast, television and satellite radio and cable television, or at least annihilate the market share because what it means is Web radio equals terrestrial radio.",
        "Web radio equals broadcast - Web television equals broadcast television.",
        "So the little guy, the bedroom producer, is going to be able to have as much market reach ultimately, you know, maybe 10 years down the road as you on NPR do.",
        "And so it's going to basically create a situation where merit(ph) is what matters.",

        "And, frankly, you know, you're not in the business of transmitting through those towers that we call radio.",

        "I think it is true that we're going to have a huge number of people doing - we already do it through podcasting.",
        "We're going to have thousands, if not, millions of people producing programming.",
        "And some of them will rise to the point where they could be as or more popular than major media companies.",
        "Smart media companies will hire some of those people.",
        "Some of them are going to create their own franchise.",
        "But at the end of the day, it's all about quality.",
        "And I think that the media companies that understand that and invest in it are going to continue to do very well.",
        "Those that keep thinking that we are in the television business, we are in the radio business would be like thinking that you're in the railroad business and not investing in airlines.",
        "They've got to diversify.",
        "But at the same time, you know, it will be a while before you're driving down the highway and turning in - turning on to, you know, WCBS or KQED San Francisco through your WiMAX radio.",
