        "What it is basically is a very, very high-resolution screen that's also extremely thin.",
        "I don't remember the number of millimeters, but it's the size of three credit cards - about three millimeter thick - very brilliant picture.",
        "It should have a lot less energy consumption because it doesn't have an - a backlight.",
        "It actually - the pixels, in a sense, light up themselves, putting it simply.",
        "But it doesn't have a backlight.",

        "And I don't think there are many people who would spend that much money, although the Sony rep told me they're selling out the ones they're making.",
        "And now, they also are showing a 27-inch one.",
        "And there is talk that in the few years, we'll have much larger ones.",
        "So it's a future technology for all practical purposes, but brilliant display and ultra thin."

        "That's what we have to wait for.",
