        "Both AT&T and Verizon are supporting it.",
        "Right.",
        "So, that may actually get a faster and broader distribution than WiMAX does, and may beat WiMAX to the crunch.",
        "And the other thing is that whether it's WiMAX or LTE, it's probably not going to be the way Wi-Fi is, which is essentially free.",
        "It's not like you're going to set up a little WiMAX node on top of your house and share your Internet connection with your neighbor.",
        "This is going to be controlled by the cellular companies as far as the actual access to the signal is concerned.",
        "But because it's open Internet, it means that other people are free to develop applications on it.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's where it gets very interesting - extremely interesting.",
        "I'm sure Google and many other people are anxious to find ways to exploit this technology.",
