        "And, Monica, what are you planning on working on next, and how far in advance do you go forward and try to plan your projects?",
        "Well, as much as I'd love to plan them in advance, it doesn't always happen that way in this business.",
        "Things come, you know, almost randomly.",
        "I'll get a call from someone because funding has just suddenly come together and they're ready to move forward very quickly.",

        "I need a list, because my project will get a green light if I have the right names…",
        "On the list.",

        "And because it's something that I'm doing constantly, I tend to be aware of who's where and who's available and who's looking for various things.",
        "So I can put something together very, very quickly.",
        "And sometimes I'm given a lot of notice, where someone may come and they're still working on a script and they'll give me an outline or a synopsis.",
        "And it's, you know, very cast-contingent, but it has to be the right person.",
        "So it may be months ahead, or a year ahead, you know, and so I'll start working with it.",
        "I'm looking to do more features, which I've been doing more of for the past few years.",
        "And both independents and studio films, and that's the direction that I want to go in more.",
        "I've done a lot of television; I'm still doing television.",
        "As you said, I do the series All of Us.",
        "And I've cast probably I think about 25 to 30 series over the past few years.",
        "So I - usually like several at a time.",
        "So though that continues to be challenging and I do still enjoy it, I think I can express more creativity in casting in feature work.",
        "You know, I just want to throw in this.",
        "Monica is one of the people you have to honestly, someone like me in Hollywood, you have to bow down to.",
        "Because, first of all, just, you know, a lot of things flow through the front of the camera.",
        "And getting the talent and getting them in the door, and, you know, you look at the people who really drive things, it's the talent.",
        "Monica has said, you know, having an eye for talent.",
        "I'm not, you know, trying to say anything about executives.",
        "A lot of times they don't necessarily have eyes and ears for talent, and you've really got to insist upon this person is talented, this person is really talented.",
        "That's what someone like Monica does.",
        "So for all of us…",

        "I'd still like to see more of us in the room when you go in on shows, and not just because you have to staff a black show with black writers.",

        "Well, I agree with Monica's assessment in general about Hollywood.",
