        "Its houses once grand, now largely crumbling have been home to generations of musicians, artists, and plain hardworking black folks.",
        "Lolis Eric Elie, a columnist with the New Orleans Times-Picayune fell in love with the community after buying a falling down house there.",
        "He and documentary maker Dawn Logsdon turned their lenses on the traditions and characters of the Treme for a new film called, \"\"Foubourg Treme: The Untold Story of Black New Orleans.\"\" They filmed for years before Hurricane Katrina hit and edited their story after the storm.",
        "Lolis joins me now.",
        "Lolis, welcome to News and Notes, nice to have you on.",
        "My pleasure, Tony.",
        "You know, I know that you bought the house in this historic neighborhood in New Orleans back in the '90s and you have a fairly strong attachment to the place - that's an understatement probably, but what was it about the history of this particular corner of New Orleans that compelled you to dig so deep for a film project?",
        "Well, the Faubourg Treme is part of the old city.",
        "It was settled not long after the French Quarter was settled.",
        "So if we're going to talk about the real roots, culturally and politically, it's in this area.",
        "And even before I knew all the history, just looking at this place, I was clear that it was a different part of America and it had a story to tell.",
        "Homer Plessy, I certainly am one of the people among many others who know about the significance of Plessy v.",
        "Ferguson and yet, I had no idea that there was a Homer Plessy and that he was from this neighborhood.",
        "Tell us about the significance of him.",
        "Well, what people also don't understand is that Homer Plessy was a part of a movement that had been taking place into - at least the Civil War to try to bring real democracy in race-blind politics to New Orleans and indeed to the United States.",
        "After Louisiana passed a segregation law which outlawed integration and travel, and this was in the 1890s, the Citizen's Committee decided that they would take Homer Plessy, put him on - in the white section of a car and try to get that case before the Supreme Court.",
        "Well, and we know that the outcome of Plessy v.",
        "Ferguson was the establishment of separate but equal by the United States Supreme Court, which lasted for decades before it was finally overturned.",
        "This neighborhood though, it lost its name later on and became part of the - what was called the notorious Sixth Ward and turned into, literally, a war zone during the crack epidemic.",
        "And then Katrina hit.",
        "How is the community now?",
        "Well, the other blow that happened was they put an interstate through the middle of the neighborhood, and what has happened is that those parts of the neighborhood that are closest to the French Quarter are coming back.",
        "People are moving in, there's some gentrification taking place, but there are also long-time residents redoing their homes.",
        "But as you move further in the direction of the interstate, we find that things are not coming back very rapidly.",
        "But NPR's Joel Rose reports that industry leaders say the accident taught them critical lessons about safety and crisis management."

        "And what it makes me wonder whether there are a lot of Republican incumbents out there who have either drifted away from the party rank and file or the party rank and file have drifted away from the Republican Party.",
        "And if she's only getting 55-60 percent of the Republican - again, this is a state that Bush/Cheney won with 69 percent two years ago - if Barbara Cuban can only get about 60 percent of her Republican Party, and assuming a Democratic - a united Democratic opposition against her won, she could be in trouble in November and so could a lot of other Republicans incumbents."
