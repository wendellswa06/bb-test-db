        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And how about that ringing endorsement you got from the president the other day?",
        "Yeah, it was wonderful, wasn't it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The leaders of the Republican Party keep saying well, you know, the Republican leaders in the state of Connecticut say just stay out of this race.",
        "Yeah, it's just not the way it's been - that's really just not the way it is, and it's unfortunate that basically I got myself into this tsunami of issues that have nothing to do with Connecticut or nothing to do with Connecticut voters.",
        "And here I am just trying to be there for the people, working 20 years on the state and local level, getting the unanimous endorsement of my party, and now find the election at least to this point hijacked by the media and by the White House to be a referendum on the left wing of the Democratic Party taking over and, according to the administration, to be rejected by the mainstream America with the proof of Lieberman getting elected.",
        "As you just highlighted prior to my entrance here, Joe Lieberman is just as liberal as Ned Lamont.",
        "It's Tweedledee and Tweedledum, but they're basically -it's perception is the whole game in politics, as you know, and the perception that's being played is that Lieberman is pro-administration on Iraq, and I don't know what it's going to take for the administration to wake up and see that there's only one candidate that supports them on anything, and that's Alan Schlesinger.",
        "Joe Lieberman continues to spit on George Bush every day, and George Bush stands there and tries to spin it that I guess he needed the rain.",
        "We've all heard, and it's true that politics ain't beanbag(ph), but it -nobody signed up for this kind of abuse.",
        "I mean, your own party.",
        "It's unbelievable.",
        "This is the chance of a lifetime for the Republicans to win the seat.",
        "The last time we won a Senate seat in Connecticut was the identical circumstances with the incumbent not getting the endorsement of his party, having to go independent.",
        "His name was Tom Dodd, Chris Dodd's father.",
        "A liberal Democrat got the Democratic nomination, and the Republican won that year pretty easily, which is the exact same scenario we have now.",
        "Unfortunately, we have a Washington agenda that won't allow for a Republican to come in here and win the day.",
        "And the irony is that the top of the ticket, we have a popular Republican governor who's going to be right next to me.",
        "And we have machine voting in Connecticut; my lever is going to be right next to hers.",
        "All they have to do is support me and I'll be the next United States Senator.",
        "It's pathetic."

        "That's right.",
        "(Unintelligible), I recall - but he also said welcome to America.",
        "And what he did by doing that was basically saying that perhaps a person of color may not be so welcome in the United States or in Virginia.",
        "Somebody who's planning to run for president in 2008, which George Allen clearly is, that's not the kind of smart thing you say.",
        "Biden often reacted to Ryan's statements with disbelief and laughter - or with something like this...",
        "It's the perception that he's with the administration on Iraq.",
        "And every day, Mr. Lieberman moves farther and farther away from Bush's position.",
        "As a matter of fact on Sunday, he recommended the ouster of Donald Rumsfeld.",
        "Every day, he moves farther from Bush, and Bush just kind of like tries to hug him like a Sumo wrestler.",
        "And the administration tries to do this, whereas they have a supporter over here that all they have to do is embrace me and I'll win the race for them.",
        "And I'll be a guy who's here for Connecticut and here for solid Republican fiscally responsible principles.",
        "It's not like I am an ogre.",
        "I'm a nice guy, I think.",
        "Most people think I'm a nice guy.",
        "I've been elected nine times by very large margins, as much as 81 percent of the vote.",
        "If Washington would allow me to get my message out, I'll win the election and they'll have a very nice Republican Senator who is level-headed, who has a financial background from the Wharton School of Finance who can do a lot of work on the federal budget, steering us away from a massive glacier that we're about to hit with the baby-boom retiring.",
        "And all they want to do is play politics and footsie on Iraq, and it's pathetic.",
        "You know, you blame the Washington Republican establishment, but even when Joe Lieberman was considered a clear winner in November you had Republicans in Connecticut like Chris Shays who endorsed Lieberman even when you were already in the race and Lamont was just an asterisk.",
        "No, actually Chris Shays attempted to get Lieberman on the Republican line, and Lieberman…",
        "That's not an endorsement?",
        "No, that was before I was involved.",
        "Okay.",
        "I wasn't even involved, so it had nothing to do with me.",
        "None of this has anything to do with me.",
        "That's what's so frustrating, is that this is all to do with Washington's spin about the future of the Democrat Party and the rejection of voters of the future of the Democrat Party rather than electing a Senator in Connecticut."

        "Once people focus after Labor Day on the election and we have some debates, even though they basically made it very difficult for me to raise any money, if I can get my message out in the debates and then I can get some folks supporting me from all parts of the spectrum - Democrat, Republican and unaffiliated - I'll get my message out, we cut some great television spots, I think people are going to respond very comfortably to my message, and they'll say hey, why aren't they talking about Schlesinger.",

        "Here's an e-mail, Ken, that we got from Jen(ph) in Traverse City, Michigan.",
        "Regarding the Democratic caucuses, primaries, and the changing of the order of them for the presidential primary, why can't we just have a national primary on the same day?",
        "It seems unfair for people in some states to have so much more influence than others in the selection of the presidential candidate.",
        "The long primary season really seems like an anachronism.",
        "I think what Jen is talking about is that the Democratic Party - first of all, since 1972, the schedule started out with Iowa, followed by New Hampshire and then all the other states.",
        "The Democratic Party just inserted to more states: Nevada in between Iowa and New Hampshire, and South Carolina right after New Hampshire.",
        "Basically the point is that they want - first of all, Iowa and New Hampshire are lily-white states with very little union representation.",
        "Nevada and South Carolina bring the voters of color.",
        "To have a national primary though - the lure of Iowa and New Hampshire has always been that, theoretically at least, a candidate without billions of dollars in his wallet or her wallet can go and meet the people, meet the people one on one and not have to have a national, multi-million-dollar media campaign and fat-cat consultants.",
        "You can reach the voters one on one.",
        "If you have a national primary, you're going to have to have $100 million, $200 million even before the first vote is cast.",
        "So theoretically, the allure and the attractiveness of a small state like Iowa or New Hampshire, and now Nevada, is that you don't have to have tons of money to make yourself relevant."

        "Until very recently, Webb has been trailing Allen considerably.",
        "It seems that due to the so-called macaca incident, Webb is gaining - we talked about macaca last wee on the show - however, because of Webb's Reagan-friendly military background, I've been surprised that he didn't catch up to Allen sooner and for more substantial reasons.",
        "Can you give us a picture of the Senate race down there?",
