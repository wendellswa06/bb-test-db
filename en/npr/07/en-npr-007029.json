        "Mr. Treviene had moved to Vermont to be with his daughter and granddaughter.",
        "So they drove back to see the house, and even before we went in the house he noticed that his truck had been flooded and that his tools were gone.",
        "And it was difficult to get into the house because the door had been swollen by the water.",
        "You have to understand; at this point Mr. Treviene was in his late 70's.",
        "This is a man who is used to building houses and repairing houses, and had been a younger man that might have been a challenge to him.",
        "But as an older man who was basically retired before the storm, this was an insurmountable challenge and so much of his story is the story of elderly New Orleanians."

        "One of the things that is very difficult to convey to outsiders is the extent to which heartbreak played such a physical, tangible role in people's decline after the storm, and that certainly people had ailments that may have been bothering them even before the storm, but it seemed that the psychological and emotional toll of the failure of the levees really was that much more exacerbated.",
