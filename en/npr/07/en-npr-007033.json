        "From your research, what are the circumstances that would have fed into people who have spent decades or even a lifetime in France staging this kind of attack?",
        "Well, I think you have to keep in mind that France is the largest source of recruits for the Islamic State in Western Europe in part because it has the largest Muslim minority.",
        "There are over 5 million Muslims in France.",
        "But if you look at per capita and the number of recruits and foreign fighters who have actually traveled to Syria and Iraq, France is not doing any worse than the U.K.",
        "or the Netherlands.",
        "In fact, it's doing better than some of the smaller countries, like Norway or Ireland, which send more per capita.",
        "Islam is a relatively recently-arrived religion in France.",
        "The labor migrants who arrived in the 1960s and 1970s really only settled in the 1980s and 1990s, so there are basic infrastructural deficiencies.",

        "There aren't enough religious schools.",
        "There certainly aren't enough imams who know the circumstances of France and the way of daily life.",
        "Now, there are things that the government is doing that and has been for really almost 10 or 15 years.",
        "But these are long-term processes.",
        "Wait, wait, help me understand that for a second.",
        "You're saying that there aren't enough prayer spaces.",
        "Why would that contribute to the radicalization of young people?",
        "Because they're not - you're saying the only people they're hearing from are radicals?",
        "Is that it?",
        "Well, in part, there was a reluctance to embrace Islam as a national religion.",
        "It was always seen as an immigrant religion.",
        "And during that period, there was a vacuum.",
        "And that vacuum was filled by many Islamist movements.",
        "And so when European countries, including France, were deciding to what extent they were willing to include Islam in their national institutions, other countries and other movements were taking up that space.",
        "Well, I certainly think that it was a planned response that for an event - an occasion such as that, the president doesn't come on and do everything off the cuff that - it was Richard Nixon who said that no speech requires more careful planning than an off-the-cuff remark.",
        "So he knew that this offer had come out, this, well, supposed offer from Donald Trump to produce these documents and he would give this money to charity.",
        "And to meet such an offer with seriousness would give credence to Trump's offer.",
        "So by meeting it with humor, it makes Trump look ridiculous, and particularly invoking a subject such as, you know, being born in Kenya and Trump and others championing of the birther idea.",
        "It engages that idea head-on and says, I can take the joke, I can dismiss it.",
        "This is all ridiculous.",
        "And we're all grownups here, not those other...",
        "Correct.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that is a - one of the classic purposes of presidential humor, to rise above the controversy.",
        "Certainly, and it's an idea that goes back in - and not only in presidential humor but in political humor generally, even Cicero writes of it in - as one of the main functions of rhetorical humor, is to dismiss criticisms while maintaining your likability and credibility.",
        "We don't have any tape of Cicero."

        "Well, yes.",

        "Yes.",
        "Well, actually in that book, which is very entertaining, in that, he's not even portrayed as using humor as much as he did, that it was a central part, I think, really of both Lincoln's being and his ability to persuade was his use of humor.",
        "And we just don't portray him that way historically.",
        "And his use of humor in a very special way, of course, he came from very home-spun circumstances.",
        "He was, people say, the first president to build the log cabin in which he was born.",
        "Certainly.",

        "And one who - he obviously read voraciously, not having formal schooling.",
        "And one of his favorite areas to read in was humor.",
        "And he was often criticized, particularly during the Civil War, that even people who were his friends and supporters would say, you know, why are you making jokes?",
        "Why do you read - for instance by Artemus Ward, who was a notable humorist at the time.",
        "And he said, if I didn't laugh, I should cry - that it's what kept him going.",

        "There are more than 50 instances of laughter from the audience.",
        "And while laughter doesn't necessarily guarantee that there was a moment of intentional humor, it likely points to one, and so he frequently used it.",
        "That in one exchange where Douglas presented his argument that each state should decide the slavery question for himself, Lincoln said that his argument was as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "It's a bit long of a quip for today's media, but the audience there certainly seemed to enjoy it.",
        "And similarly, you cite John Fitzgerald Kennedy, of course, the son of enormous wealth, who had, you know, his father was extremely wealthy, and used an appearance at the Gridiron Dinner to undercut that impression.",
        "Well, not undercut, but to acknowledge it.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's - he's not going to be able to dismiss the idea.",
        "He can't say, oh, my father isn't wealthy and powerful.",
        "That would be - that would in itself be ridiculous.",
        "Instead, he used intentional rhetorical humor to say, I acknowledge the criticism.",
        "And the moment came in 1958 when he was running for re-election to the Senate.",
        "He was certainly thinking two years ahead to running to the presidency.",
        "After hearing jokes all night about his father's influence, he pulled the piece of paper from his pocket, pretending - he said I've just a received a telegram from my generous daddy.",
        "And he said that the telegram read: Dear Jack, Don't buy a single vote more than is necessary.",
