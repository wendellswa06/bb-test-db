        "And it's kind of like the same thing.",
        "(Laughter) It's not that clear outside.",
        "Is this simply about the revenue that the brand brings in; simply about the money that a big-time college football program nets for a university to pay for other expenses?",
        "Well, it's more of a value that's just not put on the monetary aspect of it.",
        "And I think we have overvalued the impact of athletics on higher learning.",
        "I think now we're starting to see many more potential negative repercussions of, for example, the cost of running athletics programs, the arms race that many departments are participating in.",
        "And, frankly, most of these athletic departments run huge deficits that have to be repaid some way, that are usually repaid in the form of student fees or other subsidies within the university.",
        "So, we have to look and say is it all worth it or can we run athletics economically sound, and still have it be a very vibrant and effective part of the university?",
        "And I believe we can, even if athletic programs were run economically sound, you still would have the connection to the university, alums being able to come back and cheer on old State U.",
        "We just need to realize that the purpose of athletics on a college campus is to maintain a clear line of demarcation between amateur and professional athletics.",
        "It's supposed to be students playing it as an extracurricular vocation.",

        "Well, good question, Steve.",
        "I think a lot of people here are trying to work out the details of that, and that's really the big question as Mr. Brown goes into talks with President Obama.",
        "He has been talking about some of these very grandiose schemes, you know, echoing FDR's New Deal of the 1930s and the global depression then.",
        "We know that he wants to look very closely at all sorts of financial issues like the regulation of banks and the more detailed international regulation of banks, which has been one of the problems over the last few months.",
        "He wants more of a role for the International Monetary Fund to help poor countries who are hit by this economic downturn.",
        "But really, I think one of the key issues today is to try and put some of the meat, if you like, onto those bones and onto the rhetoric, which has been quite high and mighty, if you like.",
        "But we haven't really seen the details yet.",
        "Well, let me ask you one question about that, Rob Gifford.",
        "This is a guy who is an economic expert who was Britain's equivalent of a finance minister before he became prime minister.",
        "But, of course, Britain has had its own economic troubles.",
        "Is he seen as somebody with the moral authority to lead the world to some better place in the economy?",
        "Well, in Britain, that depends which side of the political divide you're on.",
        "Of course, the opposition, the conservative party is saying he was one of the reasons we got into this mess in the first place because of his deregulation during the '90s during the Blair years, and allowing the boom to go on too long and too far.",
        "But I think even his detractors say that he knows something about the economy.",
        "He's got a PhD.",
        "He's ferociously intelligent.",
        "And at the end of last year, it was he who was the first global leader to really say we need to step in with a government bailout.",
        "We need to come in and backup the banks, which is indeed what the United States then followed up and did.",
        "So I think he knows what he's talking about.",
        "And as I say, it will be just about getting some of those details for the little guy, the guy on the ground who can't pay his mortgage.",
        "That's the thing that people are looking for now, not the highfalutin language which makes him look good on the world stage.",
