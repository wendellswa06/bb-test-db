        "And they have a program to do, among other things, count the number of homicides by the police - called justifiable homicides by the FBI.",

        "What are the consequences of that lack of transparency, especially when it comes to dealing with the community - dealing with public trust?",
        "I think the major problem is that when citizens wish to get information about all sorts of things about government, they can theoretically get it - you know, how much this state spends on education versus that state - how many people died in traffic accidents - this, that and the other thing.",
        "It's all there.",
