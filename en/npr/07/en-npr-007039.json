        "The numbers are small, but it's been going on for a generation; and researchers say it's been accelerating in recent years.",

        "The fact that I know two other people in my circle of friends who've been diagnosed with breast cancer under 40, is amazing.",
        "I mean, it's just - it's ridiculous, to me, in an otherwise very healthy population.",
        "One of the other women was Dr. Rebecca Johnson, who was diagnosed at the age of 27.",
        "She's now a pediatric cancer specialist at Seattle Children's Hospital.",
        "She kept in touch with Alison Henning after she moved to Seattle, and she wondered about the bigger picture.",

        "Well, that's a very real concern within the Israeli security establishment especially.",
        "They are very nervous about explosives and weapons and material for rockets coming in from the Egyptian side.",
        "There's also a great deal of skepticism about the Egyptian claims that they're not allowing any weapons into Gaza.",
        "I think if there are fresh arms getting in, we may see militants using them in the coming days and weeks.",
        "And that would very likely be followed by Israeli military action either inside Gaza or, I suppose, possibly along the border.",
        "And that would be very tricky because of the presence of the Egyptian border guards there.",

        "Welcome.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "So we should first say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border - more than 2,000 of them have been reunited with their families.",
        "But it has been four months since the court order.",
        "Why are 245 children still in custody?",
        "Yeah, that's the question, right?",
        "You know, obviously this should have never happened to begin with, and it should never have taken this long for the reunifications.",
        "I think one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children, and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start till about six weeks after the court order.",
        "And where are these children being held right now, these 245 children that are still in custody?",
        "They are being held in government facilities all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are.",
        "I would say of the 245, a number - about 125 - are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them.",
        "And that's because we've reached the parents, and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S.",
        "not because they don't love the child, not because they don't desperately want the child back with them.",
        "But what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back."

        "OK.",
