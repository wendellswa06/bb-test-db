        "Well, I think the case of the underwear bomber in December, is a perfect example of how both the system works and doesn't work.",
        "We see an example here, of the vast apparatus of the U.S.",
        "intelligence community collecting bits of information in Yemen and elsewhere.",
        "They had many hints that this was going on, but in the end, it just wasn't able to communicate that, to analyze it in such a way, to put it together, so that the Homeland Security apparatus or the law enforcement apparatus was able to actually interdict the person before he got on the plane.",
        "And it wasn't until a passenger - a watchful passenger, noticed - that the attack was thwarted.",
        "And I think that it not only shows then, therefore, how we really are, a decade later, in a situation where we haven't solved the problem of sharing information, of connecting the dots, of having all the various, disparate parts of the government work together.",
        "But also at the same time, all of the evidence leads us to believe that not enough is being done, either to oversee this apparatus or to reform it.",
        "And the sound of that door opening and closing signal the arrival of Dana Priest?",
        "Hi there.",

        "We're talking about the case of the underpants bomber, on Detroit, and how it illustrated both the good and bad side of what's been going on.",
        "The way you described it in the article, the information was there, provided, but buried within a flood of information, and the people responsible for looking at it, well, nobody could figure out who was responsible for looking at it."

        "That's right.",
        "It's not just the flood, because certainly there's that sort of deluge of information all over, but really, the point here was the National Counterterrorism Center was set up specifically to be at the top of the heap, the best of the bunch.",
        "And yet when it came to flushing out every clue down to its last potential, they dropped the ball.",
        "And they did that, not because, you know, they're bad people, they did it because they thought somebody else was probably doing it.",
        "And so the size of the system has started to blur the responsibility within the system.",
        "And the Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, said this point to Congress when he testified.",
        "But that's sort of what's happened in other parts, too.",
        "Cybersecurity is one of them, where there's just way too many people in that mix, and nobody knows exactly who's in charge, and people aren't taking advantage of what others are doing in order to not repeat what they have already done, but to go deeper and further.",
        "And there are, for obvious reasons, a lot of people you talked to who asked that their names not be used, which you accepted, but there was one general, the former head of intelligence at CENTCOM, General Custer, who told you that he went up to that National Counterterrorism Center and said you guys - I've been in charge of, you know, running two wars, and you've never given me one scrap of information that's helped.",
        "He was quite passionate in his interview with me about what he thought of Washington and this huge apparatus.",
        "And, you know, he even told me that story that you just said.",
        "He needed all he could get, all the help he could get, and he found himself relying on his own people - which is fine if that's enough - but after all, there is this huge bureaucracy doing intelligence analysis in Washington, and he expected it to produce something, and it was very frustrating to him that it did not.",
        "And Bill Arkin, there was another example, and this involved the Fort Hood shooter, the alleged Fort Hood shooter, who was acting strangely at Walter Reed, where he was a psychiatrist, and there was an Army intelligence unit not far up the road that was not looking, however, at people acting strangely within the United States Army, but doing things that seven other agencies and I'm probably being too low on that estimate were already doing?",
        "You know, we use the 25-mile example because the premier military intelligence organization responsible for counterintelligence is at Fort Mead, Maryland.",
        "But the reality, Neal, is that even right there at Walter Reed, you know, his superiors, who were well-aware of many of his activities and many of his thoughts, really were not, you know, were not themselves able to input that information into a system that was methodical.",
        "In a way, it's a really a better example, I think, of how a lack of direction and a lack of true mission, a sort of let's each of the individual agencies decide for themselves what their priorities are going to be.",
        "And so here we have a case of someone who is actually in the Army, who has pretty much given up all of his rights, civil rights, of scrutiny.",
        "You join the Army, and your expectation is that someone is going to be looking over your shoulder and looking at your loyalty to the country, and even more."

        "Well, it is the DNI's job, but the Congress didn't give him the authority to actually do that job in a way that I think most Americans think they did.",
        "He doesn't have budget power over much of the Defense Department, which has two-thirds of all the intel that goes on within its department.",
        "And more than that, though, I mean, I think the DNI has made some progress in intelligence-sharing and standardizing certain practices and getting people to talk more together.",
        "But at the same time, the system just got so much bigger, and it seems to have overwhelmed the progress that was being made.",
        "We'll have hearings tomorrow with Jim Clapper, the new nominee for that position, and I'm sure that, you know, this question of size and coordination will come up.",
        "Well, until and unless he is confirmed, the acting director of national intelligence, David Gompert, wrote a response to your piece today, saying that U.S.",

        "The fact that there were only a few high-profile terrorist attacks and attempts recently means they are doing a good job, that the picture you paint is not the intelligence community that we know, as he put it.",
        "Well, first of all, we asked them to share with us anything they could, plots that were foiled that we could put in the paper because we didn't have many examples.",

        "You know, they're always worried about giving away too much.",

        "Well, you know, personal ego comes into everything in the world, and it certainly comes into this realm, as well.",

        "It makes sure that nobody from the outside can penetrate it with any kind of technical means.",
