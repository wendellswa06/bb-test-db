        "Right.",
        "So in that sense, I think, you know, for me it was kind of a waste of money and time, although I'm happy to have it on my record because it kind of shows that I've been at least vetted thoroughly once, you know, for future jobs.",
        "Anyway...",

        "Well, you know, I started only about nine months before 9/11.",

        "But you did top secret.",
        "But there are levels above that, as well, including something called SAR.",

        "So SAPs, or special access programs, as they're called, are the Defense Department's most sensitive programs.",
        "There are intelligence SAPs.",
        "There are technical SAPs.",
        "There are operational SAPs.",

        "And we were talking about the role, the idea of visibility.",
        "Can you see into the SAP world and just, can you see all the SAPs that there are?",
        "Because I had been told by more than a couple people that this was an issue, that it was hard to get visibility on these very special programs.",
        "And he came back and said there's only one entity in the universe that has visibility on all these SAPs, and that's god.",
        "And I said: Can I put that on the record?",
        "Because we were speaking on background.",
        "And he said: I don't know why not.",
        "Nobody's going to disagree with me.",

        "Bill Arkin, the national security apparatus was not small, as Mike points out, before 9/11, but I think you just hundreds of agencies that were either created or reorganized afterwards.",
        "Well, there are very many fundamental ways in which the national security apparatus of the United States has changed since 9/11.",
        "It is fundamental, Neal.",
        "First and foremost is the growth of ad hoc organizations, a whole new set of organizations superimposed upon existing agencies.",
        "And many of those new organizations are compartmented or work on their own or are not tied into the overall system, and that's one of the problems that we discovered."

        "And if so, can you talk a little more about that?",
        "I know tomorrow's article focuses on that, but Dana Priest, today's article pointed out not just doing the tasks that Bill Arkin was just talking about but all the air-conditioner repairmen, the landscapers, indeed the janitors, need top secret clearance.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Once you start that ball rolling, you get a whole lot of other people come on board because once you make a site secure like that, anybody that goes in and out of it, anybody who cleans it, anybody who builds it, even, there are architects that need top secret clearances.",
        "It just becomes a network, if you will, of support.",

        "And I'm sure that hasn't changed.",
        "And back in 1947, there was OSS and Army, all these various intelligence agencies whose efforts needed to be coordinated.",
        "Coordinated was vested in a new agency called the Central Intelligence Agency.",
        "And that was led by the director of central intelligence, whose job it was to coordinate all the intelligence work.",
        "Now, instead of dealing with the very turf-sensitive environment there, we've installed a director of national intelligence to coordinate the work of the director of Central Intelligence and the other agencies.",
        "I'm frankly pessimistic, over.",
        "Well, the idea was, I think, as I recall the argument, Dana Priest, that the director of Central Intelligence had enough to do directing the Central Intelligence Agency, and that given all this growth that we needed somebody else and a new agency to overlook all this different agencies and do the work previously done by the director of Central Intelligence.",

        "That definitely has improved, but the turf battles for money in particular, I think, are very tense.",
        "People tend - maybe this is just the nature of bureaucracies, never do want to cut down and be smaller, always to want to grow.",
        "And then, when you put in there the profit motive of corporations - not to criticize that, that's, you know, the American way.",
        "But when it's in a closed system that no one can see, that people can't judge and say, well, hey, you know, you gave that contract away for so much more money and it's a sole source contract.",
        "It just makes - it makes it harder to make sure the system is doing the right thing.",
