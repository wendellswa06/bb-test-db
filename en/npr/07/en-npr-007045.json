        "Indeed.",
        "I think, Neal, that we've seen in all the evidence that we've collected and all of the interviews that we've done and the extensive material which we've put online at topsecretamerica.com, that this is a system of tremendous duplication.",

        "government officials to argue at this point that these are necessary redundancies is really ridiculous.",
        "I mean, we have found just pockets of the same exact work being done in a wide variety of agencies.",
        "And why is that work done?",
        "Because that's what's hot.",
        "And when something gets hot, when it's of national importance, when it gets the interest of Congress, then the money flows.",
        "And so, if a counter IED is countering improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq becomes the hot issue, I'm not saying that we shouldn't solve the problem.",
        "But what the reality is, is that the bureaucracy and the private sector respond with a vengeance, building their own intelligence, building their own capabilities, building their own investigators, building their own networks, building their own organizations because that's where the money is going.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE)",
        "I don't know who decided...",
        "And the day-to-day intelligence suffers as these new ad hoc organizations are created.",
        "And we saw examples of that again and again and again where people would say to us, well, such and such is hot and so therefore we have to now take what we're doing and rename it something else in order to get enough money to do what we want to do.",

        "It's the government that grants top secret clearances.",
        "The company can't just invent itself and say it's top secret.",
        "So today, we wanted to give an overview of \"\"Top Secret America,\"\" its size and its scope: 1,271 government entities that we have classified in 45 different groupings and 1,931 private sector companies in America that do top-secret work for these government organizations.",
        "And tomorrow, we'll go into some greater detail about those companies and highlight one in particular that has become one of the powerhouses of the so-called services sector, General Dynamics."
