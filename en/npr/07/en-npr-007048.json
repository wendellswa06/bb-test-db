        "Nigeria has a popularly elected government.",
        "And from reading your article, they appear to have done very little here.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "The aptly named Goodluck Jonathan has his work cut out for him.",
        "Obviously since the time - since independence, they've been run largely by military dictators.",
        "So - and there hasn't really been a lot of effort to either respond to the spills, listen to the people or return some of the vast amounts of money which have been got from the oil production.",
        "Six hundred billion dollars so far.",
        "And kind of return that back to the people in any way.",
        "And that's where we've seen a real kind of anger and, you know, uprising amongst a lot of Nigerian people.",
        "There's a lot of terrorists now.",
        "There's an independence movement that's engaging a lot of sabotage and kidnapping.",
        "I just think, just for so long there was such a discrepancy in terms of wealth and the ongoing oil problems that now, you know, it's a complete disaster for a lot of the oil companies, and even functioning there.",
        "You mentioned the resistance movement and the secessionist movement and terrorism.",
        "That is indeed the source of some of these spills.",
        "Yes, well, that's right.",
        "And how much are the source is under dispute.",
        "It's obviously growing.",
        "You know, according to an Amnesty International report from last year, up until the mid-1990s, companies were saying, look, about roughly 50 percent, yes, it's our fault.",
        "It's due to corrosion, infrastructure problems, all those kinds of things.",
        "Now what is the dispute now is how much of it actually due to sabotage.",
        "We know it's a problem.",
        "The companies are saying it's about 80 percent.",
        "A lot of the Amnesty workers on the ground found that some things were being called sabotage when there was actually parts falling apart and so on.",
        "But I do think that, you know, if sabotage is an issue and, obviously - I mean, it's a terribly violent atmosphere for a lot of oil workers to be operating in - then the companies need to actually have ways of responding to sabotage attempts very quickly, you know, if not kind of putting up - you know, putting things in that it would prevent them in the first place.",
        "So I think they kind of have to - instead of being victims of sabotage, they need to actually address that aggression more assertively themselves.",
        "Wouldn't the protection be the responsibility of the government?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "But would regulation be the responsibility of the government?",
        "I mean, absolutely.",
        "I mean, I think they need to be working together.",
        "I mean, part of the problem is is that the regulatory agencies which have been looking after, you know, the monitoring of the situation and the spills has been reasonably toothless.",
        "And effectively, a lot of the companies are left to regulate themselves.",
        "Yes, you'd think they would work in concert with the government to deal with the violence.",
        "But, you know, then they obviously also need to be responding very quickly to the spills as they happen.",
        "I mean, the sabotage that we've - the companies are claiming that the production went down by 20-odd percent between 2006 and 2009 due to sabotage efforts alone.",
        "So it is a very real problem.",
        "You're saying that if the oil companies are effectively a law unto themselves and regulate themselves, they ought to be the order unto themselves too, and provide for that as well?"
