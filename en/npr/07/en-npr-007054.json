        "Neural crest cells are an embryonic population of cells that have the same ability to make fat, bone, cartilage, nerve, and as a consequence of the similarities between the two cell types, we found that indeed the cells that exist around the vessels, these stem cell-like, the stem cells that exist around the vessels, look like neural crest cells.",

        "And using that kind of approach, we are able to show that they are indeed stem cells.",
