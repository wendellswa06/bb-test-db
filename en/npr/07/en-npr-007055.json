        "And this is where our collaboration is going.",
        "And Song has developed a number of techniques to rapidly screen drugs that will specifically target these cells and not the cells that line a blood vessel, called the endothelial cells, so sparing one cell and targeting the other for therapy.",
        "But stem cells are all over the body, are they not?",
        "Could you target the wrong kinds of stem cells if you just...",
        "Absolutely, that's certainly a concern.",
        "And so it's lucky that they are spatially restricted, so we know exactly where they reside.",
        "If one were to think about targeting, you'd have to take into account that sort of spatial component.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Now, with the discovery that stem cells cause heart disease and hardening of the arteries, would they not be good candidates for other things that go wrong?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Right.",
        "So instead of now - now, of course, the therapies for treating hardening of the arteries or narrowing of the blood vessels are mostly procedures that physically widen the inside of the blood vessel or else replace the damaged by grafting.",
        "Like a stent or something like that.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So there may be an opportunity here to think about regenerating the correctly formed kind of stem cells that reside around the blood vessels.",
        "And would they - would they be able to replace the damaged ones, if they regenerate?",
        "Well, of course that's still in the future, but I think that that's definitely a feasible option.",
        "And as far as things that are not concerned with the heart, other illnesses, could stem cells - let me just throw out a few illnesses.",
        "Could they be involved in arthritis or something else like that, and we don't know that yet, you know?"

        "And so if we understand what normally regulates a stem cell's behavior, then we gain some crucial insights into what regulates maybe a cancer cell's behavior.",
        "It's that kind of approach that I think that CIRM is largely funding initiatives to try to target human diseases, the big ones, and the ones that make us all sort of quake in our shoes, and attempt to come up with new therapies.",
