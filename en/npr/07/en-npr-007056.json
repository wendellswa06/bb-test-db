        "I find this very interesting.",
        "I actually used to do a little bit of research myself in atherosclerosis and diabetes.",
        "And we kind of looked at things from a higher - kind of a higher outlook.",
        "And I wonder what your thoughts were on, with the stem cells actually congregating and proliferating there, why would they actually be going there, and would you believe this to be part of this theory that inflammation in of itself, that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and that is really the root cause is actually lifestyle, eating behaviors and lack of activity in general that's causing our body to react in an inflammatory manner?",
        "All right, Gina, thanks.",
        "Wow, that's a great question.",
        "What causes them to get to the site of injury or where the injury happens and what activates them if they're already there?",
        "And inflammation, as the caller pointed out, is a key feature of a lot of kinds of diseases, including this one.",
        "And so it may well play a role.",
        "The difficulty is that most mouse models or animal models that try to sort of test the contributions of the immune system, we can only knock out certain parts of the immune system.",
        "It's very hard to collectively say it's due to an immune response or an inflammatory response.",
        "But it's clearly on the shortlist of the causes that lead to the activation of these cells.",
        "You know, whenever you come up with a sort of paradigm-shifting idea, like this seems to be, there's great resistance to accept it.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But sometimes, I think scientists recognize - it's sort of the aha, right?",
        "Oh, it's like, I guess, yeah, if you look hard, sure enough, there they are.",
        "So I think it is - there is resistance oftentimes, but there can be moments where there's great clarity.",
        "And I think Song's work certainly falls within that category."

        "Maybe this is not a good time for this kind of agreements because there is going to be a change of administrations coming right?",
        "Do the Americans want a long term agreement or an interim agreement until whoever takes over in January?",
        "Well, they want an interim agreement but they're not really looking at this as one administration to the other.",
        "Obviously that is the political reality on the ground, but they are trying to hammer out something that will work even with the transition in our own government here that's coming up in a few months.",
        "And so - but there will be key points.",
        "I mean the key point that they have to agree upon is under what conditions do American troops stay?",
        "And certainly what the Iraqis want to see is that they want some sort of time frame for withdrawal.",
        "And the White House last week did make some sort of concession in that regard with President Bush saying that he did agree to what they're calling a time horizon, but they don't want to be pinned down to a date for two reasons."
