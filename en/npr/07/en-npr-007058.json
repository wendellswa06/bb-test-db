        "First, the Egyptian military retains power over major foreign policy moves.",
        "And second, the Muslim Brotherhood doesn't support Tehran's regional ambitions any more than the military does.",
        "If we start getting too close to Iran, we're going to antagonize the Gulf and the Trans-Atlantic at once.",
        "And again, it's not in our best interest that Iran acquires a nuclear weapon at any cost.",
        "Persian Gulf analyst Mustafa al-Ani, at the Geneva-based Gulf Research Center, says if Egypt wants to normalize diplomatic ties with Iran that's one thing.",
        "But any move to ally itself with Tehran will cost Egypt something it can't afford to lose - the financial backing of wealthy Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia.",
        "Another source of anxiety surrounding Egypt's new president is the rising profile of the Muslim Brotherhood around the region.",
        "The Brotherhood-influenced Hamas runs the Gaza Strip, and the Syrian Muslim Brothers are a powerful component of the rebellion against the regime in Damascus.",
        "The Brothers are a noticeable presence in Kuwait, and are causing serious concern among the rulers of Jordan, the other Arab state to have a peace treaty with Israel.",
        "Veteran Egyptian analyst Abdel Monem Saeed says it's ironic that Jordan's King Abdullah, who a decade ago warned of an Iranian-led Shiite crescent of power forming in the Middle East, is now worried about the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "Saeed believes what Jordan is really concerned about is an Arab Spring uprising against a monarchy that refuses to enact political reforms.",

        "ABDEL MONEM SAEED: That did not happen in Jordan.",
        "And King Abdullah, he has an anxiety about the Muslim Brothers in cooperation.",
        "Because the model we got is actually revolutions are made by youth, by discontent, and then the Muslim Brothers come with their organizational, financial abilities to the fore.",
        "But Saeed and other analysts agree that if there is to be a rise of the Brothers, Egypt won't have much of a role in it anytime soon.",

        "I mean, those are two things that have boosted momentum, have probably boosted the morale of our troops, and have made the county feel as if we're in control of this thing.",

        "Getting al-Zarqawi was just one thing, and it's like there's someone else who's coming to replace him.",

        "The Campaign for America's Future Conference, Take Back the Future, that met here in Washington earlier this week, Hillary was booed because she does not support a time certain to move the troops.",
