        "You know, we are at a decision point, a crucial decision point.",
        "And we have two options.",
        "One, we can continue and to finish what we started in Iraq.",
        "If that's the course of action that we select, we need a strategy.",
        "It's not more of the same.",
        "But leadership and a strategy that is communicated to the American people in such a way that we all understand the what and the why.",
        "You know, this nation in the past four years has not been mobilized for war.",
        "I'll tell you, when I came back from Germany in June and July of 2005, I was absolutely stunned that it was business as usual back home.",
        "Now, remember, I had been gone for three years.",
        "But I was absolutely stunned, as was my family and those around that were deployed with us, were stunned that when we got home this country was not mobilized for war.",
        "Beyond the occasional bumper sticker and certainly people who were sending care packages and supporting troops that they knew, perhaps family members, beyond that there was nothing.",
        "There was no national level mobilization.",
        "There was no rationing system of any sort.",
        "I don't think that's the way that you prosecute a war.",

        "We're spilling American blood in amounts that outrage me.",

        "Julianne, if you look at young voters, especially young voters of color, you find large numbers of independent voters; but because there are very few third parties or independent parties, most of those folks don't vote.",
        "Should there be more of an effort to reach out and get those people involved?",
        "And do you get any sense - obviously, we're still quite a ways off from the 2006 election, but with the House in play and the Senate possibly in play, do you get any sense that people are trying to reach these skeptical young voters?",
        "I think there are small efforts, business I don't think they're significant enough, Farai.",
        "There are some young people, I think, who are doing phenomenal things, and there are some who are connected with the Democratic Party and with the Republican Party.",
        "But, as you say, the key thing is that young voters - almost half of them - are registering as independents.",

        "But I think I do because I care about educational quality, and that's one of the issues where Dems are losing.",
        "For example, young African-Americans, young people who are not looking at ideology, but how does politics affect the day-to-day aspects of my life?",
        "And so I think that we've really got to get those folks involved in the practical aspects of politics, and I don't see Democrats spending enough time, effort, energy or money in that.",
        "The community that I think is interesting, Farai, is the blogging community, which skews young.",
        "And I think that some of the things, like what's his name - Daily Cosis(ph) in his early 30's...",
        "Marcus Malitsis(ph).",
        "Yeah, dailycosis.com(ph).",
        "But there's only one very noted African-American blogger and that's Chris Rabb at AfroNetizen, and so - but I think that that blogging community sort of speaks to young people's alienation with the way we do politics."

        "But it is a disturbing trend that seems to me if young African-Americans - or for that matter, anybody who's young - who doesn't understand the context of history and the movement for public education - charter schools mostly are public schools - but there are an increasing number of young people who believe in vouchers, who do not understand the notion and the concept of the separation of church and state, for example.",

        "Don't ask the public, the taxpayers, to pay for your child to go to a private a school or a religious school.",
        "Well, you know, one thing that that raises a question is, who's money is it?",
        "And I think it eventually becomes the money of the individual, and the individual taxpayer should have some say in how their tax dollars are spent.",
