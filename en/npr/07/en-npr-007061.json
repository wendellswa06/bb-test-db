        "Yeah, of course.",
        "Can you just please bring us up to date on what we know of the events of the day for those who are just joining us?",
        "Sure.",
        "So this morning around 8:40 there was an incident near the corner of Airline Highway and Old Hammond Highway here in Baton Rouge.",
        "Three officers are dead, two Baton Rouge Police officers and one officer from the sheriff's department for East Baton Rouge Parish here.",
        "The shooter is also dead, Gavin Eugene Long, who's believed to be from Missouri.",
        "And at a press conference a few hours ago, it was said that it's no longer an active shooting situation in that area.",
        "So the police are now - it's a crime scene, essentially.",
        "Two other people were detained, but there's no confirmation that had anything to do with this situation yet.",
        "We noted earlier, you know, that President Obama, the governor of Louisiana, a number of the other public officials - the mayor of Baton Rouge who spoke at the press conference you referenced earlier that you attended - made very specific appeals for calm and for unity and really implored the public not to allow this incident to divide the community further.",
        "Can you shed a little light on what exactly they're talking about?",
        "And why were they so explicit in those appeals?",
        "Well, again, last week same time, same day, on Sunday - same room, there was another press conference, and it was a very different tone.",
        "It was about the protests that had been going on since the death of Alton Sterling.",
        "And it was a much more contentious scene.",
        "Just listening to Mr. Pitts, I was reminded of a quote from last week from Baton Rouge Police Department Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. who said my officers are human.",
        "They're tired.",
        "They're scared.",
        "There are things that happen on those lines.",
        "That was really the one emotional thing that was said last week at that press conference, and it really looms large today in thinking about what's happened.",
        "What else can you tell us, if anything, about what that atmosphere has been in Baton Rouge in these recent days that - when you've been covering this story?"

        "It's really difficult to get to different parts of town right now, so people are trying to avoid that area.",
        "Last weekend, lots of protests - peaceful marches but also clashes between police in riot gear and protesters, almost 200 arrests last weekend.",
        "So it's been a lot for a town that's often very quiet on the weekend.",
        "And - only have about a minute and a half left - I want to go back to that very moving Facebook post that we found from Montrell Jackson, one of the officers who we now know was killed in this incident.",
        "Judgment Day folks.",
        "Nearby, David Liquori is telling a passerby what he thinks will happen in just a few days.",
        "And he goes on to say that when people you know begin to question your integrity, you realize they don't really know you.",
        "Look at my actions.",
        "They speak loud and clear.",
        "And I personally want to send prayers out to everyone directly affected by this tragedy.",
        "I'm assuming, because this was when it was posted, he's talking about the Alton Sterling death.",

        "I wonder, though, if the officers there have felt under attack.",
        "Do they feel that they have been under attack in these difficult times?",
        "Yeah.",
        "My sense is definitely.",
        "I mean, I think that's what the police chief was referring to last week in my officers are human.",

        "It's a small town.",
        "People know each other.",
        "Communities do know these officers.",
        "I think, you know, there's things that happen through the course of a day that make people feel a little bit like, especially on the north side of Baton Rouge, that the police are against them.",
        "But if you were to stop them and really ask them, they'll say we need the police...",
        "OK.",
        "...And we support them."

        "Pleasure to be here.",
        "We hear a lot of advocacy of renewable energy, President Obama spoke specifically of solar energy.",
        "Is there any advocacy these days for nuclear power at, say, the talks in Paris?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Both the United States and quite a number of other countries are pushing nuclear hard as one of the clean energy options that are available.",
        "It doesn't - like wind or solar, it doesn't emit carbon and it also doesn't emit the local air pollution that can cause smoggy skies and deaths as you see in Beijing or New Delhi or the other cities of the developing world.",
        "In France, CO2 emissions per capita are significantly lower than ours - or Canada's, for that matter - and yet the French are trying to turn away a bit from nuclear power.",

        "Not entirely.",
        "France is only turning away a little, but they're certainly not turning away on a large scale from nuclear power.",
        "There are countries that are.",
        "Germany has decided to phase out its nuclear power plants and a number of other - the smaller markets have done that as well.",
        "But after Fukushima, the big markets there are really building plants today - China, India, Russia, South Korea - took a pause, looked at their safety regulations, decided to strengthen them in a few places and then said, we're moving ahead.",
        "Even before the Fukushima accident, there were obviously concerns about disposing of nuclear waste.",
        "Has there been any progress over the past several decades about nuclear waste disposal?",
        "There has in other countries, not in the United States.",
        "In Finland, for example, they became the first country to cite a nuclear waste repository with the complete support of the community where it's going to be.",
        "In the United States, President Obama canceled the project for a nuclear waste repository in Nevada at a place called Yucca Mountain.",
        "He then appointed a commission to make recommendations about what we should do, and they came up with some very sensible ideas, including a more democratic process where you would not have a nuclear waste repository anywhere that didn't want it.",
        "But their recommendations require Congress to act, and Congress has not yet acted.",
        "How dependent on nuclear energy is the U.S.?",
        "The United States gets between 15 and 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy, and the world gets about 15 percent, on average, of its electricity from nuclear energy.",
        "The key question with respect to climate is can nuclear energy grow enough to be an important part of the answer to climate change?",
        "But I think we should be doing everything we can to find answers to cutting its cost, to better financing of nuclear plants, to ensuring safety and security and managing the nuclear waste so that it can be an expandable answer.",
        "It's public resistance that's the limitation here, it's not the industrial capacity to build those power plants?",
        "It's not the industrial capacity but it's cost, and one very substantial part.",
        "What is it about a nuclear power plant that's so expensive?",
        "Well, of course, you need to build in safety and make sure that this intensely radioactive material that you're producing as the plant operates isn't going to accidentally be spread over the surrounding countryside as it was in the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan or the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union.",
        "And many of the countries that are thinking of building their first nuclear power plant unfortunately rate pretty low in estimates of their regulatory effectiveness or their ability to control corruption, and that's a worry when it comes to something like a nuclear power plant.",
        "Well, Matthew Bunn, thanks for talking with us once again."
