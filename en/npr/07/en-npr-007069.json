        "Not only that modern humans had a tendency to mix with the people they met, but these now-extinct groups also mixed with each other.",

        "Slatkin, a geneticist at the University of California at Berkeley, says the pattern of DNA from this 50,000-year-old woman suggests that her family was inbred.",
        "Her parents were blood relations, half-siblings or something equivalent - perhaps an uncle and niece or an aunt and nephew.",
        "And that suggested to us that this was a rather small population, because that meant that close relatives had no choice but to mate with each other.",
        "Writing in the journal Nature, the team says small groups of Neanderthals and Denisovans apparently met and reproduced in Eurasia.",
        "When modern humans arrived from Africa about 40,000 years ago, they joined the party."
