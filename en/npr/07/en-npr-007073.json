        "So one of the big enduring questions is exactly where Syria got these weapons from or how it created them.",
        "It's no surprise that bad people get their hands on chemical weapons, but what steps have to be taken in order to do that?",
        "Initially, the Syrian chemical weapons program was very much dependent on outside expertise and materials coming in from the outside.",
        "In the 1990s, it appears to have transitioned to assistance from Iran and also in the early 1990s from Russia where precursor chemicals, the ingredients that go into making these warfare agents were provided as well as technical assistance.",
        "And North Korea also came into the equation then with assistance on delivery systems.",
        "But quite some time ago, the program appears to have transitioned to one where Syria has the domestic capacity to do all this.",
        "In other words, they have production facilities apparently for them that are capable of making chemical warfare agents.",
        "So what level of expertise does someone have to have in order to use these deadly agents?",
        "The saying is that a bozo can make it in a beaker.",
        "To make the chemical warfare agents, a chemist with fairly rudimentary experience is probably going to be able to synthesize a small quantity of these agents.",
        "But to scale up to large quantities, the types of things that militaries often have to have in order to use them on the battlefield, that's a whole other ballgame.",
        "You mentioned that Syria now has the capability to use these precursor chemicals themselves.",
        "Is there a difference between, say, sarin and VX when these things are created?",
        "Sarin and VX are both nerve agents, a family of chemicals that directly attacks the nervous system.",
        "The initial chemicals that appeared on the battlefield were actually chemicals that are still used in the commercial industry today for legitimate purposes.",
        "But the organophosphorus chemicals that feed into nerve agents are often used in fertilizers and pesticides.",
        "And Syria is believed not only to have mustard gas but also nerve agents sarin and perhaps even VX.",
        "And they're so toxic that they really can only be combined near to the time that they're going to be used, right?",
        "Well, there are two basic forms of chemical weapons.",
        "The unitary weapons are ones that are already mixed.",
        "And when they're loaded into a munition, harm occurs, death can even occur.",
        "But with what is known as a binary weapon - and Syria may have this capability - the last two precursor chemicals may either be stored separately outside of the munition and mixed at the last minute, then loaded into it or actually stored separately inside of the munition.",
        "And on the way to the target, this membrane between those two chemicals burst.",
        "There's mixture that takes place in flight and, boom, sarin."

        "So what happens in the destruction process?",
        "Plans will take shape to go in and inspect the sites that are declared as production facilities and also as storage sites.",
        "An inventory will be taken, so they're literally going to be in the field counting munitions and closing down production facilities.",
        "Out of that, there will be a determination made about what destruction processes would be best for this particular arsenal.",
        "And there'd be an outside international presence, a number of inspectors, teams that would be on the ground at these various sites.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's one of the most important jobs that the international inspectors have done.",
        "They literally sit there and watch the weapons being destroyed.",
        "They also go to commercial facilities that produce significant quantities of the chemicals that can feed into a chemical weapons program, but under legitimate circumstances are in the products that we make use of in our homes and lives every day.",
        "How has the U.S.",
        "response to the use of chemical weapons changed over the years?",
        "The Gulf War - the first Gulf War actually started to change our equation in terms of our policy.",
        "When the Geneva Protocol was passed in 1925 - this is the treaty that bans the use of chemical weapons - the United States actually didn't ratify it until 1975.",
        "And when it did, it reserved the right to retaliate in kind if chemical weapons were used against U.S.",
        "forces.",
        "That's largely because this was Cold War era and the Soviet Union had a large chemical weapons program.",
        "But in 1991, President George Bush made a very public statement renouncing the U.S.",
        "right to retaliate in kind.",
        "So our policy began to change even before the United States joined the Chemical Weapons Convention, which put everybody - 189 countries at this point - on the same level playing field.",
        "Nobody possesses it, nobody uses it.",
        "So, Amy Smithson, at the end of 2003, Libya announced that it would get rid of its chemical weapons, began that process the next year, didn't receive a ton of attention at the time.",
        "What do we know about how Libya was divested of these terrible chemical weapons?",
        "The assessment was made initially by U.S.",
        "and British teams but then confirmed by the international inspectors that Libya had a stockpile of mustard gas that needed to be destroyed both in munitions and, I believe, also what's called bulk agent.",
        "In other words, agent that is sitting in containers but not yet loaded into weapons.",
        "And the United States and the United Kingdom began providing assistance to help Libya destroy this arsenal.",
        "And when Libya forfeited its weapons of mass destruction programs at the end of 2003, early 2004, inspectors went in and found that the Libyans were unsuccessful in producing nerve agents because they couldn't scale up, but they certainly did have a stockpile of mustard gas."

        "The hospitals for an insured patient never collect the actual charge rate, the numbers that are out here.",
        "Now if you're uninsured, and there are a lot of people, 49 million, roughly, in the country, sometimes those people are stuck with the bill or something close to that.",
        "And in that case people have been known over the last couple decades to go into bankruptcy because of these incredible inflated rates.",
        "And so there are different rates, and if you're with a big insurer, they negotiate discounts.",
        "They're not going to pay that top rate, either.",
        "That's right.",
        "They will every year come in, and they'll negotiate their own rates, and they almost have no relation whatsoever to what this listed charge rate is.",

        "That's right because people who are on public assistance - Medicare and Medicaid - they don't pay these prices.",
        "The insured population, that's over half of the country, they don't pay these prices.",
        "And then even among the uninsured, a lot of the people get a discounted rate, charity care if they don't have the money or they work out their own level, or they just don't end up paying anything, and the hospital eats the cost.",
        "And that's another issue for another day, and that's one of the reasons they're trying to get everybody signed up for health insurance.",
        "But anyway, as we look at that fact, that gives no incentive for the hospital to do anything but put the rates sky high.",
        "Yeah, I mean, these are basically high rates that give the hospitals a little bit of leverage when they come in and negotiate with the insurers.",
        "And so the insurer comes in and, you know, obviously wants to pay less, and the hospital says whoa, you know, we - our original offer is, you know, $150 billion for this or - well that's a bit high, but, you know, $100,000.",
        "And then they sort of go back and forth.",
        "And these are really artifacts of an older time when hospitals just actually kept what was called a chargemaster and a list of prices, and that was before, you know, the way that prices were negotiated by their Medicare or by private insurers came to be.",
        "And is there any correlation between high prices and good quality of treatment?",
        "That's a great question, and the research is really still out there about that.",
        "I've seen studies that go either way.",
        "But what is definitely clear is that the difference in quality from one institution to another is not nearly as great as the difference in price.",

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Thanks for having me on.",
        "Well, again, why is it that there are, for example here in Washington I get a join replacement for $69,000 at one hospital and less than half of that across town.",
        "Why are these numbers so wildly different?",
        "Yeah, for those of us who study this issue of price variation, unfortunately it's not surprising to see this type of variation.",
        "And I think something that consumers are often surprised to find out is that there is no regulation of health care prices or hospital charges.",
        "So hospitals can actually charge whatever they want for their care based on what they think the costs are or what their quality is, and there's no regulation at all."

        "So what we see is the effect of basically lack of a system.",
        "How do hospitals figure out how much to charge?",
        "I mean, yeah, they have to pay the surgeon, there's so much time in the oper - how do they come up with these amounts?",
        "So actually if you look at how they've come up with these prices before, before hospitals were never required to actually know what their costs were.",
        "So if you look at, for example, other industries like the auto industry or any other industry, they actually usually know what their costs are.",
        "So an automaker will know what it costs to make a car, and they will use usually what's called a cost-plus system, so what does it cost plus the profit margin for, you know, different people along the chain.",
        "And that's how they come up with a price.",
        "But hospitals and health care has never been required to have an idea of what the actual costs are.",
        "If you ask a hospital CEO what does it actually cost you to take care of a patient who has pneumonia, they actually won't know.",
        "And because health care has never been required to basically be accountable for their costs, they come up with these charges very arbitrarily, so based on what they think it should be and what other people say it should be.",
        "It's not a cost-plus system at all.",
        "You say they're not going to know how much it's going to cost to treat a pneumonia - they've treated hundreds, thousands of pneumonia patients.",
        "They're going to have a pretty good idea.",
        "Right, so they'll come up, for example, they'll have an itemized bill and say that you had antibiotics, you had a certain night stay.",
        "So a hospital night stay could range from $700 a night to $5,000 a night just for the bed, and that's based on what the hospital thinks that it might cost based on their bottom line, based on what they have to cover, but it's not based on what it costs, unfortunately.",
        "So how do you expect that this data, now that there is some transparency, is going to change things?",
        "Well, and this is where it becomes really complicated because consumers are used to seeing costs or charges related to quality.",
        "So if we look at Yelp, for example, we'll say OK, a four-dollar-sign restaurant is probably higher quality than a two-dollar-sign restaurant, and they might make that same assumption about health care, too.",
        "And so just as Jordan said, there's not really great research out there showing that the difference in the quality is as vast as the difference in the charges.",
        "So what - while we do hope that price transparency is an initial first step, one concern is that people actually start flocking to higher-cost hospitals or higher-charge hospitals thinking that it offers better care, and that might not be the case at all.",
        "There might also, though - might not there be different decisions about different conditions?",
        "If I have cancer, I might want to go to the very-high-priced cancer specialty hospital, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, someplace like that.",
