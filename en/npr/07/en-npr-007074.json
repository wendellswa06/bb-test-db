        "As you look ahead, as we shift from a system that rewards per procedure to a system that rewards per outcome, how is this antiquated price structure likely to change in that regard?",
        "I think these things need to go hand in hand.",
        "I think it's a great idea that we start looking at outcomes rather than just fee for service and paying per service.",
        "And the issue of charges really need to be dealt with.",
        "This issue again isn't surprising for those of us who study it, but the fact that CMS has published it I think is a really good move because now consumers can - you can just go to the CMS and actually download the Excel file, and you might be able to find your hospital on there.",
        "And so this provides more momentum for policymakers to start making decisions about how do we change the system to make it more rational.",
        "Right now it's completely arbitrary, and it's really not fair."

        "Yeah, I mean I think the real problem is that there is no marketplace in health care.",
        "So a marketplace takes supply and demand for some service, and the output of that balance between supply and demand is a price for that service.",
        "Our instinct is that we want to have health care act that way.",
        "We want health care providers, hospitals and doctors, to be trying to better and providing more value to patients.",
        "But there is this weird third-party-payment, fee-for-service reimbursement model standing between providers and patients that's keeping that connection from happening.",
        "So you can solve that problem one of two ways.",
        "One way, which is I think a way that's favored by free marketeers and folks on the right politically, is to simply create a real market in health care, just give consumers information and direct exposure to price and let them make decisions about where to seek care.",
        "That was sort of the Bush model.",
        "That's right, and the challenge with doing that is that health care is so complicated to understand what are the differences really between modes of treatment and levels of quality and so forth.",
        "It's a credence good.",
        "It's very much like going to an auto mechanic and getting your car fixed.",
        "You don't really know what's going on under the hood, you're just trusting your mechanic to provide you good service.",
        "So the other way to solve that problem is to use what the Affordable Care Act and sort of Obamacare is trying to do, which is to use managed care-type approaches, so we're going to put pressure on - we're going to link provider payment to quality and outcomes and level of cost and so forth, and hope that you can, by using those incentives, replicate the forces of the market and get folks to act as though there were a real marketplace going on in health care.",
        "A lot of people on the line with questions.",
        "Let's go to Mary.",
        "Mary's on the line with us from Santa Clara in California.",
        "Yeah, I'm really excited about this news and about this transparency.",
        "We have such growth in health care costs, it's a hot story, but there's such ignorance of where those costs are coming from.",
        "And this feels like a moment where we're putting sticker prices on health care costs and at least revealing that, you know, there's an MSRP out there, or there's some kind of a base cost that I think consumers have been highly ignorant of.",
        "Is anybody, Jordan Rau, going to ask - the board of a hospital, is going to say, you know, now that I realize it, you know, it is twice as much across town, why aren't we charging more, or why aren't we charging less?",
        "Yeah, I think - well, that's exactly right.",
        "It's a double-edged sword when you put these prices out because like for instance the state of Vermont has been publishing prices for - or New Hampshire has been publishing actual prices for a while, and a couple of years, and what they found was that even though it brought some pressure on the high-end hospitals, the low-end hospitals came back and said, hey, what's the deal, you know, you, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, are paying, you know, my competitor over here twice as much as I am.",
        "So I think that in that sense it's - it may have a good impact, and it may not.",
        "And the other thing, which you referenced and is a really important point, is that right now hospitals and medical care are like colleges, in that people tend to equate the higher prices being better.",
        "And so that's going to be a very dangerous potential implication until people feel comfortable at some sort of rating system for the quality because otherwise they might say, you know, what Cedar Sinai in Los Angeles charges much more, they're better."
