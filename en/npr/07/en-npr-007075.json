        "Mary, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And as - Chas Roades, if there's no market, why are hospitals advertising?",
        "Well, because they need to fill their beds.",
        "I mean, a hospital is fixed-cost business that has beds that in order for the economic model of a hospital to work, those beds actually need to be full or nearly full for them to cover the costs of the hospital.",
        "But I think it's important to step back and realize what actually drives pricing in health care.",
        "What drives pricing in health care is scale.",
        "So the whole strategy of running a successful hospital system for the last 20, 25 years has been I'm going to try to get as big as I can in my marketplace so that when I go into that price negotiation, based on this chargemaster that we've been talking about, when I got into the price negotiation with the insurance company, I have enough negotiating leverage that I can actually extract a price that I can live with and actually maintain operations.",
        "And so until we uncouple that negotiating process from what prices actually paid in health care, we're always going to have this problem of prices not reflecting the actual value of the services that are being provided.",
        "Here's an email from Helene: Late last year I had a complete hysterectomy by da Vinci robot.",
        "Since I had already met my out-of-pocket maximum for the year on my plan due to my son's previous hospitalization, it was covered 100 percent.",
        "What I am shocked by is how little the health plan negotiated to pay.",
        "billed amount, $81,275; plan discount, $73,634; amount paid to hospital, $7,641.",
        "Frankly, I don't think $7,600 covered the hospital's expenses for my surgery, but I was back at work in only a week, so my employer benefited.",
        "So what's going on in that case is that the hospital didn't have enough negotiating leverage to extract the price that it needed from the payer to pay for using that expensive technology.",
        "Actually the da Vinci robot is a very interesting phenomenon in health care.",
        "So you ask about how people choose where they're going to go and how do consumers make decisions.",
        "You see billboards on the side of every highway heading into town from the airport advertising robotic surgery and da Vinci robots and how the quality is so much better and so forth.",
        "And so you've got to have your surgery, you know, at a facility that has one of these da Vinci robots."

        "Well, the clinical literature on this is actually pretty mixed.",
        "It's not immediately clear that the da Vinci robot is better.",
        "But it certainly is more expensive, and it allows a hospital to drive foot traffic and thus get greater scale in a marketplace, that lets them get some of this negotiating scale that we've been talking about.",
        "Let's go next to - this is Ruth and Ruth us with us Tucson.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thanks so much for taking my call.",
        "I just had a question, something I've wondered about for a long time.",
        "If these costs or these charges are arbitrarily set, let's say something costs $100, but the hospital only ends up collecting $30, what happens to the other $70?",
        "Do they get to take it as a tax write-off or a business expense, and does it affect - thereby affect their tax bill at the end of the year?",
        "I'm just curious where that other money goes.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Chas Roades?",
        "No.",
        "So, I mean, the first thing, it's a great question.",
        "Where does the money go?",
        "It's the big question in health care.",
        "Where is all the money?",
        "Most hospitals are tax-exempt organizations.",
        "Most - something like 80 percent of hospitals in this country are charity businesses, so they don't pay taxes.",
        "Nonprofits, yeah.",
        "They're nonprofits.",
        "So they - when they don't collect that money, some portion of the money that they don't collect is - can be written down as charity care, so care that's provided to patients who can't afford to pay on their own.",
        "And so they get to count that charity care toward their qualification for nonprofit status on an ongoing basis, essentially.",
        "But the vast majority of that money that is not - that's sort of the difference between what's charged and what's paid just disappears into thin air.",
        "There's - that isn't actually real money.",
        "So, again, these prices aren't real, and so they don't reflect money that's actually expected to come into the hospital at the end of a unit of service.",
        "Jordan Rau, we do read, though, of a cat and mouse game between private insurers and hospitals where if hospitals are going to bill $100,000 and the insurer says, well, we're going to knock that down to 30 percent, they then inflate the costs of the bill again.",
        "So that 30 percent, they're going to get some more money on.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are a couple of ways that insurers and hospitals negotiate, and one is the discounted rate off of charges.",
        "Now, that's, I don't think, the majority of hospitals, by any means.",
        "But there are - that does sometimes happen.",
        "And so the hospitals do have an incentive to mark up their charges to some crazy amount.",
        "So they'll say, well, you know, you're getting 20 - you know, just paying 25 cents on the dollar."

        "But most of the time, that's not what happens.",
        "Insurers have gotten a bit more sophisticated than that, and they sort of take a look at what they're paying everyone else, and they work off of that level.",
        "And so the charge - and, again, it's an accounting fiction.",
        "It's not a real thing out there.",
        "There's no actual dollars being lost.",
        "It's just numbers on a ledger that don't ever see - that actually appear, for the most part, to be anywhere, and so it doesn't play a role.",
        "But there are plenty of patients who say - hear from their insurers that, well, the normal amount we pay in this area is $75,000.",
        "They're charging $100,000.",
        "We're only going to pay for $75,000.",
        "You know, that's an excellent point, and it is true.",
        "I - when I look at my explanation of benefits, they say, we saved you, you know, 35 percent.",
        "Isn't it great for us?",
        "And you're like, well, I'm still paying, you know, $5,000 for this.",
        "And, you know, to some extent, it's true.",
        "The insurer is negotiating a better rate than you could negotiate on your own because a lot of the times when you're - you have no insurance and you go into it and negotiate on your own, you don't get any discount at all.",
        "But, again, you're taking this random number that you've - to some extent, it's fair to say it's just been plucked out of air, and you say, well, you know, here's - we got this discount.",
        "It's like, well, yeah, you did, but...",
        "Off of what?",
        "...off of what, yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, let me just - just one point on this random number.",
        "We've talked a lot about how arbitrary the chargemaster is.",
        "It is actually, on some level, based on reality.",
        "So it's based on how much it costs the hospital to run its total operation, and then they add on top of that whatever margin they need to make in order to keep things going, keep the lights on and the doors open and keep investing in new technologies and services and so forth.",
        "So there is some connection between what things actually cost and what the chargemaster says, but the connection is now so vague as to be almost meaningless.",
        "Uninsured people actually - we went through this all - in sort of 2005, 2006, there was a very similar episode where chargemasters became public, and there was a big pushback on hospital pricing.",
        "And as a result of that episode, most hospitals have put in place much tougher charity care guidelines so that they're giving deep, deep discounts to the uninsured who can't afford to pay, somewhere on the order of 50 to 90 percent discounts off of the chargemaster.",
        "That's Chas Roades.",
        "Also with us, Jordan Rau.",

        "Steve(ph) is on the line calling from Charleston.",
        "Yes.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "I was just wondering: If insurance companies know what the charges are that the hospitals are charging, why don't they direct patients to those hospitals that charge less?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "Jordan Rau?",
        "That's a fabulous question, and that's exactly what a lot of them are trying to do.",
        "It's called tiered pricing.",
        "And what they're now doing is they're giving - you sign up for an insurer, and they give you a range of choices, and they say, OK, here is our bottom level or, you know, C level of the cheapest people, and you can go there.",
        "Or you can go to the B level, which charges more, but you're going to have to pay more out of pocket.",
        "Or you can go to the A, the most expensive places, and you're going to have to pay the most.",
        "And that's where the whole system, both on the Medicare side and on the private insurance side, is trying to move.",
        "You guys did all right.",
        "It's called value-based, and the idea is that if you can give some sort of financial incentive to the consumers and the patients so that they can see that there's a differential on prices, they'll start driving themselves to the cheaper place.",
        "But - and - but the only reason that that's a new phenomenon, because that seems like a pretty obvious thing for insurance companies to do...",
        "Pretty obvious, yeah.",
        "...is that it's only recently that employers have been pushing back on the insurance companies about the 10 to 15 and maybe even 20 percent premium increases that they've been paying for employer-sponsored insurance over the years.",
        "But the combination of the Affordable Care Act coming into play and just all of the pressure in the economy has now got employers pushing hard on insurers to say, hey, guys, you actually have to provide a little more value here and do more than just pass along the costs to me.",
        "And so the insurance companies have begun to pursue some of these more aggressive tiering strategies that Jordan is talking about."
