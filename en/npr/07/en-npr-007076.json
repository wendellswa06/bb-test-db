        "According to prosecutors, how large was this conspiracy?",
        "Well, the indictment they unsealed is only covering a period of three years, and that was 15 years ago.",
        "But they clearly think that there are more victims and that Epstein sort of continued this pattern of behavior, that he recruited a network of young girls who would then bring in other young girls for money to give him these nude massages, which turned into sexual abuse.",
        "Here's Special Agent Bill Sweeney talking about the impact of these crimes alleged.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Those who have been victimized by child sexual predators are frequently haunted by memories of these crimes well into their adulthood, often for the rest of their lives.",
        "They bear the burden of someone else's criminal behavior.",
        "Quil, we were reading yesterday this indictment that referred to dozens of victims, and then after hearing of dozens of victims, it's really quite sobering to hear the prosecutor say, we don't even know how many more of you there may be.",
        "If you think you're a victim, call this 800 number.",
        "Yeah, the most dramatic part for me of that press conference yesterday was that they put up a picture of Epstein and they said, if you have seen this man, if you think you've been harmed by this man, call this FBI 800 number.",
        "So they think that this behavior went on for years and years and there must be many more victims.",
        "And they found - after arresting him, when he landed at this New Jersey airport, they found that - they got a warrant to break into his home, his mansion in the Upper East Side of Manhattan.",
        "And they found, they said, a trove of nude photographs, which they believe are underage girls.",
        "So that's also, I would imagine, child pornography charges on top of the other charges.",
        "Other than entering a not guilty plea, have you heard anything from Epstein's side about how he would say he is not guilty of these charges?",
        "Only that he's retained a high-powered law firm.",
        "We don't know that he - you know, he said he's not guilty, and there's a bail hearing on Thursday."

        "When I caught up with her, she was at the farm market set up right outside the hospital.",
