        "Lam sounds like she's trying to stop the turmoil, which she even admits her government started when it pushed this extradition measure.",

        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Well, it sounds like it's an unambiguous statement, but there's a lot of semantics involved here, especially for the protesters.",
        "The demonstrators said today, the word dead or suspending the bill - another term she's used - has no legal meaning in the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's Parliament; withdrawal does, so use it (ph) - she won't.",
        "Instead, when she spoke in Cantonese, she used the word - she used an idiom that means to die in one's bed at a ripe, old age, and the implication is that this bill will not be revived in this session and therefore would simply die at the start of next year.",
        "Now, protesters say, if you're sincere, why the aversion to withdrawing it now?",

        "No, she did not, and that's not likely to happen.",
