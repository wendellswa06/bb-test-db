        "Let me just make sure I figure this out because, I mean, there has been news about this in a lower court ruling, but I want to review it because it's quite remarkable.",
        "There was a mandate that was characterized - that was upheld by the Supreme Court because it was a tax.",
        "The federal government could use its taxing authority to penalize you if you did not have health insurance.",
        "Then the mandate was thrown out by Congress.",
        "And so now the argument is that without the tax, without the tax penalty, there is no authority under Congress to mandate health insurance for people - is that right?",
        "That's right.",
        "And then the additional piece here, which is so important to this case in New Orleans, is that the states suing here are arguing that because that penalty, that tax penalty was so critical to the Affordable Care Act's program for extending health insurance, for guaranteeing sick people could get health insurance, for expanding Medicaid, so critical to all the reforms in the Affordable Care Act, that if you get rid of that penalty, you've got to take the whole law down with it.",
        "Let's hypothetically say the appeals court would agree to that, and ultimately, maybe the Supreme Court would agree to that.",
        "What would it mean for a law that's now almost a decade old to just be completely obliterated from the books?",
        "Does anybody have any idea what that would look like?",
        "I mean, it's hard to even imagine how disruptive that would be to the American health care system.",
        "So I think people probably understand at this point that the Affordable Care Act is responsible for extending health insurance coverage to some 20 million previously uninsured Americans.",
        "But that's really just the tip of the iceberg, if you will.",
        "The law has now, as you said, been in place almost a decade.",
        "It now guarantees coverage.",
        "People have been used to getting coverage if they are sick.",
        "Without that guarantee, presumably insurers could go back to denying coverage to people who are sick.",
        "Twenty million - 20-some odd million people who have health insurance would lose it.",
        "Is the court in a situation where it could even consider the consequences of this?",
        "Can they say, this would be an utterly absurd ruling and therefore we can't make it, or do they simply have to say, if they decide they agree with the plaintiffs in this, the law is what the law is, and let the chips fall where they may?",
        "Well, this is just the next step in this lawsuit's journey.",
        "So this court can weigh in however it sees fit, and then, of course, we would expect that it may end up once again before the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court.",

        "And as you say, the White House has sent spokespeople - I mean, spokespeople have been out over the weekend talking up this idea, arguing that there are huge numbers of migrants arriving at the border, which is true.",
        "We had more than 100,000 last month alone, which is the biggest monthly total in a decade.",
        "And the White House argues that communities along the border shouldn't be forced to bear the brunt of that, as they put it.",
