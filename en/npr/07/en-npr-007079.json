        "The way that this has been framed on social media over the last few days by the president's supporters is this is a way to get back at Democrats.",
        "Setting aside the motivations, though, would it be legal to do this?",
        "The president argues that it would be.",
        "But it's been reported that lawyers inside the Department of Homeland Security had concerns about this proposal, and that's one of the reasons why it hasn't happened.",
        "Clearly, the president's critics and opponents would challenge this move in court if he actually does move forward with this proposal.",
        "Well, let's say it was found to be legal.",
        "Is it in any way practical to take a bunch of migrants on the border and just start dropping them off in San Francisco or whatever city has policies the White House doesn't like?",
        "The fact is that it would be an enormous logistical challenge, right?",
        "I mean, the Border Patrol and other immigration authorities have been saying loudly for months now that they are overwhelmed by these huge numbers of migrants, largely Central Americans who are fleeing from violence and poverty.",
        "You know, if authorities are barely managing to get these people to cities on the border right now as it is, never mind transporting them, you know, hundreds or even thousands of additional miles - so it would be costly for sure.",
        "That's one of the reasons immigration authorities reportedly pushed back on this idea when it was floated initially.",
        "And also, from an operational perspective, it's not really clear how much this proposal would achieve.",

        "It ranks as one of the most powerful earthquakes in the world of the last century.",

        "We've had reports of scattered fires in Tokyo alone.",
        "Of course, the damage will be much more severe up in northeastern Japan, although the population is sparser there.",

        "Well, I was going to say, Japan is more earthquake-prone than many other places in the world.",
        "How prepared is the city of Tokyo and the rest of the country for an earthquake of this magnitude?",
        "Well, the only thing I can say is that if anywhere is prepared, it would have to be Japan.",
        "They spend huge amounts of money on disaster prevention and disaster resistance, many times more than any other country would spend, so if there's a way to be safe from unforeseen events, the Japanese are trying to do it.",

        "The vast majority of these migrants have a connection in the U.S.",
        "already, like a friend or a relative in some part of the country who can wire them the money for a bus ticket.",
