        "Some of the comments were about Israel, about Jews, about power of American Jews in the United States and so forth.",
        "Now she made these comments about the aftermath of 9/11 and pressures that Muslims felt.",
        "And at one point, there was a phrase in there - some people did something - which was taken as her description of 9/11.",
        "How strong has the response been to that reference?",
        "Well, it's interesting on the Democratic side because in this instance, I think you see so many more of her colleagues in her party coming to her defense - that the president, in using these words and juxtaposing her image against the 9/11 attacks, has, in their words, attempted to incite violence against her and that her comments, in the broader context of what she was saying, was talking about overall Muslim bigotry in the country following 9/11 and that she sees herself as an activist against those forms of bigotry.",
        "You said that Democrats are publicly - are vociferously defending her, in this case.",
        "They have been more quick to defend her here, although it's interesting to see the debate inside the party over - they have been angry about who has been fastest to defend her and how quickly and how enthusiastically.",
        "And I think you've seen - Rashida Tlaib, who's a Democrat from Michigan, is the other Muslim woman in Congress.",
        "And she had a really interesting response in which she called out Democratic leaders for not doing enough and suggesting that they were tokenizing women of color in the caucus, where they're happy to use their images to promote diversity but not defend them.",
        "And so the speaker, when she was asked about it, initially kind of deferred and said she wasn't ready to comment.",
        "Although, over the weekend, she obviously did call for the security review and call - excuse me - call on the president to take down the video, which he has not as of now."

        "The witnesses say once or twice a week, 20 to 50 prisoners were taken from their cells and told they will be transferred elsewhere.",
        "Instead, they were taken to a basement to appear before a military judge for two or three minutes, just enough time to be condemned to death.",
