        "And then again, you know, this was a unanimous decision from the steering committee, as you mentioned.",

        "Although when we say point out the truth, we should underline - remark after remark after remark over years from Steve King suggests his basic beliefs are that Western civilization is threatened by immigration, that it has something to do with birthrates, that people from different countries can't uphold it.",
