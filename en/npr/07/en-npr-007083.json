        "Even with the bases being--sort of escaping from the guillotine here in New London and in Portsmouth, a lot of people are already speculating, you know, `Does this mean that since these sort of so-called blue state bases are being opened that this is sort of a deal that is going to be played where a red state base gets saved?",

        "And that's a big issue because John Thune, the freshman senator who defeated Tom Daschle, the former Democratic minority leader, campaigned that he as a Republican leader was better slated to save Ellsworth Air Force Base than the minority leader, and then the commission turns around and votes to close it.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, you know, a lot of Republicans thought that John Thune did them a huge favor.",
