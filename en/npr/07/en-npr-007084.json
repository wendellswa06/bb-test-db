        "What the Pentagon said was, you know, `It does not make strategic sense to have this many folks in such a concentrated area,' and that's been a concern for some time.",
        "But you know, numbers can be manipulated, and folks all across the country in their fight to save these bases have said, you know, that these numbers don't really add up or that they can add up to a number of different things."
