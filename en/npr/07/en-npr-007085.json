        "And now, by admitting he was at the Brussels airport, Abrini provides a direct link between the two plots, connecting some of the dots Belgian investigators have been blamed for missing earlier.",

        "Van Ostaeyen's been tracking terrorist recruitment in Belgium for years.",

        "Van Ostaeyen says he believes there are more important operators out there still planning attacks.",
        "He thinks the Belgian government believes that too, and that's why they've decided not to lower the terror threat level from its current three out of a maximum four.",

        "There's another way for the bloodshed to stop, and that is for the Iraqi military and the Iraqi people to take matters into their own hands to force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside.",

        "Feisal Istrabadi says Bush's subsequent decision not to back the uprisings with military force remains controversial in Iraq.",
        "Istrabadi was Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, and he spoke with our colleague, Rachel Martin.",

        "And that's certainly not what the Iraqis heard.",

        "How has that decision shaped the Kurdish region all these years later?",
        "You make an excellent point that Iraqi Kurds remember George Herbert Walker Bush much more fondly than Arab Iraqis do because he did protect them from Saddam Hussein's depredations through the no-fly zones, et cetera, and allowed humanitarian relief efforts into the Iraqi Kurdistan region.",
        "Arabs, however, were left to the tender mercies of Saddam Hussein.",
        "Of course, in a sense, that sort of separation from Baghdad began a long road that, perhaps, future historians will look back and say that's when the separatist movement gained momentum amongst the Kurds of Iraq.",
        "Although, of course, that has not led to independence since, but it may at some future date.",
        "So the legacy of President George Herbert Walker Bush in Iraq is mixed, as you have laid out.",
