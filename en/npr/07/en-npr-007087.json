        "You know, I think we probably didn't sustain nearly the damage that they did down in New Orleans to homes as were flooded, but the amount of damage to trees here was significant.",
        "In fact, some of the contractors told us that they have worked the storms in Florida in the central Gulf Coast and Katrina and have never seen the amount of tree debris--limbs and trunks of trees uprooted and all.",

        "The delegate allocation to come out of the convention ultimately reflected the results of the caucuses back in February - 20 pledged delegates for Clinton, 15 for Sanders.",
        "Ralston says it's a convoluted process.",
        "And at one point, Sanders had made some headway toward collecting more delegates.",

        "On pro-Sanders message boards, Flores was then called a traitor.",
        "And it is with this backdrop that Nevada's top elected Democrat Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid got on the phone with his fellow Senator Bernie Sanders to lay out what had happened at the convention, including the violence.",

        "I'm confident he will be saying something about it soon.",
        "This is a test of leadership, as we all know.",
        "And I'm hopeful and very confident that Senator Sanders will do the right thing.",
        "But when Sanders did put out written statement, the focus was on his concerns with the Democratic Party, saying at the state convention, party leaders prevented a fair and transparent process.",
        "It wasn't until the third paragraph in that Sanders added it goes without saying that he condemns violence and personal harassment."
