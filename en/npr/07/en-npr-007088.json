        "There's really at least a couple of issues on the table here.",
        "One is what we've been talking about, which is the crisis that the U.S.",
        "government calls genocide.",
        "There's also a question of Sudan being a state with proven ties to al-Qaida.",
        "And if things continue to go badly in Sudan, it could affect other countries, including Somalia.",
        "Are these two problems linked in a way that makes it more urgent for the U.S.",
        "to intervene?",
        "Would the U.S.",
        "consider intervening directly and not just through international body?",
        "Well, I think that, as you say, the issue of genocide is the issue that we're having the greatest trouble with the government of Sudan, the genocide that's occurred to continuing violence against the people in Darfur.",
        "We saw the same thing against the southerners when 2 million were killed over a 22-year civil war.",
        "The government of Sudan has actually been cooperating since 2001-2002 on ending their links and ties with al-Qaida and actually cooperating positively in the global war on terrorism with us.",
        "The concern here is that in opposing a U.N.",
        "force going into Darfur, there have been members of the government who have irresponsibly said this will lead to a jihad.",
        "And have, in some ways, whether directly or inadvertently, treated Darfur as an arena for jihadists and Islamic extremists to come and to fight against Western forces.",
        "Of course, the forces that are on the ground are African forces.",
        "But in, you know, arguing against the U.N.",
        "transition, they've sort of appealed to that sentiment of anti-Western and jihadist orientation.",
        "And so, whereas the government has actually been doing the positive thing on the global war on terror, their rhetoric could be undermining that good work.",
        "Here in the U.S.",
        "we've seen a certain amount of demonstrations trying to help bring the issue of Darfur to the front.",
        "You saw a rally of thousands of people in New York led by celebrities.",
        "George Clooney has been out constantly talking about this.",
        "You've also got Don Cheadle constantly talking about this.",
        "I don't know how high it does rank on America's radar yet.",
        "But what - how high does it rank on your radar, and on the radar of the State Department in general?",
        "Well, it ranks very high.",
        "It's a high priority and it's a priority that has been there since day one of President Bush's administration.",
        "When he went into his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and said he wanted to do something about the violence which was taking place in Sudan, that being the North-South conflict.",
        "So it's been a priority from the very beginning of this administration and President Bush has been leading on this issue.",
        "And so we welcome the celebrity attention to it that's come in recent, you know, years - over the last year.",
        "And we certainly welcome the continued engagement of America's civil society, the faith-based community, the NGO community, the Africanist community that have been focused on Darfur for many, many, many years.",
        "But the administration doesn't need to be pushed from outside as such to treat Sudan as a priority.",
        "It has been from day one for President Bush, and he has led on this issue.",
        "What we need is more international engagement.",
        "We need to see the mobilization of those constituencies within other countries.",
        "It would be very helpful to have the Arab street express its outrage that Muslims are being killed in Darfur in huge numbers.",
        "Where's the Arab street on that question?",
        "So it would be very important to see in European capitals the same type of mobilization.",
        "Oxfam should be in the street with outrage about what's taking place in Darfur and pushing their governments to act robustly to end these atrocities.",
        "In the Caribbean, there's right now the potential of a Caribbean Diaspora Conference taking place in Khartoum.",
        "It's unthinkable that people in the Caribbean would go and have a conference and contribute to the economy of Khartoum while they're killing black Muslims in Darfur."

        "It's appreciated the mobilization in our streets in America.",
        "But what is really needed is for those people to reach out to their counterparts in capitals, in the Caribbean, in Africa, in Europe, in Asia and in the Arab world to get them as outraged as the American public is.",
        "Finally, though, the Deputy U.N.",
        "Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown accused the president, President Bush, and the prime minister, Tony Blair of the U.K., of megaphone diplomacy.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "did act nearly unilaterally when it went into Iraq, you know, pulling together a coalition but saying we're going in first.",

        "Will the U.S.",
        "go in?",
        "Under what circumstances?",
        "Well, first, on the issue of megaphone diplomacy, I'm quite proud that our administration has been charged with megaphone diplomacy when we see the type of atrocities that are taking place in Darfur.",
        "It's also surprising that Mark Malloch Brown would make such a statement, if he did, because Kofi Annan himself has been very, very, very vocal about the need to allow this transition to take place to U.N.",
        "forces to end the violence that's taking place in Darfur and to end the military offensive.",
        "As has Jan Egeland, who has called repeatedly for international engagement and outrage on this issue to make sure that the humanitarian workers are protected and are able to assist the civilians in Darfur.",
        "So megaphone diplomacy at a time like this is absolutely necessary.",
        "On the issue of what the U.S.",
        "would be doing, I think that both in Sudan and in Iraq the United States has tried to work very closely, multi-laterally, within the U.N.",
        "Security Council to get the resolutions of the world body to put pressure on these governments which are acting irresponsibility towards their own population, killing their own population.",
        "But when you have a resolution that then a government stands up to the world body and says it will not recognize, it will not accept the decision of the Security Council and the U.N., that's when President Bush says the credibility of the institution itself is called into question.",
        "And I think that that's where are right now.",
        "We are continuing to work with other governments, including and especially the African Union forces, which are on the ground right now trying to positively contribute to the protection of the people of Darfur, and we're going to support them.",
        "We're one of their largest contributors right now.",
        "We have spent over $200 million over the last two years protecting and supporting the African Union forces.",
        "We have offered the assistance of NATO, providing strategic lift into Darfur of the African Union forces.",
        "We've also said that we could do training.",
        "We can do more logistical assistance.",
        "We can provide advisers.",

        "This mission has been planned since January 2006.",
        "It's about time now that the U.N.",
        "put itself in a place where it's ready to act.",
