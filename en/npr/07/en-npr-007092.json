        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "We got an enormous amount of good ideas from the blue-collar workers.",
        "That fellow who has been standing behind a machine for 10 years knows it better than the people who built it, really knows what to do.",
        "Ross sold off the companies a few years later, made a pile of money.",
        "But Gerard says by that time, he'd restructured the steel mills in a fair, sustainable and smart way.",
        "With Wilbur, it's been almost 15 years now.",
        "And those mills are running, and some of them are the most productive in North America.",
        "Given this good relationship with unions and that Ross was a longtime Democrat - he was involved with the Clinton administration before backing Romney and then later Trump for president - you might think that Democrats and liberals would be OK with Ross as commerce secretary.",
        "But many lump him in with what they describe as a cabal of wealthy elites getting ready to take over America.",
        "There's massive skepticism about Ross and his record.",
        "Kurt Walters is a director with the liberal advocacy group Demand Progress.",
        "He says the steel industry aside, when Ross bought textile companies, he did exactly what Donald Trump criticized during the campaign - he killed American jobs."
