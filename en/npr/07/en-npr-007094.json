        "And those simply aren't available.",
        "No.",
        "OK.",
        "So a go big is build up something but not nearly 700,000 or a million troops.",
        "Well, what they did was they rejected the original go big and said that's simply not plausible.",
        "But, they did say you could do a variation of the second option, go long, and combine it with a little bit of go big.",
        "Go long says eventually cut back your combat presence and devote much more time and energy and troops to the training and advisory effort in Iraq but also recognize that in that process you're probably committing yourself to five to 10 years.",
        "And finally option number three, go home.",
        "Option number three was go home.",
        "And they did consider it for the - to the intellectually honest.",
        "They went through and said, what would this entail, what would it implicate, what would the result be?",
        "And their conclusion was it would lead very quickly to a large and bloody civil war that easily could spill over the borders of Iraq and become a regional war.",
        "So, that basically knocked that option off the table.",
        "Didn't General Abizaid, who's directing the U.S.",
        "military efforts for the Middle East, didn't he tell the Senate Armed Services Committee just last week, we don't need any more troops over in Iraq now?",
        "Wouldn't that contradict this finding that we should go big, at least for a little while, which you write today means adding maybe 20,000 or 30,000 more troops?",
        "The question is always need for what?",
        "When generals tell you they have enough troops, reporters have learned to ask, for what mission?",
        "And Abizaid is saying he has enough troops for the mission he has right now.",
        "But that mission isn't necessarily victory.",
        "What the Pentagon analysis is trying to do is figure out how many troops do you actually need to do these things if you actually wanted to prevail in Iraq?",
        "And they said that simply can't be done."

        "Is there any reason why the prediction happens right on the winter solstice, or is this just a coincidence?",
        "Chances are when the Maya set up this count of days, which happened at some point in the past, we don't actually know when they started counting, they set up a date in the distant past which was Day Zero and a day in the distant future that would be sort of the last day of that cycle.",
        "It seems as though they planned the first of those days to be the transit of the sun, you know, across the northern parallel so that when the sun moves to the north of where they were, sometime in August of 3114 BC, and the end of that cycle happened to be on the solstice.",
        "That sort of pairing is probably something that appealed to the Maya in theory but certainly not something that they actually observed to happen because the span of time was just longer than they were around to see.",
