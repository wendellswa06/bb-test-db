        "Well, in general the information that we have about Maya astronomy comes from a series of books that were preserved from sort of just before the arrival of the Spanish, sometime in the 15th or maybe 14th century.",
        "Until now, where at the site of Xultun in the last couple of years we've been able to uncover some wall paintings that actually replicate the kind of numerical tables that we see in the much later codices in a late classic, probably the early 800s, house in the site of Xultun that has those same tables painted on the walls.",
        "They were astronomy tables, or...?",
        "Yeah, there's one table that is essentially a count of days in the periods of the moon, a very accurate account of the cycle of the moon, calculating it out over a period of 162 lunations so that it has an error of only about 20 seconds from observed averages.",
        "Give us a little bit of perspective on when the Maya culture existed and where - how far spread it was in geography.",
        "Well, what we think of as the classic Maya civilization exists from around the second century of the common era until around the ninth century.",
        "But Maya civilization extends quite a bit further back in time from that, maybe as far back as a couple thousand before the common era.",
        "And then the Maya are still around today.",
        "And so saying that the civilization no longer exists is a bit insulting.",
        "I mean, there are more than seven million Maya still around.",

        "No, essentially what we do is we use space-based observation in order to get a perspective on the Earth to identify how human beings have affected the planet over long periods of time.",
        "That can be a matter of identifying archaeological sites from the marks that human beings have left or identifying irrigation patterns or ancient fields, things like that, so just simply doing it from space, observing the Earth rather than the stars.",
        "Dr.",
        "Canuto, we'll see if we can get the phone lines to work a little bit better.",
        "Can you tell us about the pyramid Chichen Itza, an example of what amazing architects the Maya were?",
        "Of course, the Maya, of course, (unintelligible) paid very close attention to the movement of the sun throughout the year, north and south along the horizon.",
        "And they often built buildings in accordance with those patterns so that in fact they would be aligned with the planets at particular points throughout the year that were of some relevance, what we tend to call the equinoxes and solstices.",
        "And in the case of this one very important and very famous building called The Castillo by the Spaniards many year later, at the site of Chichen Itza, which is located in the northern part of the Maya ruins, the Maya built a building in such a way that on the equinoxes, the sun would rise at a certain angle to this building in such a way that it cast shadows and light along the staircases, the sides of the walls and the staircases, in such a way to create a pattern that looked like a diamondback pattern of what is essentially a snake, a snake body, as it seems to slither down from the sky and head towards the water, actually towards the well at the site of Chichen Itza.",
        "So they would play a lot with these types of alignments and so forth to achieve these kinds of special points.",
        "Now it's also important to realize that these particular alignments also look relatively good the day before the equinox, the day after.",
        "It wasn't necessarily just one day.",
        "It was a period of time in which the sun would this play with this particular building.",
        "How did they get to be such great engineers to be able to build these pyramids.",
        "Do we know?",
        "I think that this is one of those, you know, examples of a society that we talk a lot about the collapse and the decline and so forth of the Maya, of Maya civilization, but this is a society that lasted for well beyond 2,000 years in this region.",
        "And so one of the things that we're beginning to really appreciate is the extent to which knowledge was not only accumulated but also passed down from generation to generation or from century to century.",
        "So these were - the cities that were built in 1000 AD were examples of or were the result of over 10,000 years of knowledge about astronomy, about architecture, about the nature of the (unintelligible).",

        "And because the applied science such as in ships, they had no need for that, but obviously you're talking about their engineering ability.",

        "Good question.",

        "And if not, why not?",
        "Certainly they did.",
        "I mean, managing water was probably the most important thing that the ancient Maya had to do in the sense that they live in a place with a very pronounced dry season, where drought is actually very common even beyond the dry season and where much of their building, in addition to their agricultural needs and living needs, requires large amounts of water.",
        "And so you really need to not only predict the - when water is going to be there, you know when it isn't, and you have to have a supply reserved in order to survive and build with and to move it from Point A to Point B effectively.",

        "Could you explain more about the calendrical systems that the Maya used in more detail?",
        "I understand they had a 266-day calendar, as well.",

        "I mean, the Maya used a number of different calendars, three basic calendars during the classic period.",
        "One was a 260-day ritual calendar, not 266 but 260, and a 365-day solar calendar.",
        "And in addition to those, they used what we call a long count, essentially a count of days since fairly arbitrary zero day in the distant past."

        "And then for a ceremonial calendar, we rely generally on a seven-day ceremonial calendar, and the important day in that ceremonial calendar may vary with a particular religious interest, but in general we can talk about a day not only as being the 21st of December but as being Friday the 21st of December.",

        "That was a katun.",

        "Yes, I suppose I - that very explanation, I think you get basically the understanding.",
        "And I think one of the things that also has to be appreciated with today's date especially and the idea of this large cycle is that this is best understood as an anniversary date, that is this is the day in which the calendar, as it begins counting from its zero day, now appears to look - the number of days that have passed since the creation, to be the exact same day as the creation day itself.",
        "And so this is why this is of such great importance, that it's finally going to start counting from zero, from this initial date.",
        "So today the calendar looks, if you will write it down, it's now reached a certain count that would have been exactly the same count as the day of creation, 5,200 years ago.",
        "So it's one - it's not as if it's a (unintelligible) large cycle.",
        "Tomorrow the calendar would not go back to zero.",
        "The calendar would continue, 13-0-0-0-0-1.",
        "But it's such an important stopping point because it is - it looks like the way it looked the day that the world was created or that creation happened."
