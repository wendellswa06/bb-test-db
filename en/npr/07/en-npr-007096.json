        "Yes there are in fact.",

        "In fact actually one of the more exciting things that is happening here now is for the first time in over 1,000 years in some places, new monuments are being erected in honor of this date.",
        "So there's a sense of revivalism that's occurring at many of the sites throughout Guatemala.",
        "So today, if I've got it correct, Dr. Saturno, is the - today the 13th baktun begins, and 13 is a special number in the Maya?",
        "Yes, yes certainly.",
        "So it's like we celebrate, like seven is special in our culture, 13 is special in theirs?",
        "Well, 20, 13, 18, these are all important numbers that the Maya track and that they likely found resonance with looking at the night sky, sort of that 260-day ceremonial cycle of 13 20s.",
        "Well, three of those make 780, which is the period of Mars.",
        "You can combine that 260-day cycle in a 365-day cycle in order to make another period of time that they felt was resonant.",
        "And joining us for analysis of the president's speech--more analysis--John Dickerson.",
        "He's chief political correspondent for the online magazine Slate.",
        "John, welcome back to the show.",
        "And I wonder if you've heard anything about the timing and goals of this speech.",
        "So there's a lot of ratios that the Maya are calculating between these periods that I think for them probably indicated they were on the right track, right, that they understood the world around them in a meaningful and predictable way, sort of like as we try to unlock, you know, the God particle.",
        "As we get closer and closer to that, we feel like we're on the path to something and that yes, we have a greater understanding of the natural world than we did beforehand."

        "Now however, he sounds just like Nixon did in 1968.",
        "He says he has a plan to end Iraq occupation, but sounds like he had a taste of the military-industrial-complex opiates.",

        "Even Nixon at least paid lip service to law and order.",

        "So the New Year's resolution thing always seemed particularly cruel to me because my resolution is always to improve constantly in everything because otherwise you don't survive.",
        "You know, an improvement to us - to me at the time would've looked like a 10-cent raise.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And they're doing what we've seen them do before, which is open the aperture, not just talk about Iraq, but talk about a global war on terror and put the day-to-day things Americans are seeing on television into a bigger narrative in the hopes that people won't get bogged down in the twists and turns of each day, but see it as a long epoch-making struggle.",
        "Indeed.",
        "Time and again in the speech, the president would go through a list of other places where terrorists have struck--in Indonesia, in Europe, in Africa--pointing out that, indeed, it is a global war on terrorism.",

        "So in that sense, it's very familiar.",
        "But he's been whipsawed so much recently by events with the hurricanes and his Supreme Court picks and fights over the budget that it was a chance to see him in a slightly more methodical kind of laying out his argument in these very large history-making terms, which is different than what we've seen from him in the last couple of months.",
