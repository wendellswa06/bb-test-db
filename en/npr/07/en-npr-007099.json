        "There's more rain and snow in the forecast for the rest of the week and so that will probably delay us where we would be set back and our optimum yields will not be available because we are getting a late start getting the crops in the field.",
        "Still, you're going to get some good prices for those crops?",
        "Certainly and that's what's impacting the market somewhat is the fear that the U.S.",

        "Of course, the other side to that is the more corn and soy gets diverted into fuels the less is available for food.",
        "Well, you have to look at that as a mixed argument.",
        "Because I could make the argument that that food product that comes from the production of fuels you still have the soy meal and you still have the distiller dried grains.",
        "And food industry is getting very creative in being able to use those to use in packaged foods and additionally the livestock industry is coming up with very creative ways of feeding that to offset the whole kernel corn or the whole soybean."
