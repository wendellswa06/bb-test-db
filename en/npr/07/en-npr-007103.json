        "The intellectual movement that provides the backdrop for the story of Carrie Buck is eugenics, the idea that it should be national policy to improve the gene pool.",
        "Described how popular in this country eugenics was a century ago.",
        "It's hard to imagine today, but it was such an enormous fad that it was in all the popular magazines.",
        "You know, it was being touted as a way to really uplift humanity.",
        "It was taught in hundreds of universities, all the best schools - Harvard, Berkeley.",
        "On and on, they taught eugenics courses.",
        "It was just everywhere, and it's striking how few opponents it had.",
        "How does someone - in this case, Carrie Buck - who, in later life, is remembered as somebody who, at the old-age home, read t newspaper every day and tried to do the crossword puzzle - how is somebody determined to be feebleminded when, indeed, there's no scientific basis for doing that?",
        "Yeah, part of it was the craziness of the intelligence testing of the time, which was just remarkably bad.",
        "I saw some of the questions that she was asked.",
        "The questions were so subjective.",
        "What do you do when a playmate hits you?",
        "That's an intelligence question - and other things like that.",
        "They used this really bogus test to determine that she was a moron, as they said at the time.",
        "And, you know, these tests were being badly used everywhere.",
        "You write a good deal about Oliver Wendell Holmes, and I could say you're trying to reconcile this opinion with Holmes' august record on the bench, but actually, what you're doing more is impeaching that record on the bench.",
        "You find this a man who was seriously lacking in some compassion for people.",
        "That's correct.",
        "I mean - and it pains me a bit because when I was in law school he was held up as a great hero, but, in fact, he was on the wrong side of many issues.",
        "He had some terrible civil rights decisions involving poor blacks in the South, terrible immigration rulings.",
        "And on eugenics, he was a total eugenicist.",
        "He supported eugenics in his legal writings before this case came along.",
        "And in his opinion, he didn't just uphold the Virginia law, he wrote, really, a clarion call say, we need to do a lot more of this.",
        "Our nation is at risk.",
        "Go to it.",
        "Let's sterilize more people.",
        "The Supreme Court's ruling the case of Carrie Buck upheld the Virginia law on sterilization at time when states were actually - state courts were overturning their own laws on sterilization.",
        "It was influential.",
        "How many people, ultimately, in the U.S.",
        "do we think were sterilized under cover of such laws?",
        "Well, we think about 70,000, which is an extraordinary number.",
        "But then, an untold number of other people were just taken away, as Carrie Buck and her mother had been, and kept in colonies so that they couldn't reproduce.",
        "And that's another kind of punishment that eugenics inflicted on a large number of Americans.",
        "You know, there's one other group that, you know, was very terribly harmed, which is all the people who would've immigrated to America but for the 1924 immigration law that was enacted for eugenic reasons.",
        "And this intentionally shut off immigration of Jews, Italians and Asians, who were thought to be genetically less gifted, and prevented a lot of Jews from fleeing Nazi Germany.",
        "And as we know, some letters came to light some years ago in which Otto Frank wrote to the State Department trying to get visas for his family, including his daughter, Anne Frank.",
        "And they were turned down because of this 1924 law.",
        "So it's interesting that when we tell the story of Anne Frank we think that, you know, she died because the Nazis thought that Jews were inferior.",
        "But to some extent, she died because the American Congress thought that Jews and other people like that were inferior and closed the door to them.",
        "If the injustice done to women like Carrie Buck wasn't enough already, it was further compounded by the fact that, very often, women who were sterilized were not told that they'd been sterilized.",
        "That's correct, yeah.",
        "Carrie and her sister, Doris, were sterilized and for years did not know that they were.",
        "Both of them were married and were not aware that they were unable to have children.",
        "And her sister, Doris, later told someone who was investigating her situation that she and her husband had gone to the doctor, and she said that they told her when she was at the Colony for Epileptics and Feebleminded that she'd had some kind of an appendectomy, but she never knew the reason.",
        "And when the word was finally given to her by a journalist later in her life, she and her husband began crying because, finally, it put in perspective what they had been struggling against for years that the state of Virginia not only did to them, but didn't tell them."
