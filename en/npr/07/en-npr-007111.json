        "Locked within the stones of York Minister are the residues of pollution churned out in the 19th century, by the factories and power plants of Britain's Industrial Revolution.",
        "Those residues slowly permeate to the surface of the stone with alarming effect.",
        "All the salts can actually build up in the microstructure of the stone and eventually crack it, and large pieces will start to fall off the building.",

        "That's right, olive oil.",
        "Wilson can explain the science.",
        "The main component of olive oil is something called oleic acid.",
        "And the nice thing with oleic acid is it has one end of it that will selectively react with the stone.",
        "And then another end - which is a very long hydrocarbon chain - will give you the hydrophobic properties to repel the water.",
        "The oleic acid gets mixed with another substance to create the protective coating.",
        "Tests have been carried out using samples of the cathedral's stone.",
        "Wilson says it's early days but the results are looking good.",
        "One of the world's greatest Gothic cathedrals somehow survived all that pillaging and all those fires.",
