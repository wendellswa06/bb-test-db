        "Comeback records always worry me, especially when they're made by one of my heroes, and I'd heard stories about Gil Scott-Heron recently, about drug arrests and prison terms and other troubles.",

        "I mean, having access wherever you are to the entire codex and not only the images, but to a new transcription of the text, so that's the Greek written out in electronic form with tagging so that people can use it for linguistic purposes, they can search for word patterns.",

        "These are kids who argue with their parents, who refuse to follow through on chores, maybe argue with their teachers, blame other people for their own mistakes.",

        "For comparison, Keyes gave the same extensive psychological work-up to a group of teenagers raised by their biological parents.",

        "We found that most of the adolescents, adopted and non-adopted, were psychologically healthy - overwhelmingly psychologically healthy.",
        "That being said, Keyes did find what she calls an adoption effect.",
        "There's a slightly increased risk for the adopted kids, especially ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder."

        "And similarly for oppositional defiant disorder - ODD - nearly a doubling of the risk.",
