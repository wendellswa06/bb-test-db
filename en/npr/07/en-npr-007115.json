        "But one thing you won't find here is a Zoom light or any other kind of light for teeth whitening.",
        "Dentist Eric Morrison says the jury's still out on whether the light is effective.",
        "That's very true.",
        "What they're showing is, is that it isn't providing a significant difference in the result.",
        "Meaning if you want to whiten your teeth, bleaching gels used alone can be just as effective as sitting in your dentist's office under a light.",
        "The first bit of evidence that light-activated systems may not enhance the results of bleaching was published in a dentistry journal back in 2003.",
        "Researcher Lee Hansen explains there was an assumption that heat from the light served as a catalyst to decompose the bleaching gel.",
        "That's the theory behind it.",
        "But it's incorrect for two reasons.",
        "Hansen, who's a retired chemistry professor, explains in order to accelerate the chemical reaction of the gel, you'd need a decent amount of ultraviolet light and heat.",
        "But most of the UV light is filtered out of the whitening lamps because the exposure would sunburn people's gums.",
        "So all you have in the light is visible light, and so none of that light is absorbed.",
        "It's all simply reflected back out so it can't do anything.",
        "To test his theory, Hansen's colleagues at Clinical Research Associates - considered to be the Consumer Reports of dentistry - tried a combination of bleach and light on a small group of patients.",
        "On one side of their mouths they used bleaching gel alone, and on the other side they added the light.",
        "At the end of the study all the teeth were whiter, but there was no difference between the two sides.",
        "Dentist Gerry Kugel of Tufts University says this one study was by no means a final word on light-activated bleaching."
