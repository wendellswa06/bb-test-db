        "But I do think one can say this - that there are times when moving too fast and creating a political backlash can set back the cause.",
        "I'm not sure that Bill Clinton's, for instance, decision to do gays in the military right at the beginning of his administration - 1993 - even though I fervently believe that gays should be able to serve openly in the military - actually did the cause of gay rights a lot of good.",
        "And I think, so, the more measured way that Barack Obama is handling that issue, for instance and the care that we need to take to make sure that judicial decisions on gay marriage don't produce the kind of electoral backlash that in fact leads us to have laws that set back the cause of gay marriage - I think those are really appropriate things to think about.",
        "Or constitutional state amendments - there's been a whole bunch of those.",
        "Doug Kmiec, from the vantage point of the right, would civil unions be seen as a compromise?",
        "Well, I've actually done some writing on this, and I think it is a compromise.",
        "And one of the real problems out here with Proposition 8 is that it has become an all-or-nothing proposition.",
        "You either fully subscribe to gay marriage, or you don't.",
        "Whereas some of us have argued that maybe the solution is complete equality between - among all citizens of California, but the only thing that the state would provide would - to either heterosexual or gay couples - would be a civil union license and that historically the concept - the sacramental concept even - of marriage has been a religious one.",
        "And leave it up to the churches then, in their individual doctrines and practices, to decide whether or not same-sex marriage, as a concept, would exist.",
        "This is a way that some of us have been urging the legislature to get re-involved and the governor to get re-involved to create this equality of civil unions for all people in California and to preserve the religious freedom of the individual churches, rather than leave it up to litigation, which is going to lead one side a winner and one side a loser, which is the opposite of the common ground effort, I think, that the president is trying to pursue.",
        "So, if it's a religious difference, argue it out in religious circles, and then we'd all learn how to pronounce schism?",
        "I think that's right.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "But Troy, I accept the purpose of your argument.",
        "But Doug Kmiec, can you give us some examples from your point of view?",
        "You did earlier, but if you would reemphasize where you think President Obama is reaching out to cultural conservatives?",
        "Well, we have mentioned some already, such as his efforts to work into the political platform of the Democrats efforts to reduce abortion, and I assume that will be backed up with efforts in terms of legislation, his approach to equality, in terms of homosexual persons but not support for gay marriage, his recognition that some appropriate level of - there is a constitutional right, he's acknowledged, under the Second Amendment, to - the right to bear arms, but it's subject reasonable gun control.",
        "One can say all of those are at least moderate Republican positions.",
        "But, you know, even more importantly than that, Neal, is that I think Obama's sophistication and intelligence on this transcends the usual political labels.",
        "He understands that what our history has often been about, as the author Robert Bella has mentioned, is a cyclical contest between individual freedom on the one hand, which is nourished at times when things are good, and coming together in solidarity as a community, when we'd really need to address problems that individualism causes.",
        "And so, for example, I think this - it's not a republican or democratic issue to allow extensive amounts of poverty, or the polarization of income, or a health system that leaves tens of millions of people without insurance, or environmental policy that not only fails to lead the world to greater sustainability, but actually in the past eight years stood in the way of that sustainability.",
        "It seems to me both parties have to be for addressing the poor, for addressing the needs of people without insurance, for addressing the needs of the environment.",
        "And it's a question of recognizing how we can come together to accomplish those objectives, rather than to say there's one list - list A for the Republicans and list B for the Democrats.",
        "But to be fair, there are conservatives who argue the dismissal of the Bush administration official who was in charge of running the AIDS program in Africa, widely seen as perhaps the best thing in the Bush administration by many people - that that was a bowing-down to pressures on the left, that the president's decision sign legislation - or executive order on the second day that would reverse the decision to provide funding for birth control groups that provide abortions - that those things are not very graceful gestures to the right.",
        "Well, it's not a perfect system, and President Obama is not one who's going to resign his party membership, so we're realistic about that as well.",
        "When we say, we can find common ground, it doesn't mean that our differences totally evaporate.",
        "They will remain.",
        "And one of the things that, I think, for example, on Mexico City, we learned was that, even though I opposed the timing of that, as well as its reversal, I also now have a better grasp of the health needs that that prohibition was leaving unmet.",
        "And one of the things that, I think, going forward, by virtue of that discussion, is that we will be able to work together to meet those health needs without getting abortion entangled in that discussion.",
        "Peter?",
        "I think - I am not a conservative, but it seems to me, if one looks at this from the point of view of a conservative in the culture wars, one also has to ask the question, how well were conservatives doing during the Bush administration?",
        "How much did they actually get from Republican governors?",
        "I think there's a pretty good argument to be made that, in fact, it was a fairly radical kind of libertarian economic agenda that was pursued, and conservatives - evangelicals and other social conservatives - were taken for granted.",
        "If you believe that there are cultural forces, certainly on an issue like gay rights, that I think are pushing America in a more liberal direction, I think that the position of simply voting for a Republican Party that is losing on some of these culture war issues is not actually - has not been a very productive place to be.",
        "And I think that's why it's so valuable that there're evangelicals and other social conservatives who are broadening out and thinking about new kinds of strategies for getting to the kind of society that they would like to live in.",

        "There are countless other examples, but I've heard so much anti-immigrant rhetoric on so-called Protestant - that's what it largely is - talk radio, not because they have anti-Catholic bias now, but because of the underlying public that the Christian right - the Republicans tried to entreat to join in the 1970s with their southern strategy.",
