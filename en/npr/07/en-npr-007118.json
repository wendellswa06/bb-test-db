        "Yes, but I do think there is still the great possibility that immigration could reignite the cultural wars.",
        "I mean, to go back to the 1920s, immigration was really at the center of the culture wars of the 1920s, and Prohibition was very much an issue about anti-Catholicism in the 1920s.",
        "I think there is - America is in the midst of a massive cultural, demographic shift, as the result of the post-1965 immigration, particularly in this time of economic downturn.",
        "It's not hard to imagine that we could have rising anti-illegal immigrant, and even rising legal immigrant demagoguery.",
        "And I think that it's interesting that Obama has actually, I think, basically tried to put that issue on the backburner.",
        "He has not taken up immigration reform as one of his central issues, which I think is wise.",
        "But I think there is that great danger out there, and I think that George W.",
        "Bush deserves some credit, it seems to me, for trying to make the Republican Party basically a pro-immigrant, non-demagoguery party.",
        "And John McCain, for that matter.",
        "And John McCain.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But ultimately, I think, where the Republican Party, I hope, will go is not simply to support people coming to the United States as workers, but to support them coming as possible citizens, so we don't have a kind of guest worker, second class - because I think that will simply perpetuate the hot - the economic and cultural conflict in the country.",
        "Let's get to this email from Leo in Manchester, New Hampshire.",
        "We would do well to remember the so-called culture wars did not just happen.",
        "They are the outgrowth of Nixon's southern strategy, Agnew's attacks on the press and intellectuals.",
        "By the 1990s, the GOP had honed this strategy by virtually becoming the party of the religious right.",
        "Mr. Obama's attempt to be bipartisan is laudable, but I fear Republicans form up behind Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin.",
        "Cultural rapprochement will be a long time coming.",
        "And the fact of the matter is - not meaning to put an argument in Leo's mouth that isn't there - but you could make (Laughing) similar - people on the right could make similar points about going back to the New Deal and various other times.",
        "But the fact of the matter, Doug Kmiec, a lot of this depends on the new direction of the Republican Party.",
        "It does.",
        "It depends on the willingness of the Republican Party to identify people who can see that there is a common basis on which agreement can be found, that the Republican Party is not just everybody - everyone for themselves, a kind of a total libertarianism, but in fact, that it's a respect for individual freedom but recognizing that there's a place for government.",
        "And the place for government is where individuals cannot do for themselves.",
        "One-third of the world's population is estimated to be infected with tuberculosis.",
        "That gives you some idea of the challenge that hundreds of governments, nonprofits, and scientists have taken on when they announced a plan that they say could stop TB by the year 2015.",
        "They say $3 billion per year would fund new drugs, and get treatments to people who need them.",
        "NPR's Brenda Wilson reports.",
        "And that's why President Obama, I think, has struck the right tone on this in almost every practical sense.",
        "When he talks about his faith-based initiative, for example, in response to your previous caller, he's not overlooking the fact that great things can be done by small groups and individuals.",
        "Indeed, those are the most important things, those are the things he appreciates the most, by virtue of his community organizing background.",
        "And so, one of the first things that the Office of Faith-Based Initiatives will do will be to make sure that the smallest possible group has the technical capacity to take advantage of the public resources it would need to accomplish its goals, without, at the same time, diminishing that individual initiative."
