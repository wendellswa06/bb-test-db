        "We do know some of the names that were being talked about: Emil Jones, who is an African-American state Senate president from Illinois.",
        "He was Obama's mentor there.",
        "He's 73 years old; Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky; Jessie Jackson Jr., another congressman from Chicago; also Tammy Duckworth, who was the head of the Veteran Affairs.",

        "How did this all get started, this tit for tat?",
        "Well, Madeline, it all started in Bolivia, where President Evo Morales, an indigenous leader who wants to transform his country to socialism, has been under siege.",
        "The eastern region of that country, which is wealthier and less indigenous than the rest, has been protesting against policies, like his land reforms and his close ties to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.",
        "And the protests have been getting violent.",
        "On Thursday, at least eight people died, and Venezuela has inserted itself in Bolivia.",
        "President Chavez says he's going to send military forces to fight against anti-government forces, if Morales is in trouble or if he gets toppled.",
        "So, where does the United States come in, and the ambassadors?",
        "Well, both Chavez and Morales frequently criticize the U.S., saying the Bush administration wants to overthrow their governments and take over the natural resources in those countries.",
        "And in Bolivia, the ambassador, Philip Goldberg, had met with opposition leaders.",
        "The United States says it's not taking sides, but Morales decided on Wednesday to expel Philip Goldberg.",
        "And that set off a whole chain of events that ended with Chavez pulling his ambassador from Washington and expelling the American ambassador from Caracas.",
        "And then, didn't Washington expel the Bolivian ambassador from Washington?",
        "Washington did expel the Bolivian ambassador in retaliation, and Washington also expelled the Venezuelan ambassador.",
        "But Chavez had preempted the American move and had already ordered his ambassador back to Venezuela anyway.",
        "So, Juan, all these ambassadors being recalled and expelled, what does it all mean?",
        "I think what worries some people is that Chavez has said that he might cut off oil supplies to the United States.",
        "So, he says he'll do that only if the United States invades.",
        "For the Bush administration, this means just more headaches in its waning days, and the United States is not popular in Latin American.",
        "I think more importantly, it just shows the huge challenges that the incoming government in Washington, whether it's Obama or McCain, will face in trying to patch up relations here.",

        "This connection is laid out in what's believed to be the suspect's anti-Semitic manifesto, which was posted online just before the attack.",
        "What jumped out at me immediately was that this was very closely connected to the Christchurch shootings of just a couple of weeks ago.",
        "The shooter had modeled his attack after Brenton Tarrant, the killer who carried out that attack.",
        "What are connections that you find, as someone who has studied manifesto after manifesto left behind after horrendous incidents like this?",

        "And in a lot of the cases that we've seen over the last year, those two figures in particular are often cited as examples.",

        "It's white supremacy.",
        "I mean, it is definitely the promotion of a white European descent kind of in-group against anybody who doesn't fit that definition.",
        "But the frame that we see for this right now - and it's not necessarily a new frame, but it's particularly notable right now - is that, you know, a lot of this hostility, a lot of this racism and bigotry is really being phrased in an immigration context.",

        "And then that videotape would be passed around.",
        "Somebody would have to carry it somewhere or mail it somewhere.",
        "This process was expensive, and it was slow.",
        "And with the rise of the Internet, an extremist ideologue or a mass shooter can create a document, distribute it instantly to thousands of people who then spread it to thousands more.",

        "So we're going to - very similar situation, if it turns out on Friday, for example there's a job report coming out for January, if it turns out that jobs surge, which there's some early indications that they will, people are going to say, oh, we were wrong, maybe we're not on the cusp of a recession.",

        "What politicians adapt is our attitudes toward the economy.",
        "Most of us, economist or not, have a sort of Keynesian idea that the economy's like a great engine and if it's slowing down we have to juice it up, stimulate it with either tax cuts of a strange form, just giving people money, as oppose to changing their incentives or changing monitory policy in a way that it is going to somehow put more money in the system."
