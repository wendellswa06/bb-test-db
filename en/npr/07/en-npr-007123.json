        "Well, interest rates have been - when people look at the relationship they find that surprisingly there isn't a very big relationship.",
        "And you're right, there should be, and the reason there isn't, I suspect, is that if you go out as an individual and you have been a renter and you decide to borrow money to buy a home you don't drive up interest rates even though there's more money being borrowed than before and the reason is that you're a small part of a very large market, you have some kind of affect which is just very, very, very, very small.",
        "And it's surprising but the U.S.",
        "government is a relatively small borrower, at the current level.",
        "We could live in the world where that changes, obviously, if we could continue to live beyond our means, but right now it's surprising how small the impact on interest rates has been.",

        "As many of you have read in the media, I hired the Flynn intel group in 2016 before the election with a mandate to help me understand where the Turkish-American relationship is and where it's going and what the obstacles are to the relationship.",
        "I do want to salute Rex's interest in economic history.",
        "It's important when we face these current of issues of recession and monitoring fiscal policy that we remember that we've done these things in the past, and it's remarkably difficult to figure out whether there were actually successful or not.",
        "There is a general view that often it's too little too late that the government responds either with federal - with physical monitory policy after we're already in a recession leading to effects such as inflation down the road.",
        "But it's very difficult to assess these and as a result we're sort of in a faith-based economics world where, unfortunately, in the world of macroeconomics it's very difficult to discern and measure what works and what doesn't.",
        "Well it's a transition for the moment for macroeconomics to real estate.",

        "Do interest rate cuts by the Fed then turn around and affect interest rates on people's mortgages?",
        "On some loans, not on the typical 30-year fixed rate mortgage because those are actually influenced by the bond market.",
        "They track the ten-year bond, which is really how long a 30-year mortgage really lives.",
        "So bond markets, the folks on Wall Street and around the world who are bidding on those bonds will decide those interest rates and if they get spooked about inflation, they could actually go up.",
        "They could actually go up even though the Fed interest rates are going down?",
        "The Fed has very little control or influence over 30-year fixed rate mortgages.",
        "They do have influence, a very direct influence, on some other mortgages that will put a lot of money into people's pockets.",
        "Now, is there any sign that the housing market is on the mend?",
        "Not a lot.",
        "What's - but the thing to remember is this is a particularly slow time of the market every year.",
        "What's really going to be interesting is going to be - to watch what happens this spring starting February, late February and see what kind of pent-up demand there might be.",
        "A lot of people have been sitting on the sidelines for maybe two years, buyers and sellers alike.",
        "And, I'm even getting even more questions from people about is it time to buy?",
        "Is it time to get back in?",
        "What's going to happen?",

        "And I'm wondering is this, you know, is this anything like the experience - someone buys a car and then they drive past a car lot and find that the car that they just bought was a lot cheaper somewhere else."

        "I'm not sure if the trend is there nationwide, but here in Salt Lake City, a lot of rental properties even previously low-rent apartments are being listed as condos to be sold for a quick buck.",
        "My lease is nearly up at my current complex and in my search for a new abode, three of the places I've had my eye on recently underwent this conversion, I'd stay where I am but they will become condos in a few months' time as well.",
        "How do you see this affecting renters in the future?",
        "Well, in most places, that's exactly the opposite of what's happening.",
        "Condos that were - that developers were trying to sell were switched over into rentals, and that was suppressing the rent being charged to tenants to a point.",
        "That's not to say the rents have become real great bargains.",
        "And in your market, if that's what you're seeing, this - you only have to two choices: you continue to rent or you try to buy.",
        "Make the decision about buying though not so much what happens to your rent next year but what your plans of are over the next three to five years because you have to be prepared to hang onto it that long to make sure you don't lose money.",

        "In the latest data that we announced yesterday, our 10-city index went - over the last year, went down 8.4 percent on the year.",
        "And that's a record, and it's actually been accelerating for a couple of years now - the declines, or the rate of increase has been going down for a couple of years.",
        "So no, I don't see in this - our latest report - any signs that we're hitting bottom."
