        "So that means six months out?",
        "A year out?",
        "Well, it's very hard to forecast.",
        "If you look at the last major cycle - that was in the early 1990s - home prices were dropping rapidly until just about the end of the Gulf War in the early of '91, and then they seem to have stopped that acceleration downward.",
        "And it seems like, I think, the best story I can give is that our victory in that war somehow produced a sense of optimism, suddenly.",
        "And then, home prices just stagnated - they stopped falling.",
        "In the present situation, you know, I don't know that we have any good news suddenly coming that - I don't know.",
        "Maybe, if the new administration comes in, we'll find some inspiration in another 11 months but I just don't see anything happening right now.",
        "And the interest rate cuts by the Fed this week and last, what do you - what effect do you think they're going to have?",
        "Well, I think Ben Bernanke, you know, he's an expert on to the Great Depression, and an expert on other times of great financial disorder.",
        "This is one of those times.",
        "We're seeing a lot of financial problems, and he wants to be aggressive in stimulating the economy.",
        "And these two moves together are quite aggressive measures and I hope he's right.",
        "You know, this kind of thing is, unfortunately, it gets interpreted in two different ways.",
        "One is great, the interest rates are lower.",
        "But the other is hey, the Fed must be worried, and so I kind of wonder what's going to happen to confidence as we move forward.",
        "Well, particularly last week when the rate cut was announced not on the normal run of meetings that was scheduled for this week and before the markets opened.",
        "Yeah, that was quite an exciting day.",
        "Monday of last week, markets around the world seemed to be in a freefall.",
        "Of course, we were protected by Martin Luther King Day so our markets weren't open, and that's when the Fed acted very decidedly.",
        "That was impressive.",
        "And it seemed to stabilize things.",
        "So for now, okay.",
        "But I still, you know, the big thing that worries me is that we've already lost about a trillion dollars in home value in this country, and it's still going down.",
        "And, you know, the long-term implications of that for balance sheets of homes and business - homeowners and businesses and so many people suggest that there's still a lot of action to come.",
        "Let's hope it's good.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "My wife and I refinanced a couple of years ago, and we're probably atypical.",
        "We don't have our house mortgaged up to the hilt.",
        "We have several thousand dollars available to us in our second mortgage, and we got a note from Countrywide yesterday that they would be no longer honoring requests for second mortgages without a reappraisal.",
        "So I agree with the professor because I don't think the individual financial institutions have identified what each loan's potential risk is, and I think we are way far from the bottom.",
        "And that suggest that - are you a subprime borrower?"

        "Wonderful.",
        "No, we just happened to refinance a couple of years ago.",
        "And like I said, we have really never touched the line of credit available to us, but we now have to have our home reappraised if we want to do that.",
        "And, you know, I told my wife I think they're trying to identify what each loan is actually worth because they're not sure what they've lost themselves.",
        "Elizabeth Razzi, let me follow up with you on that.",
        "Is Gordon alone in this or is this happening in a lot of places?",
        "Well for one thing, I don't think Gordon is as alone as he thinks he is in being a responsible borrower.",
        "There are a lot of people out there who have a lot of equity in their house, they have been really responsible with their debts, and they have been sort of sitting on the sidelines.",
        "I think a really important thing that is going - once the markets, the financial markets recover so that credit-worthy people, especially those after jumbo mortgages, those are for more than $417,000, are able to get mortgages easily and at good rates, that will really free up a big log jam in the system.",
        "That part of the market is still afraid to lend money right now, and it's keeping people out of the home-buying market.",
        "Well, it's funny I got another request in the mail today as a circumstance where it was just a mass mailer from Countrywide wanting to know if I wanted to refinance because the rates were falling.",
        "And so I guess they're trying to generate income from that side of the equation, now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I was wondering, Robert Shiller, how long do you - are we still, or obviously still shaking out the subprime problems?",
        "Very much so, you know.",
        "The president's proposal has not been enacted yet, and so even though Congress seems to be moving fast, it hasn't happened yet.",
        "You know, it is possible that these kinds of measures will work.",
        "In the Great Depression - I hate to bring that up - but home prices fell about 30 percent between 1925 and 1933.",
        "But then, the Roosevelt administration created what was called the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which lent to homeowners who were in distress.",
        "That stopped it.",
        "Home prices stopped falling at that point, and so it is possible that this kind of - these kind of measures, if we get going and we empower, you know, Fannie or Freddie to make loans or FHA - on larger scale or for bigger mortgages, it is possible that that could change the mood of the market.",

        "…(unintelligible) add, while everyone's waiting for Congress and the administration to pass a stimulus program, they've refinancing sort of -there's been a rush of refinancings of - among credit-worthy borrowers over the last two months or so as interest rates have come down, and that's putting real dollars into people's budgets immediately, and that will continue months after months.",
        "If you take a $200,000 mortgage which is not untypical, and it refinances them from six-and-a-quarter to the current rate of about 5.5 percent for a credit-worthy borrower, you can save up - yeah, but almost a hundred dollars a month.",
        "I mean, $95 each month through the year, that's a lot of money that's spendable.",
        "Here's an e-mail question on the same point, from David(ph) in Fox Lake, Wisconsin.",
        "Why do pundits keep asking if the subprime crisis is over when the vast majority of subprime loans haven't even begun to reset?",
        "Robert Shiller, what does he mean by reset, and is he right?",
        "Well, a rest refers to the original plan.",
        "When you get an adjustable rate mortgage, the contract has certain dates when the rates can be adjusted based on the level of interest rates.",
        "And some of these were two years or some three years.",
        "A lot of them are coming into that period now, this year, and some of them next year.",
        "And so this has been a big worry because interest rates had gone up a lot.",
        "Now, they're coming back down.",
        "So, you know, the problem is that subprimes are in higher level of default now.",
        "And the prospect - it's not just incidentally due to the rates coming down, or the rates having gone up, because we'll correct that with rate cuts.",
        "But it's also that home prices have gone down.",
        "So a lot of people don't feel the same incentives to continue paying on their mortgage when the home price is down because they may be under water - some of them - most of them are not - but there are some who - their mortgage exceeds the value of their house now.",
        "And, historically, that has been a big predictor of defaults.",
        "It's when people see that they're under water that the mortgage market, the housing market is declining, that they start to default in great numbers.",
        "So even though interest rates are coming down, unless it perks up the market, we can't be sure that it's going to solve the problem.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Gordon.",

        "That's really good thinking.",
        "One of the very best reasons, though, to go for a 15, and it's not necessarily the right decision for everybody but what goes in favor of it is that you do get a break on the rate.",
        "It's about a half of a point right now.",
        "The other reason you might consider it is if your retirement day is within 15 or 20 years, you may not want to stretch out your mortgage indebtedness another 30 years starting the clock right now.",
        "As we interact more with machines, smart speakers, self-checkout kiosks, I wonder if we'll even start to have relationships with machines.",

        "On the other hand, if you want more flexibility in your monthly budget, you can still take out the 30-year mortgage or even a 20-year term, and prepay the principal, especially in the early years of the loan, and retire that early.",
        "The advantage that gives you is if times get tough, you can revert just to the regular amount that's owed on the 30-year schedule, and so you, basically, can give yourself a free loan any time you need it.",

        "I don't think we have any event like that happening right now.",
        "The thing that I see right now is that the commercial real estate apartment buildings, that's the apartment component of commercial real estate, has been booming also.",
        "And that's because it kind of substitutes for residential real estate.",
        "There - I mean, home prices and apartment prices tend to move together.",
        "And so we've seen a boom in both of these.",
        "It's interesting that it goes beyond commercial buildings, as well.",
        "We have seen land prices going up.",
        "We've seen art prices going up.",
