        "I have to ask, though, Professor Hoffman and General Scales, some people have the impression that the complication, at least in Iraq, has been that the very presence of troops seems to inspire opposition and insurgency.",
        "General Scales?",
        "That's true, but the importance of having a robust ability to put ground troops into affected regions is to prevent that from happening.",
        "In an insurgency, the pre-war is far more important than the war itself.",
        "It's important to be able to build a force that can do stability operations, humanitarian assistance, that could help to build allied armies or the armies of alien nations before the insurgency gets out of hand.",
        "And that is, by its very nature, a very manpower intensive endeavor.",
        "Professor Hoffman?",
        "In my view, I think one of the problems that we've encountered in Iraq is in fact that we haven't had sufficient troops there, that really to secure and to stabilize the highly volatile violence environment like Iraq, you would need at least 20 security forces per thousand population.",
        "That would mean a total of about 535,000 troops there.",
        "And I think the inability to have sufficient forces there created a vacuum of authority that breathed life into the insurgency.",
        "So if I understand the argument that both of you are making in favor of increased Army and Marine Corps in particular is that you - you might need special forces and forward-based units to secure a target.",
        "You need an expansion of the Army and the Marine Corp to maintain whatever has been gained?",
        "Between welfare and social security, the Martins get just over $1500 a month.",
        "The mortgage on the home is about half that.",
        "Mary Martin says the children look out for each other.",
        "I suppose if I could use one word it would be traumatized, because their world essentially changed from one day to another.",
        "They're not even sure what the consequences of this are going to be yet because they feel like everything is still all up in the air.",
        "Joanna, who do they tend to hold responsible?",
        "You know, a lot of Cypriots blame themselves that they should have seen this coming and held politicians accountable for the country's mess.",
        "They also blame Greece because Cypriot banks invested heavily in Greek bonds.",
        "And a lot of people feel especially bullied by Germany, which is, of course, providing most of the eurozone loans.",
        "Just a couple of days ago, I met a woman named Angela Panagiotou, and she works at Laiki Bank, which is going to be closed down.",
        "Angela and her husband both work at the bank.",
        "They have five kids and a mortgage.",
        "So, she feels very unfairly treated.",
        "So, here she is.",

        "She has become a figure of a lot of mistrust and I would even say hate.",

        "President Nicos Anastasiades says yes.",
        "But, you know, many Cypriots are really skeptical now.",
        "They know how disastrous exiting the euro is going to be.",
        "You know, it's inflation, they import so much and those imports would be prohibitively expensive if they left the euro and returned to the Cypriot pound.",
        "But they feel like the eurozone just destroyed them by dismantling their banking system, which has been the heart of their economy for the last 40 years.",
        "Earlier this week, I met this couple, Marinos Pourgouris and his wife, Yianna Ioannou.",
        "He's a literature professor and she's a clinical psychologist.",
        "They used to live in the U.S.",
        "and moved back to Cyprus.",
        "Marinos says that what happened in Cyprus, that this big hit on the banks, should scare everyone else in the eurozone.",
        "And he says it's about trust.",
        "I don't know how they can fix it and I don't know how they, politicians, economists, you know, can convince people elsewhere in Europe that their money's not threatened.",
        "And for us it's totally gone, that trust in the system.",

        "Well, you know, that's still unclear.",

        "There's very little fuss.",
        "People were expecting a bank run but people were actually quite calm.",
        "I should say that the Cypriots are also very resilient.",
        "Yianna, the clinical psychologist who's married to Marinos, the professor, she says Cypriots have been through really, really tough times before, like, you know, the 1974 invasion by Turkey, which devastated the country and actually divided it in two.",
        "And she sort of only half-jokingly said that she'd rather live off the land instead of living in this constant state of fear and uneasiness with some of this eurozone drama.",
        "We'll plant some vegetables.",

        "I'm very excited.",
        "What about in an era of foreclosures, this thing called reverse mortgage.",
        "What is it and who has generally been getting it?",
        "Well, the reverse mortgages generally go to elderly people who have built up some equity and they want to figure out how to live well.",
        "And so they can take a mortgage out.",
        "And at the end of the day, being - going into nursing home, whatever, basically, they've got - the equity has been lent to them.",

        "It depends on your age, it depends on you circumstances.",
        "My challenge, I think, and I think why we're talking about it is because it doesn't work for everyone.",
        "Some people can get ripped off from it.",
        "Well, let's talk about this specifically in the context of people who are in the throes of potential foreclosure.",
        "When you have these reverse mortgages, you have people essentially saying, hey, you get the house, I get the money out of the house.",
        "When you have a situation where you already owe a lot of money on the house or you owe - you're mortgage payments are more than perhaps you can keep up with, how does that affect your ability to get a reverse mortgage?",
        "The only people who are good prime for reverse mortgages are people who have clear equity.",
        "In other words, you have a mortgage of 300,000 -let's say your house is worth 700,000.",
        "You can get back reverse payments of $2,000 a month or you can get the $300,000.",

        "And there are people who are distressed and want to sell.",
        "So if you can do that, that's a wonderful thing.",
        "Also, if you can combine resources with people and think about ways not to buy a house, but to buy an investment opportunity, I think that's a great thing.",
        "That's it exactly.",
        "And I think undeniably the 21st century is an (unintelligible) where we will face not only conventional, more traditional threats, but also chronic prolonged threats from our regular adversaries that will necessitate a very flexible and nimble and adaptive military.",
        "General Scales, you've suggested in the past that putting the bulk of investment in military spending in the Air Force and even the Navy is a trend that goes back to really the Cold War and the Eisenhower era.",
        "And so we have a strange situation here, where the strategy for fighting the conflicts during the Cold War were oftentimes driven by the availability of numbers.",
        "Professor Hoffman, it seems to me, though, I can remember a time a few years ago when we kept hearing that the U.S.",
        "military has to be lighter, it has to be more surgical, it has to be more reliant on technology, smart people, smart bombs, that sort of thing.",
        "Well, I think in environments involving counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, the human dimension is so enormously important that the kinds of intelligence that our forces need to operate on isn't the kind of intelligence that's gleaned from signal intercepts necessarily or from satellite photographs, but from human intelligence.",
        "And you need, on the one hand, I think, sufficient troops that are capable of providing a level of security that engender the confidence of the population in the authorities and in the ability of the authorities to create a secure environment that lasts.",
        "But also you need to have troops that are trained to get this type of human intelligence and then to act on it very quickly.",
        "So technologies certainly can enhance that, but it's not in and of itself an answer.",
        "Does that mean an increased number of ground troops, Army and Marines specifically, contribute anything to try and confront the danger of nuclear proliferation?",
        "General Scales?",
        "Oh, I think it absolutely does.",
        "Remember, most of the states that we fear most in terms of nuclear proliferation are failed or failing states.",
        "And in order to prevent them from spreading their nuclear capabilities, these types of operations are very important.",
        "And the more we can do to build democratic, economically viable states in the region lessens the threat that the states who seek to proliferate nuclear weapons will do so."
