        "So there are hours and hours that go by when you're not needed, and so I just - I chose to, when I started the theater company, just turn myself into a playwright and, you know, brought the guitar along so I could fill that time.",
        "But yeah, once I'm in - once I'm in front of the camera or on a stage with really good people, I still enjoy it.",
        "I look forward to the next time I get to do it.",
        "Well, what about this character we just heard a little snippet of in \"\"Answer Man\"\"?",
        "That was a pretty serious, grumpy guy, but also very funny.",
        "Did - was he fun to play?",
        "He was, because I didn't have a clue as to how do him.",
        "I - the chance of failing miserably was certainly on the table.",
        "And you know, after 50 movies, that's a reason to take something.",
        "Creatively you're challenged.",
        "You will be challenged throughout the entire process of shooting a film.",

        "He was - he had been with that character for three years.",
        "So I had this wonderful source sitting right there.",
        "So I just, you know, peppered him with questions and used and abused John mercilessly in order to kind of pull this guy off.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is a guy who people think has all the answers to life because he has a direct connection to God, and yet time after time, which I thought was the funny - some of the funniest moments were, you know, when you were trying to meditate or you were trying to pray and, you know, it just wouldn't work.",

        "Well, he's completely dysfunctional, you know, when he looks in the mirror.",

        "He just can't figure his own life out.",
        "Right.",

        "You famously have lived not in Hollywood, not in New York, but you've stayed in your hometown of Michigan.",
        "And how has that sort of fed your creativity or helped you?",
        "Or has it?",
        "Because I think you made that choice because of your family.",
        "But does it also feed your creativity?",
        "Well, Kathleen and I, we really wanted to raise the kids in a place we understood.",
        "And we're both from Michigan, and that was the choice.",
        "Right or wrong, good or bad for the career, that's what we were going to do.",
        "The career was a close second, but it was second.",
        "And it's, happy to say, 20 years later and more, we - it worked out fine.",
        "What it did creatively, you know, aside - it - you know, you give up being the biggest star in the history of stars.",
        "You end that quest simply because you're living in the Midwest.",
        "And that's really not of interest to the people who make big stars out of you.",
        "But creatively, it brought back the fun of what I do, the reason I got into it in the first place as a young actor.",
        "It brought the enthusiasm back for film.",

        "It wasn't cinema.",
