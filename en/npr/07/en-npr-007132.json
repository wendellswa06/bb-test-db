        "Good.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Well, let me just say, this is a wonderful pleasure for me, because Mr. Daniels, you have been my favorite actor for quite some time.",
        "And that's one of those days that you sit, you know, when you're in the theater, when you're home watching a video and you just think that to yourself and you - you know, hope that you might have the chance to express it someday.",
        "And so, this is great, I get a chance to express that.",
        "Well, thanks, Dave.",
        "I appreciate it.",
        "Everybody gets a favorite.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I especially enjoyed seeing the type of range, you know, and the transition that you could make from, you know, the comedic, embarrassingly comedic \"\"Dumb and Dumber\"\" portrayal, you know, into really serious work.",
        "And I think throughout the whole thing, I think maybe it's the choice of roles, I'm not sure, but somehow you always come across as very likeable.",
        "And I wanted to ask you if in choosing your roles, you're really looking toward the general presentation that you end up with as you look over the body of work, the way you as a person come through as an actor.",
        "No, I don't.",
        "You know, that's - I think that suggests image and how I'm perceived by the public.",
        "And I really could care less.",
        "I think the good actors are - that I have admired will play the villains, will, you know, will do anything, you know?",
        "I've played killers, you know, and, of course, and \"\"Dumb and Dumber\"\" and things like that.",
        "So, it's just - the range is kind of just strictly for me.",
        "If people get into it, if they go with it, great.",
        "But I could care less about being likeable or sympathetic or - you know, those are the things that you learn at star school, and I didn't graduate.",
        "So, I really - the range was something I created, one, because I thought that's what actors were supposed to do.",
        "I was brought up that way, to have each character be completely different and - inside and out, and especially inside.",
        "And so that's kind of how I went about it.",
        "It wasn't until I got to Hollywood that I heard the word image and create an image and stick to it and things like that.",
        "And I said, ah, well, you know, I'm not really interested in that.",
        "Again, moving to the Midwest, I felt that the bigger range I had, the more job opportunities in between a \"\"Dumb and Dumber\"\" and a \"\"Gettysburg\"\" and \"\"The Squid and the Whale,\"\" the more jobs I would have, and that's turned out to be true."

        "I remember that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Certainly, \"\"The Purple Rose of Cairo,\"\" playing in that film two roles for Woody Allen, I'll never forget.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, there are all kind of guys, they become your friends.",
        "My idea is that, you know, when I'm, you know, 80 some day, I hope that I'll invite all my characters over for dinner and, you know, listen to them talk to each other."

        "So why was that a turning point for you, \"\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\"\"?",
        "You said that was a turning point.",
        "Well, like any young actor, you're battling the rejection, you know, that you - for every job you get, you don't get 20.",
        "That's probably a good ratio.",
        "The critics, you know, you're going - especially up through the New York Theater, I mean, you say you don't read them but you do.",
        "And when they don't like you, it hurts.",
        "And you start to question whether you're good enough for this business or not, whether you can make a life out of it or a living at it.",

        "I went home and I told Kathleen, I said, I'm going to be able to make a living in this business now.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, because if I'm good enough for Woody, I'm good enough for anybody.",
        "And instantly, the critics - while important, and we all need them and I get it - they didn't matter to me.",
        "It was just - now, it was somebody like that, and there were others leading up to Woody, believed in me.",
        "And so I wasn't alone and I knew I could make it.",
        "Okay.",
        "And Kathleen, we should mention, of course, is your wife.",
        "Yeah.",

        "But then we decided to make an independent film of it, and we shot it in Escanaba, Michigan with a lot of the same actors.",
        "And happily, the late great Harve Presnell played my father in the indie film.",
        "And we fought - we - you know, nobody wanted to distribute it because we didn't have an A-list guy, you know, doing a cameo.",
        "So, we decided to just four-wall it.",
        "And it - we played it on 30, 35 screens, and it did very well, you know, in the upper Midwest.",

        "David, what kinds of liquids do security officials look for?",
        "Among other things, they'd have to worry about the sort of bottles you might find under your sink.",
        "I talked to Chris Ronay(ph), who is former chief of explosives at the FBI, and he used to teach this class for investigators and he said he would stand up in front of the class with chemicals taken literally from other the sink and mix them together and set some of them off.",
        "And his point was that if an agent is searching a house where they think a bomber is, you know, you need to look for all kinds of things.",
        "There's not anything terribly special about a liquid explosive versus a solid explosive.",
        "Ronay said he could think of one company that used to make liquid explosives for commercial use, but he thinks it went out of business."
