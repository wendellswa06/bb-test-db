        "Well, but if the loan turns out to be $60,000 because they offer you other things, you have to be concerned.",

        "Farai, this was such an interesting question that was raised because there are two things going on here.",

        "At the same time, there are choices that we can make as a community to improve where we are.",

        "Well, certainly a lot of this discussion has been largely symbolic.",
        "Whether we're talking about 55 miles of wall or 200-plus miles that the president had been seeking, it's all a fraction of the 2,000-mile border.",
