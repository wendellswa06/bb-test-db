        "There were dozens of busses, in the city, torched.",
        "There were Molotov cocktails hurled through the front windows of the branches of several High Street banks.",
        "And really, that, that caused chaos in this city - not just fear, but chaos -because many of the transport companies in the city closed down their bus services.",
        "And so, millions of people were unable to get to work; unable to get home.",
        "And others just chose to stay at home, such as the wave of really, sort of, unprecedented fear I think, that has been caused by these attacks.",
        "It's being called a terrorist attack, actually, on this city.",
        "Oh yes, I mean there - you're seeing editorials in newspapers here, pointing out that more people have died in Sao Paulo in the last three days, than have died in Baghdad, for example.",
        "They're comparing to al-Qaida, the tactics used by this group, the PCC.",
        "I think that's obviously some exaggeration.",
        "But essentially what they're saying is, you have organized crime commanders based within the jails in Sao Paulo, who are giving orders to people on the outside - who are possibly in debt to the crime faction - and the leaders are, kind of calling in this debt now, at a time of what they see as a war with the state.",
        "And how are they getting the word out?",
        "Smuggled cell phones from inside the prisons?",
        "Yes, there're also suspicions that lawyers for the leaders of the PCC are being used as messengers.",

        "What's the motivation?",
        "What seems to have triggered all of this is a move by the state's authorities, last Friday, to shift the leaders of the PCC to the center of Sao Paulo, to police headquarters, and at the same time about 750, what they would call foot soldier inmates of the PCC to a maximum security jail.",
        "Now that was supposedly to avert a planned wave of prison revolts, but clearly, it backfired.",
        "Those revolts happened anyway.",
        "At the same time now, the interesting thing here this morning, is that the newspapers are suggesting that there was perhaps, some sort of deal between the state authorities and the PCC commanders, privately.",
        "They're talking about a meeting between three representatives of the state, including a senior police commander, and the jailed leader of the PCC in Sao Paulo.",
        "And it is being said, that soon after that meeting, an order went out for the violence to be notched down a little bit, for the intensity to be reduced.",
