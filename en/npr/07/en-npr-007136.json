        "This was actually my third tour of a large government child shelter, and there was certain similarities among all of them.",
        "They show you the soccer fields and the basketball courts and classrooms and the Xbox games and the cafeteria where they get three hot meals and two snacks a day.",
        "And they tell us about the holiday parties and the talent shows.",
        "And then you see the kids, these lines of 12 Central American teenagers at a time, they're all walking very orderly, single file, escorted by a youth worker.",
        "They smile and say hola.",

        "So Welch described what she said was well-meaning policies gone horribly awry.",
        "She told me about adolescents who've been traumatized in their home country and then by the grueling journey north, and now they're forbidden to touch each other - even if they're siblings, even if they've made close friends to the shelter and one gets transferred, and they can't hug that person goodbye.",
        "The shelter says the no-touch rules are there to protect the children.",
        "Why is it significant to note that this is a for-profit detention facility, or it's being run in any case by a for-profit company?",
        "So, you know, I've reported about private companies that run immigrant detention facilities for ICE a lot over the years, but I had no idea that private industry was moving into child shelters.",
        "There's a Florida company called Comprehensive Health Services that runs Homestead, which now has 1,600 kids.",
        "The government pays CHS about $1.2 million a day to care for these kids.",
        "The company says that the children, that their safety and welfare is their top priority, and they follow all federal regulations to the letter.",
        "But there's definitely good money to be made here.",
        "I also found out that, just in the last two weeks, this company had taken in over three - rather, this company has taken over three additional shelters in south Texas, for a total of 500 additional migrant youngsters.",
        "So when you call up this company, and you say, you know, I can see you're making a profit here, and I've also spoken with lawyers for children you're holding, and they say they're traumatized, what's the company say to that?",
        "Well, they'll say, and the government will tell you, that their mission is to get the custody of these kids out of the Border Patrol, in these cage-like holding cells that have been so harshly criticized, and actually get them into places like Homestead, which are - you know, they're not summer camps, but they're a major improvement over the austere border cells.",
        "And of course, it's not the environment of a loving family, but they have case managers at all the shelters who work to find sponsors that the kids can go live with.",
        "And immigrant advocates say that the kids still are staying too long at these shelters - 67 days.",
        "Sixty-seven days on average.",
        "On average, right.",
        "John, thanks for your reporting, really appreciate it."
