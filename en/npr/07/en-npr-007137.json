        "And again, like Obama she sometimes gets grief from not identifying as biracial.",
        "There are many individuals who feel like by using the word black you are denying perhaps another part of you.",
        "So for Barack Obama, he would be denying his white mother by just calling himself a black man.",
        "But there are also practical and political consequences to the word biracial.",
        "Just as Reginald Daniel, who teaches multiracial studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara.",
        "To say you're a biracial, a multiracial person, is really asking for trouble, because first of all, nobody's going to know what you're talking about.",
        "After all, biracial is a big vague.",
        "It could refer to someone who's half Korean and half Jewish or half Iranian and half Puerto Rican.",
        "Daniel goes on to say there's another much more perilous consequence Obama would face if he identifies as biracial.",
        "African-Americans are likely or possibly going to say, oh, you just don't want to be black.",
        "And that's not something a candidate wants voters saying in an election, says Fred Harris.",
        "Harris directs the Center for African-American Politics and Society at Columbia University.",
        "He agrees that if Obama became known as the biracial candidate, many African-Americans would feel abandoned.",
        "The candidate become invisible to its black roots.",
        "I think that would turn off a lot of voters.",
        "And, Harris adds, why is identity such a big deal with Barack Obama anyway?",
        "After all, Bill Richardson is not calling himself multiracial, even though he's part Mexican, part Spanish, and part Maine Yankee.",
        "And you hardly ever hear about ancestry when talk turns to the other candidates.",
        "Giuliani, for instance.",

        "The day I'm inaugurated, the country will look at itself differently and I think be more tolerant.",
        "Racial identity may not have played too big a role into early contest held in predominantly white states like Iowa and New Hampshire, but there's likely to be a lot more talk on the topic as the candidates head towards the next big votes in racially diverse states like South Carolina, Nevada and Florida.",
        "Alex Cohen, NPR News.",
        "Race and policing isn't just an issue in New York.",
        "There are organizations across the country trying to bring police and communities together.",
        "I spoke with Carolyn Abdullah, program director for the Study Circles Resource Center.",
        "She creates structured forums between police and communities who share ideas.",
        "And I also spoke with Jack Riley.",
        "He's the acting director of the RAND Corporation Center on Quality Policing.",
        "He studied relations between police and residents in Cincinnati, Ohio, and says his team found no hard evidence of racist policies.",
        "But that doesn't in any way, shape or form take away from the fact that black residents in Cincinnati experienced policing very different from white residents.",
        "Black residents tend to live in neighborhoods that have higher crime rates, where the police are allocating more of their resources.",
        "And if the police are engaged in proactive policing measures such as aggressive enforcement of vehicle code standards as a way of showing law enforcement presence and attempting to keep drug dealers out of a neighborhood or a specific area or something.",
        "And so this contributes to the perception that blacks are treated differently because of their race, when in fact there is a difference in the policing, but it is driven by policy choices and by the department attempting to be both proactive but also concentrate resources where they think they're needed the most."
