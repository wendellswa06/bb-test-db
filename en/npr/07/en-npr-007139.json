        "Well, one of the things that I think we're accomplishing with the five-year evaluation that we have in Cincinnati of the partnership to improve police community relations is we're helping communities understand what kind of measurement capability and benchmarks they have to have in place."

        "But I think it's really important for your listeners to understand that understanding how to measure these kinds of effects and how to design enforcement policies in a way where they were effective against crime but also incorporate perceptions and realities of racial bias into the enforcement mechanism - this is all relatively new stuff to the field of policing.",

        "I mean, that's - from what I understand, New York City is not one of the areas you dealt with directly, but what is perhaps something that folks should remember on both sides of the issue?",
        "I think one of the issues is that we are sort of used to the idea that citizen engagement is an input process model, and they are not really an active participant in making and deciding what those policies should be.",
        "And I think we move toward a more comprehensive approach to policing in our communities that what citizens have to say is not simply regarded as the okay or the rubber stamp to a policy that was created within the police department itself.",
