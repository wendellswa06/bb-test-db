        "And I was interested -first of all, you go to a lot of attention finding the very best free-range chicken you can find and then testing which type of potatoes it turns out will roast the best.",
        "Now obviously, the selection's going to be different in this country than you might get in England, but nevertheless, the technique that you say this is how to go about finding out which one is the best, that's going to work anywhere.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that was an amazing piece of information that we discovered.",
        "We went to see a company that analyzed potatoes, and you might say gosh, life's too short.",
        "Why on earth would you want to analyze a potato?",
        "It's just a potato.",
        "But potatoes consist of something called dry matter, and dry matter's everything that's not water, basically.",
        "And if the dry matter is high, then the potato will roast well and be crisp.",
        "If the dry matter's low, it means it's got a lot of water in it, and then it's really hard to get crisp potatoes with low dry matter.",
        "So we then tested 30-plus varieties of potato that we knew the dry matter of, and we literally got that - you know, when I explain this, I really do think I need to get more often because it sounds worse when I'm listening to the words coming out of my mouth.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But we did find like a 1 percent band of dry matter where you get the most incredible potatoes.",
        "And I just think that -",
        "So you found the Goldilocks potato, the just-right potato?",
        "We did.",
        "It was a magic potato, the Holy Grail of the spud.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But it sounds like this - this is an extension.",
        "You describe yourself as a self-taught cook, but you use a lot of scientific method in your kitchen.",
        "It's funny, we ended up our previous conversation talking a lot about science in cooking."

        "Yes, actually, and indeed, Jose Andres is spot on when - I mean, I agree wholeheartedly with him when he's talking about the fact that when we cook, there are physical and chemical reactions that happen, and it's not about going into the kitchen with a lab coat and clip board, but it's just - if we could understand some of these reactions, it does make life in the kitchen and gives you more confidence.",
