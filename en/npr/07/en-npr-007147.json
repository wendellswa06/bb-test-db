        "Steve, you know, I'd say that Monday morning quarterbacking's always easy to do.",
        "And what I've said already publicly - and I'll repeat - there is something about our current political ecosystem - and we're all a part of it - the parties, the candidates, the media, the voters - that leads us to avoid going deep into the issues that are really going to affect people's day-to-day lives.",
        "You talked about this with the comedian Trevor Noah the other day.",
