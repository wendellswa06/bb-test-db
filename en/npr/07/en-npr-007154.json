        "800-989-8255, email us talk@npr.org, and we're also going to talk with a couple of Matt Weiland's contributors about the states they wrote about - Ohio and North Carolina.",

        "A mother in my play group shared about her out-of -body experience ,and everybody but everybody talked about their spiritual journey.",
        "Ludicrous perhaps, but 14 years later, I still prefer to have conversations about the weight stations on my own spiritual journey rather than one, what university I went to.",
        "Or two, how much money I make?",
        "Well, joining us now is Susan Orlean, a staff writer at the New Yorker magazine who contributed an essay on Ohio, her home state to the book.",

        "And you wrote about a state which you say, does not live up to many of the myths that we hold about it.",
        "Well, I think a part of the challenge of writing about a place is seeing through the received wisdom about that place.",
        "And, when I started working on the piece I thought well, the thing about Ohio is it's nothing like what you're told it's like.",
        "And, when I first left Ohio and was in college and later, when I say the people that I was from Ohio and occasionally somebody would say, oh, do you live on a farm?",

        "I live in Cleveland.",
        "It's one of the most industrialized places on the planet, realizing that this notion that Ohio was a flat cornfield - endless flat cornfield.",

        "Yes, well, let me explain before it makes me sound like a complete psycho.",
        "But, yes I did claim this and the reason I wrote about it in the piece was - being from Ohio always made me feel - when I was around kids from New York and California and other states - it made me feel like I was so generic.",
        "There was nothing about Ohio that seemed exceptional, everything - excuse me, I have a little laryngitis here - but everything about Ohio seems so normal and so regular.",
        "So, I would seize on anything that seemed extreme.",
        "And now Sam Shepherd, the famous murderer, did grow up and live in Cleveland, and had his practice in Cleveland.",
        "And my mother knew someone who knew someone who knew him.",
        "Somehow, I conflated this to a statement that my mother had dated Sam Shepherd.",
        "And clearly, just barely escaped with her life."
