        "He became angry, and he felt that Venezuela needed a new revolution.",
        "And this coup came to fruition in 1992 when he was a lieutenant colonel.",
        "And he had hundreds of accomplices and aides right at the palace.",
        "And, well, to cut a long story short, the coup was a complete military fiasco, total debacle.",
        "But there he is, you know, the author of this military fiasco.",
        "And in a two-minute segment that he went on television to surrender, he was brilliant.",
        "He was crisp.",
        "He took responsibility for the fiasco.",
        "And he said: We have not met our objectives - (Spanish spoken) - for now.",
        "And this sent a signal to all of Venezuela that he would be back, that he was not finished.",
        "And it was on the basis of that that he stormed to the presidency, legitimately elected, only six years later in 1998.",
        "What specifically did Hugo Chavez do for the poor?",
        "Chavez did two things.",
        "He made them feel that they had a guy on their side, that he understood their problems, that he was one of them, he spoke like them, he looked like them.",
        "And they felt as long as he was in the presidential palace, they had someone looking out for them.",
        "And the second thing is that he did bring practical benefits, a lot of subsidies, a lot of handouts.",
        "So it was this sense of feeling, you know, he's my guy, plus I've got a bit more money in my pocket.",
        "What do you think will happen now, now that we're past the funeral?",
        "What is Chavez's legacy going to be, do you think?",
        "Chavez leaves a very fraught legacy for his successors because Venezuela is, in many ways, a ruin.",
        "The infrastructure had been neglected, is collapsing.",
        "Crime is out of control.",
        "Inflation is rising.",
        "And now whoever takes over from him is going to have to write the check and will have to try to fix the problems that Chavez left behind and take the blame for the problems that Chavez left behind.",
        "So it's a very fraught and, unfortunately, quite a bleak legacy.",
        "Rory Carroll.",
        "His new book is called \"\"Comandante: Hugo Chavez's Venezuela,\"\" and he joined us from Caracas.",
        "We mentioned that Hugo Chavez believed himself to be the successor of Simon Bolivar, the 19th-century Venezuelan political leader who helped Latin America obtain its independence from Spain.",
        "Bolivar dreamed of uniting all of the countries of Latin America and making them economically independent.",
        "Professor Eduardo Gamarra is originally from Bolivia.",
        "He teaches politics and international relations at Florida International University.",
        "He says Chavez came the closest of any Latin leader to Bolivar's ideal.",
        "You know, one might say that his legacy is going to be measured by whether that attempt to integrate Latin America survives."

        "Are there any ways in which Chavez was realizing this dream in a practical sense?",
        "He constructed a lot of, let us call them multilateral organizations in Latin America.",
        "One is an organization called Una Sud, which is a United Nations of the South.",
        "And the basic premise behind this organization, which was actually founded in Mexico and then it went to Venezuela and it just met in Santiago, Chile, was to have a forum where countries of Latin America would be able to speak freely without the interference, the intervention of both the United States and Canada.",
        "It was explicit about excluding those two North American countries.",
        "And what's interesting, well, you know, this is sort of an attempt at realizing Bolivar's dream of a united Latin America.",
        "You know, Bolivar's dream was not to exclude the United States.",
        "Bolivar never made any mention of excluding the United States.",
        "And, in fact, Bolivar was a great admirer of the United States.",
        "Nice statue of him right outside Central Park in New York City.",
        "That's right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Which countries do you think will be most affected by the death of Chavez?",
        "Well, that's an interesting question because, I think, you have to look at it in terms of countries that are in the Caribbean and Central America, which are countries that do not have any commodities that they can export to China or anywhere for that matter.",
        "Let's take Haiti, for example.",
        "Haiti receives approximately $40 million a month from Venezuela.",
        "And it's not conditioned assistance.",
        "It's not money that goes to, you know, NGOs or that it goes through government agencies such as what the U.S.",
        "does.",
        "It goes directly to the Haitian government, and the Haitian government basically does with that money as it sees fit.",
        "And it has used its money wisely in terms of many social programs.",
        "And in my view, probably a lot of the social tranquility that you have in countries like Haiti owes much to these cash gifts from President Chavez.",
        "So do you think that Latin America will ever see Bolivar's dream of unification come true?",
        "That is a dream that I'm afraid probably not in my lifetime.",
        "Now, there are so many tensions that persist.",
        "Yesterday afternoon, we watched the funeral of Hugo Chavez.",
        "It was very interesting because you had, for example, the president of Chile and the president of Bolivia seated side by side.",
        "They had been fighting, literally fighting, verbally fighting over the last month over a number of issues, one very historic.",
        "Bolivia lost a coastline to Chile.",
        "And the Chileans basically have refused to open up discussions about granting Bolivia access - sovereign access to the ocean."
