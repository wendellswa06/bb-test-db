        "We're going to talk now about one controversial change to the manual.",
        "It's about how doctors approach depression in the case of a patient grieving over the loss of a loved one.",
        "For more, we're joined by Jerome Wakefield.",
        "He's from the School of Social Work and Department of Psychiatry at New York University.",
        "Jerome, welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So first, let's spell out this change.",
        "It involves removing from the manual something called the bereavement exclusion.",
        "So start by explaining what that is.",
        "Right now, major depression is diagnosed by a list of symptoms.",
        "If you have five out of these symptoms for two weeks, you have major depression.",
        "Symptoms include: sadness, loss of appetite, insomnia, fatigue, lack of interest in your usual activities, and so on.",
        "However, it was noticed that when the new criteria were created that many people who have grief feel these same feelings, normal grief.",
        "And, in fact, research has shown that this is true.",
        "So the idea was let's put in a criterion that says don't diagnose major depression in an individual even if they have these kinds of feelings if they just lost a loved one.",
        "Instead of just two weeks that's allowed for the symptoms usually, the bereavement exclusion says don't diagnose them as having a psychiatric disorder unless these feelings go on for at least two months.",
        "So this past weekend, the DSM panel voted to remove the bereavement exclusion.",
        "And to kind of summarize the argument for that, basically there was a concern that grieving patients with severe symptoms were actually being prevented from getting proper treatment because they fell within this exclusion.",
        "And doctors, I guess would say to them, no, this is just normal grieving.",
        "But I take it that you disagree.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, as I just explained it, the bereavement exclusion - as it has been in the manual since 1980 - doesn't say you shouldn't diagnose anybody with depression just because they recently lost somebody.",
        "What it says is that we're going to make a distinction between the ones that should diagnose and the ones that you shouldn't diagnose."

        "So, to me, it doesn't really make sense to - on the basis of worrying that you're going to miss a case that's more severe - to eliminate the bereavement exclusion, because the bereavement exclusion already takes account of the fact that anybody who's severe should be diagnosed anyway.",
