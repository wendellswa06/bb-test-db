        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And we could smell the smoke from where we were, so we evacuated from the transport truck as well.",
        "And...",
        "Because you were afraid the plane was going to explode.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that was the worst part for me, because that's when I started to be scared, because I thought, `How bad would it be if I survived the plane crash and then died in a blast afterwards?",
        "You know, that would just be the worst way to die.",
        "So we ran down the highway, and the police crew were cleaning all this debris out of the way--there was barbed wire and everything--so that we could get to these coaches that they had stopped.",
        "They put us in these highway coaches and they took us about a kilometer away from the crash until they figured out that everybody was off the plane, and then we--they drove us to the terminal.",
        "Hm.",
        "Did your--I assume your family and friends knew that you were on that particular plane?",
        "Yes, they did.",
        "That was the worst part, really.",
        "When I had run up to the top--to the highway and I got in that transport truck, I realized that everyone's going to find out about the crash before they find out that I'm OK, and that's when it really hit me.",
        "That's when I broke down and I started crying, because up until then, like I said, I wasn't really scared at all.",
        "I was just in this survival mode.",
        "But that's when I realized that, you know, back home it's just going to be horrendous for them to think that.",
        "And it was about an hour before I got to talk to them.",
        "No.",
        "No, actually, and I lost everything.",
        "My cell phone was in my luggage and my luggage was gone.",
        "The saxophone that I was playing on tour in Europe was gone, and even the backpack that I saved was torn open, I think, while I was running up the hill.",
        "I think just someone grabbed it for support, and everything in my backpack also fell out, so it was kind of a lost cause to get my backpack.",
        "I wonder--you talk about getting scared in that truck later; a few hours later, I wonder if you didn't get the shakes.",
        "I did, because also--like, we were drenched.",
        "It was raining.",
        "We were all in shock.",
        "When we were in the terminal, it was kind of--it was nice for me to see that everyone was out safe and that all these families were sitting together, but again, I was by myself.",
        "I called my mom a couple times and I didn't even really have anything to say.",
        "I just liked hearing her voice.",
        "And I did get--you know, I was just as traumatized then as I was when I was in the actual event itself.",
        "But it was good to know that I was safe at that point.",
        "Caroline Diezyn, thank you so much for sharing your story.",
        "I'm sure you're going to get another saxophone."

        "As, you know, we drive into the airport, we always just seem to watch the planes as they land and take off while we're driving in.",
        "And I was--the weather was really bad.",
        "It was raining hard.",
        "And I was just one--thinking to myself, `Wow, that plane's out in this weather?",
        "And I was just sort of watching it, watching the road, watching the plane.",
        "It wasn't really taking off--because I actually thought it was taking off, so I didn't know what it was doing.",
        "It just kept going and going, and I was watching it.",
        "There was lightning strikes around and all of a sudden, lightning hit the plane off in the distance, I saw.",
        "Then there was some smoke, and it just continued on and just disappeared right down the hill from my view."

        "So what did you do?",

        "And then it was just sort of--we were--I was behind about three or four cars, and after it went down, like, about, I don't know, 30 seconds later, we were just turning the curves where the plane went down, and everybody was stopping.",
        "There was smoke, and people were trying to reverse, get out of the way.",
        "I just started zigzagging around these people on the curve in the opposite lane and finally got over to where the plane had broken through the fence and the concrete to go through the gully, and I just sort of parked in there and looked, and saw the tail section sticking up, a little bit of fire, and I was like, `Oh, my God.",
        "So I just opened my door.",
        "I was just looking at it for a few seconds and I just got my camera out and my phone out and took a couple pictures with my phone camera--camera phone.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "What?",
        "I just threw my phone in the car, shut the door and just ran across the field.",
        "And I saw a few people, three or four people, actually coming out from the edge of the gully, went in and--just running along the fence away from it.",
        "So I just ran to that spot.",
        "I looked down and there's just a mess of people down there, and there's just a stream of people coming from where the plane was, heading towards this spot to climb up a hill, and people were having a hard time because it was just pouring rain.",
        "The grass was all matted down.",
