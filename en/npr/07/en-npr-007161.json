        "To follow up on what you just said, a normal day for that gentlemen--well, I'm a captain for an airline in the US system, and basically, I commend the crew, definitely, for being able to do their job so quickly, efficiently and professionally.",
        "But I think this kind of brings to a point where people need to start focusing on what's going on in our lives as crew members: work rules; 16 hours of duty day--continuous duty; continued reduced rest on our overnights; sleeping in airplanes and in terminals for, like, three hours.",
        "That's our normal day.",
        "I'll take your comments off line.",

        "Guy was the heroic man in Ontario.",
        "Oh, the one that actually climbed into the airplane.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "That was amazing.",
        "We don't normally advocate for civilians to climb inside a burning aircraft, but that was an amazing story, Neal.",
        "I wonder what you made of the pilot we just heard from, who talked about the conditions that, well, flight attendants, pilots, all kinds of crew operate under.",
        "Well, flight attendants are certified onboard safety professionals, and we're trained to get passengers off the aircraft as quickly as possible.",
        "Regarding longer duty days and extra legs, I think he does have a good point there.",
        "But nonetheless, we are trained safety professionals, and when the time comes to evacuate an aircraft, we would expect that our flight attendants would be able to do that.",
        "Ninety seconds seems like a--how possibly did they get 309 people off a plane in 90 seconds?",
        "Ninety seconds--that's exactly what they expect us to get people out in.",
        "And I think that because of the fact that the crews are so well-trained and they give very specific and precise commands, they're trained to accommodate passengers who might be in negative panic.",
        "They know exactly how to assess conditions.",
        "They are very good at responding to exits that may be blocked or may be on fire, or slide malfunctions.",
        "That's what we do.",
        "We practice this.",
        "We train this all the time.",
        "And once it starts, we just start moving those passengers out as quickly as possible.",
        "But you're correct; 90 seconds is not a lot of time to get 300 people out of an airplane.",
        "You train for it all the time, but you can't train with the adrenaline and the smoke and the fire and the panic.",
        "You're absolutely right, and as much as we'd like to duplicate the real-world scenario, our training conditions are artificial.",
        "Generally, we have cooperative passengers, we'll have no fire and no smoke; and you're right, we don't get to train in those scenarios.",
        "And we actually advocate for more realistic training.",
        "But--and the adrenaline--I just believe that just kicks in.",
        "We are so well-trained and this is so much of who we are and what we do and why we're on board that, once we start to do that, we actually go into almost an auto mode."

        "Hi.",
        "Very--how are you?",
        "Oh, I'm fine.",
        "I don't have anything to say about this particular accident, but being an air traffic controller for 37 years, 17 of which was the manager of Washington Dulles International Airport, I have one story that you might find interesting, and that was the fact that while I was a controller at the National Airport in Washington, now called Reagan Airport, I noticed an Eastern Constellation taxiing out, and just before he took off, his engine started smoking quite a bit.",
        "So I notified the pilot and I cautioned him, and I guess the caution caused him to lift off after takeoff, and instead of proceeding on course he made a sharp left turn around the airport, and he noticed that there was a fire on board one of the engines.",
        "And he asked for an emergency landing, so I brought him on in and cleared all the other aircraft out of the way and so forth, and the fire people from the airport followed him down the runway on the run and sprayed his wing.",
        "And it so happened that my wife, before I met her, was on that plane, and I didn't realize that until three years later after we had our first child, when I was telling her about this, because there was an incident similar to this up in National--up in Kennedy Airport, and I was telling her about this incident I had in Washington.",
        "And she said, `Well, honey, I was on that plane.",
        "She slid off the--they got her off the plane and brought her over to the terminal building, and we kept the aircraft out on the runway.",
        "In the meantime, the fire people from the airport did a wonderful job and got the engine out and everybody was just fine.",
        "That's an amazing coincidence.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yes.",

        "Melissa Madden, talking about a Constellation tells us how long ago that was.",
        "Since those days there have been a lot of changes to the interior of aircraft, the materials that the aircraft is built out of, and the seats--much less flammable than it used to be, for example.",
        "Yeah, absolutely, Neal.",
        "I think that safety within the aircraft itself, as far as less flammable materials and more slides or better slides and better wind conditions--I think all of those safety improvements have added to the safety of air travel itself.",
        "Nonetheless, I think the key is always going to be the flight attendants and the fact that they're there and responding to the situation.",
        "You can have the best equipment in the world, but if it fails or--without any direction, I think that safety is compromised at that point in time, and I think that's why we're on board.",
        "You know, and I would kind of like to go back to that caller from Phoenix about the long duty days.",
        "One of the issues that has come up is fatigue, and we have to wonder whether or not that would delay the reactions of the crew--these long duty days and fatiguing work schedules.",
        "And one of the things that we need to do is respond almost immediately and instinctively, and that's why we are actually concerned about fatigue.",

        "They're very disappointed right now because the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder--it turns out Canada doesn't have the technology to download the information on those recorders, so now they're about three days behind schedule already because they can't do much with the plane until they get that information.",
        "So those two black boxes are being sent as we speak right now to France, where French authorities will download the information and send it back to Canada, and that whole process is going to take about three days.",
        "So, indeed, disappointing.",
        "I know that there's been a lot of speculation about the cause of the crash, whether it was the weather, the lightning, wind shear.",
        "What did they say?",
        "Well, I mean, they say that accidents never happen because of one thing alone.",
        "I mean, sort of the leading theory that's going around with experts on the outside looking in is that perhaps the pilot, knowing that there was bad weather--thunderstorms, wind shears, whatever--they tend to speed up for their landing for that reason.",
        "And maybe when he touched down, he touched down too far up the runway and couldn't stop in time.",
        "Maybe there was some hydraulic effect with so much rain having fallen.",
        "About eight millimeters of rain was in the midst of falling at that point anyway.",
        "Maybe there was a problem with the brakes.",
        "I'm hearing now from some plane spotters that it looks to them like the spoilers didn't deploy, and they help the brakes slow down.",
        "Those are slots on the wing that, well, help the plane break, yeah.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "So it could be that the pilot made a wrong decision to speed up or had no decision to speed up, and something on the plane gave out and something with the weather gave out all at the same time.",
        "So it's probably going to end up being a combination of at least three or four different factors.",
        "We are talking with reporter Kevin McGran of the Toronto Star.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Kevin, tell us: When Flight 358 touched down, the airport was under what's known as a red alert because of the lightning.",
        "Are planes allowed to land under such conditions?"
