        "It's basically up to the pilot.",
        "The pilot had clearance to land from NAV CANADA, which is our traffic control system up here.",
        "But NAV CANADA says all they really do is they tell the pilot, `There's no planes in front of you; you can land if you want,' and it's really up to the pilot at that point to make the call whether to land or to keep circling or to go off somewhere else.",
        "Up to that point, planes had been landing.",
        "What the red alert ends up doing is it keeps everybody on the plane 'cause the ground crews can't come out because of the lightning to service the planes and to marshal it in and to get the luggage off, so everybody has to stay on the plane.",
        "So they say normally it's not a problem to land during a thunderstorm.",
        "Obviously, this time it appears there was.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do we know if the plane had enough fuel to go on to Montreal or wherever?",
        "Well, they most likely did.",
        "They generally have enough fuel to get to their next nearest, safest location to land.",
        "In fact, right after this plane crashed, a KLM flight was supposed to come in and they closed the airport down so that the emergency crews could get there without interfering with plane traffic, and a KNLM(ph) flight had to move on to Syracuse because it didn't have enough fuel to keep circling.",
        "So they do have some reserves; this one probably did.",
        "Certainly with the explosions and the fire, the fuel was there burning and it added to the fire, obviously.",
        "So there was fuel in the tank.",
        "I understand the pilot himself is in a hospital with back problems, and they've not spoken with him as yet.",
        "They've not spoken with--the lead investigator, Real Levasseur, says he doesn't want to speak to him if he's in pain 'cause he wants his mind at the ready to remember everything.",
        "He doesn't want to disturb him if he's in pain.",
        "But they're not telling us exactly the extent of the injuries.",
        "We actually know very little about the pilot.",
        "I don't even think we know his name yet.",
        "Have they spoken with the co-pilot, with the flight attendants?",
        "They spoke with the co-pilot today.",
        "They're not telling us what he said.",
        "They're not telling us what they asked.",
        "They say, `You can guess what we asked 'cause it's probably obvious,' but that information is privileged under our Transportation Safety Board Act.",
        "They're not required to inform anybody of that until they release their final findings, which could take up to a year or so.",
        "After the co-pilot, it's going to be the pursers and the flight attendants.",
        "And they'll get to the captain when the captain is ready to speak to them.",
        "And we know the captain is still in the hospital.",
        "How many other people injured are still being treated in the hospital?",
        "There's a total of 14 people that were still in hospital as of this morning.",
        "None of them are life-threatening injuries.",
        "It's mostly--I think the severest is probably a--there might be some smoke inhalation, there might be some broken limbs, that sort of thing.",
        "And one other question.",
        "We've heard a lot about the remarkable efficiency and heroism--I think that's not too strong a word--about the flight crew and particularly the flight attendants.",
        "Emergency crews at Pearson--they also responded very quickly."

        "It seems to have happened in this case.",
        "It--just in the nick of time, but it's still a well-thought-out plan that worked well.",

        "And the only people that got hurt--nobody was hurt the way the plane crashed; they all were hurt disembarking, going down the shoots, and in a couple of cases, the shoots didn't deploy, which is a concern for the safety board people, and people had to jump, and that's where they really got hurt.",
