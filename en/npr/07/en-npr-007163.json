        "Well, Chas was quite a veteran of the British music scene and when he heard a hit, you know, he knew it was a hit.",
        "And Jimi was playing a song that summer that was \"\"Hey Joe,\"\" a song that had been covered by a number of groups in the Village, and done in a folk version.",
        "Jimi was doing a rock version of that song.",
        "And when Chas heard that, it immediately came to him that this song could be a hit in England.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Hey Joe\"\")",
        "(Singing) Hey, Joe, said now, where you gonna run to now?",
        "Where you gonna go?",
        "Well, dig it!",
        "I'm going way down south, way down to Mexico way.",
        "All right!",
        "Chandler saw Jimi as a rock star and wanted to put him in the rock arena and very much wanted to fashion a trio, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, much like the band Cream at the time.",
        "Jimi was still very hooked on the idea of being an R&B band, and, in fact, one of the more interesting things revealed in my book is that, basically, during Jimi's entire period of fame, he is constantly trying to form the traditional nine-piece R&B band, with horns, and partly because of their poverty, Chandler said, `We can't afford a nine-piece band.",
        "And Chandler paired Jimi with Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell and the rest, as they say, was truly history.",
        "(Soundbite of \"\"Foxy Lady\"\")",
        "(Singing) Foxy lady.",
        "Here I come, baby.",
        "I'm coming to get you now!",
        "Foxy lady, yeah, yeah!",
        "Ooh!",
        "You look so good, foxy lady.",
        "What role did race play in Jimi's ascent London?",
        "It seems to me that if he's coming and wanting to be a nine-piece R&B band, and someone else has a view of him as a straight-up rock 'n' roll singer, there's gonna be some tensions.",
        "Well, there was, and I think that you can't underplay the role that race had played in Jimi's sort of life up to that point and also at this crucial moment.",
        "One of the reasons Jimi couldn't get recognized in America because there was such a strict racial line in America in 1966.",
        "There was essentially African-American music and there was white music.",
        "And the two did not cross.",
        "The ideas that Jimi was working with, incorporating blues and moving that into the rock arena, no one was doing that.",
        "Then Jimi goes to England and suddenly his race is no longer a defining characteristic.",
        "In fact, his race ends up being an asset, because he was given a level of authenticity immediately by the British public.",
        "What's interesting is then when he comes back to America, he's still facing huge racial issues that I think he thought that he'd left behind when he was in England.",
        "Before we move on to how he was received back in the US, we should talk more about how people like Eric Clapton, and, certainly, The Rolling Stones, venerated the black blues musicians, and stole freely from their works, and so for them to see someone like Jimi must have been kind of a revelation.",
        "Tell us how he impressed Eric Clapton, for example.",
        "Well, Jimi arrived in England on September 24th, 1966, and within a week of landing in England he was a star.",
        "And one of the reasons he rose so quickly was that he went to a Cream show that happened at a London college and asked if he could jam with Cream, and no one had ever asked before if they could jam with Cream.",
        "Cream was so taken aback, they didn't know what to say.",
        "They just said, `Sure.",
        "So Jimi plugs in and plays an incredible version of Howlin' Wolf's \"\"Killing Floor,\"\" and as related by some eyewitnesses in my book, they said that the difference was is that Clapton, you could hear his influences.",
        "He was, obviously, very emulating Albert King, who was Clapton's biggest role model.",
        "Hendrix, you could hear the influences, too, but they were more shaded by Jimi's own blues styling."

        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "Essentially Jimi blew Eric Clapton away and that was one of the beginning pieces of Jimi's legend.",
        "After that point, everybody came to see him in the London stage.",
        "So what happens when Jimi Hendrix, the newly princely Jimi Hendrix, returns to his roots in the US?",
        "He's a superstar in England, at this point, huge in Europe, and he hasn't been back in America in nine months.",
        "And he returns to play the Monterey Pop Festival, which, of course, is going to also make him famous in America.",
        "But two days before the Monterey Pop Festival, Jimi stops in New York for a layover, and he stops in a hotel, and he's in the lobby of a hotel, and within just a few minutes of being there, a woman comes up and asks him if he'll take her bags to her room.",
        "She has mistaken him, because of the color of his skin, as a bellhop.",
        "Was he able to shrug off the sleights of race in America or did he take it to heart?",
        "Well, I think he both was able to shrug it off, but at the same time it did hurt him.",
        "You know, one of the other interesting stories in 1969 was that Jimi played Woodstock, which we all know about, but two weeks later he played a free show in Harlem, which he was far more interested in the audience reaction.",
        "And he was booed by some in the African-American crowd because he had a girlfriend who was Puerto-Rican.",
        "Some people thought she was white, and that was such a hot-bed issue, and he had white musicians in his band.",
        "So I think race was something that was forever a difficult thing for Jimi Hendrix, and his music was so far ahead of its time that we can only kind of look at it now and say, `My God.",
        "I mean, he was such a grandfather of so much that we hear today and really truly one of the sort of founding fathers of rock.'",
        "And we never got to hear his nine-piece R&B band, did we?",
        "Trump, on the other hand, has credited the Paris attacks with his biggest rise in the polls.",
        "Yesterday, he said that the terrorists will cause Hillary Clinton to lose the elections.",
        "He's calling for a tougher response, more torture.",
        "But that was just hours after he also called for scaling back America's commitment to NATO, whose headquarters just happens to be right in between the two sites of those two attacks in Brussels.",
        "Well, there you go.",
        "Now, people voted yesterday, waiting in extremely long lines in some places.",
        "And on the Republican side, they gave Ted Cruz a win in Utah - Trump in Arizona.",
        "John Kasich got nothing.",
        "Which of them gained more delegates?",
        "Well, Donald Trump won the big prize.",
        "Arizona was winner take all.",
        "He got 58 delegates.",
        "That puts him one more step down the road to getting the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention in Cleveland.",
        "Ted Cruz, because he got over 50 percent in the Utah caucuses, gets all of that state's 40 delegates."

        "OK.",
        "Well, let me just ask about this.",
        "The Stop Trump movement is turning out to be a stop Trump here and there movement.",
        "Is that going to be enough actually to block him?",
        "Well, it's still mathematically possible.",
        "But the idea of a contested convention, which is the Stop Trump movement's goal, just seems to be a little harder to pull off after yesterday.",
        "What about the Democrats?",
        "Well, Hillary Clinton won the big prize.",
        "That was Arizona.",
        "Bernie Sanders won the caucuses in Idaho and Utah.",
        "There were no Republican contests in Idaho last night.",
        "And right now, it's almost impossible for Sanders to catch up to Clinton's delegate lead.",
        "The Democrats give out there delegates on a proportional basis.",
        "And while no Democrats are calling publicly for Sanders to drop out, there is a lot of talk about, if Sanders stays in, how does he campaign?",
        "Does he campaign against Trump or against Clinton?",
        "And does he prevent the party from unifying against what many Democrats think is a scary and potentially very formidable opponent in the fall?",
        "Has this been a problem that Hillary Clinton's opponents have faced all along, their fellow Democrats saying don't go too hard after this person who probably is going to be the nominee no matter what you attempt?",
        "Sure.",
        "There's a lot of talk about that in Democratic circles, a lot of concern about how Bernie Sanders is campaigning.",
        "Does he campaign in a way that helps the party unify for the fall?",
        "Or does he campaign in a way that weakens the - Hillary Clinton, who looks like she's going to be the nominee in the fall - that actually just exposes her weaknesses?",
        "Just got about 20 seconds here, Mara.",
        "Are Democrats feeling confident or weirded out by the Republican primary so far?",
        "I would say that there is an equal amount of schadenfreude at the GOP's disarray and anxiety about Donald Trump possibly being able to win in the fall because he's so unpredictable.",
        "So I would say Democrats are both worried and optimistic at the same time.",
        "OK.",
