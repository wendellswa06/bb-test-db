        "I think right now we do not actually know that this helps, that medication helps.",
        "This belief is ahead of the curve with respect to research.",
        "We also know from the research that people who are having these milder depressive feelings during grief don't have a recurrence of depression.",
        "They seem to do very well.",
        "They get over it and they go on, and they're not recurrent like usual depression is.",
        "So you're basically medicating people who are going to remit on their own, are probably going to do fine.",
        "I think given the side effects of medications, the uncertainties of medication, it's a mistake to make it routine to open up people to medication under these circumstances.",
        "We do want to help people who are suffering, but to re-label suffering as a mental disorder - subjected to psychiatric treatment - seems like opening the door to a very different way of thinking about ourselves and people that might not actually be so helpful after all.",

        "Mark Sylvia is commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources.",
        "I think what it says is that Massachusetts is very curious about focusing on our climate goals.",
        "Massachusetts wants to cut its greenhouse gases 25 percent by 2020 and power plants are a huge source of greenhouse gases, so the state asked some scientists to take a hard look at the greenhouse gas footprint of power plants that burn wood."

        "For both sides this is critical: Israelis feel, for example, that their unilateral withdrawal from Gaza was greeted by a barrage of rockets, and Palestinians have not really enjoyed security for 75 years, and so how they work this out that both sides feel secure is critical.",
        "And the fourth is the question of Israeli settlements.",
        "Israel would like to leave in place perhaps three quarters of the settlements and 80 percent of the settlers, and maybe prepare to swap some territory for it, but the question for Palestinians is will they get the quantity and quality of territory in return that would make such a swap possible?",
