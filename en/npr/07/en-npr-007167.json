        "In the same video, Yee made comments disparaging Jesus Christ.",
        "In Singapore, publishing material that could hurt the religious feelings of others is illegal.",
        "And so that is the basis of one of the charges under which Amos Yee has been arrested.",
        "If convicted, he could get three years in prison.",
        "Bob Dietz of the Committee to Protect Journalists says that with all his bravado, Yee is challenging the very real roadblocks to free speech in Singapore.",
        "People know the rules and know the restrictions in Singapore.",
        "Amos did know the rules and really just wanted to go at them full force.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Re-enacting this murder, which is quite dramatic and truly awful, was a startling kind of political theater.",

        "You know, I didn't think of it as political.",

        "It was a simple demonstration to raise our voices and for people to see what happened to her.",

        "I was even seeing blood.",
        "Of course, there was no blood, but I was seeing blood - her blood.",
        "The same street I was standing on, it was the same street that she was killed.",
        "So there was so much emotion going through me, and I just start crying.",
        "How - how did the crowd on the street react to this performance?",

        "While we were doing it - the acting - I couldn't hear anything.",

        "So I did it as it happened to her.",
        "Yeah, it is a bit scary, but I was not even afraid that somebody may shoot me from the hillside or from the mountain (laughter) the houses on the mountain there.",

        "I'm wondering if she offered a symbol, something to - to rally around.",
        "And what's interesting to me is that you've been writing some really strong columns saying people shouldn't compromise on this.",
        "And what's noteworthy to me is that you are a person who normally asks people to try to find a way to find common ground on these sticky, emotional issues.",
        "So I want to hear from you first on this.",
        "Well, you're absolutely right, Michel, that I do usually seek common ground on issues where you can find common ground.",
        "But when you're talking about civil rights, when you're talking about human rights, I think it's very difficult to make a compromise and especially when we're thinking about, you know, minority rights.",
        "And I look back in one of my columns to some of the great compromises of this great country that starts with the Three-Fifths Compromise that our founding fathers settled on which was a way to count slaves as fractional people.",
        "And in a sense what we've seen Roy Cooper, our Democratic governor and the Republican legislature do this week, is discount the lives of LGBTQ people.",
        "And that is a fundamental issue, and there was a state senator here in North Carolina, Susan Fisher.",
        "And she said before the vote, you know, this is an accountability issue for all of us.",
        "We don't compromise on civil rights, but we did.",
        "And this was really an attempt to - what I call dial for dollars because the NCAA is going to be deciding this week whether North Carolina will be in play to get championship games, and everybody wants to put HB2 behind them so they can get some big bucks.",
        "Before we - before I move to Gayle on this - because I also know she has strong views on this as well - why do you say that this is - you do liken it to the Three-Fifths Compromise?",
        "You do say it's a sellout in essence.",
        "You say it's not really what it's purported to be?",
        "Why do you feel so strongly about it?",
        "Well, one of the main provisions of HB2 was that local governments could not pass anti-discrimination laws.",
        "And one of the main anchors of this new law HB 142 is exactly the same.",
        "So you can call it a repeal, but it's really just a renaming and the most onerous odious part of HB2 is still part of the DNA of this state.",
        "Gayle, what do you say about this?"

        "So when he talks about this legislation as compromising principles of morality and dialing for dollars, I would agree with him.",

        "Boycotts or purchases?",
        "Purchases - OK.",
        "I'm talking about companies that's - you have a great point because conservatives will use boycotts and use the power of the purse.",
        "But we're talking about companies like PayPal, which said they would not put 400 employees in North Carolina and other big companies, too.",
        "So we're talking about individuals making choices versus big companies making choices.",

        "You're just talking about basic privacy and modesty.",

        "And if so why?",
        "No, I don't, and I would agree with Steven that it's dialing for dollars, and, unfortunately, some people care more about catering to liberal corporations than they care about principle.",
        "OK.",
        "Steven, go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that is why this is really such a terrible, quote, unquote, \"\"compromise\"\" because nobody who has any principles which regardless of what they are, you know, is satisfied with this and that is why this is another black eye for the state of North Carolina and especially Governor Cooper."
