        "So there were explosives for training inside the school as well, whether they were in lockers or a classroom or the gym as well as the buses.",
        "And the idea was to make this as realistic as possible for these CIA and local K-9 teams to come in, respond to the threat and find the explosives.",
        "Well, as we said, nobody was hurt, and the CIA says nobody was even in danger.",
        "But a mistake like this has got to prompt some kinds of changes to policy, right?",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "And, in fact, we understand those changes are in effect.",
        "They've suspended this program where they loan out these explosives to local law enforcement to do these trainings.",
        "And they've done an accounting of all the material they used, and they say they have it all.",
        "So right now, we do not believe there are going to be any more of these surprises where a mechanic or a custodian might open up something and find explosives inside.",
