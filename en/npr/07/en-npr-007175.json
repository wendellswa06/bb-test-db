        "They concluded that this - what they referred to as weathered crude oil, the exposures from volatiles were insignificant.",

        "Higher temperatures, for example, may release toxins that otherwise would have stay locked inside tarballs.",
        "And nearly a million gallons of chemical dispersants have been used to break up the oil in the Gulf, far more than in Alaska.",
        "Emery says that could pose a health risk for people actually applying the dispersant.",
        "But once it's distributed on the water or wherever it's distributed, the relative concern there, I think, goes down compared to the just sheer volume of oil that people will be potentially exposed to.",
        "Emery says whether cleanup workers need respirators depends on what job they're doing and where they are.",
        "He says contractors and the government should continue monitoring air quality to make sure that the unprotected workers are breathing air that's safe."
