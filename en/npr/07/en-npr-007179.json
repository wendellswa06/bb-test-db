        "He supported Hillary Clinton four years ago, but could not bring himself to vote for Barack Obama in the general election.",
        "He cast his ballot for Ralph Nader.",
        "Karger says he knows he's more than a long shot and acknowledges his strategy is unconventional.",

        "I can't remember the last time I've seen this.",
        "David Doyle is a campaign consultant who once served as the chairman of the Michigan Republican Party.",
        "He says Karger is being vastly outspent by the other candidates and their superPACs in the one TV market where his ad is playing.",
        "And, in this election, the overwhelming majority of voters in the Republican primary are concerned about jobs and the economy, deficit spending and taxes.",
        "Social issues are relatively low on the list.",
        "Win or lose here, Karger plans to apply his Michigan strategy to other states that will dole out delegates by congressional district.",
        "He's on the ballot in half a dozen states and he's still trying to get on some more in hopes of picking up some delegates.",
        "He says even just a few would help him get into future debates and maybe get him some attention at the Republican convention in Tampa this summer.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Rick Pluta in East Lansing, Michigan.",
        "The science fiction movie \"\"Inception,\"\" a tricky, multilayered tale of hijacked dreams, was one of last year's biggest hits.",
        "So not surprisingly, three new films - \"\"Limitless,\"\" \"\"The Adjustment Bureau\"\" and \"\"Source Code\"\" - have tried to position themselves as this year's \"\"Inception.",
        "And that got Bob Mondello thinking.",
        "Four times in eight months, I've been caught up in science-fiction worlds that seem remarkably like the world I actually live in - urban, brightly lit; not filled with aliens, zombies or futuristic gadgets - just a lot of people with control issues."

        "Choking back tears, Wade Ward of the Prescott Fire Department continued the story from the podium.",
        "He also communicated to the crew the situational awareness, which was that the weather was changing rapidly and that was the reason that he was leaving, as well as the fire had changed directions.",
        "But that was the last communication anyone had with the other 19 on the crew.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "The audience erupted in applause when Ward urged the media not to contact McDonough.",
        "He's at home with his mother grieving.",

        "Out on the fire yesterday, air and ground resources continued to pour in from around the region.",

        "When it was being built 100 years ago, the Panama Canal was the biggest construction project in the world.",
        "Now, a multi-billion dollar effort to expand the canal is pretty close to that category of world's biggest.",
        "As NPR's Jason Beaubien reports, the expansion will allow for far more and much bigger cargo ships to travel from Asia, to the East Coast of the U.S.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF HORN)",

        "The deck of the Ever Dynamic is stacked high with burgundy-and-blue shipping containers.",
        "More boats like these are backed up in both the Pacific and the Atlantic, waiting to enter the waterway.",
        "Arnold Cano, an engineer who's working on the expansion, says the basic structure of the facility hasn't changed since it opened in 1914, yet the volume of global trade has exploded.",
        "Usually, when people think about the expansion of the canal, most of the attention is given to the bigger ships, the post-Panamax ships.",
        "Right now, they can't fit through the Panama Canal.",
        "And that's a big aspect of the expansion, but really, the main driver for the expansion is capacity.",
        "It's being able to transit more cargo.",
        "By adding a third lane, 50 percent more ships will be able to pass through the waterway each day, but more importantly, the larger vessels will be moving significantly larger loads.",
        "Right now, the biggest ship that can go through the canal is a ship that can carry about 4,000 to 4,500 20-feet containers.",
        "Containers come in different sizes, but 20 feet is the size that we standardize for measuring ships.",
        "In the expanded canal, ships that can hold three times that many containers, 12 to 13,000 units, will, for the first time, be able to pass through the locks.",
        "These ships primarily shuttle goods from Asia to the United States.",
        "Rather than docking in California and sending their cargo by truck or rail to the East Coast, they'll be able to steam through the Canal to Miami, Norfolk or New York, although most ports on the U.S.",
        "East Coast still aren't deep enough for these vessels to enter.",
        "Work on the expansion of the Panama Canal began in 2007, and the new channel is scheduled to open in 2014."

        "Far more and far larger vessels will head to Panama, even if they don't transit the canal.",
        "Even now, significant amounts of cargo are shipped to Panama's ports, reshuffled into smaller boats and then distributed throughout the hemisphere.",
        "Tiehan Zhong with China Shipping Lines in Panama City says this will increase considerably as the canal becomes even more critical to global trade.",
        "It looks like all the world.",
        "He says boats that currently are going from South Asia through the Suez Canal to New York may instead head east and transit through Panama.",
        "The canal expansion opens up more opportunities, he says, to move more goods from China to the largest consumer market in the world, the U.S., at a lower cost.",
