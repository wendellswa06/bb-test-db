        "Well, now, to another issue occupying the president and the Congress, immigration, specifically the push for more H-1B visas.",

        "The biggest user of H-1Bs are consulting companies or, as Ron Hira calls them, offshore outsourcing firms.",
        "The top 10 recipients in the last fiscal year are all offshore outsourcers, and they got 40,000 of the 85,000 visas, which is astonishing.",

        "He's also the son of Indian immigrants, so he has a personal interest in questions of labor flow across borders.",
        "For the past decade, he's been studying how consulting firms use temporary work visas to help American companies cut costs.",
        "He says they use the visas both to supply cheaper workers here, but also to smooth the transfer of American jobs to IT centers overseas.",
        "What these firms have done is exploit the loopholes in the H-1B program to bring in onsite workers to learn the jobs of the Americans, to then ship it back offshore and also to bring in onsite workers who are cheaper on the H-1B and undercut American workers right here.",
        "The biggest user of H-1Bs last year was Cognizant, a firm based in New Jersey.",
        "They got 9,000 new visas.",

        "Sawade is active in a labor organization called WashTech, so he gets the complaints from IT workers around the country.",
        "The H-1B consulting firms are especially active in banking, insurance, and pretty much any industry that runs on big computer systems maintained by aging, increasingly expensive American tech workers.",
        "He laughs at the notion that a cost-cutting insurance company somewhere is in dire need of hotshot foreign programmers with specialized skills.",
