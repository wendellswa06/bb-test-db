        "And these officials do not claim to have killed or captured either Osama bin Laden or his chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.",
        "And al-Qaeda is close to defeat?",
        "Neal, we always start with number three in this world.",
        "Numbers one and two, Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri don't count.",
        "We start always with number three.",
        "You know, they say that being the number-three guy in al-Qaeda is the most dangerous job in the world because we're always hearing stories about number three being taken out.",
        "The truth of the matter is this, that Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri are really off by themselves.",
        "In terms of the day-to-day management of the al-Qaeda network - the planning of plots, the dispatching of volunteer fighters, the coordination, the communication - it's really done by this sort of senior to mid-level range of al-Qaeda leaders, not by bin Laden and Zawahiri.",
        "And it's that operational leadership of al-Qaeda that they say has been decimated.",
        "So, news today of another attack on the Pakistani side of the Khyber Pass that destroyed a bridge that's an important part of the route that the U.S.",
        "and NATO use to supply forces in Afghanistan.",
        "Again, how does that figure in if al-Qaeda's close to defeat?",
        "One other part, though, is on training.",
        "Your piece this morning suggested that there had just been a new graduating class, if you will, of al-Qaeda fighters.",
        "And indeed, the attacks in Mumbai, well, that was - there was a large class, according to the person who got captured alive, and to what extent you believe what was published by the Indians about this, but a large class of people, 32, I think, who graduated in his terrorism class, a group allied to al-Qaeda, only 10 of them were involved in the attacks of Mumbai.",
        "You know, I've been driving through town.",
        "I've been seeing lots and lots of chairs in front of houses, even some tents with mattresses inside them that people drug out of the house to give us a sense of greater safety.",
        "You don't see a lot of external damage to houses just from what I've seen driving around.",
        "But at the fire station, of course, all the fire engines and vehicles have been pulled out of the fire station.",
        "And it was a good thing because there's still a lot of aftershocks.",
        "I was sitting in my car during a sizable one.",
        "And when I first rolled into Ridgecrest, I stopped at a gas station, and the pumps were almost all occupied with people filling up their gas tanks, possibly for a long drive to another place to stay or just to keep their vehicles filled up while they run around doing post-emergency chores, which, you know, there's going to be a lot of them.",
        "But inside a convenience store at a gas station, the typical thing you see - bottles everywhere.",
        "You could smell the wine just wafting out the front door.",
        "And the earthquake actually knocked a toilet off its bolts.",
        "So that was unusable for customers.",
        "Well, you know, people in Ridgecrest and all the surrounding area must be on edge because of that 6.4 magnitude earthquake on the Fourth of July.",
        "But how is this stronger quake affecting the people you've been talking to?",
        "This is a one-two punch for them.",
        "Well, it's almost like a two-one punch because the bigger one followed what they thought was the big one.",
        "Right, right."

        "They'd lost power for a couple of hours after the July Fourth earthquake.",
        "And that was a 6.4.",
        "But last night, the 7.1, their power went off briefly, and then it came back quickly.",
        "It also restored her Internet, which was actually the only good news she's had.",

        "So what there about emergency services?",
        "What's been set up so far?",
        "Well, in a situation like a 7.1 earthquake, we'll see assistance coming from all over the state, maybe even beyond.",
        "There are specialized units, like the urban search and rescue team.",
        "I went inside the trailer that the Los Angeles Fire Department brought out, and they have tools for freeing people from cars, from buildings.",
        "They can cut through steel with an oxygen torch or through concrete with heavy saws.",
        "So far, though, none of that has been needed.",
        "The housing stock here dates from World War II and after, so it's got pretty good building standards.",

        "Do you need the second?",
        "The one black box can tell us some good information.",
        "It's a quantum-engineering manufacturer recorder.",
        "And what we're doing now is that our recorder specialist is already working with the manufacturer to use their conversion software - it's not unusual to do this - to turn all of those zeros and ones into information we can use, such as the distance traveled, the throttle inputs, the brake system performance, as well as the speed."

        "The problem here is we don't know yet.",
        "So we're hoping we'll be able to see.",
        "We'll absolutely look into PTC.",
