        "Most of the cave was, in fact closed, but there was an entrance on one side.",
        "You could climb into it.",
        "I can remember going into that cave, probably when I was - maybe 11 or 12 years old, and thinking it was very romantic.",
        "Thirty years later, when Henshilwood was a new archeologist trying to make a name for himself, he went back to that cave and found, under a layer of sand that dated back 75,000 years, several dozen seashells.",
        "They are the size, probably - or even smaller - than the nail on your pinkie.",
        "They're very tiny, little shells.",

        "These shells weren't simply shells; these shells, he realized, were beads.",
        "The hole that had been made was in the same place.",
        "I could very clearly see, under the microscope, the wear that had been made by the string - or whatever had been used to string these beads together.",
        "And by the time I'd looked through 30, I was convinced, right, these are beads.",
        "These are the oldest beads yet discovered.",

        "Why are a few shell beads such a big deal?",
        "Because this handful of shells was an early version of the wedding band around your finger, or the golden cross around your neck.",
        "The beads were symbols, symbols indicating to the people of that community who this person was, what they believed, whether they were friend or enemy.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There was no doubt that if we had beads, we had evidence for symbolic thought."
