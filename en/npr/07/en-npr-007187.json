        "Now, as for the other point that Abe makes, the fallout from these attacks, that can't be disputed and that, you know, that's the cost that has to be considered when you weigh whether this is a, you know, a good idea to continue doing this.",
        "Now, all I can tell you is that one of the things the intelligence officials I spoke with about this story told me is that they have seen - that they have picked up evidence of increasing tension in those tribal areas between the traditional tribal leaders there, the local leadership and these foreigners, the Arabs, as they are called, who come in, the al-Qaeda figures from outside Pakistan, who come in and bring down the wrath of the United States on those villages, that this actually has created some new tension between that local tribal leadership and the foreign fighters in that area."

        "Well, I spoke earlier about the - some of the ways that this could be reversed, and one of them is if the Pakistani military relocates, reorients, redeploys to the line of control with India, there's going to be less pressure in those tribal areas, and this might make it much more difficult for these strikes to continue.",
