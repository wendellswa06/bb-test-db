        "And you know, they show outrage when we do attack, but they haven't done anything material to actually take care of these fighters.",

        "It's - you know, it does create political problems for them, but this is not a violation of the sovereignty of Pakistan, these strikes.",
        "There is a tacit understanding with the Pakistani government that these strikes are going to continue.",
        "They don't like it, they're not happy about it, but they are allowing it to - they are allowing these strikes to take place.",
        "That's important.",
        "As differentiated, there was several months ago a helicopter-borne attack by Special Forces troops inside Pakistani territory, and they made it pretty clear that was unacceptable.",
        "They actually fired on those troops that were U.S.",
