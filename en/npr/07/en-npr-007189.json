        "In congressional testimony and in the interview you're about to hear, McKay claims a top aide to a Republican congressman called to ask about an inquiry the prosecutor was conducting into alleged vote fraud.",

        "That would have seemed like an unusual thing at the time?",
        "Not unprecedented, but very unusual - and of course, in the context of the election, and I knew that Congressman Hastings was involved in some of the public debate surrounding that.",
        "And of course, I was the chief federal prosecutor and I wasn't involved in any debate.",
        "I was keeping very, very quiet, as was the FBI.",
        "So when the call came in, I was immediately alarmed.",
        "What did Congressman Hastings's chief of staff ask you in that phone call?",
        "Well, first he asked me a general question: what was going on?",
        "And I told him what was publicly released by my office - that we were requesting anyone with information to contact the FBI, that there were FBI agents assigned to this, that in effect it was a preliminary inquiry.",
        "And we had made those things public.",
        "Then he went further, which was to begin to ask me about what actions the government might be taking in any inquiry.",

        "A couple of months ago, this was normal.",

        "There is a very heavy government campaign that tries to show these refugee seekers as kind of a threat to security for ordinary Hungarians.",
        "They don't really have much contact with ordinary Hungarian people.",
        "For example, when these people enter Hungary, they are trespassing the fruit gardens of farmers in the region.",

        "There have been reports in the United States, Mr. Szekeres, that some of the refugees aren't in fact relying on smugglers at all - they have smartphone apps that help them navigate the landscape.",
        "I wonder if you've seen this.",
        "In February and June, the situation was really, as you say - that people used mobile phones, smartphones to navigate their way.",
        "They have an operation center somewhere - it could be in Syria or their home country - and they keep contact with a certain person.",
        "And that certain person is kind of guiding them through the whole way.",
        "Right now, people still have mobile phones, but my feeling was that they don't rely on traffickers anymore.",
        "Also, I have a contact who runs a little motel.",
        "He says that there is a big change in the social status of the refugee seekers.",

        "Probably, they have less money to spend on this journey."
