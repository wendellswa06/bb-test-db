        "The Army views a soldier as a soldier, and soldiers are deployed with their units to carry out their wartime mission.",
        "The Army still prohibits women from serving in smaller units whose primary function is direct ground combat.",
        "But female soldiers in Iraq commonly pull guard duty, go on patrols and operate the turret guns on Humvees.",
        "So far 37 Army women have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan since the beginning of the war on terrorism; seven of them were mothers.",
        "But, Robbins points out, there are plenty of men in uniform who've left kids at home, too.",
        "About 43 percent of our deployed soldiers are fathers, and about 3 percent of our deployed soldiers are mothers.",
        "And I think it is equally hard for our fathers as for our mothers to be away from their children.",
        "But just as women are now sharing the hardships that men at war have faced for centuries, they're also getting access to the benefits of a military career.",
        "That includes housing and health care for their families and leadership training and advancement.",
        "And there are plenty of women who just plain like being soldiers.",

        "Perkins says she does miss her twins, but she's in touch with them regularly via letters, phone calls and e-mail.",
        "The Army works hard to facilitate modern communication because knowing that everybody's OK back home reduces soldiers' stress and allows them to focus on the task at hand.",
        "Sergeant Perkins says it makes for some funny moments when battle-hardened soldiers get a videotape from home and pop it in a shared VCR.",
        "And you see all these people, you know, who just come back from the field, and they've still got their camouflage on, you know, and they've still got full battle ...(unintelligible).",
        "The first thing they did was stop in the mail room, come running in with their rifle and what have you, just sitting there watching their kids, and everybody's sitting there crying.",

        "From a short term, that's good for our local economy because it's, you know, we're selling houses, we're getting new business startups, we're creating jobs and things.",
        "But he says McAllen derives its economic strength from its relationship with the low-cost manufacturing plants in Reynosa.",
        "Patridge says the two cities are dependent on each others' success.",
        "We have to really look at what's in the best interest of both parties, and the best interest for us is to have a strong, stable, progressive Mexico.",

        "He kept that same tenacity and combativeness throughout his life.",
        "He studied agricultural science.",
        "And when he was 30, he accepted an offer from the Rockefeller Foundation and moved to a small research station in Mexico.",

        "That was it.",
        "Boy, he worked probably 10, 12 hours a day every day while he was in Mexico.",
        "The key to his biggest breakthrough came from Japan - a kind of wheat with a very short stalk.",
        "Other wheat breeders were experimenting with offspring from this dwarf wheat and getting encouraging results.",
        "It turned out that the wheat that they brought in from Japan not only shortened the stature of the wheats, but greatly increased production.",
        "Borlaug used that line of wheat and many others.",
        "He worked on a large scale and he worked fast, doubling the pace of his breeding program by continuing work through the winter in a separate warm-weather location.",
        "Borlaug then took his new varieties out to villages across Mexico.",
        "In a 1974 interview with the public radio show Options, Borlaug explained that it was the only way to persuade a farmer to plant the new seed.",
        "He won't do this if it's done an experiment station, a government experiment station, because he can't tell how much science and technology went into that and how much witchcraft.",
        "But if it's done on his own land, if he participates in putting in this demonstration, if you provoke this big increase in yield, he's very receptive.",
        "The Borlaug method succeeded in Mexico.",
        "And in the 1960s, with the support of the Rockefeller and the Ford Foundations, he took his campaign to India and other parts of Asia.",
        "Again, wheat breeder Clarence Peterson.",
        "He was very persuasive.",
        "He was more involved in politics, almost, than he was in agriculture when he went to these countries.",
        "But what he did is he went to the people over in charge of agriculture in India and convinced them to take(ph) a complete package - not only the wheats, but fertilizer and improve everything in their production.",
        "That combination: high-yielding seeds, fertilizer, expanded irrigation and government subsidies, produced the green revolution.",
        "Production boomed.",
        "Similar advances happened with rice farming.",
        "And instead of mass famines in south Asia, as many had predicted, the region became self-sufficient in wheat and rice.",
        "In 1970, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.",
        "In the decades since, his work has come in for criticism.",
        "Some say the green revolution made rich farmers richer and left poorer farmers behind.",
        "In some areas, heavy use of agricultural chemicals has harmed the environment.",
        "Borlaug, meanwhile, turned his attention to Africa and found it difficult to achieve success there.",
        "In a 1997 interview at member station WAMU, Borlaug said thousands of trials in farmers' fields all across the continent had shown how to double, even triple, farmers' production."
