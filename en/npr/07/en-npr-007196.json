        "Did anyone see Gags last night?",
        "This week, a clown has been making the late night scene in Green Bay, Wis., Gags, the Green Bay Clown, as he's been christened on a Facebook fan page - and, by the way, if the Visigoths sacked Rome again these days, there would be a Visigoth Facebook fan page about them - has appeared on the streets of an intersection at about 2 a.m. Gags doesn't look much like Bozo or even Crusty.",
        "In photos that have been snapped by alarmed neighbors, Gags appears to be grim, even forbidding, a character out of a Bergman film, not Disney.",
        "Gags has a blank white face, hollow black eye sockets and a cheerless black smile.",
        "He wears a crumpled ruffled collar and a dingy clown jumpsuit.",
        "The Green Bay Clown seems to loom over the street as he holds three black balloons aloft like gloomy clouds.",
        "Are they pestilence, famine and death, or in Green Bay, the Lions, Vikings and Bears?",
        "A couple of people on Gags' Facebook page have said that a horror film was being made in Green Bay, but no camera crews have been seen nearby.",
        "No permits to film have been filed.",
        "The Green Bay police told WGBA they've received several phone calls from anxious citizens.",
        "Imagine those recordings.",
        "Can you describe the clown, sir, red nose or floppy feet?",
        "But Captain Kevin Warych told news organizations a person can walk down the sidewalk dressed however they want as long as they are in a place they legally can be.",
        "Well, it turned out that there many solutions.",
        "Listener Richard Renner of New Philadelphia, Ohio, wrote in saying there are 78 solutions.",
        "Then he goes 42, 10, 4 and 3 in the top row and the rest of the numbers will appear on our Web site.",
        "Well, I used to be a software engineer, but now you'd call me a honey-do engineer.",
        "I am, I am, and the seven-letter first name and seven-letter last name helped a lot.",
        "And what's happening for you in Worthington, Ohio?",
