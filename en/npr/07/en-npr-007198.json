        "Right.",
        "And I have to ask you what you're doing at your school tomorrow.",
        "Well, we - my school actually allows it.",

        "But all parents - all kids have to dress in basic costumes.",
        "They can't have any weapons that go with it or anything like that, anything that they carry.",
        "But I've worked at schools where Halloween -you don't even know how to bring up the word Halloween.",
        "Really?",
        "Yes.",
        "And that happened to be because of influence of religious parents that go to the school.",
        "And thought it was encouraging paganism.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, this has come up at our local school because there are a number of families that don't celebrate Halloween.",
        "I've also got letters about this from my column.",
        "And my reaction to this is that it's fine not to celebrate Halloween.",
        "You know, I think we have this idea that our kids, they - everything always have to be the same for all of our kids.",
        "It's like every kid, you know, we can't deny them any experience for cultural reasons.",
        "But I feel very comfortable saying to a kid, yes, other people do do this, but we don't do it, and it's fine.",
        "But what's happening is that schools are now very uncomfortable dealing with the whole thing and they're pretty much outlying the whole thing.",
        "Now, when my daughter was young, her primary school didn't want any scary costumes.",
        "So, here's what I love.",
        "This was the '90s in Washington D.C., a bunch of these little second and third graders came as Bill Clintons and Monica Lewinskys."
