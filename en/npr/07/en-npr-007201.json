        "On one hand, he's trying to give this massive rescue program a fresh start, but he was involved in many of the bailouts for the banks and institutions that received rescue money last year.",
        "So, he's going to both have to answer a question about, this is why I did this in the past, and at the same time, convince lawmakers, I'm going in a new direction with this program.",

        "I think the Dow dropped something like 700 to 800 points.",
