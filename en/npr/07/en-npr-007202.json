        "And, you know, Mandela always said to appeal to people, you have to appeal to their head and their heart.",
        "And him understanding rugby, embracing rugby, was a way of appealing to the Afrikaner's heart, and he hoped the heart of the nation.",
        "And so it became a kind of symbol and even metaphor for what Mandela was trying to achieve as a whole.",
        "So I mean, the basic truth of it, I think, is absolutely correct and fair.",
        "There is another chapter you write in your book.",
        "We think of Nelson Mandela as, if anything else, utterly fearless, and according to what you write, nothing could be further from the truth.",
        "Well, he - you know, one of the things, Neal, that I found so fascinating and amazing when I was talking to him - and we did many, many, many hours of interviews for \"\"Long Walk to Freedom\"\" - was he would often say, you know, I was terrified or I was very scared that the guard was going to assault me or - he was constantly saying or often said, you know, that he was feeling fear.",
        "And at first, I just thought it was amazing.",
        "I mean, here is one of the greatest heroes of 20th century, one of the greatest heroes ever, expressing this fear.",
        "And I would ask him about it, and he would say, well, Richard, it's - it would be irrational not to be afraid, wouldn't it?"

        "I mean, that is what makes him a great hero, I think.",
        "One of the great stories Richard Stengel tells in \"\"Mandela's Way\"\" is about an airplane flight that Nelson Mandela took with one of his bodyguards, a man named Mike(ph), who, halfway through the flight, a twin-prop-plane, and one of the propellers stop turning, Nelson Mandela looked up from his newspaper and noticed that and told Mike to inform the pilot and went back to his newspaper.",
        "Mike said he was utterly terrified of this, but looked at Mandela, he was just calmly reading his newspaper, landed.",
        "And then later, Richard Stengel took a car ride with Nelson Mandela, who told him, I was absolutely terrified up there.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Now, it was - it's - and again, talking to Mike afterwards - I mean, Mike said the only thing that calmed him and he - this was probably his, you know, second or third airplane trip in his whole life - was that even while the, you know, the plane was landing, Mandela was just very calmly reading the newspaper like he was, you know, commuting in from his suburban home to the office.",
        "And again, as Mandela said, that was him putting up a front, pretending not to be scared, and that calmed Mike and it probably calmed the pilots and calmed all the people on the ground.",

        "He - Mandela never much looked to America.",
        "He knew about the Constitution, the founding and Abraham Lincoln.",

        "There probably wasn't much news that they got in South Africa in those days from America.",
        "Remember that part of a totalitarian government that South Africa had was that it kept out news like that.",

        "But, Neal, as you know, Gandhi spent his formative years in South Africa.",
        "And Gandhi was, indeed, a great influence on the ANC and Nelson Mandela.",
        "It really wasn't until, you know, the very early '60s that the ANC renounced nonviolence.",
        "I mean, nonviolence was - they embraced it, partly from that Gandhian tradition.",
        "But as Mandela told me at the time - and I write about it on the book -you know, he had won overarching goal, which was to bring freedom to his people and his nation.",
        "And everything else was a tactic or a strategy, as he would say.",
        "And he said to me very, very frankly, you know, nonviolence as far as I was concerned was a tactic.",
        "It wasn't a moral imperative or principle.",

        "They were talking very much along the same lines: nonviolence was a tactic.",

        "It was for Indian South Africans, and to get them to have at more privileges and more equality before the law.",
