        "Take the phrase `Baby Barb'--B-A-B-Y B-A-R-B.",
        "It has the same cryptogram pattern as Alan Alda.",
        "That is, the four B's in Baby Barb are in the same positions as the A's in Alan Alda.",
        "The two A's in Baby Barb are in the same positions as the L's in Alan Alda, etc. The question is: The name of what famous TV personality has the same cryptogram pattern as `Words Work'--W-O-R-D-S W-O-R-K?",
        "So, again, the name of what famous TV personality has the same cryptogram pattern as Words Work?"

        "That should be done over the next month or so.",

        "They say, look, Ronald Reagan's tax cut in 1981 was not real popular right out of the gate.",
        "A couple things to note about that - Reagan's tax cut in '81 was about three times as big as this one.",
        "And even so, Republicans lost 27 House seats the following year.",
        "The president also signed a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through mid-January.",
        "What does that do?",
        "Well, it keeps the government's lights on, but that's about it.",
        "It does provide some temporary funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which lapsed in the fall - enough to keep that operating through mid-March.",
        "But all the other big battles over future spending levels for the military and domestic programs, what to do about those DREAMers who came to the country illegally as children, whether and how to prop up the Obamacare markets - all those fights were simply put on hold.",
        "And Congress will have to go back at those in mid-January.",
        "And that tax bill passed without a single vote from the Democratic side in the House or the Senate.",

        "We haven't really seen either party talk about where the money is going to come from, and it's hard to do public works projects without money.",
        "You mentioned the Affordable Care Act, and President Trump said yesterday, to quote him, \"\"Obamacare is over\"\" with repeal of the tax penalty for people who don't buy health insurance.",
        "But there were big numbers this week for Obamacare sign-ups, weren't there?",
        "That's right.",
        "Nearly nine million people signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges, which is almost as many as signed up last year even though the enrollment period was much shorter this time around and even though the Trump administration slashed funding for advertising and sign up assistance.",
        "So what that shows is there is still considerable demand for this insurance coverage and the subsidies even though the president continues to say the system is imploding.",
        "Now, congressional forecasters say without the tax penalty for people who don't buy insurance, some younger, healthier people will opt to stay out of the system.",
