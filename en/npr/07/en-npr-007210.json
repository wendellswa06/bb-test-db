        "And I think this is just after you were up for an Oscar in, of course, \"\"Misery.\"\" And you said you'd made the decision to move from New York to Los Angeles, because, in part, you were a little tired of seeing the roles that you originated in theater going to other actresses when they were made into movies, and in part, because you figured you could go to Hollywood and either get a TV series or get a big movie part and do whatever you wanted.",
        "Has it worked out that way?",
        "Well, it's taken me a while, but I think, yes.",

        "I think we might get a lot more viewers, and it would be interesting to see how it worked out, anyway.",

        "Yeah, that's the same thing I thought.",
