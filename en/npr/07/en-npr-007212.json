        "As unemployment went down to 4 and 5 percent in New York City, well it went up in most neighborhoods of Harlem at a high rate of 23 percent.",
        "And how do you reverse these disparities?",
        "Then it also - and this is what I mean about the complexity of the undertaking here, that goes beyond brick and mortar, and that is the fact that it forces institutions to take their head out the sand and provide more leadership in society, and not just be passive in saying, well, we did all we can do.",
        "But I think that Columbia is challenged with setting a standard of what is the responsibility of the institution as citizen.",
        "And when it looks squarely at the scale of the disparities, and the scale of the solutions, you know, to address those disparities.",
        "And so when in developing this campus, I think the administration was, you know, almost forced by the reality - but not in terms of resistance - but forced to look at the fact that we have to talk in terms of thousands of jobs.",

        "Edwards is smart to stay out of that.",
        "But I tell you, I would like to be one who said that this is a coincidence that we've seen from the Clinton campaign, that it did not mean to inject racism so overtly, but I have to tell you, as an observer of this and as a political analyst, watching former Governor Shahin's husband talk about Senator Obama, watching BET founder Bob Johnson this past weekend, talking about Obama and making Al Gore a co-reference to his drug use, I would think that the Clintons are better than this.",
