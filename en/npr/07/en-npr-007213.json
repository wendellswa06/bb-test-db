        "Here to tell us more about it now, is NPR's justice correspondent Ari Shapiro, and Ari, I take it that this ruling was a bit less controversial than the one Dahlia was just discussing?",
        "Yeah, totally different in contrast to the five - four ruling that went against the Bush administration with these very scathing vigorous dissents coming from the court.",
        "This case was nine - zero.",
        "It was a unanimous opinion and the justices agreed with the Bush administration.",

        "Then Shawqi Omer, the other guy was arrested in a raid on an insurgent headquarters.",
        "He has not yet been tried or convicted, but in both cases, these are Americans who are being held by Americans in Iraq and the Americans were holding them and this is the tricky, but important detail, are operating as part of the multinational force in Iraq.",
        "And that was one of the government's arguments was that the Americans can't hand him over because the Americans aren't in control.",
        "It's a multinational force that's in control.",
        "But lawyers for these two men listen the American courts need to step in because these are Americans in American custody.",
        "They said the Iraqi justice system is a sham, and they said if our clients get handed over, our clients are likely to be tortured, perhaps even executed.",
        "That's what the lawyer said, but I take it the Supreme Court did not agree?",
        "No, they did not.",
        "The government basically made two arguments, and the Supreme Court agreed with one of them, but not the other.",
        "The first argument, which I mentioned just a moment ago, was look the Americans aren't holding these guys at all.",
        "It's the multinational force that is holding them.",
        "We have no control over them.",
        "And the justices basically said come on guys, you are Americans.",
        "You are holding these Americans.",

        "I'm sorry, continue."
