        "A little bit of both.",
        "In the beginning, because Morocco was a very close Cold War ally of the United States, the United States sided with Morocco in grabbing this land.",
        "Then, in the 1990s, former Secretary of State James Baker was appointed by the United Nations to be a special envoy to try to mediate the solution to the crisis and spent several years doing this, resigned in frustration when the Moroccans kept breaking the agreements.",
        "Most recently, however, there's been an ominous cloud, which is that the Moroccans have said that Western Sahara should be an autonomous province, and there are a growing number of people in Congress that are saying, yes, that's right.",
        "Now who's going to negotiate this, if anyone?",
        "This really - this needs to continue to be conducted through the United Nations.",
        "There really is no other broker that, I think, can do this, although pressure from the African Union certainly could help if it was a move against the Moroccans.",
        "The problem that we face, though, is that if there is a developing poll of opinion in - on Capitol Hill that's supporting the Moroccan position, the Moroccans may feel that they have no reason to compromise, thus, war will continue.",
        "What stake does the U.S.",
        "have either in Morocco or the Western Sahara in that region period?",
        "There is economic, political and strategic: economically, phosphates which were discovered in large quantities in the early 1960s in the Western Sahara; political, Morocco has been a close ally - some would call it a puppet of the United States for years.",
        "So that's the second factor.",
        "The third thing has to be situated in this so-called war against terrorism where anywhere in the Arabic-speaking world, there is this complete paranoia within the United States that al-Qaida may surface.",
        "And what's happening is the Moroccans are trying to disparage the liberation forces in West Sahara, calling them terrorists.",
        "Is there any basis for that?",
        "None.",
        "Polisario which is the liberation movement that leads a struggle there in Western Sahara is not at all an Islamist group.",
        "They are - they were certainly influenced by Marxism, but not at all by political Islam.",
        "And their chief national ally is Algeria.",
        "And Algeria has fought a tough war, as you know, against Islamic terrorists.",
        "So there is no basis.",

        "The Moroccans and their French allies, however, keep blocking this.",
        "And so when King Hassan II sent in 350,000 people, what he was hoping to do was to quite literally change the demographics of the Western Sahara so that when a referendum was held, people would vote to remain with Morocco.",
        "But there's an irony here.",
        "Many of those settlers are not very pleased with Morocco.",
        "And so Morocco doesn't even want to have a referendum now.",
        "In some ways, is this parallel to China and Tibet in terms of this whole idea of repopulating an area being a political strategy?",
        "It's very similar to China, Tibet, to Israel and Palestine.",
        "The sending in settlers - there's a security wall that the Moroccans set up in Western Sahara that divides the country and was based off of discussions of the Moroccan leadership actually had with the Israelis.",

        "The - and very few of them have been able to return.",
        "So you're talking about people that had been there for three decades, nearly four decades.",
        "So you have that situation.",
        "The second problem is, to put it bluntly, very few people care about the Western Sahara.",
        "And even in the Arab world, there is a great degree of silence about what's happening there.",
        "So the Western Sahara, even though the government - the interim government of the Saharawi people is recognized by more than 80 countries, it's not like you have a significant global movement that's insisting that something needs to be done.",
        "That - there in lies the problem.",

        "No.",
        "No, I wasn't surprised.",
        "It's been coming in many ways for a while.",
        "When the Libyans both decided to settle the Pan Am claim around the Lockerbie bombing and when the Libyans renounced weapons of mass destruction, it laid the basis for this turn of events.",
        "I guess the other part is that the Libyans under President Gadhafi have been very frustrated by the isolation that they found themselves in over the last 20 years, in particular, with the end of the Cold War.",
        "And so one, President Gadhafi has started to put more attention actually on Africa, but also there's been pressure within Libya for a greater rapprochement with the rest of the world.",
        "So I'm not surprised."
