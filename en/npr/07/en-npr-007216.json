        "Chicks dig guys with kids.",
        "But more seriously, it's a way of identifying you and not necessarily, certainly the way - although you might see yourself that way, not necessarily that's the definition of who you are as a person.",

        "I was friendly and outgoing, but I was having difficulty making friends.",
        "And, you know, I was pondering this and being self-reflective, and then I realized that the friends I was making were all Hispanic.",
        "They were all Mexican-American.",
        "And I realized that my identity really was primarily Hispanic, even though I didn't appear to be Hispanic, and in fact I joined Hispanic student organizations and started participating with them because that was where I was comfortable, which - and so it's just been an interesting journey to be a person who feels very much bicultural.",

        "And what you have in any border is an arbitrary line.",
        "You have this line that somebody's drawn, and people on one side are one thing, and people on the other side are another.",
        "And naturally, if you are around those border areas of Texas and New Mexico, they are - they're very hybrid, and you couldn't really - I mean, you know, your phone signal could pick up a Mexican one or an American one.",
        "People are wearing pretty similar things no either side of the border.",
        "But I think what - Sue also identifies an important thing about identity is that it's only when you leave where you're most comfortable, where you know, and you enter some other space that often that you really, you know, find out what is, you know, what that identity is."
