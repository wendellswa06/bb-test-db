        "As a child, it really troubled me because my first name is actually Russian, and I had kids tease me, saying I was a Russian spy and that they should report me to the government.",
        "And that was really terrifying for a young kid.",
        "And sometimes when people ask if I have a green card or if I can even work where I work, it's a little - sometimes you can take it, you know, with a grain of salt.",
        "Other times you can kind of tell when someone is deathly serious about reporting you.",
        "And that gets a little scary.",
        "Bree, thanks very much for joining us today on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Gary Younge, that brings up another question of national identity and green cards in this country.",
        "That is also something very much a part of our own personal identities but something that is also a very political matter for a lot of people and is a very judgmental thing, I think, as people look at others.",
        "Well, very much.",
        "I mean, many of these identities, while we can be playful with them, they can make the difference between being included and excluded, between being allowed to stay and being deported.",
        "And yes, I mean, particularly America, interestingly, I think, because it's a nation founded by immigrants, and that therefore, unlike most of Europe, where people consider themselves really, you know, they're from the - consider that they were there from the beginning, so there is an extent to which, for example in France and Germany, when you talk about immigrants, immigrants is almost a - is almost a synonym for non-white, whereas America has a much more flexible sense of its national identity.",
        "But at different moments, I mean, different groups become kind of the most questionable.",
        "I mean, I've always thought that Americans love immigration, they love the stories of the fluidity of coming to the country with just $10 in your pocket, of reinvention and so on.",
        "They love immigration; it's just the immigrants that they have a problem with.",
        "And the particular immigrants at particular times will change.",
        "It's been Chinese, it's been the Irish.",

        "I find that people in this country care a lot more for race and ethnicity than anywhere else.",
        "And it sounds kind of like you were saying.",
        "I don't know that it's necessarily more than anywhere else.",
        "I think America has had to develop a language, particularly for race, because of its particularly kind of fraught recent racial history, and sometimes I wish Europe had a better conversation, a more grown up and sophisticated conversation about race, actually.",
        "But America didn't have any choice.",
        "It's civil rights movement took place here.",

        "I mean, I certainly think that with a little bit of historical memory, it becomes clear why that would be here, but it's not that long ago that racism was codified, practiced in America.",
        "And if you went to South Africa in 30 years time, it would be strange if people weren't still talking about race.",
        "But I think what is certainly true is that different countries in different ways will have different obsessions and that those obsessions will also change over time, depending on what's going on in the country.",

        "And then, it may turn out that they don't look old, they're just haggard.",
        "You know, who knew?",
        "But there's really important distinction between discriminating between people and discriminating against them.",
        "And it's the moment at which we act from those assumptions in a way that's going to isolate, marginalize or in some way denigrate someone that the problems arise.",
