        "Logan says the society's doctors feel the benefits of BSCs aren't clear, whereas some of the drawbacks are.",
        "One is the tendency of some women to find every little change, even normal ones, alarming.",
        "That leads to additional tests and biopsies to make sure everything's okay.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But this I'm-waiting-for-someone-to-come-to-me approach on immigration got him through the speech, but it lays bare the question that once you've put aside the Band-aid of the DREAM Act, what is either Mitt Romney or Barack Obama going to do with the much larger challenge of 11.5 million people who are in this country without proper documentation.",
        "And Raph, let's talk briefly about that, because do you think that President Obama missed an opportunity there to use the bully pulpit to be more proactive?",
        "And did that seem, as Dan is saying, too passive a statement?",
        "Well, anybody who's watched the first few years of the Obama administration would find it pretty hard to argue that he hasn't tried to reach out to the other side and gotten his hand slapped again and again, to the point where it was, in fact, almost embarrassing and demoralizing to the Democratic Party and to many independent voters.",
        "At a certain point, with the economy not getting better, he really has no choice but to fight his way out of the box he's in.",
        "And I think with this decision, which was probably the best he could get, he's finally saying: I know for people who support me and whose support I want, I have to make a difference in their lives, and I just did something that made a difference in 800,000 to a million people's lives that really matters."
