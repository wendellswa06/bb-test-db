        "Latino voters are a substantial factor to consider here in California in the congressional races.",
        "There are new congressional districts that have been drawn, speculation about how much of a net gain there might be in Democratic seats in the House from California and if that could, in fact, tip the balance in the House back to the Democrats.",
        "Dan Schnur, any chance of that, do you think?",
        "It's looking less likely as a result of our primary early this month.",
        "Just to give your listeners from outside of California, Melissa, a little bit of a historical perspective on how badly gerrymandered our congressional districts have been in the previous decade, there are 53 congressional districts in California; that means there have been 265 elections held in this state for Congress over the last 10 years.",
        "In 264 out of those 265 elections, the party that went into the election holding power came out of the election holding power.",
        "There was exactly one seat that turned over.",
        "For reasons that we probably don't have time to get into today, Democrats probably are not going to realize as many gains in the state this fall as they'd originally hoped.",
        "But far more importantly for California voters at least is that we end up with a much larger number of competitive races.",
        "That's not only good for voters on Election Day, that's good for our delegation and for Congress come next January.",
        "And Raphael Sonenshein, there's a new rule here in California, the top two primary - why don't you walk us through how that works and what the effect might be.",
        "Yeah, good luck with this one.",
        "The new rule that was enacted in 2010 is that in the primary, everybody runs, and only the top two candidates make it into the runoff.",
        "Even if one candidate gets 99 percent of the vote, the top two runoff.",
        "This really bollixed-up Democrats because there were six seats they thought they had a chance for, and they managed in one congressional seat to not get a Democrat into the finals, so there's two Republicans running.",
        "They didn't get their favorite Democrat into another seat.",
        "So there's sort of two out of the six already not looking good.",
        "Everyone is completely confused.",
        "There's members of - mostly Democrats running against each other in November, which is going to take money from the presidential race.",
        "Like the Sherman-Berman race.",
        "They call it the Ermans, and there's many other names, the Sherman-Berman race.",
        "It's going to be very confusing.",
        "In the long run, the hope is that more non-aligned moderate candidates will get elected.",
        "Let's hope that happens."
