        "And I think also, given that President Obama went on to give a speech in presenting the award that was widely seen, basically, as a justification for the wars in Afghanistan, in - and Iraq, that was something of a shock, I would say, not only to the committee, probably, but to European sensibilities.",
        "And I think that's what this prize in many ways reflects.",
