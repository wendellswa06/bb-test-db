        "Well, it's always a mix of organizations and individuals.",
        "There are some Russian dissidents, actually, on the list, or in particular one woman, Svetlana - and I'm sorry about the name here but -Gannushkina, who has been really a champion of Chechen human rights in face of the Russian military campaign in Chechnya.",
        "But then there are also organizations - and several organizations seem to figure prominently this year.",
        "One is the Special Court of - for Sierra Leone that is trying war crimes and crimes against humanity that were committed in the civil war there.",
        "Another interesting one is the Democratic Voice of Burma, which is really a media organization.",
        "It's an exile media organization that - actually based in Oslo, Norway.",

        "But they - what they do is they send clandestine Burmese journalists, they bring them out clandestinely, train them to use video cameras and other reporting equipment, send them back in, and then they send out with either via cell phones or other devices, send out the reports on what is really going on inside a closed country like Burma or Myanmar.",
        "And one reason some observers or - of the Nobel Prize think they could be a good candidate is just the kind of hybrid organization it is or the way it kind of uses new technology to address an old problem...",

        "It's Howard LaFranchi.",
        "Nelson Mandela, pretty uncontroversial choice, right?",
        "When he got it.",
        "Clearly there have been choices like that in the past that no one can find any fault in.",
        "There are some interesting things that - it's sort of like the Oscars in a way - and by the way, the Democratic Voice of Burma, a documentary about them last year, was nominated for an Oscar.",
        "But in the same way that every year at Oscar time we hear how there are certain actors and actresses who are - or directors - that are among our favorites that have never won an award, never won an Oscar - Gandhi never won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And so...",
        "It's kind of hard to believe."

        "But if nominees themselves want to make the fact that they were nominated public, they're - they have every right to do so.",
