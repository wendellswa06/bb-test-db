        "In addition, they're talking about maybe that the president should appoint someone like a Rudy Giuliani, a Colin Powell, someone with a tremendous amount of personal appeal and reputation, as a czar of recovery--put someone in that position who could handle long-term relief efforts, reconstruction, so that you would have a sense of this administration coming to grips with a major catastrophe on the national scene.",
        "Whatever is done, though, they feel the president has a need to make up for the flyover when he was first made aware of the extent of the damage.",
        "Remember, at one point he said, `Brown, you're doing a great job,' with regard to Michael Brown--that the president now needs to go back and say that maybe he didn't understand the gravity of the situation.",
