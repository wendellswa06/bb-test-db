        "Now, looking at these first appointments as a group, and we'll include in that group the White House staff appointments earlier in the week of Stephen Bannon as chief strategist and Reince Priebus as chief of staff.",
        "So what jumps out at you when you look at the group?",
        "Well, obviously, you've got Donald Trump who likes to have these kind of warring factions of different power centers beneath him so that he can make decisions.",
        "And you've got very different types of people with Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus.",
        "Bannon's sort of more of this inspirational leader for Trump as he was during the campaign, but a very checkered background - ties to the alt-right as he had bragged that Breitbart, where he was the head of the conservative news organization, that he had made it a platform for the alt-right, so a very controversial pick there.",
        "Reince Priebus, on the other hand, somebody who will probably try to work with the Republican Congress to try to get some of Trump's agenda through.",

        "Now, some of the dozens of mortars and rockets fell short and killed Iraqis in surrounding civilian areas.",
        "The Green Zone has always been a popular target because hitting it carries a lot of symbolism, as you can imagine.",
        "It's supposedly the most heavily protected area in Baghdad, and yet they're still vulnerable to attack.",
        "Attacks against the Green Zone have become infrequent, but we've seem an uptick recently.",
        "And today, obviously, someone seems to have been trying to send a message.",
        "Any idea who that might be?",
        "Well, there's some conjecture that these attacks may have come from rogue elements of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army, but no group has claimed responsibility and they normally don't.",

        "Now Lulu(ph), I know outside of Baghdad, there was violence in Mosul, in the city of Samarra.",
        "What do you know about those attacks?",
        "We saw two suicide attacks in Mosul.",
        "A truck bomber smashed into an Iraqi Army base, killing at least 10 Iraqi soldiers.",
        "There was then a second bombing, also targeting an Iraqi Army base.",
        "The reason we've seen Mosul become such a hotspot is because insurgents have been pushed out of Baghdad and they've moved north.",
        "That also means Samarra.",
        "Today there was another car bombing, this time targeting local Sunni tribal fighters.",
        "Now, this must be of great concern to the U.S.",
        "military.",
        "It is now drawing down the troops that were part of the surge.",
