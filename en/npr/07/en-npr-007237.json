        "Brown recently got solar panels on his Oakland home, but it's dark out right now.",
        "His panels aren't working, so Brown's appliances are running on electricity he's buying from his utility, Pacific Gas & Electric.",
        "So even with solar panels, you might think his utility bill is pretty high.",
        "Right now, we're projected basically to have a zero bill.",
        "Zero dollars - that's because during the day, when Brown's panels are cranking out electricity, he sells the extra back to PG&E.",
        "The power he sells cancels out the power he buys.",
        "That's what makes solar so financially attractive - at least for him.",
        "It is going to be a challenge for the utility.",
        "That's Aaron Johnson, a vice president at PG&E.",
        "The utility is home to a quarter of all the rooftop solar systems in the country, and a new one comes online every seven minutes.",
        "And to that, he says, today's electric grid needs an upgrade.",
        "As we begin to build that sort of modern, 21st century grid, you know, everyone's going to have to contribute to that.",
        "And we think solar customers need to contribute that.",
        "Did you catch that last part?",
        "He's saying with their low bills, solar customers aren't pitching in enough.",
        "That's creating a shortfall that PG&E says will reach almost $3 billion a year within a decade.",
        "So California's utilities want to pay new solar customers less for their extra electricity and to add new monthly fees."

        "We saw a 95 percent drop in the applications for solar.",
        "We saw, you know, absolute devastation in the market, and it's created a lot of anxiety.",
        "That's not something California wants to do, Wright argues, when the state has big renewable energy goals.",
        "Whatever California regulators decide, the state makes up more than 40 percent of the country's solar market, so the precedent set here could spread nationwide, says Brian Chin.",

        "A lot of times, these states all kind of look at each other and go, well, if they can do that and it's reasonable, then we can do it too.",
        "Chin says it just shows how solar is disrupting the way electric utilities do business.",
        "You look at sort of the business model, and you can't help but go the business model has to change in the next 15 years in some way, shape or form.",
        "That's why utilities in some other states are trying a different approach to solar."

        "Now, there are a few important differences between Georgia and California when it comes to solar.",
        "Electricity costs less here, so it makes less financial sense for people to get rooftop solar panels.",
        "When they do have solar panels on their roofs, the utility doesn't pay as much to buy the extra energy generated, as it would in California.",
