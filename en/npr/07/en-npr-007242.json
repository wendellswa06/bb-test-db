        "Basically, we talked a lot about the war in Iraq and terrorism, and the person who's always done well, that's always stood out, is McCain.",
        "McCain is a shining star, and I do agree with Ron, he's the one to watch in Michigan.",
        "and also Mitt Romney.",
        "And I'd like to add to what Ron said, Mitt Romney's father was governor of Michigan.",
        "And I worked for Senator Bob Dole in '95 and '96.",
        "and Mitt Romney, to me, he looks presidential, but he can't close a sale.",
        "And if you remember Bob Dole in 1996, he can reach the masses and I think that Mitt Romney has that Bob Dole syndrome.",
        "So if he doesn't pull it out in Michigan, I think he's going to have a big uphill climb and a challenge.",
        "What's your assessment, Michael?",
        "I think all of the candidates, but for John McCain lost.",

        "…because - when McCain is on the verge of establishing himself as the clear front-runner.",
        "I think he got a tremendous amount of boost from New Hampshire and when you look at how the other candidates really did and challenge him all very much, I think when you're the front-runner or moving toward a front-runner status, and the other candidates effectively give you a pass, then I think that just sort of confirms your strength.",
        "And so from my perspective, McCain was the clear winner and the rest of them, really, didn't do anything to help themselves at all.",
        "The one thing that I'd like to add is that - to your analysis -no one can take that terrorism moniker away or that patriot moniker away from McCain, and no one really wants to bash him on his policy dealing with the war on terror because he has given so much to this country, fighting in Vietnam, being a POW.",
        "And I think that all of the candidates respect McCain.",
        "However, don't count Giuliani out, because he's going to take Florida and then Super Tuesday is just right around the corner.",

        "Dupont has lots of stories about what made Melvin the best, how Melvin once found his car keys in the tall grass, how they trusted Melvin so much they let him babysit their grandson all by himself in the backyard, how folks would come by just to visit with Melvin.",
        "He'd listen.",
        "You could talk to him, and he - sure, he understood what you were talking about.",
        "I mean, you'd tell him anything; he'd go do it.",
        "Most of the time, he knew what you were talking about.",

        "So a couple of years ago, when Melvin was starting to show his age, the Duponts heard about a place that was cloning dogs, a lab in South Korea.",

        "So Dupont sent some of Melvin's skin cells off to the lab in South Korea.",

        "But not everyone thinks this is so great.",
        "Before I went to see the Duponts, I talked with Insoo Hyun, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve University, to find out why.",
        "If you love dogs and you really want to have your companion animal cloned, you really do need to take very seriously the health and well-being of all the dogs that would be involved in this process.",
        "You see, to clone a dog, you need to use a lot of other dogs, female dogs, to get eggs to make cloned dog embryos and be surrogate mother dogs.",
        "So lots of dogs go through operations to get the eggs and impregnate the surrogate.",
        "And most of the time, it doesn't work.",
        "So you have to try over and over again to get each clone.",
        "I think there are probably better ways to spend $100,000 if you really care about animals.",
        "Hyun also wonders about the health of the cloned puppies.",
        "Most cloned animals end up pretty sickly.",
        "And just because the clones have the same genes as the original dogs, Hyun says that doesn't necessarily mean they're really carbon copies.",
        "All cloning does is reproduce the genome of your original pet.",
        "But maybe the way that your dog interacted with you and the way it looked was also strongly environmentally influenced.",
        "And you can never obviously duplicate that kind of influence."
