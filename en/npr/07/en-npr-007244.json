        "So Michael, why are the Republicans referencing Ronald Reagan so much right now?",
        "And is there a GOP candidate who you think whose campaign is actually resonating with Reaganites?",
        "They are calling Reagan's name so often because he is the last popular Republican president.",
        "It would be fool's gold to do that with the current President Bush or the previous President Bush.",
        "And so, you know, Ronald Reagan's name evokes certain thoughts among Republican voters.",
        "And so I understand why they're doing it.",
        "The problem, though, Tony, is, in many respects, that Republican coalition doesn't exist in the same way that it did a generation or so ago.",
        "And so while I understand that that may work in Republican primaries, nominating contests, sort of circumstance - I'm not sure if this is sort of thing can get you to the White House.",
        "And so I think that the candidates who evoke Reagan's name do so for understandable reasons.",

        "Nobody brings me to mind to Ronald Reagan.",
        "But one thing I'd like to disagree with your analysis is from the standpoint, our conservative foundation is strong.",
        "Now, in 2006, that was a state home by conservatives because they were disgruntled with the party from dealing with Mark Foley and the spending, wasteful spending.",
        "But Ronald Reagan was the great communicator.",
        "And he's the great hero of the party.",
        "And yes, you are right.",

        "I do agree with you with this, though.",
        "In the national campaign, Ronald Reagan is not going to get someone in the White House.",
        "We will get someone in the White House if the person is tough on terrorists, the person is in the front on national security, and people care about the economy and the price of oil.",
        "So I think there's many things there, but right now, Ronald Reagan is very popular still among conservatives than in history.",
        "Here's my final question.",
        "We have about a minute left.",
        "When do you think we will finally get a sense of who - the front-runner - is going to be the standard bearer as likely to be for the Republican Party, Michael?",
        "Well, I think if there is one candidate who wins both Michigan and South Carolina, and let's say that candidate is McCain, then I think you begin to see the beginning of the end for the remaining candidates.",

        "Mitt Romney is fading badly.",
        "Mike Huckabee has problems.",
