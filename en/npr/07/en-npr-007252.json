        "You're saying this is - this is strange for a political campaign to have a family - the Trump family - being so crucial in making all the decisions and Manafort was able to...",
        "I don't know that it's strange.",
        "It's predictable and it can happen.",
        "But it's not usually a good idea because families have different agenda items, right?",

        "So if you're Donald Trump and the Trump family, I mean, what - what do you see in Paul Manafort that you want right now as opposed to, you know, a campaign manager like Lewandowski?",
        "I'm guessing they went to Donald Trump and said what we're doing is not working, that it's failing and we need to make a change.",
        "And sometimes when a campaign needs to make a change or things are going so badly - and they have been going badly when you have polling numbers where women see Trump negatively at 77 percent, Hispanics worse, African-Americans worse and even the electorate at large, the potential voters for Trump, at almost 70 percent - things aren't going well.",
        "And with the finance report yesterday, you know, 1 to 42 million is not where you want to be.",
        "And you can run - look, you can run the, you know, the greatest message in the world.",
        "I think they have a - an OK message.",
        "But then you got to pay for that message to get out there for people to hear it in battleground states.",
        "And when Hillary Clinton's already placed almost $21 million worth of ads and he's placed zero, this is winding up to be a problem.",
        "So they needed some - they needed to say we're serious about change.",
        "That's what the family convinced Donald Trump of.",
        "And moving Corey off was the signal that we're going to change things.",
        "Corey Lewandowski was sort of seen as the man who let Trump be Trump.",
        "Right.",

        "Yeah.",
        "...Who responded to that.",
        "Is there a risk in not having him around that people like Paul Manafort, as you described him, will try and rein him in a way that won't let him be himself."
