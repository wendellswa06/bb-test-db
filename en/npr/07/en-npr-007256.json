        "I just - I used to be a supervisor in the maximum-security men's prisons for the state of Virginia, but I did have the opportunity to tour the main women's prison, and I found it fascinating because the only fencing on the women's prison were to protect the women who were about to be paroled.",
        "They said women didn't run.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Piper Kerman, I do have to say that there's one point you say, you've got to get me out of here, to your fianc�, but I - and there's nobody ever in your book who says: Why don't we tunnel our way out?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "The prison camp where I spent the first 11 months of my sentence was not a fenced facility, and so you could easily have walked away at almost any time, and no one ever did.",
        "The high-security prison that was immediately adjacent was, in fact, heavily fenced.",
        "There was a vicious-looking, triple-layer, razor-wire fence.",
        "But to escape from that facility would have been a tricky, tricky proposition - and certainly from Oklahoma City or from the Chicago federal jail.",
        "I can't say I invested a lot of thought in escape, but it would probably be a pretty challenging thing.",
        "Marilyn, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",

        "How are you doing?",
        "We're doing well, thank you.",
        "I called because I worked in a male institution for five years in the Ohio Department of Corrections, and was asked to transfer to a women's facility.",
        "When I investigated what that would be like, I really began to question the validity of having different-gender staff working with inmates.",
        "I wondered if your guest could comment on what it's like to have male correction officers in a female prison, and if she thinks that's a valid option.",
        "And Bill, just briefly, what did you do there?",
        "I was the chaplain.",
        "Chaplain.",
        "OK.",
        "Piper Kerman?",
        "Well, Bill, thanks for your service as a chaplain, because that's a really important role within any prison setting, first of all.",
        "In every facility in which I lived, the overwhelming number of the correctional officers or guards were men.",
        "Some of them were good men, and some of them were bad men.",
        "And there were also women who worked in each facility as well.",
        "I think one of the things that's most problematic about that situation is the paradigm of guards who have near-complete control over prisoners' lives.",
        "When that gender imbalance is there, it reinforces a lot of aspects of the women who have been prisoners, many of whom have had complicated relationships with men over their history.",
        "Women in prison are much more likely to have been physically hurt and abused over the course of their lives.",
        "So I really, on a sort of philosophical level, that's a disturbing thing.",
        "I do think gender parity among guards would be a better thing all around in facilities.",
        "I think a lot of folks in corrections say that it's hard to recruit women to work in institutions, and I do understand that."

        "Yes, that's true.",
        "I would say that that was a big factor when I was an undergraduate at a women's college - was, you know, busting the stress of exams and the pressure of school with food and rituals around food.",
        "And that is certainly true as well in the other women's institution in which I spent time, the federal prison.",
        "So I think that when you are presented with institutional food on a day-in and day-out basis and often not very good food, despite the best efforts of the prisoners who are working in the kitchen, the opportunity to eat food that is prepared with love, which is really only the food that people are able to make for themselves - there were two small microwaves for about 200 prisoners is really a huge treat.",
        "And a lot of the women who were there in Danbury were of either Latino or Caribbean background, and they would particularly strive to make food that reminded them of their own cultures, and that was especially delicious.",
