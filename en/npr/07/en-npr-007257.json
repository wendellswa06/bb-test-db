        "Cathy, how did you girls down the hill regard the campers up the hill?",
        "Well, to be honest with you, we thought they had it made in the shade.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Because they were able to walk around and move.",
        "We were under movement, which meant that we could only move across the compound every 10 minutes during the 10-minutes move, which was like a quarter 'til the hour.",
        "I was really stunned...",
        "The campers were able to go up and down and go outside.",
        "We weren't allowed to do that except after 4 o'clock or on the weekend.",
        "You were locked down.",
        "Yeah, I was really stunned when I was moved from a minimum-security facility to a maximum-security facility, - especially the Chicago facility - at what a dramatic impact the conditions of your incarceration make on your mental and emotional state.",
        "It's really devastating.",
        "And I was at the medical facility in Texas, Coswell, because they sent me there.",
        "I'm disabled and was sent there the last four months of my sentence.",
        "Are you doing OK, Cathy?",
        "I haven't seen a doctor yet.",
        "I've been out since Friday, actually, but and I just left my PO officer, and we heard it on the radio.",
        "And I told my friend, I said, get me on the phone."

        "Hi, yeah, actually, it's Clarkdale, Arizona, and I've been out for actually eight months, and I spent 12 months in Dublin FPI in California, and then two months in a halfway house in Phoenix, Arizona.",
        "Dublin is another of the places that you mention in the book, Piper.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's another facility that is a large, high-security facility, and then I believe they also have a satellite camp there, too.",
        "And which side were you on?",
        "I was actually I think they consider it medium now, but it's medium-high.",
        "I was in the medium-high facility.",
        "They actually did my points wrong.",
        "So I could have gone to camp here in Arizona.",

        "Oh, I'm so sorry.",
        "No, you know what?",
        "The girls there are amazing, and I just want to say that they work so hard in the facility and to change their lives, and I completely agree with pretty much everything that your guest has said about being in the prison and what it does to you psychologically and emotionally and even leaving your family.",
        "So...",
        "You would think that if, given that experience, that people would take good care not to go back.",
        "Most people would, but I was just saying to the lady who answered the phone, is I'm very lucky because I have an amazingly supportive family who has been there with me through this whole, entire thing - and some really good friends.",
        "But a lot of people that get out, men and women, they don't have the support system.",
        "They don't have anywhere to go.",
        "They're in halfway houses for three months, six months, a year, you know, looking for jobs, and you know, the opportunities aren't really there, especially with the economy the way it is right now."

        "She couldn't be more right.",
        "You know, there are some really consistent factors that make up success in terms of coming home, and those are stable and safe housing, access to a job, the ability to get a job, have employment, keep employment; and family reunification.",
        "And that's a really, really important, big deal for women especially, because most of the women in prison, I think 80 percent, are mothers, and a significant percentage of them had primary custody of their children before they went to prison.",
        "And gaining the support of their family and their community, their larger community, is a really big challenge.",
        "And when those factors are difficult, it makes it very, very challenging to keep your feet on the straight and narrow.",
        "You know, unfortunately, two-thirds of all offenders are being sent back to prison.",
        "Sometimes that's because of a new offense, but a lot of the time it's because of what's called a technical violation, like missing a probation or parole appointment or sometimes a bad - a dirty drug test.",
        "And I really I mean, a lot of people talk about personal responsibility in that respect, and again, I take personal responsibility for myself.",
        "But to me, a two-thirds failure rate is a systemic failure.",
        "You know, it's not simply about individuals.",
        "Milena, thanks very much, and good luck to you.",

        "I went through my supervised release.",

        "Hmm.",
