        "So many women that I knew either were going home to really uncertain and potentially unsafe situations and they were scared to go home, and that was heartbreaking.",
        "To see somebody who is frightened to leave prison is a devastating thing.",
        "Yes.",

        "And unfortunately, there aren't enough factors built into the way that the system works to allow folks to really succeed as much as they should be able to.",
        "Because I see folks walk out of prison and they have the strongest intention to put their lives back together.",
        "But it takes, you know, a support system to do that.",
        "Yes, it does.",
        "And it is hard because, you know, there have been moments where, yeah, I felt like I was doing OK, but then it seemed like maybe I should, you know, go back to my old life because that seemed easier for me.",

        "And one of the rules of probation is that you are not to have any contact with people - a person with a criminal record.",
