        "Well, and Rick Warren got a lot of flak for inviting Obama back then.",
        "Maybe then on some level, Obama actually feels grateful to Warren for doing that because it gave Obama a certain amount of credibility at a key time.",
        "But I think, beyond that, Warren, you know, may look like just another conservative evangelical from some perspectives, but he's a bit more interesting than that.",
        "I mean, for one thing, he's actually been arguing and criticizing his friends among evangelicals that they are too political and they're too conservative - and they're too focused on culture war issues."
