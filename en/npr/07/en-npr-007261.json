        "Right, right.",
        "It's a kind of a slippery slope argument that's understandable.",

        "I actually asked Warren about it because of that confusion.",

        "No, and you know, I think the next turn on the wheel is going to be to see what Rick Warren actually says at his invocation.",
        "And (unintelligible) issue is a little bit different, which is that Franklin Graham caused a bit of a controversy when he did the invocation for George Bush by praying in the name of Jesus Christ, which was a departure.",
        "Usually the invocations are more broad than that.",

        "In the summer of 1842, along what is now Highway 40 in Central Indiana, Martin Van Buren was being taken for a ride, literally.",
        "He'd been out of office for a little more than a year, but the ex-president was already traveling the country trying to drum up support for another run at the White House.",
        "He spent a weekend in Indianapolis speaking and meeting people and then was heading west to Illinois to shake more hands, to kiss more babies.",
        "But according to historian Bill Clendineng, the people in Plainfield, just outside of Indianapolis, wanted to teach the ex-president a lesson.",
        "During his term, Van Buren opposed a bill that would have funded improvements to the National Road, which wasn't really a road so much as a strip of dirt, with huge tree stumps and ruts that forced carriage passengers to tie themselves to their seats.",
        "Some Plainfield residents decided that Van Buren should go on a rough ride to see firsthand how badly the road needed repairs.",

        "At the base of the tree was a large mud hole where pigs wallowed.",
        "There were two routes to get around it, but the carriage driver deliberately took the rough route knowing the elm's roots would overturn the carriage and send Van Buren flying into the mud.",
        "The plan was executed perfectly.",
        "The carriage tipped over, and Van Buren went into the muck, soiling his starched white clothes and filling his boots with thick mud.",
        "Residents who'd gathered in their Sunday best to greet the ex-president stood amazed as a humbled Van Buren made his way to the town tavern to clean up.",
        "Meanwhile, the carriage driver who'd pulled off the prank was rewarded by some residents with a $5 silk hat.",
        "It took 75 years before the tree was marked with a plaque.",

        "With our 60 to 70 strike aircraft, those aircraft would go out, apply their 500, 1,000, 2,000-pound bombs, recover, reload, refuel, relaunch and go do it again and again and again, and there's nothing like it.",
        "Rear Admiral Peter Daly, one of the crew members featured in the PBS series \"\"Carrier: Life Aboard the USS Nimitz.\"\" Filmmakers followed 24 men and women, including newly enlisted sailors, long-serving chiefs and fighter pilots to get a glimpse of the monotony, intensity and expectations aboard this vast island of steel.",
