        "Thanksgiving was one of the few holidays where we actually participated in respecting the new country that we found ourselves in and that I was actually born in, and we actually roasted a turkey.",

        "And there would be some sort of pastitsio, which I guess could best be described as a Greek baked ziti, and my mother would always make braised artichokes and lemon, and egg would be added to it with a lot of dill, and that would be poured over.",

        "The people leaving the country that they love take a picture of that country and then they bring that picture with them and they raise their children in the vacuum of that picture.",
        "What happens is that the country evolves but that picture never does, so there's an interesting dynamic that occurs where you - transplanted first generation child often time is more in tune with the older traditions of the country that your parents left than the people who are actually living there at that time.",
        "What about this year for you?",
        "What are you putting on your table on this Thursday?",

        "There'll probably be a little bit more American.",
        "And interestingly enough, you know, I was born in this country and my wife is Italian and I have a son who is now second generation, so we incorporate, I think, a little bit more American sort of identity, so there is cranberry - fresh cranberry preserve on the table."
