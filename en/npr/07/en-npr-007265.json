        "You know, if you really watch the series, it's not.",
        "What I'm actually proud of is that it's pretty even-handed.",
        "Because there are a lot of people who watch the series, you know, who were, you know, very pro-Navy, or more on what would be classified, you know, as the right side of the spectrum politically, who can't believe some of the things that you show and that people are saying and that people are speaking so freely.",
        "And you know, I think there's some things that happen that are very challenging and you know, it's not the direction that the Navy would take in their - if they were, you know, managing their own PR.",
        "But I think over the end of the whole series, the leadership of the Navy came to feel that it represented them well and fairly and that people could make their own judgment.",
        "But the thing that I really - I've always felt when I went into directing it and when I started to talk to them was that I felt that if people saw things not just from one perspective, I mean, if you look at a recruitment ad or an ad for the Navy, there is no dark sides to that story.",
        "They are showing you a 100 percent positive join the Navy, see the world."

        "And I'd like to think the ladies were flattered, but I knew they were probably scared to death.",
        "I think all of the members of the Nimitz crew, I think, will thank me now for not wearing a black leather mini-skirt.",

        "He would write out the oath, indicating where he planned to pause for the president to repeat the words, and then have it conveyed through the congressional Sergeant of Arms office to the president's staff.",

        "Nobody on the president's staff, however, ever saw this oath with the marked pauses.",

        "That's it.",
        "And Obama started his part early and then it got worse because, you see, John Roberts is famous for his memory.",
        "And he'd memorized the oath, rehearsing it often in chambers, and he did not bring a copy of the oath card with him.",
        "Now, even a man as confident a memorizer as the Chief Justice can be thrown when he appears before a crowd of 2 million people and a verbal wrench gets thrown into the works.",
        "So the next phrase the Chief Justice is to say, that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, here's what happens."
