        "The fewer pieces that go to making up that curve, the stronger the vessel, over all.",

        "He seems to be the champion of the Sunnis.",
        "So, in some ways, that shows that the elections here are cross-sectarian, all of these Sunnis voting for a Shiite.",
        "But in other ways, it seems that it's still sectarian, because all of the Sunnis seem to have voted for this particular party.",

        "What I'm hearing from up there against preliminary is that he didn't do as well as expected in the city of Kirkuk and the city of Sulaymaniyah, maybe not the total upset that he had hoped for, but still getting a number of seats and still remaining a political force up there.",
        "So it's maybe shaken the cart up there, but it hasn't tipped it over completely.",
        "And my friends up there say that they think it's healthy to have another party besides their entrenched traditional two-party system, but maybe also nice not to have the thing ripped open completely."
