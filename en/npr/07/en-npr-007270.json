        "Moody's flirtation with Twitter was not entirely successful, mainly because the delivery of the story went awry, and some industry insiders were bombarded with repetitive tweets.",
        "Still, Moody doesn't regret the experiment.",
        "But he does have doubts about Twitter's literary potential.",
        "It forced me to try to imply more narrative than I could actually include in the piece, because I was so stuck in this little box.",
        "You know, it's hard to have a dialogue between characters in the confines of the Twitter box, and so on.",
        "That was all really fun.",
        "Whether I think Twitter is ultimately going to be a great vehicle for fiction, I'd say no.",
        "A lot of writers are trying their hand at Twitter books, but Time magazine book reviewer Lev Grossman thinks it's a passing fad.",
        "What might have some staying power, says Grossman, is the cell phone novel.",
        "Written on cell phones and meant to be read on them, many of these books are best-sellers in Japan.",
        "The authors are usually young women, and romance is the main theme.",
        "They tend to be, narratively, very propulsive, not very interested in style and beautiful language.",
        "There tends to be, well, a lot of drama and melodrama, sex and violence.",
        "They grab your attention, and they don't really let it go.",
        "Apart from Twitter books and cell phone novels, Grossman, who is also a novelist, says the real challenge for writers is electronic-book readers like the Kindle.",
        "They're increasingly popular, and he says the way people read books on these electronic devices is really different.",
        "They scroll and scroll and scroll.",
        "You don't have this business of handling pages and turning them and sort of savoring them.",
        "And I think that lends itself to a certain kind of reading and a certain kind of writing, which is a very forward moving, very fast narrative writing.",
        "And likewise, you don't tend to linger on the language.",
        "When you're seeing a word on a screen or a sentence on the screen, you tend to go through it, you extract the data, and you move on.",
        "Grossman thinks that tendency not to linger on the language also affects the way people react to a book when they're deciding whether to buy it.",
        "You'll buy it based on an excerpt, and it will be incumbent on novelists to hook readers right away.",
        "You won't be allowed to do a kind of tone poem sort of overture.",
        "You're going to want to have blood on the wall by the end of the second paragraph.",
        "And I think that's something that writers will have to adapt to.",
        "And the challenge will be using, you know, this powerfully narrative form, this very pulpy kind of mode, to say important things.",
        "Grossman, Moody and Carr all believe that traditional books will still be around for a long time, and that some of the changes that may occur in writing will be more evolutionary than revolutionary.",
        "But it's hard to know, says Carr, whether traditional books and the people who read and write them will have much influence on the culture in the future."
