        "Canisters of low-level nuclear waste fell over and more than 50 items were damaged.",
        "NPR's David Kestenbaum is in Tokyo.",
        "And David, where is the power plant and how close was the plant to the fault line?",
        "It's about 150 miles north of Tokyo and puts it right on the Sea of Japan there.",
        "It was very close to the fault line, not right on top but pretty close.",
        "The, you know, earthquakes are always a risk in Japan.",
        "And the Tokyo Electric Power, the company that owns the plant, says when it was built, they did a survey looking for fault lines going down about 1,000 feet, but this quake was much deeper about 20 kilometers, around 12 miles.",
        "And the plant was designed for a 6.5 magnitude quake and this was significantly larger, it was measured at 6.8.",
        "Well, what kind of damage did the quake do to the plant?",
        "The most immediately visible thing was a smoke from a transformer building that caught on fire that took a while to put out.",
        "There were some 400 barrels that were toppled, some containing low-level nuclear waste and the lids came off some of those, the contents were described to us as bolts(ph) and abrading agents, things like that.",
        "There was some leakage of radioactive water into the Sea of Japan, but that sort of measured in liters.",
        "A spokesman said the radioactivity was very low.",
        "The person we talked to said he compared it to the radioactivity in some hot springs that people get in.",
        "You know, the thing you really want to happen when there is an earthquake is you want the reactor to shut down safely and that part did happen.",
        "Now, the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is described as the largest nuclear power plant in the world.",
        "How long is it going to be shut down and do we know what sort of impact that would have on power supplies in Japan?"

        "Basically, the local government has ordered shutdown until the safety checks are done and, as you mentioned, there's a list of over 50 things that are broken.",
        "You know, this is a - it is by capacity, the largest nuclear plant in the world, 8,000 megawatts, which is, you know, electricity for millions of households.",

        "We'll have to see how well that works.",
        "And what has local reaction been to all of this in Japan?",
        "There has been frustration because the information coming out seems to have been changing over the last few days.",
        "The numbers of barrels overturned have changed, the amount of radioactivity in the water, the company said they miscalculated that and they had to increase the number.",
        "The president of Tokyo Electric has apologized for this.",

        "Here's NPR's Eric Westervelt.",
        "It's a long-standing criticism of K-12 teachers - they too often teach to the middle, it's said, leaving struggling students feeling lost and more advanced students, bored.",
        "Often everyone gets the same books, the same material, same homework, same difficulty level.",
        "And overworked, underpaid, time-stressed teachers don't necessarily have the time to personalize every lesson and drill deep into what each child is struggling with.",
        "The ed-tech company Knewton, with a K, thinks it has finally created a technological solution.",
        "And we think of it as like a robot tutor in the sky that can semi-read your mind and figure out where your strengths and weaknesses are down to the percentile.",
        "That's Knewton founder and CEO Jose Ferreira.",
        "He believes his new free online tutoring platform, built on data-rich content in the cloud, will radically change how teachers personalize instruction through automation.",
        "We can take the combined data power of millions of students - all the people who are just like you - who ever had to learn a particular concept before that, you have to learn today - to find the best pieces of content proven most effective for people just like you and give that to you every single time you come."
