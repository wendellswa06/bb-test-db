        "The irresponsible rhetoric of our president who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color has made America a more dangerous environment than, frankly, I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.",
        "This administration...",
        "Barbara, what about you?",
        "And as the historian of the group, I was wondering if that tonal difference also struck you or is this something that tends to happen, we just don't notice it as much because stylistically they were so different?",
        "Is it that the party in power tends to make the case that, you know, things are pretty good and that the party that's not in power tends to make the case that things are terrible, and you have to change it?",
        "Well, that typically is a way to go about this.",
        "But I think what struck people so much, and I noticed a lot of the commentators were pointing out as well, that the Democrats were able to take this territory that was seated by the Republican convention - and maybe the Republican Party at this time if it is indeed being led by Donald Trump - and that is the patriotism and optimism element that the Democrats have not really able been able to hold onto since about 1960 when President Kennedy ran and in his speech talked about the new frontier in Los Angeles.",
        "So this kind of uplifting, upbeat view that might've seemed corny for sophisticated Democrats to take on and the fact that Ronald Reagan had so captured that element for the Republican Party meant that it was sort of hard for Democrats or maybe it just didn't feel second nature to them to take up that cause.",
        "But now everything - it's like a perfect storm has formed for them to take up that theme.",
        "And I thought they did a superb job at expanding on it in Philadelphia.",
        "Mary Kate, I know that people talked about Hillary Clinton's tone some, you know, particularly conservative commentators talked about her tone as they have in the past.",
        "They say, you know - they find her shrill, etc. I was just curious about his tone and his presentation.",
        "You know, the thing that, as a speechwriter, sort of speech writing 101 would be tell a lot of stories, make it a speech that no one else could possibly deliver because it is full of stories from your life and your view capturing your voice in time.",
        "And none of the Trump family speeches, I thought, necessarily did that.",
        "There weren't a lot of stories about Donald Trump.",
        "That was one of the problems with Melania's speech - a lot of platitudes, a lot of generalities.",
        "And, in his case, he didn't really talk about his journey and how he got to this place and he - and when he said I alone can fix it and things like that, that wasn't a policy solution.",
        "That wasn't details that people wanted to hear, which I think would have been very comforting to Republicans like me.",
        "And that's where I think he missed the opportunity to reassure people and grow the tent.",
        "We mentioned President Obama.",
        "So I did want to ask that this was a - an important moment for both Obama that many people - the speeches given by both the first lady and the president really struck a lot of people.",
        "And this was their last hurrah, if you will, on a big stage.",
        "I think it's fair to say.",
        "I mean - I wanted to ask all of you, what do you think their legacy is as orators?",
        "What do you think that - when we think back to the Obama era what - do you think that they had an impact?",
        "And I apologize for putting them both together, but we heard both of them this week, and you can talk about either or both.",
        "Mary Kate, I'm going to ask you.",
        "Let's do one each.",
        "The Michelle Obama, I thought, hit it out of the ballpark.",
        "I didn't agree with everything she said, but it was well-written, well-delivered, and it was the best speech I think she's ever given in her life.",
        "And sort of like Cal Ripken going out on top there, you know (laughter).",
        "I think she was terrific."

        "He sounds like no other president in American history.",
        "It's highly motivating to the people who are listening to him, and he's - that's his A-game.",
        "The flipside is for eight years now my pet peeve has been when he says in America that's not who we are.",
        "And to me, that means anybody who disagrees with him on a policy is somehow un-American.",
        "And that is very divisive to me in a very subtle way, and he's continued to do it all eight years.",
        "And I think that's - I'm glad to see that part ending.",
        "I thought his speech Thursday night was probably one of the best he's ever given, and it was his attempt to define his legacy.",
        "He'd probably deny that.",
        "But I think he did a good job with what he had to work with.",
        "Jeff, what do you think?",

        "He has this interesting combination where he is able to be a inspirer-in-chief, while also being an educator-in-chief.",
        "And I would actually disagree with Mary Kate a little bit because I think that he, more than most actually, has what I think is almost - I almost don't want to see him do it as much where he actually explains the other side's argument to you.",
        "And I think he does it relatively honestly before making his argument.",
        "So there is a little bit of that law professor, too.",
        "So I think if you're weaving together the strands of sort of the pulpit plus the law professor plus the, you know - plus being able to concede an argument to make an argument, you have this really unique rhetorical braid that he's mastered.",
        "And then I will just say about Michelle - her speech was masterful, and I think it will be a master class in how to deliver a speech in an arena.",

        "And so I think to Mary Kate's point about when he says that's not who we are in America, I think that that's what he's trying to say.",
        "He's trying to think in terms of a United States of America, and that's a theme throughout our history, that because we all come from someplace else except for those natives who are here, we have always tried to create an American creed that everyone can espouse and believe in.",
        "So I think he was attempting to do that 12 years ago.",
        "I think he has been attempting to do that throughout his presidency.",
        "But the fact that Donald Trump has come so far indicates that he's not always been successful, but in terms of looking at him over the history of the presidency, I think he will go down in presidential history with the great orators of John Kennedy, of Franklin Roosevelt, of Ronald Reagan and maybe there even some touches of Lincoln.",
