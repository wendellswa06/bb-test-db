        "Keep it moving in the right direction.",
        "Republicans argue the country could be enjoying a stronger recovery, were it not for business uncertainty over taxes and regulation.",

        "For years, it was the president, saddled with bad economic news, who was forced to argue things could be worse.",
        "Now, Mr. Obama can point to encouraging numbers, leaving the GOP with the challenge of making the case: things could be better.",
        "Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.",
        "Now that a special counsel has been named to lead the investigation into Russian meddling, what does that mean for the other probes happening already on Capitol Hill?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think it's worth noting there are five - at least you can count them on one hand - five House and Senate committees conducting their own inquiries on Capitol Hill.",
        "The investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller though is different because it is a criminal investigation.",
        "And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says the special counsel might actually limit what the House and Senate can do.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "I think the shot to the body is it's now considered a criminal investigation, and Congress's ability to conduct investigations of all things Russia has been severely limited probably in an appropriate fashion.",
        "OK.",
        "Susan Davis, NPR congressional correspondent, is in our studios this morning.",
        "Hi, Sue.",
        "Good morning, Rachel.",
        "All right, does the special counsel - this new investigation led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller - does that diminish the significance of the House and Senate investigations?",
        "It does give them a little less juice because Congress does tend to defer to the FBI when they're investigating the same subject matter.",
        "That said, the investigations in Congress are definitely going to continue, it just may affect the timing and who and when they get to hear from the same people.",
        "Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins is a member of the Senate intelligence committee and - which is one of the lead committees on this, and she put it well."

        "She said the Senate intelligence is focused on counterintelligence, and the special counsel is focused on criminal aspects.",

        "Is that right?",
        "It really did.",
        "And when I was there, what was really striking was visually it looked, at least to judge from all of the construction cranes that were dotting the skyline, it looked like a place that was still expanding.",
        "But then as you stopped to listen, you notice that there was almost no sound coming from those cranes.",
        "They were all stopped and all silent."

        "And then, of course, toward the end of the year, we all became familiar with Dubai World and its troubles.",
        "Well, and I gather there's something of a history to this, countries racing to build incredibly tall buildings and then having huge epic financial troubles.",
        "I guess one example you could point to would be the Empire State Building.",
        "And then we saw, of course, the Wall Street crash.",
        "Right.",
        "The race to build the tallest building in the world was always complicated symbolically.",
        "The effort always has to do more with symbolism, more with making a kind of mark and making a splash than really filling some kind of market need in whatever city or country you're talking about.",
        "And that's been true back to the days when the United States was producing the tallest buildings in the world.",
        "But it also raises a question of the degree to which architectural ambition has migrated out of the United States, out of cities like New York and to places in Asia and in the Middle East.",
        "Americans aren't trying to build the biggest buildings anymore.",
        "We're not even coming close.",
        "We don't have that kind of ambition.",

        "And that sort of ambition has left the United States and gone elsewhere.",
        "But part of what makes that ambition possible, I think it has to be said, is the kind of government, like the one in Dubai, like the one in China, where these kinds of projects can be done essentially by Fiat.",
