        "So it sounds like when you're saying, you know, we have these algorithms, but we don't know exactly what they are under the hood, there's this sense that they're inherently unbiased.",
        "But what you're saying is that there's all kinds of room for biases.",
        "O'NEIL: Yeah, for example, like, if you imagine, you know, an engineering firm that decided to build a new hiring process for engineers and they say, OK, it's based on historical data that we have on what engineers we've hired in the past and how they've done and whether they've been successful, then you might imagine that the algorithm would exclude women, for example.",
        "And the algorithm might do the right thing by excluding women if it's only told just to do what we have done historically.",
        "The problem is that when people trust things blindly and when they just apply them blindly, they don't think about cause and effect.",
        "They don't say, oh, I wonder why this algorithm is excluding women, which would go back to the question of, I wonder why women haven't been successful at our firm before?",

        "And the way they try to find these terrible teachers is through something called the growth model.",
        "And the growth model, mathematically speaking, is pretty weak and has had, like, lots of unintended consequences.",

        "I guess the point is that you might have some statistical information when you hear a score, but it's not accurate enough to actually decide on whether a given teacher, an individual teacher is doing a good job.",

        "It's widespread and it's an important decision that the scoring pertains to, so like a job or going to jail, something that's important to people.",
        "So it's high-impact.",
        "The second one is that the things that worry me the most are opaque.",
        "Either that means that the people who get the scores don't understand how they're computed or sometimes that means that they don't even know they're getting scored.",
        "Like if you're online, you don't even know you're scored but you are.",
        "And the third characteristic of things that I care about, which I call weapons of math destruction, the third characteristic is that they are actually destructive, that they actually can really screw up somebody's life.",
        "And most of the time, these algorithms are created with, like, good intentions in mind.",
        "But this destructiveness is typically undermines that good intention and actually creates a destructive feedback loop.",
