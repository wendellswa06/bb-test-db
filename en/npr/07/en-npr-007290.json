        "And the years, actually - or during a particular season, we can have either one of the As or two of the As, and in another year we only one of the Bs.",
        "So there is some unpredictability, and I would rather say that this year, we are just really lucky.",
        "I'm not sure whether the warm weather is really the reason for having a much more mellow season in terms of influenza.",
        "But you could argue that, well, if it's warm weather, people are outside, they're not huddled in places keeping warm and maybe not spreading it around.",
        "Would that be a valid argument?",
        "I think this is a very valid argument, and I'm sure that people will try to sort of get some data on that kind of observation.",
        "On the other hand, we had in the past years which were very, very mild, comparable to what we have right now.",
        "And do we have any reason why that was, or it's just how it happens sometimes?",
        "Unfortunately, we do not understand the precise mechanisms for that.",
        "So there is really a lot of luck involved, a lot of change, and it is really not predictable, unfortunately.",
        "And there's still a lot of winter left, isn't there now?",
        "We've got almost a month to go in wintertime."

        "And that sort of tries to calm down, a little bit, the fear many people have that this H5N1 virus is very dangerous for humans.",
        "And it is based on the fact that the WHO has statistics which suggest that out of 600 confirmed H5N1 patients, humans, 300 died.",
        "However, this definition by the WHO, World Health Organization, is a very rigorous one and basically only includes people who have been hospitalized.",
        "And then there are samples, blood samples, etcetera, have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta or to the English in London to the WHO center in London.",

        "Not sick enough to...",
        "Who are not sick enough to show up in the hospital.",

        "It's a somewhat unusual move, but it solves a Catch-22 the defense has said they're in.",
        "They say their advice to Holmes about whether to make an insanity plea could change, depending on if prosecutors seek the death penalty.",
        "But normally, prosecutors don't have to announce that decision until 90 days after the arraignment.",
        "So what the judge did today is allow the case to move forward, and the next step will be that death penalty announcement - and still give the defense a chance to give their client a full picture of what he faces.",
        "So the next step - a decision by the district attorney about whether or not to seek the death penalty.",
        "How will they come to terms with that?",
        "There's a hearing April 1st, where prosecutors have said that they will announce that.",

        "All of them were actually prosecuted in this district, and one of them has exhausted his last appeal and may soon face execution.",
        "So that's going to be getting a lot of coverage.",
        "And there's a push right now in the state legislature to repeal the death penalty.",
