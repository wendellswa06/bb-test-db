        "But you're saying that's not true.",
        "Yeah, I definitely have done a lot, but usually I'll get a big burst during March and - you know, the end of February and March just because it gets colder and people are getting sick, so it hasn't got in much this time.",
        "But in fall you usually get a lot.",
        "Our listener is very correct, saying that in the pharmacy, if very little Tamiflu - which is an anti-viral against influenza - is being sold, that there is most likely much less influenza in the population.",

        "And you always hear people complaining I don't want to take a shot because it makes me sick, there's a side effect.",

        "OK, so this is worse than mythology.",
        "So our influenza virus vaccines are not perfect, but certainly they cannot, they cannot make us sick.",
        "So clearly if you want to get sick, then don't take the vaccine.",
        "But the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, approved influenza virus vaccines in this country, absolutely safe, and there is no reason to believe that you can get the flu."
