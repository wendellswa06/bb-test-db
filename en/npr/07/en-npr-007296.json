        "There were walnuts in there, which is traditional in nutz bussel.",
        "It has egg whites.",
        "It didn't really have a specific sugar measure, which could make things difficult.",
        "But it did call for confectioners' sugar, which immediately threw up many red flags for me because in the old country, they just powdered the sugar.",
        "But that tends to clump.",
        "So in the United States, we add things that are anti-clumping agents, like cornstarch.",
        "And that addition can throw off a meringue's sugar-to-egg-white ratio - in this case resulting in flat, crunchy cookies that don't taste quite right.",
        "Gesine Bullock-Prado sent Jamie Lynn Stevenson her recipe for nutz bussel.",
        "It called for superfine sugar, and explains the pain that is meringue.",
        "You cannot whisk them in a plastic bowl.",
        "You have to have everything clean because any bit of oil, or any kind of fat, is going to deflate the egg whites.",
        "So this is just for a traditional meringue.",
        "But then you decide to add nuts.",
        "And what do nuts have?",
        "They have oil.",
        "So you are really, really playing with fire - delicious fire, but it's fire.",
        "The solution: Roast the nuts to dry them out.",
        "Then toss with just a little cornstarch to absorb the oil.",
        "Jamie gave it a shot.",
        "Her cookie kisses were tasty but flat.",
        "Gesine suspected the culprit was humidity.",

        "On average, what is the size of each donation so far?",
        "Do we know?",
        "What they've said is that the average donation is around $50-$60, which is pretty low.",
        "And it suggests that they've managed to tap into the world of people who are not rich or even necessarily affluent but can afford to write a small check or put a recurring charge on their credit card.",
        "And, really, if you can tap those people, they're really important in politics, Ailsa, because a rich person who gives the maximum check of $2,700 for the campaign can't give any more after that.",

        "Usually at this point in the modern era of campaigning, let's say, Romney or Obama or even Clinton in '08, if you can, you've already spent a few months or weeks making advance buys on television to lock on rates while they're low.",
        "You've hopefully had field staff out in the key swing states for months or more building relationships in their communities, getting ready to turn out the vote.",
        "It's not clear how much of that, if any, Trump has done.",
        "In fact, there are...",
        "Right.",
        "...Signs that he's basically outsourced it to the Republican National Committee, which has had its own program in place for a while to get ready for the nominee.",
        "So the big question to come back to again is what do they do with that $74 million cash on hand that they say they have?",
        "Well, a big piece of it will probably flow to the party to run those grassroots efforts.",
        "And you have to imagine we will finally see some Donald Trump campaign ads in force on the airwaves.",
        "And I guess the question is, is there enough time to drastically improve Trump's campaign infrastructure?",
        "Is there time?",
        "It's not really enough time for Trump to do it.",
        "What his campaign will tell you - and what I think is partly true - is that they have the Republican National Committee.",
        "After Obama won in 2012, the Republicans, you know, looked ahead to the future and thought, well, Hillary Clinton as a likely candidate for 2016, and if she runs, she'll probably get the nomination.",
        "What can we do?",
        "Well, the RNC had a good fundraising base, and they had seen what happened when they were outmatched and when they chose a nominee kind of late in the game and got started late.",
        "So around 2013, the RNC began doing some of this work on behalf of their future candidate.",
        "I think that in an ideal world, the nominee, Trump in this case, would be bringing more of his own lists and up-to-date data and technology and testing into the mix with the Republican National Committee."
