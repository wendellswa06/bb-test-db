        "A strange slogan for supporting a candidate who is 76 years old.",
        "But polls show that young republicans and independents are responsible for making Paul a top contender in Iowa.",
        "And in hopes of adding young democrats to that support base, the Paul campaign has been handing out pamphlets with instructions on how to register republican, if only just for Caucus Night.",

        "He noted the news from Nuevo Laredo grimly.",

        "In the president's second term, he could extend that rule to existing power plants - the biggest single source of greenhouse gases.",

        "That number is down from 2007.",
