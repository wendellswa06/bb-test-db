        "That's David Fleischer, professor of political science at the University of Brasilia.",
        "The economy here is stagnating, and he says there's also been 12 years of rule by the same party and people are tired and want change.",
        "But more recent polls show that Rousseff's negative campaign ads have been working.",
        "Her popularity has been steadily climbing, and her message that change can be as frightening as it is enticing is resonating.",

        "She heard echoes of the shooting of her brother, Darrell, by two police officers in Gary, Indiana, and questions that she's never been able to answer.",
        "Three decades later, Donna Britt still wonders what actually happened that day, how her beloved brother wound up dead in a ditch and how to reconcile her memory of Darrell with the police report of a man who attacked them with a pipe and a chain, wearing an aluminum pot on his head.",
        "Questions there, like questions in Florida, will always linger.",

        "Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.",
        "It's good to be here.",
        "And you write that one of the hardest things after your brother's killing was reconciling the brother you knew with the picture painted in the police report.",
        "There was no connection between them.",
        "It, you know, it - I don't know if it will ever make sense to me.",
        "My brother was my favorite growing up.",
        "He was my hero.",
        "He was smart and funny and popular and athletic.",
        "And he adored me, which, you know, what could be more wonderful for a young girl than to have such a wonderful guy think that she was great?",
        "So, suggested to me that I might be OK and maybe one day some other wonderful guy could love me.",
        "And so for someone so special and so irreplaceable to be described behaving like a crazy person, it was beyond the scope of my imagination.",
        "And an easy answer to come up with was that the report was fabricated and what the police officer saw that day was not a pipe and a chain and an aluminum pot but your brother's skin.",
        "I don't know - I wish it had been easy to come to any conclusion.",
        "I didn't know what to make of it.",
        "I had been raised to believe that police were people who cared about us and people who protected my community.",
        "And so I wasn't one of those people who grew with that kind of automatic suspicion.",
        "I didn't know very much then about fabricated evidence and about things that could happen.",
        "And so my struggle was to try to reconcile what they described with the man that I loved, and then to go to that place where what if this was made up and never to know what it meant, you know, and for some - and so it became so painful that I just sort of stepped away from it and tucked it into a corner of my mind where I didn't think about it much at all.",
        "Didn't think about much of it at all, yet it also provided a singular motivation to your life, your career."

        "Yeah.",
        "It had everything to do, I believe, with me becoming someone who wrote about the worth of all lives, not just black lives, but everybody's life and who wanted to sort of go beneath the surface of things because the surface, as I thought of it, had betrayed me.",
        "And so I wasn't that interested in living in that place or writing about that place.",
        "I was more interested in going below to the deeper stuff.",
        "The deeper stuff, the whispers, as you described them, from that ditch in Gary, Indiana.",

        "And I'm ashamed to say that, but I didn't want to find out more.",
        "And so I tried to think of things to separate me from that case because I have sons, and I have a husband, and I have people who could be similarly threatened for looking a certain way that has nothing to do with who they are as human beings and as essential people to my life and to my community's life, and to the larger community's life.",
        "And so I didn't want to be attached to this kid.",
        "And finally, when I realized what I was doing, and I read more about him and looked at his picture, and I just burst into tears.",
        "I felt bad that I had, in my own way, stepped away from his humanity because it was too painfully reminding of my brother's.",

        "If you are judging candidates and making your vote choices based on what you hear, you have got to be able to know who is saying the things that you hear or the things that you see.",
        "In other words, voters want to know who is trying to influence the election and toward which candidate.",
        "And, says Ornstein, writing big checks to groups running political ads is, by definition, trying to influence the election."
