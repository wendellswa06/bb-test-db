        "To strike the satellite, the Indian military used a kind of missile designed to intercept other missiles.",
        "Hitting a satellite is similar to striking an incoming warhead, so the test may actually be about missile defense.",
        "If that's the case, then it's also designed to send a message.",
        "Well, according to the record as I have been able to do it, it was a paperwork issue.",
        "You had to submit two pieces of paper.",
        "One is a formal request that you want to be a citizen, and the other is an oath of allegiance.",
        "He submitted them at different times.",

        "And it is, of course, the great general of the South, but one of the questions was: What was his true attitude towards slavery?",
        "And there's a famous letter that was cited to say, well, Robert E.",
        "Lee was more progressive than you might have thought.",
        "In the retelling of history afterwards, Lee, he called it a moral and political evil in any country in one letter, written in 1856, to his wife.",
        "But if you really pull out all the strands, you're going to find that Lee was a typical Southerner who really, I think, had a very complex approach, understanding of slavery.",
        "On the one hand, they could tell you to your face it's a terrible thing.",
        "On the other hand, they couldn't really think of any alternative.",
        "That is, it was the way of life, it was the way of law, therefore we just have to learn to live with it.",
        "There was always this, eventually the South will find a way out of this quagmire, but right now, we're in it, we need to make the best of it we can.",
        "That letter, though, I think expanded upon after the war and after Lee's death to provide justification for the argument that, oh, the war, it was about states' rights and our liberties and not about slavery.",
        "Well, and that certainly would have been the major dialogue you would have heard if you were talking to soldiers in 1861 and early 1862.",
        "But in a way, slavery is the foundation.",
        "It's way down there.",
        "It's the bedrock.",
        "Ultimately, the war ground its way down to that bedrock, and they had to admit that this was a driving factor.",
        "In fact, look at the ordinances of secession issued by the various states.",
        "You're going to find that slavery is in every one of them, saying this is why we're going to protect this institution."
