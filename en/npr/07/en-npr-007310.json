        "So give us a sense of what you tried - or did you just kind of resign yourself to being chronically sleepless?",
        "No.",

        "I was so tired; I had only gotten three hours of sleep.",
        "And I went out to cross the street on a red light and nearly got hit by a cab, and the cab driver shouted: Lady, what's your problem?",
        "And I really began to think, hmm, what is my problem, and what can I do to fix it?",
        "And I spoke to my internist and she said, look, you'd better go see a sleep doctor.",
        "So I started from that point on, and then went through the sleep study and all that entailed.",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting because it seems like the stakes are sort of ever raised.",

        "You know, the health effects of sleeplessness - in addition to the possibility of getting hit by a cab - seem to stack up on each other with every new study.",
        "So it's not just sort of feeling exhausted.",
        "It's actually dangerous.",
        "Yes, I mean, I think that point can be overstated a little.",
        "I think the fact that people may be overweight in this country has probably more to do with overeating at this point than it does real sleep deprivation.",
        "But certainly, you know, it's important to get not so much the seven to nine hours of sleep that seem to be recommended.",
        "I mean, it's important to get, to figure out what - how many hours you need and do that.",
        "I mean, the one thing that I found in doing all the research is sleep is very, very personal.",
        "There's really no one size that fits all.",
        "People are very individual sleepers, and what some people may need 10 hours.",
        "Some people may need six hours.",
        "You know, the key is finding out what's right for you.",
        "Well, it also gets at this idea that it's very hard to tease out cause and effect, that, you know, if sleeplessness is causing other health issues or maybe other health issues - is affecting your sleep, and maybe you're having a hard time sleeping because you're anxious, or maybe you're anxious because you're not sleeping - that sort of what is the root cause is kind of hard to pin down.",

        "So I think that is a lot of the reason why we see such intense focus on sleep issues now.",
        "And a lot of focus on medication as a solution.",

        "I mean, we spend something like $45 million a year on sleeping pills and by 2012, it's estimated the number will be close to 3.9 billion.",

        "No, they didn't.",
        "You know, sleeping pills can work for some people, and they tend to work a lot better in helping people fall asleep.",
        "But for sleep maintenance insomnia, which is what I have - which is, you know, you fall asleep right away and then wake up three or four hours later, and then you have this, you know, yawning hole in the middle of the night - it's very difficult for sleeping pills to keep people asleep throughout the night.",
        "Well, I did a lot of things.",
        "You know, at times it would absolutely drive me crazy, and I'd be roaming around the house, and then for a period of time I finally said, oh, let me just go with it.",
        "And, you know, I'd sort of stay in bed and analyze my dreams and, you know, think up book ideas.",
        "And I know cognitive behavioral therapists would tear out their hair at the thought of that.",
        "But what's interesting is that in some of the research that's come out, particularly Roger Ekirch's book, his history of the night, he talks about before the invention of electric light, people slept in segmented sleep.",
        "They would sleep for a few hours, they'd be up for several hours, and then they'd be - fall back asleep again.",
        "So in many respects, that sleep pattern is fairly natural.",
        "What would cognitive behavioral therapists say you should be doing instead, if you're wide awake in the middle of the night?"

        "Well, you know, I also did hypnotherapy, and we went through a whole thing where I was to imagine myself in the cocoon of sleep.",
        "The cocoon does work except that sometimes, I can sort of let my imagination go and - becomes like one of those cocoons in the alien movies.",

        "I remember as a very young child - 6, 7 years old - I learned the constellations because I would wake up about 2 or 2:30 in the morning, which I still do, even with a sleeping assistant, and I would lean out the bathroom window on my back, with my little star book, and study the stars.",
        "And it lasted for decades and decades and decades until I finally, you know, talked to somebody about it.",
