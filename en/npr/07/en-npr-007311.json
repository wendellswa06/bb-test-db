        "So you know, I think you sort of have to accept that.",

        "So that's how they got, you know, to the nine hours.",

        "So I had to back off it a little bit, and consequently, now I tend to get anywhere from two to five hours of sleep a night.",

        "So yeah, look, it's hard to sleep if you're in a lot of pain.",
        "Well, also it's a sort of self-diagnosed, slightly fuzzy syndrome that is hard to, in both cases, often hard to parse out the causes and effects, and hard to find the right treatment.",

        "Well, you know, up until 1972, when they discovered - a man, I believe in Australia, invented the CPAP machine, there was no the only thing that people could do for their sleep apnea was, you know, have a tracheostomy, which was cutting a hole in the throat.",
        "So, once they invented CPAP, that really helped put the whole field of sleep medicine on the map because up until that point, they really didn't have - it didn't have a disease to call its own.",
        "I mean, there was narcolepsy, but that was just affects too small a percentage of people.",
