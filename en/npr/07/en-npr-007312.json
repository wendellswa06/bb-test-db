        "And has that increased the - sort of attention and research dollars and treatment?",
        "Yes, it has, and it certainly has increased the number of sleep labs.",
        "I mean, you know, two decades ago, there was maybe only a couple, and now there are thousands of them because you can go in, you can diagnose it and you know, everybody can feel good to come away with, you know, either you can put in a dental bite plate or a CPAP or a BiPAP machine.",
        "So you know, they had all of these sleep clinics and, you know, they can be used for a purpose.",

        "And I'm curious to know if your guest tried any dietary changes, as these are usually very helpful.",
        "Eliminating irritating foods, which vary from one individual to another, some of which we consider healthy, is usually the key.",
        "Certainly in terms of eliminating caffeine, being very careful about alcohol.",
        "I've always been a very, very careful eater and a very clean eater.",
        "So that, I sensed, was probably not going to be an issue for me.",
        "But certainly, in terms of the caffeine intake, you know, I changed my habits there.",

        "How does your husband deal with you being a light sleeper?",
        "Oh, he's, you know - I'm beginning to think, the more stories I hear, that people marry people who are the opposite, maybe because you always need to have somebody on guard.",
        "But he's pretty good, and I can be really annoying - like, you know, elbowing him and announcing, hey, I'm awake, I'm awake.",
        "And that would drive me insane if he did that to me.",
        "But he's really good, and he just falls right back to sleep.",
        "He's just, you know, a really good sleeper.",
        "That's handy.",
        "It is.",
        "It is.",

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I just wanted to say thank you for having this conversation.",
        "I wanted to add that I've struggled with sleep myself since I was a kid, and it's mostly, I believe, from PTSD associated with violence and not feeling safe enough to go into a sleep, you know, place, and then being violated by dreams and nightmares.",
        "It's so vivid.",
        "So it's equal to the attack of physical attack.",
        "And for myself, what I find is that I -almost like a child, I will resist going to sleep until I'm so exhausted that I will skip the dream state and go straight to REM.",
        "That's my solution.",
        "So anyway, I don't know if that's considered insomnia, exactly, but it's a sleep issue that I struggle with since I was a kid, and still I have trouble explaining to others.",
        "You know, it's sort of a social stigma trying to relay this.",
        "And what she was saying about having somebody there is so much different, so much safer than being alone, you know, to be there in case you have a bad dream, or what have you.",

        "Patricia Morrisroe, do you think there are different - different people dream differently, that there are more vivid dreamers than others?",
        "Yes, I think there are, and I think the whole issue of post-traumatic stress disorder, we see, you know, with a lot of the soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "And it's a huge issue.",
        "And then for anybody who is having difficulties like that, you know, there are many more specialists who are dealing with that.",
        "And it can be, from my understanding, be helped so much by going and talking to somebody who specializes in it.",
        "Talking to the insomniacs you researched for your book, hearing from our callers today, do most people ultimately find something that works for them, do you think?",
        "I don't necessarily think that's true.",
        "Sadly, I think the key is to try to find a certain acceptance of it and realize, you know, you may not always have great sleep.",
        "But I think the biggest worry, and the biggest problem you can have, is that you fear one bad - you have one bad night and that next night is going to spiral into another into another into another, and then you're on this downward slide.",
        "And I think if you just recognize, OK, I've had a bad night, you know, it hasn't killed me and - but the next night, I'll be OK.",
        "I mean, so much of this is triggered by your anxiety.",
        "And as someone pointed out earlier, I mean, you can - you sort of make a decision about how you're going to sleep that day.",
        "I mean, if you're very, very hyper-aroused and anxious and tense during the day, there's a good chance you're going to have trouble sleeping that night.",
        "Well, also, you have to make a decision about how open you're going to be to treatments.",
        "I mean, when you described going to the 92nd Street Y and taking a meditation class and occasionally there were annoying and noisy people in the class, you know, you had to sort of decide that this was worth a shot."

        "You know, we're almost out of time.",
        "But she mentioned melatonin, which brings up the issue: Some of these drugs have been prescribed off-label for insomnia, that they were really originally meant for jet lag or depression or something else.",
        "Well, certainly drugs like trazodone, which is an antidepressant, has been prescribed.",
        "It's a very, very popular drug for insomnia.",
        "You know, melatonin, I think, is probably helpful for jet lag.",
