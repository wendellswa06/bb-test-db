        "Hey Juan, and last night here at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus it got kind of personal between Senator Clinton and Senator Obama and between Senator Clinton and Senator Edwards.",
        "At one point, she hit him with the ultimate Democratic put down.",
        "I don't mind taking hits on my record, on issues, but when somebody starts throwing mud, at least we can hope that it's both accurate and not right out of the Republican playbook.",
        "So Juan, I guess the question is, once things get a little testy, if you will, a little heated, how can you return to loving each other?",
        "Or at least a form of civility.",
        "Well, you know, heat is the right term there, I think, Madeleine, because at the recent Jefferson-Jackson dinner in Iowa, Senator Clinton said that she was going to turn up the heat.",
        "And last night, I think the way that she strategically handled it was to try to put her opponents on the defensive, to put them in a position of being desperate politicians who are really worried that she is moving away from the pack.",
        "I thought it was a much better performance for her, but the way that she did it was to begin calling them by name.",
        "I think you should have noticed that for the first time in a debate she's calling her opponents by name, and then she's making specific reference to policy proposals that they've made and the shortcomings, such as Obama on health care saying that he is leaving 15 million out by not calling for universal health care coverage in the United States.",
        "Juan, is there any sense, do you think, among the Republicans that it's good to see the Democrats going after each other or is it bad?",
        "Because the Democrats are getting a lot of attention here.",
        "Oh no, Alex.",
        "In fact I know as a fact that the Republicans are just delighted with it.",
        "And the whole idea, for example, that you have former President Bill Clinton out there saying, you know, they're ganging up on her - the boys are getting kind of tough - I'm using his language here - has lead the Republicans to make a point that, oh, Hillary Clinton is playing the gender card, as if she is somehow afraid of actually being challenged and using her femininity to try to defend herself.",
        "They see this as something that will play in the general election and they want to plant that seed in the American mind right now.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "How about the other story on the GOP side - it's got to be the continuing rise of Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee in Iowa.",
        "It is really a stunner.",
        "You know, in political circles this is so curious.",
        "This man was at - Huckabee was a two percent in one poll back in July.",
        "In that same poll now he's running second behind Mitt Romney with an 18 percentage point - is what the voters in caucuses say that they would give him.",
        "So only Romney at 27 percent is better than he is.",
        "And now he's attracting attention in a way that he had not before.",
        "Mike Huckabee, who doesn't have much money, has very little organization, is the subject of intense fire from Republicans, and specifically anti-tax Republicans, because he's moving up in Iowa."

        "He doesn't brush her off.",
        "He doesn't say we don't use those kind of words here, but goes ahead and gives a thoughtful reply.",
        "That got a lot of play on CNN and elsewhere.",
        "How bigger deal is it?",
        "It's all over the country, Madeleine.",
        "And I think it's the kind of thing, you know, that increasingly comes to define our politics.",
        "I think it was a surprise to people, and I think for a lot of people on the Republican side, they say, oh well, he didn't say it, he just went ahead with it.",
        "But for people on the Democratic side, I think it's - they're not happy about it, and they're saying if that's the kind of politics that's coming in the general election, especially if the candidate is Hillary Clinton, then people on the Democratic side shouldn't stand for it.",

        "And let me anticipate some questions from our audience.",
        "Some might argue that there are aspects of Islam and some cultural traditions, too, that seem incompatible with equality for women.",
        "I think that's probably true, that there are aspects, if you read the Christian Bible quite literally, that pose challenges for women, and that's absolutely true of the Quran.",
        "There are passages in the Quran that pose challenges for women's rights within Islam.",
        "But that doesn't mean that you can't still look at the text and contextualize them.",
        "What many of the men and women today are trying to do within Islam is argue that times change, and you have to read them differently.",
        "You have to think about them in the present, not only in the past, and find new meanings and new ways to circle that square.",
        "You describe this as, I think the word is ishtihad.",
        "Am I pronouncing that correctly?"

        "Yes, ishtihad, which is it's a legal process that has been within Islam for centuries, which is a process of intellectual reasoning -looking at the text and trying to work with the text to come up with answers to questions that are modern question that pertain to today and people's very real lives that they live.",
        "There is another school of thought, however, that what's needed to be interpreted in the Quran has been interpreted, and this is all settled by now.",
        "Indeed it is, and the book talks about the tension between these two schools, these two approaches, in effect.",
        "And you have very conservative, very narrow, traditionalist readings that prescribe a very narrow role for women in society, and you have much more progressive, open interpretations.",
        "And the book is looking at how those two different schools are interacting in today's modern world and duking it out, in effect, in countries across the Middle East.",
        "We want to focus, because we have a guest here who's very familiar with this work in Afghanistan, on that country, which is of course central to U.S.",

        "Well, that is absolutely true.",
        "You've got a very conservative, very narrow, traditionalist perspective in Afghanistan, that prescribes the very harsh treatment of women.",
        "I mean, the Taliban is really the worst of the worst when it comes to women.",
        "But you also have very open and modern and progressive thinkers in Afghanistan today, and unfortunately, both of these sides are really vying for position and control in that country, and women are very much on the front lines of the war that is taking place across these two sides.",
