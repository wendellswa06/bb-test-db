        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, it's a very good point that Jamil is making.",
        "But the problem is that in so many countries around the world, tradition, culture and religion are conflated.",
        "And so you saw, for example in Afghanistan, there are deep cultural traditions, but the Taliban used Islamic arguments to justify those cultural traditions.",
        "And it's much harder to change religion than it is to change culture.",
        "When you're doing something that's seen against religion, it's just very difficult to change it.",
        "It sort of stops people dead in their tracks.",
        "And so that is why women today are using Islamic arguments to fight back on those traditional and cultural aspects of society.",
        "Jamil, thanks very much for the phone call.",

        "And the man presented her this bouquet of roses, and she put her hands to her face, and it was quite a poignant scene.",

        "The one of the drivers, I think, of Islamic feminism today is the fact that more and more women are reading the texts for themselves.",
        "And as the previous caller just said that when she was little, growing up, she had to read it in Arabic.",
        "It was incomprehensible to her.",
        "But today, you now have women who are reading the texts, reading the Quran themselves in study groups, with friends, even at their mosque with their local mullah in their local language, really engaging with the text, trying to understand it better and trying to understand what it really says and what it really means.",
        "And there's much that is progressive and is accommodating for women in the Quran.",
        "There are parts of it that are not and that people are struggling with, but there is much that people can take away from the Quran that allows for a much more empowered role for women in society.",

        "Absolutely, yes.",
        "When I went there in the refugee camp, and I saw that all these (unintelligible) refugee are in the camp in Peshawar, Pakistan, in different refugee camp, and most of them, as I said about 60 percent of them are women, some of them, about maybe 40 percent of them are widow without a husband with the children sitting there.",
