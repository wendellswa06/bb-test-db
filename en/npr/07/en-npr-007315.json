        "So it was devastating to me, and that was one thing that really I decided at the time that how we can - we change their lives?",
        "And the only way that we could do it, through education.",
        "And if you want to implement education at the time, it was a time that even the majority were against education.",
        "So what happened?",
        "We went to a mullah, and we really said that this is the best way, through the community and through the leader, which is in the time - the mask - the mullah is the leader of that community.",
        "So I went through with my group.",
        "We went there, and for months, we trained this mullah to be a teacher and how to teach.",

        "How a mullah could teach?",
        "But you know what?",
        "When you have a plan, a very organized program, which means teacher training new methodology students in that technique and teaching critical thinking.",
        "And when you train somebody like that, it's -everybody get involve.",
        "The mullah got involved, the family got involved, everybody want to teach.",
        "And as a matter of fact, in a matter of three months, from, like one-tenth, we get to see one-tenth and we have 300 students in one compound.",
        "And after that, we have, like, in a matter of one year, we have 25,000 students in different school.",
        "And that was the way it went.",
        "And it's picked up from there.",
        "And since then, we have trained 18,000 teachers.",
        "And as Isobel said, we are not just telling them to read Quran.",
        "We teach them how to read Quran then interpretation and to understand that.",
        "And what does Quran says?",
        "Quran is all about right, about democracy, about justice, about equality, about advancement.",
        "That is the way that Quran teaches us if we really understand that.",
        "If we don't understand and we read in Arabic, we will not be accomplishing anything and we just, like, follow whatever they said to us.",
        "And when they want to abuse us and submissive women in Afghanistan, the way that they abuse them so they listen in whatever they say, they listen to them and that was the way it went.",
        "And now, you can communicate with the women, as Isobel said, looking like a woman like Habiba Surabi.",

        "Of course, maybe people will argue with me that still people have problem.",
        "Yes, we do have problem because it's not easy task and it takes time.",
        "It takes time the way that we took 30 years off this war to people who are devastated.",
        "It takes us a longer time to reimprove our life.",
        "But sure enough, by having a guidance like Quran and using Quran as our guidance, and we will have much, much better life and we will be much happier because we also - we practice our religion and tradition, and we also educate ourselves.",
