        "And what I woke up to this morning, quite frankly, was a sunny day, and there wasn't any overnight issues other than the fact that we did, in fact, capture a couple of more high-value targets in and around Mosul and one in Diyala province, which was very good, from a couple of raids that we did last night.",

        "What we have seen is not as much of a decline in the north as has occurred in the rest of Iraq.",
        "While the rest of Iraq was seeing decline significantly, and especially in Anbar province and in Baghdad, there have been some of the terrorists that we've tracked, some of al-Qaida and some other extremists that have moved into the northern areas, especially around Mosul, the Rabiya crossing and even some into Diyala province, which did not have many troops there.",
        "But even with that, over the last six months, the number of attacks in our provinces have dropped about 50 percent.",
        "Over the last month or so, they have somewhat evened out, so there hasn't been the continued decline in violence.",
        "Do you, though, have enough troops if this is an ongoing issue of insurgents being pushed out of one place and pushed into another and, at this moment in time, they're tending to be pushed into your area up there in the north?",

        "troops.",
        "What we continue to build in capacity are the Iraqi security forces.",

        "Again, the area that I'm responsible for is about the size of the state of Pennsylvania.",
        "So we need to continue to build capacity in the Iraqi army divisions.",
        "But also most importantly in the north, we need to build capacity in the Iraqi police forces.",
        "We think we're missing about - oh, somewhere about 30,000 police officers up here in the north and we are going to begin to train those additional police forces starting in the month of April.",
        "Parallel to trying to get the security forces there, you know, up and running and efficient and effective, you're also trying to help local officials where you all get resources from the national government in Baghdad.",

        "In the past, governors went to Baghdad, met with the ministers, had their ceremonial tea, which is part of the culture, presented their problems and then left and went back to their provinces, at that point hoping that the ministers would help them solve their problems.",
        "Well, the central government has so many challenges right now, that sometimes as soon as the governors left their offices, their problems were forgotten.",
        "What we attempted to do recently, and it seems to be working, and it seems to be generating a lot of interest, is we brought our seven governors together in the north, the governors from the southern provinces, to Tikrit, and we help the ministers, under deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih, come up here.",
        "And we had an all-day event with them where some key concerns were aired between the provincial governors and the central ministries.",
        "We're beginning to see some results where the ministers now understand what's going on in the outlying provinces and aren't just focused on the capital city of Baghdad.",
        "And some of the concerns that they heard about there?",
        "Well, it's just primarily getting infrastructure back up and operational, the processing of the budget, the way oil and gas and kerosene is distributed, security means, the generation of more police as I talked about earlier, things like sewer systems, cleaner water, even things like the distribution of fertilizer and products that will help crops grow better.",
        "These are just some of the hundreds of things that we worked with, ministers, like the minister of finance, minister of construction and housing, the minister of agriculture.",
        "So it was an event to try and bring the ministers to talk to the governors.",

        "Under Saddam, the central government was viewed as successful if they saved their budget.",
        "Now in a society where they're trying to equally distribute things, they have to break that mindset of, hey, we've got to get rid of the money and actually help the provinces and understand what the people's needs are."
