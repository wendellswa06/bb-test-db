        "So this is not a typical voting lawsuit that you might see that focuses on just one aspect of a state's election law like its decision to purge voters or the state of its voter registration database.",
        "This, instead, argues that the sum is greater than each part, that if you think of each one of these as an obstacle, it's as though Georgia has set up an obstacle course that the voters have to overcome if they want to be able to cast a ballot."

        "Right.",
        "So the lawsuit makes a number of different claims.",
        "What's most interesting is that some of the claims argue that there was intentional racial discrimination in voting.",
        "And the reason that's so important is that if that could be proven, it would give the court that finds intentional discrimination the potential to put Georgia back under federal supervision for its voting laws for up to 10 years.",

        "Well, it's possible that Georgia might choose to take other actions that might make it harder to register and vote, and then those would, I presume, be added to the lawsuit.",
        "I do think, though, that under existing law, many of the claims that Abrams is making face an uphill battle.",
        "We've seen the Supreme Court, for example, in recent years make it harder to bring lawsuits claiming that efforts to make it harder for people to vote violate the Voting Rights Act.",
        "And so it is not clear to me that this is going to be a legal winner of a lawsuit, but it could be a political winner, even if it's not a legal winner, because it reminds voters what is at stake.",
        "And what we've seen in Georgia, in North Dakota and in other states is that when states make it harder for people to register and vote, there's sometimes a backlash there where extra efforts are put in, more money is put in, more effort is put in, to make sure that all of those barriers are overcome.",
        "That doesn't justify these laws.",
        "There's no reason to put barriers in front of voters unless they're serving an important purpose.",

        "Well, I do think that as these lawsuits go forward, you have both voting rights advocates and states looking at how the lawsuits are being run.",
        "And if the lawsuit is successful, that would be a warning to other states not to try to emulate Georgia.",
        "And, of course, if it's unsuccessful and if there's no political backlash, maybe that serves as more of a green light.",
        "But I do think that voting rights is likely given what we've seen in 2018 to be a major issue as we head into the 2020 elections.",
