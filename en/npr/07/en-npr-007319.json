        "By the way, we mentioned that clue, 30 across, as it was in this puzzle, Caruso show.",
        "That was the C level clue, just to give you again an idea of the different levels of competition here.",
        "30 across in the C or the easiest level was TV series set in the 15th Precinct.",
        "And in the B level clue, it was ABC debut of September 1993.",

        "I would like to do crossword puzzles, but it just - I don't even get halfway through them usually because of the clues.",
        ": Yeah.",

        "But Mike Shenk, any observations?",

        "The Journal only has the crossword on Fridays.",
        "It's only one day a week crossword.",
        "And it's the same size as the Sunday puzzle in the Times.",

        "No.",

        "The clue for 51-across was effusive, colloquially.",
        "And the problem was a lot of people went to 52-down and said difficulty in walking and had a limp, and ended up with 51- across being alush, which I'm not sure is a word, but if you think about effusive colloquially, might fit, and it turns out, of course, it was not limp, but gimp, going down, and agush.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That - agush is not a particularly good word to start with.",
        "So it's not surprising people didn't jump on that.",

        "He's maybe in the top 50 to 100 Scrabble players in the world.",
