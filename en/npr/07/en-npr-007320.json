        "Are doctors trying to treat diabetes two by going to the core issue of obesity, or is the treatment more about treating the disease once it's developed?",

        "This is so true.",
        "When you look in lower social economic class communities, what you find is that there are few grocery stores that stock healthy, fresh fruits and vegetables; and it's much easier to go the local fast food store and buy high fat food.",

        "Now, we've noted earlier that diabetes can be completely debilitating for some people, loss of eye, loss of limbs.",
        "How does it get to that point?",
        "Well, one of the problems is that a third of the people with diabetes don't actually know that they have it.",
        "And they may not make that discovery until they've already had some irreversible damage done to their bodies.",
        "The other problem is that many of the people who know that they have diabetes are not as informed as they should be about these potential risks, and how to prevent themselves from getting these complications from the disease."
