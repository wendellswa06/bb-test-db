        "The spring of 1942 was given over to a very impassioned, strategic debate about where we should first attack in counterpunching against the Germans and Italians.",
        "The British argued very persuasively on the part of Winston Churchill, prime minister, that this was a very green American Army, green soldiers, green commanders.",
        "It was building itself from 190,000 in the late '30s to 8.5 million, ultimately.",
        "And Franklin Roosevelt listened to Churchill over the protests and the advice of his senior military commanders, including George Marshall, the chief of staff, Dwight Eisenhower, who was just becoming a large figure then, and agreed that they would - that we, collectively, the Anglo-Americans, would attack on the periphery.",
