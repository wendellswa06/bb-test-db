        "Chris Thornberg is a forecaster with Beacon Economics.",
        "He says there are just too many question marks: how bad the housing crunch will be, what the broader economy will do, and which banks are still heavily exposed to bad loans.",
        "He says the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, actually has a list of troubled banks that it's keeping an eye on.",
        "There are more than 90 banks on the list right now, but it turns out it's a secret list.",
        "The problem here is this: Here is a situation in which information is both an enemy and a friend.",
        "The FDIC recognizes that if they point at a bank and say, well, maybe them, they can create a full-fledged panic and bring down even healthy institutions.",
        "But not knowing which banks are most in trouble is also helping to create this panic across the whole industry.",
        "At one point today, the stock of the Ohio-based bank National City was down more than 75 percent on the year.",
        "Washington Mutual and Wachovia have also been falling sharply, but some analysts think investors are getting too scared.",
        "My sense of it is that it's not a system-wide problem.",
        "Brian Bethune is an economist with Global Insight.",
        "He says more banks will fail over the next couple of years, but he thinks most banks are on much more solid footing than, say, IndyMac Bank, which just went bust a few days ago.",
        "Well, IndyMac was a specialized mortgage lender and therefore had a lot of concentration in the mortgage market.",
        "Large regional banks, they're not anywhere near as exposed.",
        "Regulators are trying to calm fears.",
        "They say most banks will be fine, and most people are covered by FDIC insurance.",

        "The critics were concerned about reports suggesting the drug was potentially bad for the heart.",
