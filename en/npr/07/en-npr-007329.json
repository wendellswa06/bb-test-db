        "When was the last time you changed your investment strategy?",
        "With my portfolio what I do is I have written targets for how much I'm going to have in large stocks, how much I'm going to have in small stocks, how much I'm going to have in bonds, and then once a year, I sit down, I calculate where I stand and then I revamp my portfolio to get it back in line with those target percentages.",
        "And what this does is two things: First, it keeps my portfolio's risk level under control.",
        "For instance, after a year like 2004 where stocks did pretty well, I was selling stocks at the end of the year because I'd became overinvested in stocks.",
        "But the other thing it does is it can boost your portfolio's long-run return and the reason is this: If you're continually rebalancing within your stock portfolio, say, you know, lightening up on foreign stocks when they do really well, adding to small stocks when they do poorly, you're essentially forced to buy low and sell high.",
        "And as anybody who's ever invested in the stock market knows, that's a great way to make money.",

        "But, you know, I've been doing this long enough to know my guess is no better than anybody else's, and so instead of playing my hunches, it makes a lot more sense to have these target portfolio percentages and rebalance back to them.",
        "That way, even when I'm thinking that hey, you know, stocks had a nice run, you know, maybe this is where I should have my money, I'm forced to go in the opposite direction."
