        "They postponed that vote for a week.",

        "And I would train them in the same ways that we train the Marines.",
        "And we'd break them down into small groups and Marines would take individual teams of Iraqis under their wing and run them through scenarios, run them through buildings.",
        "We didn't have elaborate training facilities, but we found old abandoned buildings or incomplete buildings that we could use as good training areas.",
        "But it's difficult.",
        "I mean, we could be teaching the Iraqis a class in the morning, and suddenly there'd be a call on the radio and they'd have to cut it short and run out into the city, and essentially do what we were just teaching them.",
