        "I don't know how that could possibly have happened, because, you know, 120 guys walking through the desert.",
        "I don't know how anybody doesn't see them, but, they were just gone.",
        "But the people who remained were solid.",
        "And when we started training the Iraqis, we put them through a scaled-down version of Marine Corps recruit training, which ended with a version of the Marine culmination training called the Crucible.",
        "A two-day event in the desert, it was 140 degrees.",
        "But that cadre took to calling themselves al-Insaderine(ph), which means, the ones who've been through the Crucible.",

        "Well, what is this guy, you know, whose side is he on?",
        "Even though I had been with these guys for eleven months, at this point, and I'd slept with them; I ate with them, you know; I suffered with them, all that kind of stuff.",
        "But the Iraqis, especially as I got closer to leaving, were extremely concerned that there would be another attempt, and so they insisted that I sleep with their leadership cadre.",
        "And they had guards on me 24 hours a day.",
        "But then I kept thinking, well what if one of these guards, you know, gets compromised, or something like that.",
        "So...",
        "Do you think it's likely that even after that plot was exposed there probably was at least one more insurgent or insurgent sympathizer in the ranks, passing information around about your unit or doing other things?",

        "Well, one of the challenges we faced in simply recruiting good soldiers was that we really wanted to recruit them on merit.",
        "Because we would have soldiers in the battalion who were weak or incompetent, and we wanted to weed them out.",
        "But the Iraqis always wanted to recruit people that they knew, because they were so concerned about loyalty - and often with good reason.",
        "But we weren't as keyed in to all the tribal relations and family relations that defined loyalty for the Iraqis.",
        "You're saying that what looks like nepotism to you might have looked like survival to them?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
