        "It is a terrible place now.",
        "It's very dangerous.",

        "I mean, when you spoke to me last time, you see, on that very day, there was a huge explosion somewhere near the university and young people and students were hurt.",
        "But a few minutes after my arrival at my place, you see, which is usually around 9:00, 9:30, you see, there was a young fellow, a taxi driver who was involved in that accident and he came with his right eye almost cut in the middle, you see.",
        "And very fortunately he came this morning with a very, very reasonably looking eye and a functioning eye.",
        "And as far as I'm doing work here, it's becoming very necessary, you see.",
        "There is no more health services here in this country, especially in my own specialty.",

        "Hoping.",
        "Hoping and I don't very usually pray, you see, but I'm praying tonight.",
        "I am probably going to church tomorrow for a change, you see.",
        "I will be praying for the country as a whole and also to some extent for the miracle we are hoping and waiting for in the case of my son.",
        "Well, we wish you a Merry Christmas.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The same to you and the same to all my friends in there.",
        "I would like you to, on my behalf, wish them all my best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a very happy and prosperous new year.",

        "When he went into surgery, the surgeon told him that he would do everything he could to save his left arm.",

        "And so we - I waited at his bedside and I was standing on his right side and holding his hand when they were bringing him out of sedation and waking him up and his surgeon told him that he was so sorry that he wasn't able to save his left arm.",
        "The soldier was very, very brave and he squeezed my hand with his right hand - I thought he was going to break my fingers, he was squeezing so hard.",
        "And once the surgeon walked away, he turns to me and he said, Ma'am, would you hug me?",
        "And so I gathered him up good and he cried.",
        "Father Louis Iasiello recently retired as chief of Navy chaplains.",
        "He's now head of Washington's Theological Union.",
        "I spoke with him about the ethical dilemmas of war, especially for troops facing an elusive and changing enemy.",
        "I was in uniform for over two decades, and for me, I was always amazed at the level of ethical behavior and also the ethical awareness of our men and women in uniform.",
        "They're not only very moral people but they're people who are truly concerned in a political and an ethical way about the events of the world.",
        "So obviously for them a discussion of whether or not actions are just would be part of their daily lives.",
        "How have the ethical questions changed over time in this war?",
        "Last year I was invited to the Naval War College.",
        "I was invited to speak on any issue I wanted to, and I said, well, why don't you sort of poll the students and find out what they'd like me to speak about.",
        "Their question to me was, how do you fight an enemy who either ignores or exploits the rule of war?",
        "And my answer to them in my lecture was what you do with an enemy like that is you don't ask yourself what should I do?",
        "You ask yourself who am I?",
        "And we're Americans.",
        "We're supposed to be representing the United States.",
        "We're supposed to be representing those constitutional values which we hold so dearly that we'd even die for them.",
        "And so for us to do anything less than remain ethical and moral in the prosecution of a war is something that Americans should not do.",
        "You know that and I know that, and that's the way we have to proceed, even with an enemy that ignores or exploits the rule of war, and even if that means putting our own life or limb at jeopardy.",

        "Saint Augustine wrote a great deal about going to war.",

        "Well, of course for me \"\"The City of God\"\" is not only a classic of literature, it's pure genius.",
        "And I say that because Augustine talks about the dialogue that a Christian must have as a citizen in an empire or in a state.",

        "And of course Augustine's great fear was that people could lose their humanity in a time of war.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think Augustine, although he lived almost 1500 years ago, Augustine would have made a terrific military chaplain, because he understood that sending someone into the most inhuman of all situations, a situation where you're pitting human against human, that was his major fear.",
        "In his letter to Faustus the Manichaeum, he talks about the evils of war, and for him the evils of war really sort of zeroed in on what you just said, Jacki, that a person would lose their humanity, and for him that would be the ultimate evil.",

        "The Intel chip.",
        "For years, it's been trapped inside PCs, inside dull little boxes, dutifully performing dull little tasks.",
        "In this commercial, the life of the chip will be spruced up inside Apple computers.",
        "The new desktop iMacs will begin at $1,299; the new laptop, called a Macbook Pro, starts at 1,999.",
        "According to Jobs, the notebook is four to five times faster than the previous one; the desktop is two to three times quicker.",
        "The new hardware announcements came on the heels of good news for Apple.",
        "Strong demand for iPods fueled a 63-percent growth in the company's revenue during the holiday season.",

        "Well, Debbie, I think that for the average reader, people who aren't really involved in politics, the indictment may have been the first thing to get their attention.",
        "Before that, I think people sort of thought it was a little bit confusing, it was hard to sort out who was telling the truth.",
        "It was sort of like the Swift Boat controversy during the election.",
        "You know, it took a while, I think, for things to sort of settle home.",
        "With the indictment, though, I think that people are finally starting to pay attention.",
        "Keven Willey in Dallas, Harriet Miers' home town I should say, has the withdrawal of her nomination been a shock there?",
        "I think it has been.",
        "As you might imagine, north Texans have closer knowledge of Harriet Miers and at least much of the establishment folks who have worked with her over the years or rubbed shoulders with her pretty unanimously recommended, you know, her in terms of her legal skills and that sort of thing.",
        "So I think that at least among the establishment the sense is that unfortunately she was never allowed to define herself.",
        "All the actions swirling around her and the comments about her by other people, many of whom did not know her at all, served to define her.",
        "I think one of the ironies in this situation is that most people who know Harriet Miers doubt very much that she sought this position in the first place.",
        "In fact, most kind of assume that the president had to personally persuade her to step into the spotlight since that's not been her practice in the past, and here if she was reticent to do it was persuaded to do it and then essentially forced out.",
        "You know, that's kind of an irony in an unfortunate circle of events.",
        "Patsy Brumfield in Tupelo, President Bush has enjoyed strong support there in Mississippi, but this has not been a good week at all for him.",
        "Are your readers starting to question now how the president is running the country?",
        "We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.",
        "It's no joke.",
        "He's shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it."
