        "Yes, we were talking to Republicans yesterday and they're a little depressed here in Iowa about all the trouble that the Bush administration's had.",
        "But one lady remarked that, `If they just take care of the mistakes and move on rather than prolonging things with arrogance or denial,' you know.",
        "People are, you know, looking ahead now to the 2006 election cycle.",
        "And in Iowa, we've already started the 2008 election cycle with the caucuses, and so I think what Republicans here are looking at is the need for this president to acknowledge what was wrong, find the people who were causing the problem, get them out of there and move on.",
        "What are any of you hearing from rank-in-file Democrats?",
        "Debbie, it's Patsy in Tupelo.",
        "I think the rank-in-file Democrats wonder where their people are.",
        "I mean, there is a conspicuous absence of effective speakers on behalf of the Democratic Party.",
        "I realize there are some speakers, but I don't think they're very credible with people down here and they start to look like a bunch of whiners without any good ideas.",
        "Now once somebody can ever come up with an agenda, I think they get traction, but until then, they're just floundering around in the soup of politics at this point.",
        "This is Kathie in Des Moines.",
        "Democrats here in some ways feel like if they don't do anything at all that the Bush administration is just going to implode all by itself, but, I mean, I think when we get to the other side of the dust storm, there's those who are arguing that there needs to be leadership to step up, and offer alternatives is not going to be enough to just let the Bush team fumble.",
        "Somebody has to be there to recover.",
        "We've been speaking with editors Kathie Obradovich of The Des Moines Register, Keven Ann Willey of The Dallas Morning News and Patsy Brumfield of the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal.",
        "Thank you all.",

        "My pleasure, Debbie.",

        "So this is the most direct that Joe Biden has been about calling for impeachment of President Trump.",
        "In the past, he had been conditional at one point, saying that he - that if Trump didn't cooperate with Congress, they would leave him no choice.",
        "He had just been saying that he supported the inquiry.",
        "Now - while other candidates had been more direct.",
        "Now, in recent days, as I'm sure you know, more has added up.",
        "Trump called on China to investigate Biden.",
        "Now the White House is refusing to cooperate with the investigation by House Democrats.",
        "And former Vice President Biden really struck a very somber tone today, really trying to stress the gravity of what he sees as a threat to democracy.",

        "With his words and his actions, President Trump has indicted himself.",
        "By obstructing justice, refusing to comply with a congressional inquiry, he's already convicted himself.",
        "In full view of the world and the American people, Donald Trump has violated his oath of office, betrayed this nation and committed impeachable acts.",
        "Now, we should add that right after the speech, Trump responded immediately with a tweet.",
        "It said, so pathetic to see sleepy Joe Biden who, with his son, Hunter, and to the detriment of the American taxpayer, has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment.",
        "And I did nothing wrong.",
        "Joe's failing campaign gave him no other choice.",

        "And to that point, did Biden address the allegations Trump is making against him and his son?",
        "Yes.",
        "So Joe Biden said pretty much what you just said.",
        "He said these are lies.",
        "He sort of - he didn't get into specifics.",
        "He just said that the president was saying falsehoods.",
        "But what's interesting is that Joe Biden also turned this around and folded it into an existing argument he is making.",
        "Joe Biden has been saying for a long time on the campaign trail that Donald Trump is scared of him and that that's why Donald Trump attacks him.",
        "So Biden made this about electability.",
        "He said Donald Trump is lying about me and is attacking me because he's afraid to face me.",
        "You've also been talking to voters.",
        "What are you hearing from them about all this?",
        "You know, as far as impeachment, the voters here, they care about it.",
        "A lot of these voters want to see Trump impeached.",
        "But it doesn't really weigh on how they feel about the campaign, from what I gather.",
        "Now, as far as Hunter Biden's business dealings overseas, again, there are a lot of voters here who don't - who really didn't bring it up and, when I asked them about it, didn't seem to care.",
        "I will say that the most serious misgivings about Hunter Biden's business dealings that I heard were from a very solid Biden supporter.",
        "Her name is Pam Dupee (ph).",
        "And she said, you know, Hunter Biden doing business overseas while his father was responsible for U.S.",
        "policies in countries like Ukraine, she said it's bad judgment, but it's not really a big deal.",
        "It annoys me that he was even - his son was even - had anything to do with that.",
        "I mean, I think that was a stupid move.",
        "But I don't think of anything illegal or anything nefarious or - I just think kind of a lack of judgment maybe.",
        "But again, you hear from a lot of these voters, no matter what, they think Trump is worse than - that Trump is just the worst choice, no matter whom Democrats nominate."

        "Two filmmakers, Hassan Fazili and Fatima Hussaini, made a film that answers those questions, and it's personal.",
        "Fazili and Hussaini were filmmakers in Afghanistan until they were threatened by the Taliban.",
        "They decided to escape to Tajikistan with their two young daughters.",

        "Their new film, \"\"Midnight Traveler,\"\" documents every step of that journey from Afghanistan to Hungary - discrimination, death threats and confusing immigration systems, as well as the love and faith that kept them going.",

        "We asked her to tell us more about the film, and I started by asking how she met the family.",
        "I wrote my dissertation on Tajikistan and made a film in Tajikistan before this, so I had this rather specific community of filmmakers that I was tapped into.",
        "And I met them through that community.",
        "And I was helping with writing letters to try to support them in receiving protection without traveling on this migrant route.",
        "And then it became clear they weren't going to receive protection, and I agreed to help producing what would turn out to be this film documenting their experience as migrants.",
        "I understand that the technique of it is not the most important thing about it.",
        "But it is still remarkable that in the midst of all of this, they were able to film what they were going through and get the film out.",
