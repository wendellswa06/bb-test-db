        "All of this will go into the confirmation cauldron that began boiling today.",
        "The Senate Republican leadership had begged the president not to appoint someone so soon since it will be next to impossible to have a confirmation vote before January, and even confirmation hearings will be a stretch before the new year.",
        "But the White House needed to change the subject, to move the public's attention away from the indictment of Vice President Cheney's top aide and the continuing investigation of the president's top political aide, Karl Rove, not to mention the Miers debacle.",
        "So after weeks of being besieged by his own base over the Miers nomination, the president is back in the more comfortable stance of fighting Democrats.",
        "As Gary Bauer, president of a conservative think tank called American Values, put it...",
        "If there is a lesson in all of this that the president would have internalized, it is that on anything that matters in Washington, there is usually a fight.",
        "And if you're going to be in a fight, it's much better to be fighting with your political opponents than it is to be punching somebody in your family in the nose.",
        "Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.",
        "Yeah, so there's two things there.",
        "The first is, a lot of people wonder, well, you know, you're fleeing for your life.",
        "How do you have time to make a film?",
        "And the reality, unfortunately, is that fleeing for your life involves a lot of being stuck in camps and waiting.",
        "And for people who are used to working, working hard, having normal lives, being asked to sit somewhere for 12 months with nothing to do in a small room in really cramped quarters with other families close to you - it's very hard to actually do nothing.",
        "So although there are harrowing moments of flight and moments where they're having immediate peril that they're dealing with, in a lot of cases, they were actually keeping themselves occupied and sane by making this film.",
        "As far as the logistics, what we did was in each country they would go through, I arranged a contact to meet them.",
        "And that contact would bring a laptop and a hard drive, and they would copy all of the footage that they had shot to date off onto that hard drive, and the contact would mail it to me.",
        "So that way, they didn't have to deal with, you know, trying to manage that themselves.",
        "They just had to meet someone.",
        "A lot of the shots are of the girls, the daughters, playing, trying to explore their surroundings, especially at the refugee camps in Bulgaria.",
        "And there's another in Serbia.",
        "There have been sort of other films that explore, you know, parents trying to give their children a sense of the beauty of the world, even in the midst of, you know, ugly circumstances.",
        "What struck you about that?",
        "Well, so I was speaking with them as they were going through the experience and then often receiving the footage and going through it months later because there was hundreds of hours to go through.",
        "It took a lot of time.",
        "And what I found was that while there were these moments of high drama, it was, as you said, punctuated by a lot of time of trying to keep normalcy for their family.",
        "And I felt like by allowing this family to shoot the story themselves - you know, frame their lives and tell their own story - what we discover is the way in which, amidst this kind of tension and anxiety of the migrant experience, there's also still the possibility for humor and joy and a much more diverse and rich humanity to emerge when we are in the hands of this family rather than in the hands of an outsider who's coming and looking for a quick story.",
        "There's one scene that's just - it's hard to watch, even though you're not seeing sort of overt ugliness.",
        "It's when the - I think, like, this is when they're in Bulgaria.",
        "And there are anti-immigrant marches, anti-refugee marches in the streets.",
        "And there are - I mean, you can hear the chanting in the background, and you can just - you know, despite the best efforts, the children are hearing this, and they're affected by it, and it's terrifying."

        "And at the same time, we wanted to keep it true to the experience of people from that region.",
        "And so that was a balancing act that we were dealing with as we worked on it.",
        "And what we were hoping is that, rather than focusing on the kind of binary political rhetoric that right now tends to proliferate, that people could just throw themselves into being with this family, experiencing their journey as a family and not necessarily, you know, having to do a lot of work to think about the political history or the geography that inform the journey.",
        "Does it ever worry you, though, that the only people who will be attracted to this film are people who are sympathetic to the families like this anyway?",

        "Yeah.",

        "And 30 years, really?",
        "How is that possible?",
        "Well, investigators believe that Mr. Madoff had a trading strategy, the trading strategy that he's talked about, that he's been pretty public about over the years.",
        "The problem was it didn't work.",
        "It didn't work, initially, when he started it, apparently, and for the last 30, 35 years - perhaps longer, that's not exactly clear - he essentially stopped making trades or made very few trades with client money and started a Ponzi scheme, which means he was taking money in, not really doing much with it, but paying it out to investors who were redeeming their funds, all the while telling everyone that they were making 10 percent a year or more in gains.",
        "And I guess the question, or at least one question that investigators are trying to figure out, is how could he have done this alone for 30 years and with what is said to be $50 billion?",
        "Right.",
        "There are plenty of people with exposure here, and investigators are obviously looking at everyone, including the family members who worked with Mr. Madoff at his firm.",
        "They always called it a family business.",
        "So, you had his brother, Peter; you had his sons, Andrew and Mark; you had his niece, Shana.",

        "They're all being looked at to see what they may have known about the fraud.",
        "The official story, obviously, is that Mr. Madoff told his sons on December 10th that he was basically committing fraud for a long time and that they were shocked, and they immediately went to the FBI.",
        "But obviously, they're being looked at.",
        "One sort of key red flag here that investigators are probably noticing is that Mark Madoff did not have any money invested through his father's firm for at least the last eight years.",

        "But another key person is Frank DiPasquali.",

        "If you wanted to set up an account, if you wanted to take money out, you dealt with him.",
        "And he worked at the firm essentially out of high school for more than 30 years.",
        "So, he's being looked at very closely.",
        "And also, the auditor, a very, very small storefront auditing firm, about an hour's drive north of New York City, which audited the financial statements of the Madoff firm; that firm received a subpoena, as well, for documents.",

        "We don't know yet how accurate it is, but we should note that that figure is believed to include all of the sham profits that were reported over the years.",

        "We don't know exactly how much less.",
        "But if you think about it, you know, when you have a lot of money that you're claiming is gaining by 10 percent or 12 percent every year, it can be inflated in a very short time.",
        "Any idea where that money is now?",
        "It's likely that a lot of it is in the hands of investors, of other investors who have redeemed money over the years.",
        "It's unclear exactly where all the money is, and that's what investigators are trying to figure out.",

        "Obviously, this is a situation where you look to see if there are any Swiss bank accounts or any money stashed away.",

        "So, it's possible that most of money just went to other investors over the years.",
