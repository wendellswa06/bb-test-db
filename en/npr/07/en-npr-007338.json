        "As he becomes a representative-elect, yes.",
        "Again, in the meantime there are polls out.",
        "We're going to talk about them.",
        "There are some in, for example, places that are having elections next November, including the state of New Jersey, where it's not expected to be close.",
        "No, and of course a lot has to do with the horrific events of Hurricane Sandy, but Chris Christie by most polls, there's a new NBC-Marist poll that shows Chris Christie with 60 percent of the vote.",
        "The likely Democratic candidate Barbara Buono, a state senator, with 28 percent, a landslide for a Republican in a state where Republicans usually don't win let alone landslides.",
        "And there are also - well, we should mention of course the big news in New Jersey is a smaller governor.",
        "Thanks a lot."

        "There's a new NBC-Marist poll among likely voters that came out today that had Cuccinelli up by only 45-42.",
        "It's very, very close.",

        "In the meantime, though, time is getting tight for the Massachusetts Senate seat formerly held by now Secretary of State John Kerry.",

        "He's still an Hispanic and probably will be for some time to come.",
        "Exactly, but he also has Gomez leading among independents 47-31.",

        "I guess he does.",
        "I mean, Scott Brown did prove that anything is possible.",
        "But this is a kind of shocking numbers for the Democrats.",
        "But again the election isn't until June 25.",
