        "Is there anybody - we mentioned Marco Rubio, but is there anybody else getting especially good buzz?",

        "And that event sold out about two weeks before the date of the event.",

        "The - some Republican parties around the country have shown this battle between the establishment and the so-called Ron Paul wing of the party.",
        "Is Iowa going in that...",
        "Well, Iowa has several factions within the party, just like every state.",
        "I supported Congressman Paul in 2008 and 2012.",
        "I was nominated in 2012 to be the chairman of the party by a Santorum supporter who was the head of the Iowa Right to Life in the past.",
        "And in 2013 I was nominated by Steve Scheffler, who's the head of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, a Ralph Reed entity.",
        "So, you know, I think there's a lot of unity around principles of the party.",
        "We're going to have some differences on candidates from time to time.",
        "But Republicans as a whole are pretty united on issues.",
        "Are you united on procedure?",
        "There was a lot of criticism after the last presidential election about too many debates.",

        "There's always been the criticism about Iowa that you have to run - Republicans need to run so far to the right to get the votes; the Steve Schefflers and the pro-family groups are in Iowa.",
        "And yet as we saw, Mitt Romney in 2012 desperately try to move towards the center, to the middle, in the general election.",
        "Do you feel that's a fair criticism of the situation in the way of you have to get the Republican nomination?",
        "No, I don't think that's a fair criticism at all, because if you look at Ron Paul and Mitt Romney, those two candidates were arguably, you know, not embraced by social conservatives to a large degree.",
