        "Obviously, mentioning the Web site - your background, most recently as - coming from TheNewyorkTimes.com, the New York Times, every newspaper that's a big newspaper, every broadcast outlet, as they look at diminishing numbers of readers and viewers, have invested heavily in their Web operations, seeing - well, that's where the future is.",
        "Nevertheless, none of them, so far as I know, have managed to figure out a way to make those Web operations pay for themselves.",
        "Do you anticipate that npr.org is going to be able to contribute significantly to NPR's income soon?",
        "Yeah, I've spent time in the last week with the heads of PRI and the heads of PBS, and we do all kinds of things together, including asking for money and raising money.",
        "We have shared resources.",
        "There are many ways in which we're connected.",
        "You know, a merger isn't necessary as long as we're collaborating along the lines that you suggest, and I agree.",
        "That is - that's an essential thing for us to do.",
        "We'll be very happy to see a huge crowd at 10 a.m.",
        "Well, no. I don't think it will contribute to NPR's income anytime soon.",
        "But you know, our mission in particular as a public service organization, even more so than commercial media, although I think they need to do it too, cannot simply bank on where the current revenue streams are.",
        "That would be foolhardy for us, and we need to continue - of course, you know, radio is our primary medium.",
        "And I think, frankly, radio's going to be around a lot longer than some of the other forms of legacy media, like print, for a variety of reasons, particularly the way that people use it.",
        "However, we must - irrespective of, you know, a lack of a business model - we must continue to forge ahead on all platforms.",
        "That's where the audience is.",

        "But I find it to be politically significantly left-leaning - rather unapology - unapologetically politically left-leaning.",
        "And I wonder if that's by intent, by default or is it even - I believe it's rather obvious, but I - maybe you disagree.",
        "Well, you'll be either pleased or concerned to know that we get just as many calls and complaints that we're too right-leaning.",
        "In fact…",
        "Yeah, but I don't think that it's an acceptable argument though, because people on the far left will think the middle is the right, and you certainly would have a majority of your listeners being of a leftward bent.",
        "In actuality, there are no Daniel Schorr counterparts.",
        "I've always heard that, when I'm talking to the Ombudsman - well, we have people complain about being too far to the right.",
        "I know that's true, but I know on an absolute scale, when Click and Clack make fun of themselves by talking about, for instance, \"\"much to the chagrin of,\"\" and then they fill in a blank as to who would think they were on National Public Radio..."

        "And in fact, survey after survey of our listeners shows that we're almost equantly balanced between people that self-identify as left of center and people that self-identify as right of center.",

        "Nobody - those programs - that and Day to Day - the two programs that are going away at the end of March were canceled with a very heavy heart.",
        "We know they're excellent programs with excellent journalists, and they had a lot of loyal listeners.",
        "But the economic reality was such that we needed to find millions of dollars to take out of our budget.",

        "But now I find myself paying a subscription fee for my Sirius as well.",
        "So, it seems like I'm like paying twice for the same service.",
        "My question is, what is the relationship to that and what, if any, of the money that goes to Sirius goes to the syndicate station?",
        "Yeah, that's a good question.",
        "(Laughing) First of all, Sirius needs all the money they can get right now, as you've probably read.",

        "And in fact, they are one of our distribution channels.",
        "There is an NPR channel on Sirius XM that runs a lot of our programs.",
        "It is an independent relationship - relationship that is independent from the stations.",
        "It is a separate revenue stream for us, which is another reason why we hope that Sirius XM survives, because it both delivers us listeners like yourself that may be outside of signal range, but also gives us - brings us money to support our programming.",
        "If you're worried about, you know, paying too much for you NPR programming, let me reassure you that there are multiple revenue streams that go towards supporting NPR.",
        "And in this difficult economic time, frankly, we're still not reaching our ultimate goals.",
        "So, whether you're supporting your local station, which I strongly suggest that you do because they have their own economies, in addition to the dues that they pay NPR, or whether you're paying XM, we appreciate it because it ultimately does help NPR stay on the air."

        "So, it's very nice when you're driving across Pennsylvania at two o' clock in the morning and you cannot find anything to listen to, to be able to flip on the Sirius and hear a repeat of whatever programming you care to.",

        "Look, in this - the great thing (Laughing) about a bad economy, if I could say such an outlandish thing, is it really focuses the mind.",
        "And I think what you'll find as - is that NPR and the member the stations will come closer and closer together going forward, because our ultimate objectives are exactly the same, which is to bring our listeners quality programs.",
        "You know, the question of bypass, which refers to the fact that npr.org streams some NPR programs, and it goes directly to listeners that might otherwise be listening to the radio - you know, what I've been telling folks as I travel around the country to visit stations and here at NPR is we're having the wrong conversation, because the opportunity is not npr.org versus the stations.",
        "The opportunity is that the stations - the summation of - whether it's the radio broadcast or the digital availability in local communities through station Web sites - that the sum of all those parts is what makes public radio and NPR so great, and that we've got to - what we will do is network all of those sites, network all of our efforts, to create one large number that represents the total listenership.",
        "One thing I think a lot of listeners don't necessarily understand about National Public Radio and its relationship with its member station is that, to the extent that NPR's owned by anybody, it's owned by the member stations.",
        "The majority of the seats on the board of directors are - their member station - radio station managers, and in a strange way, your customers - the radio stations - set your prices.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "It is a membership organization.",
