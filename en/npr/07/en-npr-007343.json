        "We will not - absolutely, positively - do anything to degrade our news reports.",
        "That is the fundamental commitment.",
        "It's at the core and the heart of everything we do.",
        "You may have heard me say earlier in the broadcast that it's a difficult time for everyone in the media - for everyone in every business, and NPR is included in that.",
        "And there are ways that we may need to find some cuts.",
        "As you know, we just eliminated two programs from our schedule, but we are not touching the core of our news gathering and reporting organization.",
        "And this from Peggy in Overland, Kansas - I would have happily increased my current contributions to my local NPR station had I known it would make a difference in keeping current programming.",
        "I'm sure if every NPR listener had been asked, they would have increased their giving by just a few dollars.",
        "Well, Peggy, there's no time like the present.",
        "So, I would really encourage you to give to your local station, because that will really help us, not only maintain our level of quality, but to grow it.",

        "She just came on board - joined us from TheNewYorkTimes.com in January.",

        "I was wondering what challenges you see NPR facing today and in the long term, besides the obvious one of the current economy.",
        "I was wondering how you see NPR addressing those challenges.",
        "Well, I think the challenge is for us to be very flexible and nimble, in terms of reaching audiences wherever they may be consuming media.",
        "I think radio has a strong, healthy future ahead of it, I think more so than most other forms of so-called legacy media, such as television news and newspapers.",
        "However, James, you, like most other Americans, consume their media in a multiple of ways, and the challenge for us is to figure out how to translate that NPR experience, that quality of what we call internally \"\"NPRness\"\" that makes you recognize on the dial when you're on an NPR member station without even knowing the call letters.",
        "How do we translate that experience to other forms of media, to the Internet to our - to your mobile phone, to however you want to consume it?",
        "We feel like we have a mission to serve listeners, readers, users, audiences however they want to consume us, but we want to preserve that special quality and that value that we bring to our audience.",
        "And let's go to Sean, Sean with us from Salt Lake City.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "I have a quick comment and then a question.",
        "My comment is, although I disagree with many of the criticisms that I think have been, you know, tossed maybe onto your laps in the last 40 minutes or something, I do want to say thank you for taking them seriously.",
        "Taking criticism seriously is something that keeps NPR wonderful, and it's one of the reasons that I've been listening to it my entire life.",
        "And then my question is is I was wondering if Vivian would talk about some of - the funding model for producing programming, for those of us who are not familiar.",
        "Many of us have been through many NPR fund drives, and we know that a lot of content is produced at local member stations, and we know that a lot of it is produced at, you know, HYY and in Washington.",
        "But I was wondering if she could talk about how the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets married together with local contributions to produce the content that we're all familiar with, so we can better understand how our funds go towards contributing and supporting the content that we like.",
        "Thanks, Sean.",
        "And isn't it wonderful how quickly you're on the first name basis with the audience?",
        "Well, I don't think it was the last opportunity for him to change the trajectory of the race, but it was certainly one of the last opportunities that he could make the case before the entire American people where everyone was watching him, to hear his vision, his ideology, and the direction that he'd like to take the country."

        "I'll call you by your first name back.",
        "I think there's sort of two questions embedded in there.",
        "One is, you know, what is the NPR funding model?",
        "How are we funded?",
        "And then, how do individual programs emerge into the system?",
        "I'll try to answer them both quickly.",
        "The first one is NPR's funding breaks down roughly as follows: 60 percent of it - I'm using rough numbers, so don't hold me to the exact percentages - but around 60 percent is from member station dues.",
        "Another 20-some-odd percent comes from underwriting or sponsorship, sometimes known as advertising.",
        "Another chunk of it in the teens comes from institutional foundations - the Ford Foundations and Wallace Foundations and others that you hear on the air - and from individual major gifts from our - to the NPR Foundation from our trustees and others.",
        "Some of it comes from payouts from our investments, although that's not doing so well right now.",
        "And a very small percent - less than 1 percent - comes from government-funded institutions, like the CPB.",
        "Now, you know, I sort of quickly went over the fact that 60 percent of our funding comes from stations, but don't forget that stations themselves are funded - some by CPB, some by, you know, some of the same ways that NPR is funded but also from the kind of pledge drives that you hear on the radio.",
        "And those are very, very important to their survival and to their growth.",
        "So, we encourage you to keep listening.",
        "In terms of how individual programs are developed and distributed, sometimes they are developed here, incubated here at NPR.",
        "Sometimes there's just a wonderful idea that comes in over the transom that NPR funds and distributes - shows like Car Talk, shows like Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.",
        "And a lot of programs emerge out of the station system.",
        "And they're either distributed, such as The Diane Rehm Show at WAMU, such as...",
        "Fresh Air.",
        "Yeah, Fresh Air - thank you - with Terry Gross.",

        "Well, I think, Madeleine, what he's trying to do is really build a case for the intervention, the decision to go into Iraq.",

        "And in specific, there was a poll done recently by Pew that indicated 43 percent of Americans now believe that the US and British forces--British government, I should say--lied about Iraq's weapons to justify the invasion.",
        "That's a big increase; it was only 30 percent earlier in the year.",

        "But given what we saw earlier in the week where Republicans lost gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, I think particularly in Virginia, a very red state, one the president won by 9 points in 2004, Rick Santorum would have been there.",
