        "I work with the company.",
        "I'm the engineer for Construction Solutions International, and we're a company that has one portion of our operation that makes its living supporting the offshore oil and gas industry.",
        "So, you know, we certainly welcome it with open arms.",
        "And it's an important part of the economy in Alabama, which you have to point out, is one of the poorest states in the country.",
        "We don't think ourselves that poor.",
        "But it is important and it could be much more important should other areas of the Gulf be opened up.",
        "And what kind of services do you supply?",
        "Well, what we operate with one portion of our company is what's called a shore base.",
        "All those platforms that anybody sees offshore, everything they get that the people need out there, from spare motors, replacement valves to their groceries and their drinking water, comes to them by a vessel, a boat, and that boat has to go to some central location to pick everything up.",
        "Those are called shore bases, and you could think of them as purpose-built specific ports just to support the oil and gas industry, because everything they need comes in smaller batches than you typically think of in a port, and it must move much faster.",
        "And that's what we do, is we operate a shore base, and everything...",
        "I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "And what do these platforms look like?",
        "You've got two main kinds of what we call fixed platforms.",
        "You've got manned and unmanned.",
        "Your unmanneds typically could just be as small as a stem, just one pipe sticking out of the ground with nothing on it, and it can be serviced by a vessel that comes up to it as a ladder so a guy can get to the top and that would be about as small as they can get.",
        "But your typical platform will have anywhere from three to six caisson legs driven into the ground, and it will be a large, steel superstructure supported on top, and it will look, to a lot of people, a lot like a drilling rig.",
        "Most people who don't know what they're looking at wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between a drilling rig and a production platform, but the drilling rig can get up and move and the production platform never will.",
        "And are they dirty or do they cause environmental problems?",
        "Not that I've ever seen, no. The production platforms - I can't tell you what occurred 30 or 40 or 50 years ago.",
        "But nowadays, they're very clean, very safe.",
        "They're just like any other industrial facility you'd ever go to except they're out on water."

        "And part of the price, you would argue that the United States is going to have to pay to free ourselves of dependence on foreign oil.",
        "Well, from our perspective, and given that we're just a small player - you know, we're just a support unit for these offshore energy companies - from our perspective, if we don't drill, what's going to happen five years from now?",
        "Gas is already, wherever it is, somewhere near four dollars a gallon, how are people going to feel from now when it's eight or nine dollars a gallon?",
        "So when you get started is when you can put an end to this.",
        "And one question - our next guest is somebody with a different view of this - but one question he asks is how is it that with all of those natural gas platforms off the coast of Alabama that the cost of natural gas in Alabama is among the highest in the country?",
        "I can't answer that one.",
        "That one's a little above my pay grade.",
        "I can understand that.",
        "As you go about this, how many people work for your company in this part of the business?",
        "In this part of the business, we've got about 24 people involved in it right now and it can vary where a general contractor our company is.",
        "So at sometimes, when the business is not very busy, we'll minimize it and put people to work in other areas of the company.",
        "When it does get very busy, we fold everybody into the shore base and do what's needed to be done.",
        "And how many people typically would work on one of those platforms?",
        "The largest platform in our area is owned and operated by Exxon Mobil and they can have upwards of 45 people out at there at a time with a typical number probably in the thirties.",
        "The smallest has two.",
        "And from your vantage point, I gather they look like somewhat like erector sets, those things you used to put together as a boy.",
        "Very much so.",
        "You're looking at just steel pipes driven in the ground, which we described as caissons, and they'll have horizontal levels of supports on them, and then you'll see the erector set diagonal bracings you're referring to to support it during storms."

        "Yes, it is.",

        "I would go fishing right up to these oil rigs and there are big signs on the oil rigs: \"\"Danger: Hydrogen Sulfide.\"\" And we had a leak last September 4th that settled on the island and sickened quite a number of people, and there was an evacuation of the classrooms at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab.",
        "And I have found out since - and this was a surprise to many of us, including the scientists at the sea lab who I was told by then that they were taken by surprise - that this gas is worse than hydrogen cyanide, which is what is used in gas chambers to execute capital criminals.",
        "The next stage after being afflicted by this poisonous gas, after the nausea, after smelling - it has that rotten egg smell - the next stage is that a person loses all his senses, including his sense of smell, depending on the saturation of the gas and the amount causing the convulsions and loses consciousness and dies.",
        "Did anybody die last September 4th?",
        "No.",
        "Dauphin Island, wasn't that also the place where one of the oil rigs during Hurricane Katrina was blown off its moorings and landed on your island?",
        "Yes.",

        "So what advice would you have for people in California or Florida or in North Carolina if they were given the power to make their decision by the Congress and decide whether to start offshore drilling?",
        "If they're asking me, I would tell them, you do not want those contraptions off your shoreline.",
        "For matters of safety, for matters of health, aesthetics, of course, they are ugly.",
        "I mean, there are people on the island who've grown up with them and some of my neighbors say they've gotten used to them and they find kind of a comfort in them, but I'm thinking - and of course, I've only lived on the island for three years, Neal, and I'm thinking it's rather like those people who own dogs that bark and bite that everyone is afraid of and hates.",
        "But of course, they got to love them.",
        "They've had them since they've been pups and they're their own.",
        "But since September 4th, the rigs have - well, literally and figuratively, caused me to lose sleep for the major reasons I said before.",
        "But also, I thought of this one evening, you can't escape them at night, either.",
        "I mean, we can see - our island is small.",
        "It's like two and a half miles by 12 miles.",
        "It used to be longer but Hurricane Katrina cut a big portion off.",
        "And you see them from every point where you can see the water, and then at night, the halogen lights are inescapable, and you can go in your house and you can draw the shades, but if it's a night when you want to leave the windows open, you hear the whistles and the bells coming from the rigs from as far as 10 miles offshore and the conditions are right.",
        "And quickly, though, what about Chip Conklin's point?",
        "Five or ten years from now, when oil or gas from offshore could start coming onshore, we're going to need it then.",
        "And we may have an energy revolution, but not in five or ten years, nobody thinks."
