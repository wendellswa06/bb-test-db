        "I lived there from 1955 through 1997, and I went to the beach all the time because we lived about, I don't know, half a mile from the beach.",
        "And as a kid, you'd go to the beach, and there's always been natural seepage of oil and tar out of that.",
        "In fact, the Spanish used to stop there to get caulking for their ships.",
        "But when the drilling started in the early '60s, it progressively got worse.",
        "The tar on the beach, and now it's a joke.",
        "I mean, you know, the beaches in that area, especially if there's a southerly wind that blows from the platforms into the land, you know, I remember surfing there and getting blobs of tar six inches in diameter in my hair.",
        "And wasn't there a big spill there in 1969?",
        "Well, first of all, let me say that I served in the U.S.",
        "Congress and dealt with energy legislation back in the '70s and served in a position called Chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission, which is just a three-person board that doesn't deal with railroads, but since the 1930s has dealt with all oil and gas production in Texas.",

        "At the right time of the day, when the sun is at the right angle, you see lots of reflections of oil slicks in the water as you fly over the ocean.",
        "So I'm not buying that thing about there's no, you know, seepage.",
        "There's definitely natural seepage there.",
        "But when they started drilling for oil, probably because of the change in pressure underground from the oil, there's lots of tar and stuff in the water there now.",
        "It can get pretty bad.",

        "And that oil spill that Jerry was just talking about, wasn't that the spill that initiated the moratorium on drilling?",
        "Well, it was one of the factors that initially led Congress about a decade later to begin, you know, sort of the process of initiating moratorium.",
        "It started with California and then throughout the 1980s it expanded to include pretty much the entire Pacific and the Atlantic Coast, as well as parts of the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "But as you point out in a recent article in U.S News & World Report, just because there's a moratorium on most of the coast, doesn't mean that there's not activity out there.",
        "Right.",
        "And there's activity in the western Gulf of Mexico and the Central Gulf of Mexico, especially once you get out into deep water.",
        "That's where the real interest is right now.",
        "A lot of oil companies have started pushing out into water of depths greater than a thousand feet in the hopes of trying to find resources out there that either used to be not available to them, either for economic reasons or technological reasons, and I think since 2002 we've seen a doubling of the number of projects on the deep water.",
        "Economic reasons because, well, the price of gas and oil is much greater than it used to be so suddenly, if it was marginal before, now you could make a profit on it.",
        "Right, because it's very expensive to drill out in deep water.",
        "To operate some of these rigs it costs these companies more than half a million dollars a day.",
        "So it's a pricey operation.",
        "But as oil prices have gone up, there's a certain cost-benefit analysis that goes on there.",
        "And reading your piece, there are other restraints on sudden expansion of offshore drilling, including lack of skilled personnel and lack of equipment.",
        "Right.",
        "Both of those are huge problems.",
        "One, you have a labor problem where you have a work force that is aging.",
        "You have a lot of engineers and technicians who are now older and they're not being replaced by younger generation of workers, in part because interest at the university level in engineering programs for petroleum has fallen off."

        "Yeah.",
        "I grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, which relies very heavily on the tourism industry and the beaches.",
        "And so, you know, this is an issue that is close to my heart, and my question is, the proponents of offshore drilling are talking about how it will lower prices, you know, whether it's in a year, five years, ten years or whatever.",
        "But if there's nothing to stop all this new drilling oil from going straight to the world market, you know, China and India are increasing exponentially in the amount of oil they use so there's no guarantee that America's going to see any of this oil that's being drilled off our shores anyway.",
        "So I'm just wondering, is it really worth the risk, given that we may never see a drop of the oil that's being drilled off our shores?",
        "Kent Garber, oil, as they say, is fungible."

        "You know what, I think, again, the best evidence we have, the best information we have on this issue right now comes from the Department of Energy, which essentially looked at this issue of lifting the ban on the OCS and found that before 2030 that there would not be a significant impact on oil production and that the impact on prices would be insignificant.",
        "And so as Sarah pointed out, that even if we do increase our production, the price is set on the international market, and so - many more factors come into play here than simply boosting our production to whatever degree we do.",
        "But more oil produced domestically would mean we'd be buying more of that oil - the money that we'd be paying for that would be going to - some of it or more of it - would be going to domestic producers.",
        "Well, I think that's correct to a certain extent, although the one thing that's interesting as we're looking to the future, the Department of Energy has sort of looked at oil imports over the next two decades and they found that they actually think that a lot of the increase in petroleum or fuel is going to come from either bio-fuels or liquid-to-coal technology, and so you have to sort of consider those alternative sources, petroleum against - the traditional petroleum, whether it's domestic or foreign.",
        "And in that occasion, when I was serving as chairman of the commission, I found - because there were always questions about the environmental safety of offshore drilling, but there is a group in Boston, and I've forgotten the specific title of their publication, but something like, Off the Oil Spill Reporter, something of that sort.",
        "What I found is that the total spillage from all U.S.",
        "production for a year, all offshore production was less than the spillage of one small tanker that, you know, cracks or does whatever.",
        "And so environmentally, the risk is not very great from the environmental - there's not much environmental risk to offshore drilling because it has been perfected to the extent that if we had to import all that oil, not only would we have a huge capital outflow but we would not have an environmentally more secure set of oceans.",
        "And people can say, well, how many jobs does it mean?",
        "But you know, suppose we still had healthy American car-production facilities instead of depending on Honda and Hyundai and everybody else.",

        "Would that not mean more capital at home?",
        "And do you think he's got a point there, Kent Garber?",
        "Well, certainly, the oil industry does provide, you know, hundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans.",
        "There's, you know, also growing evidence that investing in green manufacturing, be it in wind power or solar power, would also be a significant spur to the American economy.",
        "I'm not opposed to wind power, however, you know, oil derricks don't kill birds and we have an awful lot of wind power that is coming in, in West Texas amid the oil fields and also offshore.",
        "But there are always certain costs to anything.",
        "I mean, we don't get free electricity, and the reality is that since 1920, at least as five years ago, in America, 90 percent of all of our energy production came from three fossil fuels: Coil, oil and gas.",
        "And although the ratio between those three shifted at various times, the total number stayed much the same.",
        "And so, I'm not opposed to the energy or others, but they will faze in over time and meanwhile, for - particularly for transportation, we don't have any significant substitute..."
