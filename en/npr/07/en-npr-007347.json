        "And all of - Congressman, all of this is fascinating and it's part of the debate.",
        "Today, we wanted to talk with people who live near oil platforms.",
        "Well, I've seen the oil platforms.",
        "They're out there, they're visible, but they're, you know, they're just - they're far enough offshore that I've never minded swimming at Rockport or Galveston or anywhere else because they were a considerable distance out.",
        "And you know, I don't find one offshore rig any more unattractive than, you know, than a hundred wind turbines that are out there trying to generate some energy.",
        "I mean, it's - there are always costs to these things, and one of the costs is perhaps your view from the shore, but I find them pretty small and kind of unnoticeable.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, sir.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "Obviously, a cost to everything, but as I understand it from your article, there are a lot of new leases coming up, those deep-water leases that you're talking about, and there's going to be an auction here in Washington pretty soon.",
        "The auction will actually be down in New Orleans.",
        "Oh, that's right.",
        "On August 20th, and this is actually part of the regular lease process that the Interior Department goes through every year.",
        "They hold a handful of leases on track, available either in the Gulf of Mexico or Alaska, the areas that are currently available for leasing and drilling along the Outer Continental Shelf.",
        "And it's interesting to look at sort of this, you know, particularly - so just as an example of what can happen because you have, you know, the potential for 400 million barrels of oil to be produced from this particular sale that's going to happen later this month.",
        "And yet, even when you do the calculations you realize that we consume about 20 million barrels oil a day.",
        "So you do the math and you're not talking about a lot of oil there.",
        "But again, it's some oil, and money that would be going into American pockets as opposed to Saudi pockets or Russian pockets."

        "And certainly, there were many environmental protections in place with regulations, but you know, I have to say that overwhelmingly, the perspective of my coworkers was that, you know, any kind of federal - let's see, how do I express it?",
        "They were very hostile to the idea of environmental regulation, much less from the federal government.",
        "And so they went out of their way to, you know, cut the environmental corners, you know.",
        "We went varied(ph), all kinds of nasty stuff.",
        "And if you raised your voice about this type of thing, you were ostracized by your coworkers and all kinds of, you know, nasty invectives came your way and such.",
        "But I think - my point is that there's a cultural element here in terms of, you know, how this works - or a human element, I guess I would say, you know, how this works internally.",
        "And I'm very dubious when oil companies tell me there's going to be environmental protections for any kind of drilling because I saw the exact opposite for the entire time that I did that kind of work.",

        "They're quite beautiful, actually.",
        "I think that it's more of an eyesore for me is to stand at the side of the gas pump and look at numbers just go at 100 miles an hour from my Tour(ph) coach.",
        "That's more of an eyesore to me.",
        "But looking at theses offshore oil rigs, I don't find them undesirable at all.",
        "They're very beautiful when they're lit up, and it usually tells us how far or how close the marine layer(ph) is coming in, as well.",
        "So we kind of use it as a tool, but it's not quite as an eyesore as it is to be at a gas pump watching that thing just ring up.",
        "And your question?",
        "And my question to Mr. Garber is, as the lady was saying in St. Louis, I would think that we would be part of the competition with the Saudis and with Russia as far as fuel.",
        "Wouldn't that be more competitive for us to be able to lower the prices?",
        "Or is that just something that can be taken advantage of because of the money that could be drawn from it?",
        "Well, the prices are set, as he said earlier, are by the world market.",
        "It's sell itself per gallon of - well, it depends on the grade of the oil, too.",
        "Lightweight crude is the best quality, as I gather.",
        "So we can't be competitive?",
        "You don't see - I mean, because if you got two roofers in one city competing with another person and one guy lowers his price so he can get the job to do.",

        "If you actually look at the actual numbers, about half of our oil imports come from the Western hemisphere, either from Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, as well.",
        "We actually get about 16 percent of our oil imports from the Persian Gulf.",
        "So I think that's, you know, an interesting point to take into account when we talk about energy security and where our oil comes from that, you know, to the extent that we can make it domestic, it also helps to make it, you know, from North America, as well, and a significant amount of oil does come from, you know, neighboring countries.",
        "And I think the other point that the caller mentioned, which was interesting, is just talking about prices at the pump right now.",
        "In recent weeks, we've actually seen them decline significantly.",
        "So I think the average price of gas nationally is now about 3 dollars and 83 cents, which is down from the above-four-dollar price which we were talking about several weeks ago.",
        "And there are several reasons for this, one of which is the U.S.",
        "dollar seems to be strengthening, U.S.",
        "demand has fallen because of high prices.",
        "We've also seen supplies go up internationally in recent weeks and so I think - to the extent that this debate has been galvanized by higher gas prices, it will be interesting to see if some of that steam falls out as prices fall.",
