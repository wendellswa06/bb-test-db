        "The fact that Barack Obama is being accused of being a Muslim, there's an outsider element to it that's sort of racialized, in my view, and I think it's sort of connected to a very long tradition of seeing African-Americans as outsiders, despite the service of African-Americans in the military, despite the fact that the civil rights movement which Roger talked about was always rooted in the rhetoric of the Founding Fathers and basically asked African-Americans to walk naked into fire hoses and into rabid dogs, into police waving night sticks.",
        "And you know, you sort of put that up against people who claim that feminists caused 9/11.",
        "No one questions their patriotism.",
        "You put that against people who say that the gays caused Katrina.",
        "No one questioned these peoples' patriotism but it's always African-Americans who are sort of seen as the outsiders, despite the fact that African-Americans, historically, as I've said at the beginning, I think have demonstrated their patriotism in spite of some really harsh treatment repeatedly throughout history."
