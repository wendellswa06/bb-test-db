        "Roger, I wondered if you want to get in on this.",
        "Well, I think that I think it is true that blacks were for many - well, for a couple of centuries, the designated outsider.",
        "But as the country moved west, Native Americans became designated as outsiders, as well.",
        "But the myth, the guilt, the anguish that went into creating a slave society, I think, created a deeper kind of antipathy and need to stamp otherness on the heads of black people.",
        "I think that they - a lot of slave owners would have had a much harder time keeping their slaves and treating them badly had it not been for the fact that they thought that these were inferior beings, something other than.",
        "So I think that our otherness is a product of that.",
        "But let me go back to your first question about patriotism.",
        "I ask myself whether I can be patriotic about a country that was started by Brazilian people who were slave owners.",
        "And ultimately, I said, I'm looking at this only from a white person's point of view, as if I were white.",
        "Why don't I look at this as if I had no race?",
        "Then what would I say?",
        "I would look at my slave ancestors, because I was looking at a white perspective because I had kind of obliterated my slave ancestors.",
        "I knew they were there but there's no history, there's no individualism.",
        "But then I began to find out about them, and they were working people.",
        "They were forced to work.",
        "They were not paid for their labors.",
        "Some spent their entire lives in slavery.",
        "And then, the thing that really got me was that my - I found out where my great, great grandparents on my father's side were from.",
        "They were Mississippi field slaves.",
        "There couldn't be any harder kind of slavery than Mississippi field slave.",
        "They were freed on - technically - by the end of the Civil War.",
        "They were still children but they were slammed back into semi-slavery and that's what they did in Mississippi until they died in the second decade of the last century.",
        "But I think of their holding on, keeping their spirits together, indications that we have that they had a sense that there would be a better day for their descendants, like me.",
        "And I have to revere those people for their fortitude and for their beliefs and their doing what they could to create generations that would be free.",
        "They were right, too.",
        "They were right.",
        "And so - and they were Americans.",
        "They weren't treated as full Americans but they surely weren't Chinese or Mexicans.",
        "They were Americans.",
        "And so I said to myself, these people put more down in the soil of America to create what we have now than virtually any other people on earth.",
        "Who can't love them?",
        "You got to love them, and you got to love the country they worked for.",
        "Let's get a question from here in the Newseum.",
        "Hi.",
        "Barack Obama embodies many elements of American society, white as well as black, old American families and immigrants.",
        "We know immigrants can be extremely patriotic.",
        "It seems strange, therefore, to question his patriotism because he's black.",

        "You want to address that, Ta-Nehisi Coates?",
        "Yeah.",

        "So I don't want to, you know, make it sound, you know, in that sort of fashion.",
        "But getting to the question, again, I just want to connect it to this very long tradition of when African-Americans try to establish some sort of reform in this country, to people basically questioning their patriotism.",
        "This goes back to Martin Luther King and people were not really believing that the civil rights movement was a home-grown thing but some sort of Communist plot inspired by the Russians.",
        "And so, I'm just, you know, when I said that about Barack Obama, I'm sort of just connecting him into that history.",
        "Also, you know, I think, you know, Roger really got at something that pretty much, you know, sums up how African-Americans feel.",
        "I mean, you understand if something horrible happened in the past and in some respects still happens today.",
        "But I think African-Americans, for the most part, desperately, desperately love this country.",
        "Chris Rock has a great if not crude joke where he says, America is like your uncle that molested you but paid your way through college.",
        "And you can't, you know, completely walk away from that.",
        "I think that, you know, pretty well sums up how a lot of us feel.",

        "And whoops, what am I doing wrong?",

        "Yes.",
        "Mr. Clever has managed to get you on the radio.",
        "I apologize.",
        "Well, I would say if my uncle molested me, I would very easily walk away, even if he paid my way through college, so I don't know if that was the greatest example of why, as African-Americans...",

        "I know it's a joke, but I understood what you were saying and it's sort of like - you know, it was a good entree to sort of say that I have a very hard time, actually, you know, just listening to the program.",
        "It makes me sort of emotional because when I think of patriotism, you know, I think that my father was a Marine, he fought in World War II, you know, he paid those kinds of dues with all the lack of recognition that African-American soldiers got during that time.",
        "But I look in - when I hear people talk about Founding Fathers it sort of makes me want to wretch because these men were not my father.",
        "They had nothing, you know, familial to me.",
        "They were people who raped us and who enslaved us.",
        "And so when I hear people referring to them as Founding Fathers, I can't relate to that.",
        "And so for most of my adult life, actually, since junior high school, I have not stood for the pledge of allegiance.",
        "I have not been able to, you know, put my hand over my heart and say those words because to me they were void of any meaning for me.",
        "And I have to, though, say that as we move into this unbelievable period that we're in now with Barack Obama, you know, the Democratic nominee, presumptive Democratic nominee, I have to say that from the day he won the Iowa caucus, you know, my breath was taken away because I never thought I would see this in my lifetime.",
        "And that's become sort of a cliche for so many of us now.",
        "You know, my parents are 82 years old.",
        "They certainly never thought they would see it in their lifetime.",
        "So as I watch this process, I've had to have, you know, I've had to soften myself a bit, I've had to, you know, make myself understand that, you know, that my brush might have been too broad, that my stroke is maybe going through too many people and assuming too much about people.",
        "But then on the other hand I get an email this morning for the preview in the CNN broadcast that's coming up in a couple of weeks from blacks in America.",
        "And they had an anecdote in there that talks about some interview where they were able to glean that, you know, there are employers who are more willing to hire white males with felony records and no high school diploma than a black male with a college degree and no felony record.",
        "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.",
        "Yeah, Neil, I'd just like to say, first of all, that this whole idea of post-racial is very suspect because it seems as though - it makes it sound like America is just trying to rush through this idea of equality.",
        "And there is no level playing field.",
        "So until that happens, there is no post-racial.",
        "I think the whole notion of that is just kind of insulting and implies that we're at a place where we are far from.",
        "And there's still a lot of work to be done.",
        "In terms of what the caller said about having this ambiguous relationship with this country, you know, we have a very rough history with this country and a lot of people had died and a lot of inequality has been dealt us and unfair hands.",
        "But it's like you have to have a stake in the game.",
        "It's like ownership.",
        "And if you look at a community, the renters in that community don't have much of a stake in it and don't really care about what happens there.",
        "It's the homeowners who go to the block club meetings.",
        "It's the homeowners who do the Neighborhood Watches.",
        "It's people who have a stake in that community and seeing it improve and prosper.",
        "And I think that we're in that same position.",
        "As Americans, as black Americans, we have to have a stake in the game.",
        "And so you have to, therefore, cleave to this country and claim your stake in it, claim ownership of it before you can improve it."

        "But in fact, blacks fought in every battle.",
        "On both sides.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Every family has some things in their closet, and if you really love your family and you really love the people around you, you have to be honest with yourselves.",
