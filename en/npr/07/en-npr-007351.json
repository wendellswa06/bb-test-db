        "While I do not doubt the patriotism of most African-Americans, why do African-Americans make such efforts to not integrate into American culture?",
        "As American patriots, why do African-Americans have black colleges, black churches, black fraternities, black magazines, et cetera?",
        "As an individual of Germanic heritage, while I'm proud of my heritage, I am an American.",
        "And again, Roger, this is an historical question in terms of when these institutions were founded and what purpose they had.",
        "Black colleges were founded because black people were not permitted to go to most of the colleges in the United States.",
        "And they were created in the period after the Civil War at a time when in the South the terrorists, these redeemers, were trying to recreate the pre-mellim(ph) South and made it very difficult for blacks to do anything except go back into slavery.",
        "As to why blacks don't integrate, it's in large measure because there's still enough racism and discomfort in this society that a lot of black people do not feel comfortable participating in social activities with whites, and often we're not invited.",
        "But I got a letter from a very - a brilliant young friend of mine, black, who said - he calls me a ludeye(ph) because I don't like the Internet but anyway, he's saying, dear Lut Eye(ph), here I'm going to tell you that I have been sampling life on the friendship circuits of the Internet.",
        "And he said, what I find, really, is stunning because I find that so few of the white people I know have - or few of these people that come up on the Internet have any black friends at all.",
        "I was going to ask you to come in on this, Ta-Nehisi Coats?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I would question the presumption that black people haven't tried to integrate.",
        "First of all, the term \"\"white flight\"\" was invented for a reason.",
        "It's not like African-Americans don't try to move into white neighborhoods.",
        "They've, you know, historically have been barred by law and when not barred by law people weren't especially welcome to them moving in.",
        "Also, I mean, if you look at measures of citizenship, again, you know, as we've all talked about, military service, voting, et cetera, I think African-Americans have made phenomenal efforts to try to integrate.",
        "The integration is tradition in African-American.",
        "Activism is probably much more stronger than a nationalist tradition.",
        "It's no mistake that Martin Luther King is the saint in terms of African-Americans, the civil rights movement, which was wholly premised on integration.",
        "I also would question the idea that seems to underline this, and that is that somehow white culture is American culture, that African-American culture hasn't been a persistent source for American culture.",
        "I don't know that you can have American culture without, say, jazz, for instance.",
        "And at this point there I would say hip-hop.",
        "I would go so far as to say, I don't know that you could have a Barack Obama without hip-hop at this point.",
        "I know that's a little far out there, but, I mean, if you look at hip-hop and look at how, you know, it has brought blacks and whites together in ways that, you know, just weren't true before, I think, I would really question this idea that black culture sits over here and has not really contributed to American culture.",
        "I don't know how you have American culture without black people.",
        "And Terry Glover, there certainly is both black and white separatism."

        "We've been rejected, but our culture has very much been a part of the larger American culture and we would not have an American culture without the contributions of black Americans.",
