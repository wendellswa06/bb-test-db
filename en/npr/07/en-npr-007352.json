        "So you think that there still is an economic need not just for individual African-Americans to get access, but there's an economic need for this country to have affirmative action based on race?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I think that you still see - if you look at any of the economic indicators, from unemployment rate to wealth, you just go down the list of economic indicators, you find the African-American community lagging.",

        "What this does is, unfortunately, it provides a release valve for the investor-owned utilities, where they can do this not as a matter of last resort and not have motivations to do the other mitigation that's so critical.",
        "For now, PG&E is pushing to ensure they have the most updated contact information for the 16 million people who rely on the utility to keep the lights on."
