        "He and two other Mormon historians wrote \"\"Massacre at Mountain Meadows,\"\" the latest of more than a dozen books on the subject, but the only one written with the support of Mormon leaders.",
        "What happened at Mountain Meadows was horrific.",
        "It was terrible.",
        "It has been used as one of the biggest clubs to beat Mormonism over the years, and so it keeps coming up over and over and over again.",
        "Mormon leaders long blamed Paiute Indians who denied any significant role.",
        "The victims were also blamed.",
        "They were characterized as belligerent and bragging about the killing of Mormon founder, Joseph Smith, and the violent ejection of Mormons from settlements in Missouri.",
        "Heavy blame was also placed on local Mormon leaders.",
        "The new book by Mormon historians lays all that out, but concludes something that could be disturbing to Mormons, says Richard Turley.",
        "These people who carried out the massacre were, in many ways, ordinary individuals who got caught up in emotion, caught up in the circumstances of their times, and began to make decisions that led to committing an atrocity.",
        "And what was disturbing about that was the realization that the difference between ordinary people, like us, and these people who committed atrocity was really a short distance."

        "Because in the meantime, we were able to find a solution that actually removed the chemical weapons that were known from Syria in a way that the use of force would never have accomplished.",
        "But the fundamental problem of Syria persists, and that is that there's enormous human suffering.",
        "And we have not - we, the United States, the international community, the U.N., Russia, everybody else - has not managed to find a negotiated solution, which would, by necessity, mean dealing with the problem of Assad continuing to govern Syria in the most violent and repressive way.",

        "That - we had plenty of time to do that, and we knew it.",
        "And the fact that we were concerned about what more might come between October 7 and the election was another factor.",
