        "How many more do you need?",
        "Why has this been so difficult?",
        "Well, it's really a question of rounding out the plan and the troops that were scheduled for that plan a little bit more - a little bit earlier than we had anticipated.",
        "We are basically asking that the remaining 15 percent of the troop list that has been approved by nations be filled, particularly the emphasis on a maneuver battalion that we feel the commander of the NATO mission in Afghanistan needs to have the flexibility, not just in the south but throughout the country.",
        "And this additional 15 percent, that doesn't like a lot.",
        "It isn't.",
        "It's really perhaps not even quite 2,000 troops, but it's the enablers that come with it, the - some attack helicopters, some C130s for inter-theater airlift, but most of all it's a maneuver battalion that can be put at his disposal to swing the force any way he wants to anywhere in the country.",
        "In recent days, I think in the past 10 days, NATO forces in Afghanistan have reported killing 400 insurgents?",
        "Well, it's hard to say exactly, but there's no question that in the southern part of the country, where we have just expanded, we have expanded into an area where there have not been many permanent forces, if any, over the past several years.",
        "And in the south central region, the traditional home of the Taliban, it's the home of Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban.",
        "It's the home of the opium producing narcotics cartels.",
        "It's been rampant with crime and corruption.",
        "And there has been very little reconstruction in that part of the country, so I've likened it to poking at a beehive and now the bees are swarming.",
        "But I have no doubt that we're going to be successful.",
        "And I think it's very important that the people of that region also see that reconstruction and a better way of life can come their way, but right now it's not an easy time."
