        "I think that those laws are obviously not widespread enough and not universal across our 50 states, but this is where we're headed.",

        "So pure and utter ignorance is the sin here, and Garden Guy is manifesting that.",
        "But the dangerous thing is when you talked about putting them out of business, there will be people in Houston - probably even churches - who will uphold the (unintelligible) businesses because they believe that they are suffering through the persecution that good Christians are suffering through for taking a stand.",
