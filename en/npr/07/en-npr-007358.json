        "But remember, if everyone did the Kyoto Protocol, which is 20 times more than what the world has actually managed to do, we would save about one polar bear a year for a cost of a couple of hundred billion dollars in lost GDP growth per year.",

        "Actually, over the last 150 years, sea levels also rose about a foot.",
        "And I doubt that most people think of that as one of the most important issues that happened in the last 150 years.",

        "But just in a job-racked and deficit-concerned America, the greatest idea, I think, would be take these factories, factory cities and factory towns - wherein, you know, many automakers have removed themselves and thus depleted - and instead create solar and green jobs, creating perhaps, like, cheap, as you said, cheap solar panels, cheap - other cheap things.",

        "Well, Amanda, first of all, we have to recognize what we need to invest in is the research and development to get these solar panels and many other green technologies to become so cheap - we dont actually have to support them.",
        "Because right now, what is happening, especially in places in Europe -Spain is a good example - they supported these green technologies by very high subsidies.",

        "That's an incredibly bad investment.",
        "And of course, it also turns out that thats one of the reasons - not the only, by any means - one of the reasons why Spain is in such a bad place.",
        "So it's not about creating very ineffective, subsidized jobs now, it's about creating the knowledge so that we can actually make great economics later on by simply selling these green technologies below fossil fuel prices.",
        "So I'm afraid it's not going to help right now in Miami, but it is going to help both in creating a new green economy in the long run that's based on smart economics rather than subsidized economics; and it'll also actually solve global warming.",

        "We definitely need it.",

        "I really think a lot of people are starting to look around for smarter solutions and investment and research and development in green energy.",
