        "And I wonder when the transfer to NATO was first brought about, I mean there was at least an impression that many of the countries involved did not think this was going to be a heavy combat assignment, that this was going to be reconstruction and protection, that sort of thing.",
        "That's a fair statement concerning the - how NATO approaches its traditional mission, but in Afghanistan the alliance approved a very robust set of rules of engagement for its forces and has shown that it does have - when challenged, it does have the capacity to do what needs to be done.",

        "Good afternoon.",
        "I have a huge amount of questions, but the first might be what's the strategic significance at this point of anybody being in Afghanistan?",
        "It seems like we just blow up countries and then go back and rebuild them, and there's plenty of people in America that have the same needs as they do overseas.",
        "We're not after Osama, so...",
        "I think General Jones might dispute you on that point, but let him speak for himself.",

        "That was absolutely proven a few years ago.",
        "I also believe that it's the - it's also a cradle of narcotic producing problems that in fact the West, particularly Europe as a matter of fact - and I think that the people of Afghanistan have shown a tremendous amount of courage in raising their hands for democracy and freedom.",
        "Okay.",
        "And so we have the choice of, it seems to me, of helping them along that road - and it certainly is encouraging that the people want this - and also making sure that this country doesn't revert back to being a haven for terrorist that will export their methods throughout the world.",
        "It is a fact of life that terrorism is a global problem.",
        "We need to confront it where it is, and it is still there in Afghanistan.",
        "And I'd rather fight it there than I would, you know, on the shores on the European countries or in the United States.",
        "(Caller): Okay.",

        "Right.",
        "And it's two generations later and this has come to fruition.",
        "It seems to me that big business in America and abroad have basically taken advantage of other nations and set up social classes for our care system where people are just disenfranchised and in that respect are easily turned to terrorists.",
        "And rather than killing these people with guns, it seems like propaganda, which is something that we do a lot of, might be a better way to bring people into the fold and let them realize that you know there is help out there.",
        "But on the other hand, we've gone after Iraq and we've gone into Afghanistan and the problem is really Saudi Arabia and Iran, and even Pakistan."

        "Given that if you look back over the last few hundred years the only governments - if you want to use that term - whether it was the British or anyone else that controlled this area of Afghanistan controlled little bits of territory around capital areas, are we realistic in trying to do anything out in these frontier areas?",
        "Why are we going to be any different than any other power - any other power that was always a great power of that time?",
