        "Absolutely not.",
        "In fact, I wrote a story last week or the week before about how Western diplomats believe that this agreement - these peace agreements that General Musharraf's regime has made with the insurgents - Islamic insurgents aligned with the Taliban in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and we're talking about north and south Waziristan.",
        "In fact, there is an underwritten or unspoken aspect of these agreements they believe.",
        "And that is that the Pakistani authorities are basically saying to the extremists in the tribal areas, don't mess with us anymore; we're taking our troops back into their compounds and their garrisons.",
        "And you can go over to the other side of the border and join the Taliban jihad against the Americans, NATO and the Afghan government.",
        "And in fact the U.N., the United Nations, has a very highly respected tracking program, monitoring program, that monitors violent crime and insurgent activity along the border.",
        "And they have noted a major increase in both violent crime and insurgent activity since General Musharraf's regime has been negotiating these peace agreements with their own insurgents in the tribal areas.",
        "And just a few minutes before we were speaking with General Jones, who said clearly that the equipment, the training ground, all the logistical support for the Taliban forces in Afghanistan is clearly coming from Pakistan.",
        "That's absolutely correct.",
        "And in fact what's different now as opposed to the past is this - that previously most of these insurgents and the Taliban and (unintelligible) both Pakistani extremists, Arab fighters and the Taliban themselves have been coming through the mountain passes along the eastern/southeastern border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and that in the winter time those passes were blocked by snow.",
        "The development this time, however, is that the insurgents are coming around from the south not from the tribal areas of Pakistan but from Pakistan's province of Balujistan; and that is desert, that is flat desert, and that doesn't get blocked by snow.",
        "And there is a great deal of concern that this year will not see the traditional decrease in violence that takes place during the winter time but that indeed this conflict will go on all winter.",
        "Ed, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Okay, thank you.",

        "Sorry, which event?",
        "The fall of the Taliban?",

        "Woman are not by law obliged not to go into the market or not to send their children to school.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "My guys who wear sparkly caps, you know, normally, tied on a big whopping black turban each.",
        "And I tied on a big whopping white turban to make that drive up to Kabul, because we didn't want to be too visible; we wanted to blend in.",
        "And I'm seeing that more and more - people growing beards, people changing their dress because of the increasing tension.",
        "But your organizations is based out of Kandahar, a city that, well, that was the home of the Taliban, the home of Mullah Omar, and a place which is said to be - a lot of people say is pretty strong Taliban right now.",
        "Yeah, I mean here is where I actually disagree with General Jones.",
        "He said that basically NATO troops are going to where the Taliban have always been and are stirring it up.",
        "That is not the case.",
        "Let me tell you that I have been watching an encroachment on the city of Kandahar.",
        "It is true that up in the mountains, you know, way north of town, there have been some villages that remain pretty sympathetic and were the initial - starting late 2002 - place that the Taliban coming across the border were trying to establish as a safe haven.",
        "But we did not have pitched battles at the doors of Kandahar, which is what we have every single day.",
        "And we did not have people, you know - even in Kandahar, which was their stronghold, people were really thrilled.",
        "Not maybe in as demonstrative a way as people were thrilled in Kabul when the Taliban fell, but they were really looking forward to the Karzai government backed with a really wide, you know, a kind of - it wasn't just the United States - but led by the United States international coalition.",
        "They felt like, my god, the nightmare's going to end.",
        "And it hasn't.",
        "Partly because of Pakistan's meddling and partly because of a decision to re-empower warlords and corrupt people in the new Afghan government, which was partly a U.S.",
        "decision which was then basically confirmed by the Karzai government, who at various stages could have removed these people and didn't."

        "And now - you know, this is what Jon Landay was talking about.",
        "The disenchantment with this government is such that people are starting to make room for these reentering Taliban, not for ideological reasons, not for anything to do with, you know, culture or religion or anything like that, but because this government is preying upon them, is beating them up and brutalizing them and extracting money from them.",
        "And because the Taliban, for example, were not corrupt when they were in government.",
        "They did not extract bribes at every transaction with an Afghan citizen.",
        "And because they performed a lot of the functions that a government ought to perform in a timely fashion, like, you know, administrative stuff.",

        "I was there a year ago, returning students who had been in the United States for a year of study, and saw that the infrastructure was just not being built.",
        "The schools were still UNICEF tents.",
        "Ten thousand students in a school built for 2,000 going to school three shifts a day.",
        "And in the summer months in Kabul, kids were getting sick from cholera.",
        "What's going on?",
        "What - I agree with the prior comments too, about the warlords and the - everywhere, the airport, every service that I saw was controlled by Pashtun ethnic people in Kabul, which ordinarily would not have been the case 30 years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer.",
        "Let's get to that question on education.",
        "Sarah Chayes, you first.",
        "Then Jonathan Landay.",
        "I actually think that infrastructure has been one of the success stories.",
        "So it's pretty depressing to hear that pointed out as what isn't working so well.",
        "Of everything that we were trying to do - we, the international community were trying to do in Afghanistan - you know, the one thing that did happen is some buildings got built and some roads eventually got paved and stuff like that.",
        "And it certainly took too long.",
        "But I found that what's even worse is when you inside a school and don't see any books and when you find out that the teachers are being paid $30 a month, and so they're not going to class.",
        "And you know, classes are being taught by class monitors instead of teachers.",
        "So unfortunately the metaphor I like to use is, you know, how does the body deliver oxygen to the muscles.",
        "It's not enough for the heart to beat.",
        "So we've had on the very high level money being appropriated, but you have to get that money out into the blood vessels and all the way to the capillaries, where, you know, one blood vessel lines up - I mean, sorry, blood cell lines up behind another and drops off its load of oxygen, and that has not been happening.",
        "Jonathan Landay, what's your impression?",
        "I would agree with that.",
        "Definitely there has been progress made in rebuilding schools and having kids go back to school.",
        "There is something like two million young girls going to school now, where during the Taliban they were banned from going back to school.",
        "But at the same time, there is a school being burnt on average by the Taliban every other day."

        "I met with teachers in a very rural part of Afghanistan last week, where I spent about 10 days - halfway between Kabul and Kandahar - and they haven't been paid in six months, and yet their salary does go to the provincial administration.",
        "And when they go to get their salary they complain that either they're not paid or the person who's supposed to give them their money demands part of their money in return for giving them the rest.",

        "Well, my notion is that you - the best way to make it easier for people not to grow opium is to make it profitable for them to grow other things.",
        "And it turns out that Kandahar, before it was famous for the Taliban, was famous for, you know, pomegranates - which are also hitting the news these days - and almonds and apricots and all that stuff, which is actually very valuable.",
        "The problem is that fresh fruit does need infrastructure to get out of where it's being grown, and that's not so great.",
        "You know, fresh fruit is heavy and perishable.",
        "So I thought if we transform it into something else and add value in the transformation process, you know - and so we make this absolutely gorgeous hand-molded soap which is now sold out in seven shops in the United States and Canada.",
        "And you know, I'm not saying that we in and of ourselves can beat opium.",
        "But I do think that a varied economy that includes a lot of processing of some of these really valuable agricultural products is the way to beat opium.",
        "And there's unfortunately very little money and attention really being put to things like this, although a lot of lip service is.",
        "We kept hearing - I'm afraid we just have a few seconds left - but we kept hearing about, you know, agriculture advisors going to, you know, provide advice on what else you could grow profitably.",

        "Rosa damascene makes rose oil, which is the base of all fine perfumes, and it's worth about $10 a milliliter, and it's indigenous, it turns out, to southern Afghanistan, but no one, you know, now there are a couple of rose oil projects, including ours.",
        "But you know, it took a number of years to get this going."
