        "Well, you know, first of all, I think the politics of them are difficult.",
        "You know, to start with, some of them were built not because we needed them but because political leaders wanted to appear tough on crime, and building a supermax prison was a sign of how tough you were on crime.",
        "Once you've got it built, and you're using it, expensive as it may be, there are powerful forces at work that make it hard to close them.",
        "You know, among them are the fact that many of them were built in small towns, and they're a prominent employer.",
        "The union often is against closing them down.",
        "You know, there's a lot of claims made for their effectiveness when there's not necessarily very much empirical proof, but those kinds of claims are made.",
        "And if you're a politician running for office, it's too easy to put ads on the television saying that you voted to close the prison that housed the worst of the worst, and a lot of people don't want to be painted in that way, and therefore as a political matter it's awfully difficult to close them once you've started them.",
        "Seven percent of the prisoners in federal penitentiaries, Laura Sullivan, are in supermax.",
        "That number is declining in some states, down to 1.4 percent in Mississippi.",
        "Yeah, there are a number of states - Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Mississippi, are all either doing away with one of their supermax prisons or downgrading it or trying to take as many inmates as they can out of it.",
        "There's - it's the beginning of a movement away from supermax.",
        "We're not seeing the sort of rush to build them that we saw 10 years ago or 15 years ago.",
        "It's beginning to shift, but it's still at the very beginning.",
        "Let's get another caller in, this is Jack, and Jack's on the line with us from Cleveland.",
        "Hi, yeah, I was in (unintelligible) correctional facility.",
        "It was not a supermax facility, but it was a maximum-security facility, and I was placed in what they call segregation, which was very similar to what you guys described.",
        "It was - I was in there for my own protection because I was in on a bad charge, and I feel like the guards foster a community of violence towards prisoners, and you can't do your time and you can't get out of prison without placing yourself at great risk.",
        "And the time I had in segregation was the only safe time I had in my time in jail.",
        "I mean, it's punishment, but I mean you need to be able to get out of it alive.",
        "And so in that respect you're grateful, but what kind of an experience was it otherwise?",
        "Otherwise it was basically a constant state of fear.",
        "Thankfully, my cellie, the cellies which I did have, I had about three of them, they were OK with me, but the second they would open up the doors for what they call range(ph) time, which would happen for about six hours every day, in which I was in the courtyard room without about 30 other inmates, was just absolute fear, because if they would get on you about whatever charge or whatever issue they had with you, or it could not even be about you charges, about the outside world, it could be about some internal politic in that range."

        "And I wanted to ask you, Laura Sullivan, about the lawsuit that was filed on behalf of mentally ill inmates at the federal supermax in Colorado, ADX Florence, earlier this week.",
        "And in the past these kinds of lawsuits have not progressed very far in federal court.",
        "No, there have been some lawsuits from inmates who would file on their own behalf, or they would - there were a few sporadic lawsuits.",
        "They never seem to go very far.",
        "But right now you have this lawsuit that you were just talking about in Colorado.",
        "You also have a lawsuit in California that has gained a lot of traction.",
        "I actually work in Schenectady, where I'm an administrative assistant for a company that does communication consulting and staffing, as well as staging corporate events and webcasts.",
        "It started off as a lawsuit by a number of inmates who had gone on a hunger strike in Pelican Bay.",
        "It has now been picked up by a nonprofit who has filed on their behalf, a very strong lawsuit with lot of experts and documentation, and it's going to be interesting to see how they go, because these lawsuits have gained a lot more traction than we've seen in the past.",
        "Let's see if we can get Leanne(ph) on the line, Leanne with us from San Francisco.",
        "Hi, yes.",
        "I was calling just to say that with maximum security, a lot of inmates will actually pretend to be mentally ill just to get in there to - it's called - oh gosh, I forget what it's called (unintelligible) to up their security level because they are at risk from their fellow inmates.",
        "And I think to help reduce that population - and I've worked at a number of institutions for a very long time in the state of California - is they need to quit overpaying a lot of underworked, lazy officers and redirect that money to programs that actually do go towards rehabilitating inmates.",
        "And they say that they do that, but frankly, they don't, and what should really happen too, a lot of times inmates will go in and with the revolving door, the rate of recidivism, it's just - it's off the board.",
        "And inmates, they'll go in for six months or eight months.",
        "They won't let them get into vocational training programs or educational to get their GED or anything like that because they aren't going to be in long enough.",

        "And Laura - sorry to interrupt, but Laura, I think she's right, those kinds of programs, not just in California, vastly reduced.",
        "The interesting thing that happened, and most experts will point out, that this idea of supermax facilities in California started at the same time that they began eliminating all the rehabilitation programs, all the education, all the extracurricular programs that kept inmates busy.",
        "When you took all of that away, you ended up with a pile of inmates with nothing to do all day long, and the gangs took its place.",
        "It became the activity.",
        "And so then they responded to that with supermax.",
        "But the problem was that when the inmates are either trying to come out of supermax or to send them back to regular population, there's no program to help them do that, and there's no programs really in most of California's facilities at this point.",
        "In Illinois this week, Governor Pat Quinn announced the closure of Tamms Correctional Center, the state's only supermax facility.",
        "George Welborn, Tamms' first warden, argued in an op-ed in the Newton Press Monitor that the closure could be disastrous.",

        "George Welborn, good of you to be with us today.",
        "You're more than welcome.",
        "And you wrote in that op-ed piece: Like it or not, Tamms has done exactly what it was intended to do, reduced violence.",
        "How does it do that?",
        "Well, the Illinois Department of Corrections had an epidemic of violence, late '70s, '80s, and through the early '90s.",
        "I worked at the Menard Correctional Center, I was the warden at Menard prior to coming to Tamms, and my last year at Tamms, we were on deadlock for 270 days due basically to gang violence.",
        "And at that time we simply did not have a resource to handle the most - and we all admit it's a very small proportion of inmates that cause the vast amount of problems.",
        "We at that time did not have a mechanism to isolate those relatively few troublemakers.",
        "We would send them from one maximum-security prison to another, and they would - they were just passing each other on the highway, virtually.",
        "Tamms gave up that opportunity, and it has reduced violence.",
        "It has reduced staff and inmate assaults, and it certainly - we don't see our prisons going on deadlock for 270 days anymore.",
        "Deadlock meaning shutdown, lockdown?"

        "Exactly, through violence, yes.",
        "You would put the entire two or three thousand inmate population on deadlock because of a few knuckleheads.",
        "And it costs $26 million a year to operate Tamms, as I understand it, and obviously Illinois is in a budget squeeze.",
        "Is that the reason it's being closed?",
        "Well, that's what it's portrayed at, but I think it's - this is a political decision.",
        "This is our governor's way to placate his base constituency in Chicago.",
        "Like all supermaxes, Tamms has been heavily litigated, and there are many organizations in Chicago who have tried and tried and tried to get Tamms shut down.",
        "I think the governor is simply using this as a political process.",
        "Yeah, it's going to save $26 million a year, but at what cost?",
        "If our maximum-security prisons couldn't handle these type of inmates 10 or 12 years ago, what does the governor think - why does he now think that they can?",
        "And what's going to happen to the prisoners who are in Tamms now when it's closed down?",
        "They are going to Pontiac Correctional Center and Menard Correctional Center, both of which are terribly overcrowded now.",
        "It's a fear among staff at those prisons.",
        "It truly is.",
        "As I said, Tamms was the mechanism to isolate those people - again, those relatively few people - who caused the vast amount of problems, staff should be afraid of (unintelligible).",

        "Oh, I think it does.",
        "And I don't question the judgment that there are violent inmates or dangerous inmates who need to be isolated from the general population from other inmates.",
        "I think there definitely are.",
        "I think, you know, how many you've got in a particular system is not easy to know, but it's important to try to determine it carefully.",
        "And I agree with the warden that separating those inmates from other inmates is important to allow for order and control in the institutions.",
        "One thing I'd say is, you know, I think there's great variation amongst the states.",
        "Illinois and California are not Wisconsin and are not Kansas, and so this variation in the behavioral problems that are presented in institutions and therefore variations in what numbers of closed custody cells you need and how are those are most widely - wisely used.",
        "The other thing I'd say, you know, is the point about, you know, they don't have to be brutal and terrible where all that happens is that suffering is inflicted on people.",
        "A well-run, professionally run institution, supermax or otherwise shouldn't be engaging in that.",
        "I'm not suggesting that Tamms or any other one was.",
