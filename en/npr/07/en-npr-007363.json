        "They want to go to segregation.",
        "As soon as they get in, they already know about it.",
        "That gains them all kinds of credit inside the prison walls.",
        "As soon as they get out, they have much more respect than what they would have if they, you know, just would have been in a normal housing authority.",
        "George Welborn, is that right that some inmates think it's cool to go to supermax?",
        "Well, I certainly didn't find that.",
        "No, I didn't have - we didn't have any inmates in Illinois lining up to go to supermax.",
        "And, Austin, what do you for a - during your time, during your day there at the supermax?",
        "I take care of any kind of shakedowns or emergency situations or inmate-on-inmate fights or any - your day-to-day serious things.",
        "That's interesting but dangerous work.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it - I guess, I'm going to retract my comments to say it's not cool.",
        "But if you want to survive and you're 20, 21 years old, that's how you're going to - in my opinion, that's how you're going to do it.",

        "And, Laura Sullivan, these lawsuits, the budget pressure on many states and indeed on the federal government too, is there any - as we look at the trend, do you think that this is going to be swinging back the other way?",
        "Well, it costs about $60,000 more per inmate per year to put an inmate into solitary confinement or supermax compared to general population.",
        "So there's a huge argument that you could spend that money on programs and rehabilitation and education and take an inmate who would have joined a gang or would have caused problems and instead redirect that inmate with that money into something more positive that they could do later on for society when they get out of prison.",
        "So that seems to be the direction that we're headed now and - but, you know, it depends on the crime trends.",
