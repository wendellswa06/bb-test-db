        "And they can put a program right in place, eFitness was one of the websites that I was really impressed with; being able to track my statistics daily, getting a birds eye view of my monthly fitness plan.",
        "And one of the things that I really liked is that, you know when you're trying to do your fitness, sometimes you just don't stick to your plan like you've planned to do, and you need to do that emergency cheating, if you will, on some food and stop at fast food?",
        "They even have some of that covered in some of these tools, to account for that, if in fact that happens to you in your daily routine.",
        "(Laughs) Hmm, has it happened to me?",
        "Oh, no, never!",
        "Never!",
        "What about things like PDA's, things that you can carry around that, you know, it's a lot easier than carrying around a whole computer.",
        "Do they have programs?",
        "They have tons of programs, over 1,000 I've found at Palm.com, which is the leading device out there for personal digital assistants, which are PDA's.",
        "And some of the hottest ones was My Workout Tracker, and it was really interesting.",
        "But I've even seen, like, for instance Weight Watchers, being able to create programs, software, that runs on these PDA's.",
        "So you can track your points; you can track when you're going, say, to the grocery store and you're looking up particular vegetable or something to eat; you can find out exactly how many points you have.",
        "You can monitor your points and your progress throughout your day; for your morning meal, your midday meal, your evening meal, and then it can synch up--the beauty of having a PDA running a program that tracks your fitness campaign, is that you can then synch that up to your computer and print out the results.",
        "And that can help you really identify trends, identify your weaknesses, and really, the proof is in that paper when you see it right there in front of you.",
        "And of course there's Weight Watchers online, which I guess does some of these similar things on the computer.",
        "But how much do these programs cost?",
        "There's, we're talking in some ways about some of them are subscription based services and some of them are software…what are the price ranges?",
        "Yeah, I've seen everything from $9.00 for a 13-week program to have your online profile, to give you your calendar, your actual workout program, even give you access to a virtual trainer that can coach you along the way if you have questions--all the way over to $99.00 for a year program.",
        "So, some of these things aren't expensive.",
        "Now on the handheld--those are online tools, on the actual handheld--these are one-time purchases of software that you will keep.",
        "And that's ranged from $19.00 to about $30.00, depending on the features of that software program.",
        "But the thing that I've noticed that most folks are having the most success with--let's take for example a person that is in Weight Watchers' program and simply just follows the point system and follows that program the way you're supposed to, versus another member of Weight Watchers that does the same thing but uses the assistance of an online support group.",
        "We've seen an increasing amount of progress and success in those folks that have also decided to take the extra step and reach out for support online.",
        "To share like stories, like experiences, and like tips, and tricks to stay on focus.",
        "It sounds like there are plenty of good tools for me to use and I'm actually going to try some out.",
        "So, stay tuned for further fitness challenge moments."

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, essentially, people don't want things taken away from them that they feel they've already been given.",
        "Is that what the Republicans are facing right now?",
        "That's certainly a big part of it.",
        "So when you're looking at market democracies, when you do try to shrink a program, when you try to change how a program works, the only way you could really successfully do it is by saying, look, we're going to take the most vulnerable people, and we are going to protect their interests while we're going to change the program to make it more cost effective to make it more sustainable over time.",
        "That's still not always easy, but that's a message that can succeed.",
        "If, however, you have a muddled message, if it seems like you're planning on having some retrenchment of a program for no good reason, you're not articulating a good and compelling reason to do it.",
        "That tends to be much, much worse.",
        "There is a paradox.",
        "The Affordable Care Act has become popular, as we mentioned, but in the same polls when you ask people about Obamacare, they say that they don't like it.",
        "Now that Obama is out of office, are people paying more attention to the actual policy and its effect on their lives?",
        "Well, what I'd say is that earlier on, I pointed out to the fact that if you look at surveys, you find that people say that the federal government should insure universal coverage.",
        "Now, of course, there are lots of ways to go about doing that.",
        "As for Obamacare in particular, it certainly has created some constituencies.",
        "But are there ways to change the law that would be broadly popular?",

        "But to do that, you'd really need to have a coherent, unified critique of Obamacare.",

        "People have criticized it for all kinds of reasons that are oftentimes somewhat contradictory.",
        "And that means that you don't have a kind of common narrative about, what's the problem here that we're trying to solve?",

        "Both of these legislative proposals aren't actually repeals of Obamacare.",

        "You'll find a lot of people on the right, you know, for the last 20 years, who would have said, sure, you might need premium subsidies, you might need sliding scale subsidies, et cetera.",

        "They can't really do all of what they'd want to do.",
