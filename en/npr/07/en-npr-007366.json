        "So on the Republican side, John McCain received Mitt Romney's endorsement late last week.",
        "And this morning, the first President Bush, H.W., endorsed McCain.",
        "So the former president had a few words for folks who'd been attacking McCain's record.",
        "If you've been around the track, you hear these criticisms.",
        "And I think they are grossly unfair.",
        "He's got a record that everybody can analyze in the Senate, a sound, conservative record.",
        "And yet he's not above reaching out to the other side.",
        "So I hear criticisms, and Barbara knows, I get a little bit annoyed about them, frankly.",
        "President George H.W.",
        "Bush wasn't a favorite among conservative voters, Ron.",
        "So how much does this endorsement really help Senator McCain among that group of voters?",
        "It's not as though Ronald Reagan had returned from the dead to deliver his own endorsement of John McCain, but it's all good.",
        "It's Presidents' Day.",
        "You want to line up some people who have presidential credibility, and you want to say John McCain is going to be in the pantheon of Republican presidents.",
        "It's interesting that Jeb Bush, the other son of H.W.",
        "Bush has been mentioned as a someday presidential candidate, had already come out for John McCain.",
        "And I think we've heard enough support from George W.",
        "Bush, the current president, that we can pretty much assume that as soon as it's official and he has - John McCain has enough delegates to be nominated, the White House Bush current will also get on the band wagon.",
        "David Shoemaker is a physicist at MIT who studies gravitational waves.",
        "Those are ripples in the fabric of space-time that are created when something big in the universe goes boom.",
        "His phone had buzzed because some of those waves had been picked up by two giant detectors.",
        "What's more, just as the waves arrived, an orbiting NASA satellite saw a pulse of high-energy light.",
        "And that put us into a very high state of excitement."

        "It just felt - to me at the time, I was like, this is almost too easy.",
        "It was, like, almost too perfect.",
        "The little circle of light started out bright and blue.",
        "Over the next few days, it faded and became redder as scientists around the world watched with awe.",
        "What they were seeing was the fiery collision of two neutron stars 130 million light-years away.",
        "Neutron stars are stars but weird ones.",
        "Each one is about the size of a city like Boston or New York or Seattle but weighing more than the mass of the sun.",
        "Edo Berger is an astrophysicist at Harvard.",
        "He says when two circling neutron stars finally collide, they're going fast - about a third of the speed of light.",
        "So it's this amazing, powerful head-on collision between these two extremely dense objects, I think one of the most extreme events one could imagine in space.",
        "And it used to be that imagining was all anyone could do.",
        "Daniel Kasen is a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley.",
        "He spent years thinking about colliding neutron stars, so watching this unfold was uncanny.",
        "Even though this was an event that had never been seen before in human history, what it looked like was, you know, deeply familiar because it resembled very closely to the predictions that we had been making.",
        "And seeing this solved a longstanding mystery in astrophysics.",
        "Where do heavy elements like gold and platinum come from?",
        "Kasen says this neutron star collision created a cloud of radioactive waste the size of our solar system filled with an astonishing haul of precious metal.",
        "We estimate that there's maybe, you know, upwards of 200 Earth masses of pure gold in this cloud and probably even more platinum - maybe 500 Earth masses worth.",
        "Today, major science journals published a bunch of reports on all these observations authored by more than 3,000 researchers.",
        "One of them is Peter Saulson of Syracuse University."

        "Afraid to leave why?",
        "Afraid to leave because their homes will be left unattended, because the few things that survived could be taken away by looters, they suspect.",
        "But also there's just a general sense of mistrust and suspicion of authority in neighborhoods like that in New Orleans, which have had a sense of isolation for a long time, geographical and cultural.",
        "Now the people who are staying behind--how are they surviving?",
        "Are they sitting in rooms full of water and how are they getting food?",
