        "I do think there's a bit of projection going on here.",
        "The recent Rolling Stone cover story seem to me to be a vast literary Rorschach blot in which the author projected onto Pope Francis everything that he wanted to see in the Catholic Church, some of which may be arguably true in terms of changes of style and method of proclaiming the truth of the gospel.",
        "But the idea that Pope Francis is somehow 180 degrees different from his two papal predecessors is really quite silly.",
        "The Catholic Church doesn't work that way.",
        "Well, I think the past two or three popes have said they love people who might be gay but the church doesn't accept their orientation.",
        "So, when Francis says - and I'll quote - \"\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord\"\" - by the way, he says gay and not homosexual, which is also significant to me - \"\"and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?",
        "Now, isn't that significantly different from anything John Paul or Benedict says?",
        "No.",
        "Actually, it's what every good pastor would say to a person experiencing same-sex attraction who's trying to lead a life of chastity and integrity, which is the case that was posed to the pope.",
        "He wasn't asked to make a generic comment on the human condition.",
        "He was asked about a specific circumstance.",
        "In fact, he was asked about suppose there is a priest in the Vatican who says I'm gay; I'm trying to lead a life of integrity and chastity, and the pope said in that circumstance who am I to judge?",
        "So, the notion that Pope Francis was expressing some radical change in the church's view of gay people is just not true.",
        "Do you look at Pope Francis' record so far and see someone who was sensitive to the public opinion polls that come up in country after country?",
        "I don't think in the sense that we would understand that in American political terms, Scott.",
        "I think the pope is deeply aware of the fact that the people of the church don't often understand why the church says the things it does, teaches the things it must.",
        "And he wants to help that understanding.",
        "He wants people to understand that they are welcome in the Catholic Church to pursue their questions but that the church's settled understanding of certain matters is a settled understanding.",
        "And the church believes that those understandings lead to human happiness.",
        "I'm going to try to fill in a blank here.",
        "I think one of the reasons, maybe even the prime reason, why people who call themselves church liberals, reformers, people who called themselves church conservatives, both share an admiration and affection for this pope is a sense that he is holy, that this is man who lives by his holy convictions and wants the church to do that."
