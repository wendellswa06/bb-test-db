        "Yeah.",
        "Well, mac and cheese is kind of, obviously, you know, it's a classic dish back home, as well.",

        "And you point out in your book, mac and cheese if you have it every once and a while is fine.",
        "No.",
        "I don't think - there's - no one wants to be involved in a food Nazi, you know, and certainly the inspiration behind one of my other projects which was the \"\"Food Revolution\"\" that was on ABC last year, was basically, you know, the health statistics are terrible, you know, and in my country and yours.",
        "And it seems that government is slower than ever to respond.",
        "You know, there's many effective ways they can make change, and it's just really not happening.",
        "So the food revolution really was the kind of about what we feed our kids on 180 days of the year at school, you know, and how we educate them in sort of how to shop, how to look after themselves, and just basic kind of life skills, really.",
        "So that's a massive passion of mine.",
        "I mean, it's something that I've been doing for seven years now in England and in America.",

        "And there are recipes for rich dishes in this book.",
        "But there are also recipes for a lot of salads.",
