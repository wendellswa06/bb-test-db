        "It has its greatest utility in people who are having symptoms.",
        "The stress test is often useful in seeing whether they have obstruction in the coronary arteries at that time.",
        "The stress test isn't terribly useful at looking for the presence of plaques - that is, narrowing in the arteries.",
        "That is not of sufficient severity to interfere with blood flow at that point in time.",
        "Is there typically any symptomatic pain or discomfort that would precede a heart attack by a few hours, say, that might be a warning sign?",
        "Well, of course, in Mr. Russert's case, we will never know.",
