        "Well, I'm sure Glenn can speak for himself.",
        "What I heard, was, though, that we underestimated what we're getting into.",
        "Remember, Rumsfeld gave the idea that we would be greeted with citizens waving flags and welcoming... We've been greeted with bombs instead.",
        "I think this points at the problem that we're going to continue to have there, and that is--you're going to have a problem of trying to have who's going to govern this very, very divided nation.",
        "And Glenn is right.",
        "You can't manage that from Washington, and we're in a much more complicated situation than we realize, and this is just the beginning of it.",
        "Let me come back to you to be fair, Glenn.",
        "Did I put words in your mouth?",
        "Or did I understand you correctly?",
        "Well, no. I'm not saying we're the ones who blew up the mosque or anything like that, and I agree that al-Qaeda's probably in there, but we created that.",
        "We stirred a hornet's nest over there is what I'm saying, and I'm saying we're in deep doo-doo.",
        "Tara, let me ask you, all of you, actually, but to begin with Tara: What do you think the U.S.",
        "response, militarily, should be?",
        "So far there hasn't been one.",
        "Should there and can there be one that could be effective in this?",
        "Well, I think the U.S.",
        "military response needs to continue to be one of assistance to the Iraqi troops over there.",
        "This is something that United States cannot manage.",
        "It is something that is going on within that country, and this morning, the Special Forces captured one of the top al-Qaeda leaders over there in Iraqi--he's one of the number one bomb makers.",
        "The Special Forces made that capture and killed him--actually, they killed him, excuse me--this morning.",
        "So the U.S.",
        "forces in a more of a shadow capacity are doing their jobs as far rooting out these individuals.",
        "But something else that needs to be understood is that the Sunni tribal leaders in al-Anbar province have begin to turn against the foreign fighters that are infiltrating the insurgency there because they realize that this is beginning to wreak havoc over there, and it's not to their benefit, and the assassination of a local Sunni tribal leader was the impetus for this turnabout, but they're going to realize that the al-Qaeda foreign fighters that are coming in and fueling this insurgency is not to the benefit of anyone over there, and hopefully cooler heads will prevail.",
        "Glenn and...",
        "I think we have to be careful when we hear these reports about capture, or our capturing top leaders.",
        "I mean, how many do they have?",
        "You remember, I was in Dohar(ph) Cutter(ph) at the beginning of the war, and I remember they brought over these cards that we found the King of Spades, we found the Ace of Diamonds and saying, oh, we've gotten basically the top leadership, and then what happens?",
        "Another whole cadre comes up and replaces them.",
        "First of all, I don't think they, obviously, have gotten all the top ones.",
        "We're still talking about trying to find Osama bin Missing, and you know, so I really don't give much credence to this report that we just got another top leader when there's actually... So what If you do, you still don't see a basic change in the war.",
        "So Glenn, what about this U.S.",
        "response, militarily, before we go on to another topic?",
        "It seems to me that there must be some role that the U.S.",
        "must figure out how to play, militarily, in this.",
        "I don't know.",
        "I don't know how... I mean, we can try to support the government in its effort to maintain basic security--and I assume there are some clandestine operations ongoing--but should this situation overflow into generally broadly encountered violence across the country between Shiite and Sunni, I don't that there is a military solution to that situation.",
        "We're not going to get involved in that civil war."

        "A lot going on there this week.",
        "The White House issued its report, 125 recommendation on what to do right the next time a hurricane hits, hopefully one the size of Katrina will not come.",
        "Also, there's quite a bit of controversy surrounding the upcoming mayoral election in April between Ray Nagin and now the Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu.",
        "Let's start talking about the White House report and the recommendations because in June, I guess, the next hurricane season hits.",

        "All of that's true.",
        "I just might add, about the New Orleans' situation, though, I think a great experiment is unfolding there.",
        "I mean, many cities might wish that they could have a massive--the city fathers, I should say--evacuation of their poor.",
        "New Orleans has actually experienced that, and it's going to tell us a lot, not only about the city, but about the country.",
        "The extent to which those people who were dispossessed and who don't have any claim in the city are able to - if they are--reestablish a voice and a place at the table and the future of the city.",
        "Let me just let the audience know that, in fact, we're going to be hearing from Louisiana Congressman William Jefferson a little bit later in this program on that very subject.",
        "But back to the report and its ramifications for New Orleans.",
        "George, what do you see?",
        "Well, I mean, the problem with these reports are they're written, they're well thought out, but they're poorly implemented.",
        "I mean, there were reports--I remember reading at least two--prior to Katrina, which not only predicted that this could happen, a disaster could happen, but also had plans for removing the poor out of the city.",
        "Written plans they had already in place, but they weren't implemented.",
        "So if you want to have these reports and report after report--and the local newspaper there had also done a series talking about the problem with the levies--if we're going to not do anything about it, it really doesn't matter.",
        "I've kind of sick of seeing all these reports and they're not really acted upon, so if this is going to join the other shelf of reports we've had before and don't have proper follow-up, it doesn't do any good.",
        "What about that, Tara.",

        "And the House report pointed out, and it was the first report done, and I think these reports are necessary in an investigative capacity to come up with plans and solutions on how to avoid it.",
        "You know, that's why I think that the Democrat leadership called for an independent commission and then that becomes a waste of paper because we didn't have, we don't have all this time to go through two years of reports, like it took the September 11 commission, to come out with a report.",

        "Well, I mean, he has about, last count, 10 or 11 opponents, so, with Landrieu of course being the major on.",

        "You're seeing rural legislators saying this is a power grab, you know, all the concentration has been in New Orleans, now we can shift it to the rural lawmakers.",

        "So it's going to be a real scramble but I really don't think the thing is well for the Nagin at all.",
        "Let me ask you, Glenn Loury, because as I read some of the comments that Mitch Landrieu made on his announcement that he was running for office, I'm wondering, are these code words for something else?",
        "For example, he says, he promised to \"\"change the DNA of government.\"\" Here's another one, he says, if we're going to succeed in the 21st century economy, we have to have the brains, we have to be smart.",

        "Probably.",
        "I mean, I don't want to accuse Landrieu of racism or anything like that.",
        "But of course, there's a subtext here of competency which is related to race.",
        "This whole unfolding tragic, profound event down there has been a big kind of dramatic stage on which we've been acting out different kind of racial stuff.",
        "So yeah, the Mayor, he came out, he said we'll be a chocolate city again.",
