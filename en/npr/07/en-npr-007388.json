        "Thank you, Michele.",
        "Why did you decide to write this story?",
        "Well, I've been hearing things kind of over the transom about some of the difficulties campaign volunteers of Obama were having in the field.",
        "And I went and kind of explored that, confirmed some of those incidents, things like signs being burned along a parade route during a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Scranton, phone bankers hearing caustic responses like, you know, hang that darky from a tree, when they're making calls.",
        "And so I thought that it was worth doing a larger story, and I just gathered more material.",
        "How did you know if these incidents weren't just pranksters on the other end or if it actually represented some sort of trend or way of thinking?",
        "There were just so many of them, I mean from so many different places.",
        "I mean high school students being called the common racial slur for African-Americans holding signs, people getting doors slammed in their faces.",
        "There were expressions of the kind of raw racism that many of them had not confronted before and I think they wanted to talk about it.",
        "And yet with all the coverage of the campaign, these stories really have not been talked about.",
        "This - your story was somewhat surprising to many readers because we haven't heard these stories, these kinds of things.",
        "Well, I think in part that's because there has been so much euphoria and excitement around Obama's candidacy.",
        "I think also the nature of campaign coverage, it centers on events, rallies, really you have to kind of just be on the ground and, you know, hanging out at the bar at Applebee's in small towns, going places where you're not doing anything but just listening to people.",
        "But it really it was lying in plain sight.",
        "The campaign office was vandalized in Indiana, and it was really ugly stuff spray-painted all over the walls, a flag was stolen, a plate glass window was smashed, and the campaign decides not to make too much of this, even though someone involved with the campaign said, hey, we need to report this.",
        "But the campaign stepped in and said, no, no, no, no, we want to keep this low.",
        "Why does the campaign try to keep these incidents sort of under the radar?",
        "Well, because I think that they feel that the broader message that Senator Obama is trying to communicate is one where we need to bridge divisions.",
        "But I think, you know, also there's a political component to it.",
        "I mean, he has tried to present himself as someone who should not just be looked at through the prism of race.",

        "Well, I guess it is the new thing.",
        "Earlier in the week, Barack Obama did the same exact thing; of course it means that you don't have to answer questions at a news conference, and that's very helpful.",
        "I think in Mrs. Clinton's case, it allowed her to do something very effective.",
        "It was an extremely cozy setting.",

        "Republicans have intimated that they will let all the tax cuts expire before they let these tax cuts that we're talking about - for the wealthy - expire.",

        "I don't think that's the best step to take for the current circumstance that our economy is in right now, but sure, I would vote for that if that was the only choice in front of me."
