        "And so, if what you want to accomplish - which, you know, President Obama and many Democrats want to accomplish - is to get people spending money, then you want the tax cut to go to poorer people.",
        "Right.",
        "Because if you're giving it to people who can't even pay their bills, they'll at least pay their bills.",
        "And if you give it to people with a cushion, like the rich, well, they just might sock it away.",
        "Exactly.",

        "So what about that?",
        "So - exactly, Mike, but that's a longer-term issue.",
        "That's not a short-term - you know - this-year, next-year problem.",
        "That's a five-year, 10-year, 20-year, 40-year.",
        "In that case, when it comes to taxes, it does seem, you know, based on economic history, that higher taxes on rich people, higher taxes on small-business owners does tend to suppress entrepreneurial activity.",
        "So that would argue in favor of giving the tax cut to the rich.",
        "But there's another problem that we have right now, which is massive deficits.",
        "Right.",
        "So if we don't raise enough taxes to lower the deficit, then that can also stifle growth.",
        "So this, you know, is fueled by a century of intense intellectual battles.",
        "I would guess that even 10 years from now, even 20 years from now, it will be hard to look back at the data and piece out what was the impact of taxation.",
        "This is simply not a big enough move that it's really clear.",
        "Well, speaking of piece out - peace out.",
