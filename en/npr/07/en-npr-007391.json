        "I think what's puzzling about that is the three stars.",
        "I'm not an expert on American - the American presidential system or politics, but I kind of wonder what the three stars signify.",
        "There are two key rules on any kind of high profile logo design, and that is to keep it simple and to make sure that it works on bumper stickers or placards or badges.",
        "It's got to make - it's got to get across to the audience as quickly and as effectively as possible.",
