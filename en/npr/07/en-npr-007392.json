        "So, on Christmas Day 2009, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was about two or three hundred members.",
        "Now, after three years of bombing raids, the group has more than tripled to well over a thousand.",
        "And as events earlier this spring, when we saw al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula attempt to put a second underwear bomb on a plane bound for the United States, the organization continues to be very determined to hit at the United States."

        "And in his explanation, that's why al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, this group in Yemen, has grown so big so fast.",

        "is actually closing down the amount of space that local clerics, that tribesmen in Yemen have, to stand up and confront al-Qaida and say, look, what it is that you're doing, what it is that you're arguing has no place within Islam.",
        "And in fact, we have seen some clerics do this in Yemen.",
        "There was a case just a few months ago where an anti-al-Qaida cleric was standing up, was lecturing in the mosque that these suicide bombings were a travesty, that they were crimes.",

        "What the White House is doing is they are literally having conference calls, strategy meetings, behind-the-scenes arm-twisting, if you will, to reassure conservatives that she is, in fact, a true conservative and that she will, in fact, be a person on the bench that will not legislate from the bench.",
        "And so what you see, literally, is a White House not necessarily in panic mode, but certainly there's a heightened sense of awareness, if you will, for the need to make sure that conservatives realize that Ms. Miers is a true, bonafide conservative.",
