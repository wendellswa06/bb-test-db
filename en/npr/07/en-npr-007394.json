        "You know, as you know, John, relationships between presidents and secretary of states have varied.",
        "You know, John Kerry is someone who supported President Obama in 2008.",
        "It was, you know, striking that he did that because of his relationship with the Clintons, but he also was one who brought Obama to the Democratic Convention in 2004 to give his famous - Obama's famous speech, blue-red.",
        "I mention that only because, well, he's not in the inner circle.",
        "He is close to President Obama, and I think he's someone who has the ear of so many around the world and has informed himself as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
        "And he's a listener.",
        "And I think he has the gravitas to come forward and say, for example, that we must find a way out of Afghanistan.",
        "A very contested issue this will be, it seems to me, in the next year as our exit looms forward in 2014.",
        "I also think he could play a critical role in rebalancing international policy because the militarization of U.S.",
        "foreign policy, which is a question I raised in The Washington Post column, one that should be posed to a secretary of state nominee is how can the State Department reclaim from the military its proper role as leader of U.S.",
        "policy abroad?",
        "But Katrina, to narrow on this point that you're making earlier about Kerry taking a different role, when the senators are asking questions of Kerry as the nominee, are - what are they asking?",
        "Are they asking Kerry what he thinks?",
        "Or are they asking Kerry what Barack Obama thinks?",
        "They are asking both, but over - again, I think it's an opportunity in the hearing to probe the administration's foreign policy priorities, and in that, to see if there is some evidence on the part of a nominee for the position of secretary of state, some difference this nominee may have with what has been the administration's priorities.",
        "Now, John Kerry is a very cautious man.",
        "And I think that may be difficult to see, but he is someone who has spent a lot of time in the Middle East.",
        "And it would be very interesting, for example, to know how he sees the efforts to rebuild an Israeli-Palestinian peace process, how he sees relationships with new countries emerging in the Arab world, countries no longer the authoritarian governments of the last four decades.",
        "He's a man of great experience and someone who, I think, also understands an issue that has been too off the radar is the nuclear peril.",
        "We live in a post-Cold War world, and we've lost sight of that issue.",
        "Speaking from the Muskogee, Coburn says doing so may have made him the proverbial skunk at the picnic.",
        "But it also kept Congress from sweeping all the spending bills into an omnibus.",
        "But all of this, I have to say, John, comes back to probing the administration's foreign policy, national security priorities but also raising a question of how John Kerry sees what might be called a new internationalism because we've lived in this kind of war on terror, post-9/11 moment for a long time now, for almost a generation.",
        "Maybe that's overstated, but is there a new internationalism that is consistent with the administration's vision of rebuilding an investment at home, a new internationalism that rejects the tendency to measure our nation's strength by our capacity to destroy?",
        "Let's go to Richard in Palo Alto, California.",
        "And we're asking our listeners to call in with what questions they think should be put to secretary of state nominee John Kerry.",

        "I'm interested - I would be interested in Senator Kerry's take on what policy the administration would pursue to deal with the problem of a failed states, and obviously, the problem of terrorism, you know, finding a comfortable home there, places like, Mali, the Congo, Somalia.",
        "Richard, I want to ask you this because Katrina is, I think, somewhat making the point.",
        "I think Katrina is actually saying that we don't know the answers to a lot of these things, that there's a lack of articulation on the part of the administration.",
        "We don't know what their answer would be to that question, so asking Kerry might be a chance to answer.",
        "Do you have that sense that you don't know what the approach would be to a failed state?",
        "Well, I certainly don't know.",
        "It may be that there's a coherent, consistent policy or it may be that they're dealing with it ad hoc.",

        "Katrina?",
        "And that's not necessarily a...",
        "I think you're caller is right that it isn't clear because this administration has veered, in a sense, between trying to build multilateral approaches, trying to work through the United Nations, but at other times, working more unilaterally and not really working to build responsible regional powers capable of establishing order or the development of true international collective security arrangements.",
        "So the U.S.",
        "has been called on or has stepped in to, quote, \"\"bear the burden of order keeping\"\" in many of these areas, and I think that is a major issue as to what the, quote, \"\"footprint\"\" of the United States will be in very troubled areas, whether it's in the Middle East, in Northern Africa and in dealing with what your caller rightly refers to as failed-state situations.",
        "I mean, we're witnessing this civil war in Syria unraveling and what will follow.",
        "So these are issues as to how to construct the U.S.",
        "relationship with other countries, with other regional powers, with international institutions.",
        "But also, I come back again to the militarization of our foreign policy.",
        "Perhaps that is something that a secretary of state could begin to address because we've - we have a military budget that is larger than it was during the height of the Cold War under Ronald Reagan, and so many of the critical issues our country faces today call not for military responses - bombs and bases - but for international collective efforts.",
        "And I think that's where a secretary of state with a vision of a new internationalism could play a serious role.",
        "Katrina, you have complimented John Kerry already in this conversation as a serious man and a man who has a profile overseas.",
        "I want to ask you this about the seriousness of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in addressing the kinds of issues you're talking about.",
        "And I go back to the third presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, which was meant to be in foreign policy, and how quickly they veered - in that conversation, they veered back to domestic conversations as though the umbrella topic of foreign policy was left behind.",
        "That, you know, I'm suggesting that we have a collection of leaders who are much more comfortable talking about domestic issues in domestic terms than foreign policy issues."

        "And I also raise hope in a sense that at this time of, you know, the need for global economic recovery, you know, that too is something that we're grappling with at home, this massive unemployment in the United States in recession, in Europe and Japan and the risk of yet more difficult trade policies from China require new international policies from the U.S., but that too also begins at home...",

        "I'm paraphrasing.",
        "And I think he could shed fresh eyes on Afghanistan and the question of why not begin our exit more quickly.",
        "I'm concerned in a certain way because in the 2009 debates inside the administration, it's reported that John Kerry did not play a key role in raising tough questions about our counterinsurgency strategy which Vice President Biden did.",
        "But the - we will witness a battle in this country, no question, beginning next year as many try to say we cannot leave Afghanistan because it will endanger our national security.",
        "And I think John Kerry has an opportunity, as do many others, to say that the continued waste of lives and billions on the senseless war does not contribute to our national security, and we will be far better off using economic development and other such measures to ensure that Afghanistan and its people are not victimized by our departure.",
        "I will say that as Kerry has played a role in these last few years, as I said earlier, it's almost like this, you know, informal, unofficial ambassador to Afghanistan and to Pakistan."
