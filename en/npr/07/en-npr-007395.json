        "New Haven was afraid of a Title VII suit being brought by the African-American firefighters, so they scuttled all the test results.",
        "Then a lawsuit was brought by the white and one Hispanic firefighters who did well on the exam essentially saying this was discrimination on the basis of race any way you sliced it.",
        "The district court in New Haven said - they threw out the lawsuit.",
        "The Second Circuit Court of Appeals, a panel on which Sotomayor sat, agreed with the district court that the firefighters just didn't have a claim here, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear it.",
        "Is discrimination against white firefighters the same as discrimination against black firefighters, and for all sorts of complicated reasons, it really resonates with the conversation we're having about race in this country right now."

        "As we read about this record Arctic ice melt, is this a coincidence?",

        "That heat does go into the ocean, that warms the ocean.",
        "What's going to happen when the ice starts to freeze up again - which it will this fall - is all that heat, a lot of that heat has to come out of the ocean before the ocean temperature gets to the freezing point again and can freeze.",

        "Just today, Shell oil announced that it had to pull out of its oil drilling, which just despite it started yesterday in the Arctic Ocean, you know, in the Chukchi Sea because they had discovered that there was a 30-mile long iceberg heading towards them.",
        "And they had to get out of the way.",
        "So even on - even in periods where there's a lot of ocean water that's just plain open, ice is still a hazard up there, and it will be for decades to come.",
        "And as this trend continues, you said, globally, is it true in Antarctic as well?",
        "There's a lot of ice in the ocean that's around the Antarctic continent?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a little more complicated in Antarctica because what happens is, for one thing, the southern ocean around Antarctica is warming up.",
        "There's a - the temperature measurements have been - are clear on that.",
        "But what happens around as a result of that is you had to put more precipitation.",
        "So you actually have expanding sea ice around Antarctica, at least in the wintertime.",
        "In the summertime, it all melts away or almost all of it melts away.",
        "And it has for a long time because it's a very different situation from this closed bowl of an ocean in the Arctic where the ice can pile up and get thicker and thicker.",

        "It always has melted away.",

        "And in the summertime, it melts away pretty much every year.",
        "In getting back to the northern region, the Arctic, is - scientists had long feared that if this trend continues, there will come a summer where there's no ice at all.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think people are starting to back away from that a little bit because there are enough little pockets where you could get some ice accumulating every summer and not melting out because, basically, you have the wind that pushes that together and piles it up.",
        "So you have always have a few places where it's piled up.",
        "But on the other hand, that will be a fairly small part of the Arctic, quite a small bit.",
        "So it's not - so for practical purposes, the ocean will look ice-free, and the North Pole may be sort of in a large area of no ice at all.",
        "Occasionally, right now, there are cracks and there are openings that drift around.",
