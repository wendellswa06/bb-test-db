        "Yes, and that's a very different situation because the ice sitting on the ocean, when it melts, it doesn't change sea level.",
        "If you think of a glass of ice tea and you put your ice cubes in the ice tea, when the ice melts, your ice tea, obviously, doesn't overflow.",
        "The ice just - it...",
        "There's quite a difference in volume, but not big enough.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It basically doesn't - but the melting ice that's floating doesn't matter, but what - but a lot of the ice sitting on Greenland and on Antarctic, the continent of Antarctica, when that ice melts, that does, in fact, add water to the sea.",
        "And those are in the long term, likely to drive the sea level rise and could drive the sea level rise by a great deal in the coming decades and centuries.",
        "So is anomalous - I mean, is this - as you said, it's definitely part of a trend.",
        "There's no way to argue with it anymore, about the warming and that it's having real effects.",
        "How is it going faster than people feared?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think if you talk to those scientists who've done the computer models and are projecting how quickly things will happen, a lot of those models will say that the ice could be largely gone by 2030, 2040, 2050.",
        "But they say, what we're actually seeing is outracing those computerized trends.",
        "So the computers in this case are giving an optimistic picture, compared to what we're seeing in real life here.",
        "So, yes, this is a real eye-opening event for people.",
        "And that suggests to people in this country, as they look around to the weather that we've been experiencing these past couple of summers, that they better get used to it.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think - I mean, there are still obviously a lot of skepticism in this country about whether a global warming is real or not, or whether it's - at least whether it's caused by human activities.",
        "Scientists don't argue that point by and large anymore, but I think a lot of people in the public do.",
        "But I think it has come to the point where people can't say, well, it's - people at least have to acknowledge it's hotter now and getting hotter and has been hot for a long time.",
        "And this is, you know, this is a new normal for us.",
        "And whatever you believe about the politics of this, you have to acknowledge this is something we have to get used to at least and maybe think seriously about, you know, is there a way to put a brakes - the brakes on this?",
