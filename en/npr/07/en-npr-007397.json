        "Many factors can affect whether a particular cycle of IVF will result in a baby.",
        "One of the most reliable is age.",
        "The younger the parents, the more likely they'll have a child, but even younger parents can fail to have a baby on their first attempt at IVF, and then they face a difficult decision: Do they try again with the procedure, go through the stress, the expense, the inconvenience, the drugs, the discomfort, or do they quit and look into other ways of building a family?",
        "Mylene Yao is a fertility specialist at Stanford University School of Medicine.",
        "She says it would be great if there were a way to give patients more specific predictions about their personal chances of getting pregnant.",
        "If they are told that you have very high chance of taking home a baby at the end of this, that is much more powerful and much more informative than telling someone, well, based on your age, this is what you might expect.",
        "So Yao and her colleagues are trying to find ways to predict the outcome of IVF.",
        "To start, they went into their medical records and looked back at all the patients who came through the Stanford Fertility Clinic in 2005.",
        "They looked at 30 different factors, including age, number of embryos a couple produced and the reason for their infertility.",
        "Then Yao and her colleagues used statistics to see which factors were most likely to predict whether a particular IVF cycle would result in a pregnancy.",
        "It turned out that you can use four factors, and those four factors alone gave prediction at 70 percent accuracy.",
        "The four factors were the amount of follicle-stimulating hormone the woman produced, as well as the total number of embryos, the number of embryos that had grown to eight cells by day three and the number that had stopped growing by day three.",
        "The work is published in the journal PLoS One.",
        "Mark Hornstein is director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.",
        "He says he's particularly impressed that Yao found you have to look at all of a couple's embryos, not just the one or two you transfer to her uterus, in predicting outcomes.",
        "They note correctly, and we made this observation in our own program, that the prognosis for pregnancy doesn't depend only on the embryo that's implanted.",
        "It depends also on the entire group of embryos.",
        "And Hornstein agrees it will be valuable to know what factors predict the outcome of IVF, but he says the Stanford study only looked at whether or not an IVF cycle resulted in a pregnancy.",
        "And when we assess prognosis for a couple, we always talk about a take-home baby."

        "Have you ever seen anything like this?",
        "No.",

        "They're just so big and they're operations are just so important to so many regions.",
        "You've got the trickle-down effect when GM has a cold or GM has its issues, so to speak: the ad agencies that service the company, all the auto suppliers, all the doctors, the HMOs, the hospitals that provide health care to GM's retirees and employees.",
        "And when Chrysler's down, people notice it, of course.",
        "But when GM's down, they really, really notice it.",
        "Do we know and we have looked at, Jeffrey, the idea, as you just suggested here--and it seems to me that America does not understand if GM falters--and we don't necessarily suggest faltering being going under--but if they trip and stumble, it has a tremendous effect across this country, does it not?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Back in 1998--now I wasn't covering the industry at the time, but I know that back in '98 when GM had its strike up in Flint, I've been told and I've read that the GDP took a dip of about a point because of the GM strike, which knocked out, you know, an infinite number of plants and all the suppliers that provide parts and services to GM as well.",

        "They've been behind the eight ball, quite frankly, for a long time.",
        "People have talked about inferior product and the like, and it does not seem as though they've been able to really deal with the competition from the foreign market.",
        "I think that's very fair, certainly at General Motors.",
        "If you look at the market share of the company back in the '60s, it was 50 percent.",
        "Now it's hovering around 25 percent, a little bit over.",
        "So there's been a straight-line decline for about 40-some years and management has shown no real ability to reverse this.",
        "And I think, ultimately, it is a management issue.",
        "There are some other aspects to it.",
        "You mentioned the medical costs and the pension costs.",
        "That's a huge problem and a bigger one for GM than for anyone else because they have an enormous number of retirees, some 300,000.",
        "And a lot of these retirees were created when they had 50 percent of the market, and they're now trying to support them from the revenues of 25 percent of market.",
        "It comes out to about $1,500 per car and truck sold in America.",
        "And if they didn't have that cost, that would be $7 billion, which would help quite a bit.",
        "But if they hadn't lost that market share, that whole retiree situation would be a whole lot more favorable and it is, in fact, more favorable for Ford and Chrysler because they've lost less market share since the '60s than GM has.",
        "Jeffrey McCracken, what can be done, when you look at the continuing slide of what is known as the big three in this country, to try to shore up their position and remain as strong?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "I think, as Csaba pointed out, back in the '90s they were--the three automakers got out in front of the Asian automakers and found the truck and SUV segment as a way to protect themselves.",
        "I think what they need to do now is probably get back--first of all, they need to get back to building some cars that people actually would like.",
        "And that's one of the things that's helped Chrysler, is Chrysler alone among the big three is actually doing reasonably well, mostly on the back of products like the Chrysler 300 and the Magnum.",
        "It sounds pretty simplistic, but a lot of times it does just come back to building product that people are going to want to buy."

        "Well, there's no question about it.",
        "This industry is absolutely critical to the country.",
        "It's not--when you look at the car industry, it isn't just the car manufacturers, but all the suppliers; to some extent you can look at the oil industry as being part of it, the transportation industry.",

        "When you look at all of these opportunities falling by the wayside, are we going to have to see, as we saw with Chrysler some yeas ago and Lee Iacocca trying to salvage that corporation--are we going to have to see outside intervention to eventually save the foundation of what we know as the automobile industry today?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "I think these companies can turn it around.",
        "If there needs to be outside intervention it would probably have to be in an area like health care.",
        "I think, increasingly, people realize that General Motors and Ford and, to a lesser degree, Chrysler, are going to need some outside help or need something to hold back these rising health-care costs.",
        "The one thing I would caution is, on the issue of health care, these automakers talk a lot about health care.",
        "But you do--you have to note they make a lot of their own bad decisions that are wholly unrelated to health care.",
        "It wasn't health care that got GM to spend $4 1/2 billion on a dismal deal with Fiat.",
        "It wasn't GM that--or it wasn't health care that forced GM to really miss out on hybrids, to miss out on another--on crossovers, which is another popular segment.",

        "I was around back in the '70s when we had the first fuel crisis in '73, '74, and the Japanese car makers first really got established because they had the high-fuel-economy cars that Detroit wasn't building.",
        "And a lot of people in Detroit thought that Americans will never buy Japanese cars or, if they do, they'll buy them temporarily and get back to the Detroit cars as soon as gas gets cheaper.",
        "Well, gas got cheaper again, but people learned not only that these cars were not evil, but they actually had higher quality than the domestic cars.",
        "And ultimately, most American customers buy quality.",
