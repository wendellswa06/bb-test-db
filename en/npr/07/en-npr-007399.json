        "Well, it's morose, although we have to add that a Wednesday morning, there usually isn't that much activity, but it's a little off.",
        "And the dominant scene are people waiting to check out of their casinos and their hotels.",
        "Although the hotels remain open, without the gambling, no point in staying.",
        "That's why people booked, in some cases, weeklong trips to take advantage of the July 4th holiday.",
        "Waiting to check out a little bit early was Barbara Juba(ph) from Hazelwood, Pennsylvania.",
        "Here's what she says.",
        "Without the beaches, the gambling, what are you going to do?",
        "You know?",
        "I mean, how much can you walk the boardwalk?",
        "And if Juba and her friend didn't want to walk the boardwalk, they could've rolled along the boardwalk in one of those rolling chairs, but I talked to a guy named Zoltan Brier(ph).",
        "He's from Hungary and spends the summer here trying to hustle a buck.",
        "He has to rent the chairs from the supplier, and the supplier's not cutting his prices, so this is what Brier says he has to do.",

        "You know, average, I work 12 hours a day.",
        "But maybe tomorrow I should work 14 or 16 hours for the money.",
        "So that's the general sense.",
        "For a day or a half-day, people feel that perhaps they can weather it, but if it goes on much longer, it's really going to be cutting into the pocketbooks of the employees and all the businesses that have sprouted up around the casinos.",
        "Right, so they're losing money, but what about the state in general?",
        "They must be losing money, too.",
        "Yes, that's an interesting question.",
        "Here we have - here's why the casinos are shutting down.",
        "Obviously, everyone who works for the casinos isn't a state employee, but the casino inspectors, the gaming inspectors, are.",
        "They're the guys that make the whole enterprise legal.",
        "And every day, the casinos generate an estimated $1.25 or $1.3 million.",
        "You can compare how much they are giving to state coffers versus the salaries of the salaried employees for the state.",
        "Jon Corzine knows business.",
        "He knows the casinos actually give more money than they take.",
        "Take into account the lottery, a very popular thing in New Jersey.",
        "That generates over $2 million a day, and the salaries and the costs for those pling-pling-pling balls isn't as expensive as how much they're taking in.",
        "But I think - he says (a), there's nothing he could do.",
        "They're a non-essential state employee, but the symbolism is pretty striking.",
        "Everyone knows Atlantic City, and if you cut it down, he, I think, wants to make people understand how serious this is, wants to make them feel the state's pain.",
        "Well, what are his options now?",
        "He says he's emphasizing a 1 percent raise in sales tax.",
        "It can't be income tax, he says, because then the millionaires will just leave the state.",
        "So what about that 1 percent raise in sales tax?",
        "I talked to a woman named Helen Casey(ph).",
        "Here's her take.",
        "It was Corzine had to make a stand, he had to back it up, and legislature, whatever.",
        "Six percent to 7 percent - I'm from New York, originally - 8 and a quarter The end of the world for a penny?",
        "What would have been the difference, if that's the only issue?"

        "In fact, spending was up 1.2 percent in November, even at the time when gas was up and housing was down.",
        "If you remember, one of the things that drove consumer spending for so long were these high housing prices.",
        "People thought the price of their house would keep going up and up.",
        "And they borrowed against those increases.",
        "They used their house like an ATM.",
        "Well, that's all over.",
        "And what's interesting is that people continue to spend.",
        "And why consumer spending is so important is it makes up 70 percent of our gross domestic product.",
        "I mean, we truly are a consumer-driven economy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And a lot of economists expected that it would be less during the end of this year.",
        "Do we have any sense of why people are continuing to open up their wallets given so much uncertainty around them?",
        "It's always a bit of a guessing game.",
        "I mean, today, talking to analysts, I heard there was an extra shopping day after Thanksgiving.",
        "There was good weather on both of the coasts.",

        "It was up almost 35 percent.",
        "We haven't seen an increase like that since the early 1970s, during the days of the oil embargo.",

        "Per barrel, it is down now in the low 90s.",

        "And, of course, the fed's job, one of their biggest priorities, is to make sure that inflation doesn't get out of control.",
        "Three point four percent is the producer price increase, then, you take the core inflation rate which just takes energy out of the equation: 0.4 percent, still pretty high.",
        "It is still pretty high.",
        "And I think what we have to see is what comes up next month in December and in January to see if this is, you know, a one-time thing or whether it's really a sign of a trend towards inflation."
