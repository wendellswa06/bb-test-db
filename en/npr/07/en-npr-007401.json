        "It's here, of course, that Freud made his lasting mark.",
        "He believed that below the level of our conscious perception, our most primitive desires or drives, what he termed the id, are in constant conflict with our moral compass, the superego, and that both are kept in check by the ego, firmly based in reality.",
        "He believed that our dreams hold cues -- clues to the workings of our unconscious, and that many of the neuroses that plague us as adults can be traced back to a failure in childhood to resolve a basic sexual tension.",
        "Tomorrow is the 150th anniversary of Freud's birth, and in honor of that occasion, a new exhibition opens at the New York Academy of Medicine.",
        "It's a collection of Freud's scientific illustrations that span his career from med student to psychoanalyst.",
        "The exhibition is being presented by the art museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton in cooperation with the American Psychoanalytic Association and the Arnold Pfeffer Center for Neuro-Psychoanalysis at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.",
        "We'll start the hour today with an audio tour of the exhibition, and it will be an interactive tour.",
        "So if you'd like to join us, give us a call.",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "That's 1-800-989-TALK.",
        "And if you need visual gratification, some of the pictures we'll be talking about are on our website www.sciencefriday.com.",
        "And, now, let me introduce my guests.",
        "Lynn Gamwell is the curator of the exhibition, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind, at the New York Academy of Medicine and the director of the art museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton.",
        "She joins me today from our NPR studios in New York.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "It's wonderful to be here.",
        "Also with us--thanks--also with is Mark Solms.",
        "He is a psychiatrist.",
        "Mark Solms is a psychoanalyst.",
        "He's the director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and a professor of neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.",
        "He has provided commentary for the exhibition at the New York Academy of Medicine, and he joins me today at the NPR studios, also at the studios in New York.",
        "Welcome back to the program, Dr. Solms.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "So, Lynn Gamwell, let's begin with you, if I may.",
        "When did Freud do these drawings?",
        "Well, he began doing them as a student in the 1870s and continued them until the last decade of his life.",
        "And so he began doing them looking through a microscope as an observational tool in his training and in his early professional career as a laboratory scientist; and then he continued, once he moved from the physiology laboratory to his consultation room being a laboratory, he continued doing diagrams throughout the rest of his career.",
        "And is there--is this a unique collection of his work that's being presented?"

        "Well, what I've done is assembled all of the images that he did that were related to the mind, and they're--yes, so in the public, in the exhibition in the publication, there're--the drawings and diagrams are assembled and put in order.",
        "You walk through the exhibit.",
        "You start in the late 1870s, and you walk through Freud's career and see the--his changing images of nerves and the mind, basically.",
        "And that's what's unique, is that you're seeing all the pictures together.",
        "If you'd like to ask questions about these pictures or, I suppose, we can even field questions about Freud's theories, we'd be happy to hear from you.",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "That's 1-800-989-TALK, and, Mark Solms, can I turn to you and say, what was Freud drawing at the start of his career?",
        "At the start of his career, as you mentioned earlier, the very first paper that he ever published was a search for the missing testicles, of all things, of an eel.",
        "Nobody had ever been able to identify the male of the species, and Freud's task was to try to find those testicles, which is rather funny if you think about the fact that he later on discovered the castration complex in humans.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, I--yes, but I'm sure people are wondering how did people lose the eel testicles?",
        "It's not that they were lost.",
        "The gonads, which are the precursors of both the ovaries and the testicles, had been found, and also ovaries had been found.",
        "What hadn't been found was gonads which developed into testicles.",
        "I see.",
        "He moved from eels to the brain.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yes.",
        "He--that study on the eel was really a sort of an anomaly, because everything else from then onwards had to do, one way or another, with the nervous system.",
        "So he moved onto histological studies, that is to say studies on the structure of the nerve cell.",
        "He was trying to describe--at that time, we still didn't--had not yet discovered the neuron, and so he was trying--he and others were trying to identify what the basic units of nervous tissue was.",
        "He moved on from those histological papers to anatomical papers, where he tried to trace the pathway that was followed by individual nerve tracks in the spinal cord and then later up into the brain proper.",
        "Maybe I could ask Lynn Gamwell now is--have you enough familiarity with the pictures of this era to say whether Freud was a particularly good draftsman or a particularly good drawer of these things?",
        "He was a very good draftsman, as far as drawing through a microscope.",
        "His drawing--he was proud of them.",
        "He--and they're well drawn.",
        "They're--the detail is captured where it needs to be.",
        "They're excellent simply as drawings--as drawings through a microscope, yeah."

        "...Which was a massive amount of money for a country your size.",
        "Well, the--yes, he was overlapping with the microscope but, I mean, with the--with photography, but both photography and the microscope he used were developed in the 1830s, the achromatic microscope, and, but throughout the 19th century, scientists that worked with microscopes continued to draw rather than photograph through a microscope, even though it was possible, because they weren't after capturing everything as far as the appearance of what they saw; they wanted to selectively direct the viewer's attention to certain details, like a cell nucleus.",
        "And so, yes, he was--he's contemporary with the development of photography.",
        "But he, himself, and his colleagues in the laboratory didn't use photographs.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mark Solms, after his studies of the neuron, what came next?",
        "The studies of the neuron were of very lowly creatures, the river crayfish and also an organism called the lamprey.",
        "What came next was the human brain.",
        "So, as he moved from the study of individual neurons and from the study of the spinal cord, and moved into the brain proper, he also moved from lower animals to human beings.",
        "And the thing that interested him most initially about the human brain was trying, again, to trace the anatomical path followed by individual tracks.",
        "For example, he traced the origin of the acoustic nerve in the human brain stem.",
        "But the interesting thing about those early studies of the human brain, as far as Freud's work is concerned, were the methods that he used.",
        "He developed a method or he adopted a method that had been developed by a colleague named Flexick(ph), whereby because the brain--the pathways in the brain, as Lynn was saying earlier, it's not a matter of just photographically depicting what's there, it's very difficult to see what's there.",
        "The artist tries to identify individual structures of importance.",
        "And what Freud did was to study fetal brains, human fetuses.",
        "The purpose of doing that was it's easier in a less-developed organism to be able to identify individual's fiber pathways.",
        "And then, once he'd found the pathway in the fetus, it was then easier to re-find it in the mature adult brain.",
        "Was there anything--I mean, if all you had to go on for predicting Freud's future were these first sets of drawings going up through the depiction of the fetal brain, was there anything in these early drawings that would predict the future course of his life and his research?",
        "I think that there are continuities that you can find in retrospect, which, I suppose, one could easily overstate; like for example, the method that I just mentioned was a developmental method and Freud was, in his psychological work, also a very much developmentalist, always looking for how primitive structures developed into more mature, complex structures.",
        "Also his commitment to evolutionary theory, to dynamic ways of thinking, the tendency to look for new methods, to not be satisfied with doing things the way that we were conventionally done, but rather trying to find new approaches.",
        "But all of those things I think are less important than a sort of sense of mission.",
        "Even in those early works, it was clear that Freud saw himself as somebody who had to make an important mark on science.",
        "And he tended to always go from the small, individual observation to grand theory.",
        "And what you're saying is his observation--the detail in his small work, was noteworthy."

        "And once psychoanalysis begins in the early 20th century, you don't see pictures of patients anymore.",
        "Because it--the diagnosis is by talking to the patient; it's by case study.",
        "And Freud--and so most psychoanalytic texts in the early 20th century aren't illustrated at all.",
        "But Freud continues drawing and he's diagramming them, not what he's--he's diagramming what he's imagining on the inside, or he's doing theoretical diagrams of a presumed neurological substrate in some cases, or simply his hypothesis about the organization of the psyche of the patient.",
