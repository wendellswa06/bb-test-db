        "Yeah, interesting.",
        "Mark Solms, maybe you can shed some light on that.",
        "Well, that's the, I think, most interesting thing about seeing all of these drawings together in one progression, is that you're sort of forced to recognize that there's not a absolute break or even any obvious moment at which suddenly Freud is no longer doing neuroscience.",
        "I think from his point of view, he was doing exactly the same thing.",
        "It's just that he moved on to more and more complex aspects of the nervous system.",
        "So starting with an individual cell, then tracing the paths--the pathways, you know, groups of cells, what sort of pathways they form, the point of tracing those pathways is in order to understand something of the function.",
        "And if you can see how one part connects to another, it tells you something about what that part does.",
        "And that's one small step towards what he ultimately becomes interested in, which is how does this whole thing work.",
        "And how does it work at its highest levels of complexity?",
        "So you see him moving from tracing pathways in the brainstem of relatively simple functions like how sound gets from the ear into the brainstem, and then, step by step, going through more and more complex things.",
        "An important milestone along the way was trying to understand the neurological organization of our language function.",
        "Now language, of course, is a psychological thing.",
        "But Freud's approach was the approach of a neurologist and of a neuro-anatomist, what's more.",
        "He's interested in trying to identify where in the brain language is organized.",
        "And, in doing that, he was forced to recognize that these higher orders of--higher principles of organization start to govern the functioning of the apparatus.",
        "So that it's no longer simply a matter of that language is made up of auditory components, motor components, and kinesthetic components when it comes to written language and so on; but that it has principles of grammar, of syntax, of phonology, which are no longer anatomical concepts.",
        "And so he was sort of forced, in order to understand the principles that govern the apparatus at these higher levels of complexity, to start using categories, which now one is compelled to call psychological.",
        "But it's not a different type of task.",
        "He's still trying to understand how the thing works.",
        "And I think that that's the continuity right from the start through to his last psychoanalytical diagrams.",
        "Does that make it clear, Matt?",
        "As clear as mud.",

        "It's on the campus of SUNY, on the campus of the University, the State University of New York.",

        "Okay, great.",
        "Thank you for calling.",
        "I wonder, Mark Solms, if I could just ask you: How old was Freud when he began to make this turn and--this turn away from the brain and into the mind?",
        "Was that later in his--I guess how old was he?",
        "It depends where you want to situate that turn.",
        "Because, as I was saying a few minutes ago, and I regret to hear it was as clear as mud, but...",
        "Well...",
        "There isn't one particular moment at which the turn is made.",
        "You know, he was in his early 20s when he did his first anatomical and histological drawings.",
        "That was in the late 1870s.",
        "By the late 1880s, in other words, by his early 30s, he was beginning to work on problems of language, how language is organized in the brain.",
        "And then by the late 1890s, his main interest was in the neuroses, that is to say, functional disorders of the nervous system.",
        "His first purely psychological drawing, in the sense that he makes no attempt whatsoever to identify what the brain structures are that perform the functions that he's diagramming, is 1899.",
        "So by then he's--he's in his early 40s.",
        "That gives hope to some of us to recognize that Freud's magnum opus came in his 40s already.",
        "Right.",
        "And, you know, eventually Freud began to study what you call the meta-psychology which was even more difficult.",
        "How did that work?",
        "Well, the word meta-psychology was a neologism of Freud's.",
        "He invented the word trying to find a way of describing what he had to do.",
        "If he was going to have a theory about how the mind or the brain produces these complex functions that he was observing in his clinical work and limited, as he was, by having no instruments to--no scientific techniques to be able to visualize what the brain processes were that underlay them; rather than just say, well, these complex things can't be studied by science, we'd better abandon them, he used purely psychological methods of observation and tried to infer what the underlying functional principles were; what the organizing, lawful arrangement was of the nervous system to produce these psychological processes that he was observing.",
        "But because he couldn't draw the anatomy, because we didn't know what the anatomy was, he drew it in purely abstract ways, calling the systems of neurons mental systems or mental agencies.",
        "And it was this transition from neurons to abstract systems, to functional entities, that required a new word.",
        "So he no longer spoke of neuropsychology, but rather of meta-psychology, something that goes beyond what can be perceived.",
        "Okay.",
        "Let's take another call now and go to Brian(ph) in Cincinnati.",
        "Brian, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY."

        "Yeah, hi.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I've always been kind of troubled by Freud's--how he came--how he actually came upon the data that he used to develop his theories on--his psychoanalytic theories--the whole Oedipal complex has always--I've never, for example, felt--I know he said it was all subconscious that, you know, boys are attracted to their mothers, but I never understood that.",
        "It never made sense to me.",
        "I'm wondering how he actually obtained his data.",
        "Has it been questioned in the past?",
        "I suspect it's been questioned quite a bit.",
        "Mark Solms.",
        "It's been questioned all along, and I think that the limitations of the methods that Freud was compelled to use is the basis for the doubt that attaches to his conclusions.",
        "It's very easy to convince people of something concrete that you can show them.",
        "You can say, look, here's the neuron.",
        "You see the cell body's connected to the fiber there; and we can all look at it and we can all agree.",
        "When you start trying to understand how the thing works and how it works, in terms of the complex interactions between millions of neurons, it's not so easy and simple to show visually what your conclusions are, and I think, likewise, your conclusions are less secure.",
        "They're more far removed from what's observable.",
        "So, how Freud arrived at his conclusions was to listen to his patients telling him what they felt, what they remembered, and what the stories of their lives were, where the symptoms arose in this fabric of a lived life.",
        "And doing so with, literally, countless patients, he eventually started to see certain organizing principles.",
        "There were certain general features that seemed to apply to all people, in the sense that he could infer underlying laws--underlying commonalities.",
        "They were--the emphasis has to fall on the word inferred--they were constructions.",
        "They were models.",
        "They were theoretical explanations for what was observable, and such things are always subject to error.",
        "But, Freud, I'm sure, didn't start out with the preconception of a thing called an Oedipus complex.",
        "It's a rather strange and counterintuitive notion.",
        "But, I assure you, that that was the best explanation that he could come up with for the clinical phenomena that he observed in his daily work over many, many years.",
        "Brian, thanks very much for that call.",
        "Lynn Gamwell, you wanted to add something.",
        "Yeah, I would add that, as Mark has described, Freud's method, that his early training in the laboratory--it shows, in that once he is observing patients, that he's always looking for the data as--gathering as much data and as--and being as objective as he can, given the elusive nature of the unobservable phenomenon that he's dealing with.",
        "But, he's always--throughout his life, he fought for--and I think that you can use a strong word like that--to insist that psychoanalysis was a science, and as based on observation as is possible, given the nature of the subject matter."
