        "Mark Solms, do you have a favorite?",
        "Yes, funnily enough, I have a favorite, which has the same importance that Lynn attached to the diagram of that dream in the Project for a Scientific Psychology, but it's a different drawing that I would identify as the, sort of, pivotal, transitional drawing.",
        "It's actually, from an aesthetic point of view, one of the ugliest.",
        "It was drawn in 1886, or thereabouts.",
        "We don't know precisely when it was drawn because it was never published, and, as far as I'm aware, it's being exhibited, now, for the first time.",
        "It's a drawing in which Freud shows that the relationship between the body periphery and the central organ of the brain, especially the cortex of the brain, is a very complicated relationship.",
        "One of Freud's professors, Theodore Meinert(ph), had taught that the body periphery is literally projected onto the cortex, so the cortex contains a sort of map of the body periphery.",
        "And Freud showed in that drawing that the relationship is much more complex than that--that the body periphery--the nerves going from, say, your hands or your feet, arrive at spinal nuclei where they're subtly reordered and then projected onto thalamic nuclei deep in the brain, where they're reordered again, and joined with other inputs, and then projected onto the cortex, where they're reordered again, and joined with, yet, other inputs, and then re-represented in various iterations in the cortex.",
        "And, why that's important, as Freud said in the accompanying text, is that, as we move deeper into the system--as we go from the concrete sensory motor level of the body periphery to the higher levels of the cortex, so we have different principles organizing the representation of the body.",
        "It's not a literal, physical representation of the body, but rather an increasingly abstracted depiction--performing different functions.",
        "It's not the function merely of projecting the surface, but rather of re-representing that surface in relation to other things.",
        "And I think that that drawing, in this sense, introduces what will later become the mind in Freud's theorizing--something which symbolically represents, rather than concretely represents.",
        "Mark Solms, I'm afraid we've run out of time, but I'd like to thank my guests.",
        "Mark Solms is a psychoanalyst and director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Lynn Gamwell is the curator of this new exhibit, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind.",

        "Obviously, with Brother Gordon gone, that's not going to happen, and of course, fingers are pointing all over the place.",
        "But you haven't seen the major contributions come into the NAACP that you would expect to see if they had made our civil rights a value proposition, not only for corporate America, but even for everyday Americans.",

        "If it was something more simple that could be resolved with a phone call, or it would just something that was office funk and not a big civil rights case, but people felt connected because of that.",
