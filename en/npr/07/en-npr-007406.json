        "Japan has opened up to some help from abroad.",
        "And I think we're starting to see it speed up now.",
        "But no, there have been some complaints that Japan is a first-world nation, it's not Haiti, and that they have been a bit slow.",
        "But I think it's starting to get through now.",
        "Is there a problem caused by the power plant problems at Fukushima Dai-ichi, that the - is that causing a blockage of preventing supplies from getting further north and diversion of resources like helicopters?",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think just - it's a very good point, diversion of attention, as well.",
        "You know, I think that the attention of the world and, of course, of the Japanese government has been diverted to the Fukushima nuclear plant.",
        "So that's been - that has been a major issue, and I think it's fair to say that things would've got further north quicker and supplies would have got there quicker if it weren't for this nuclear crisis, because, you know, every day we've had - and as reporters here, we're watching it very carefully, as you can imagine.",
        "We're watching very carefully to what every little or big explosion is, what every word is from the fuel rods or from the reactors.",
        "So I think that there's so much attention on that.",
        "And I think this is a slight tragedy in itself, that, of course, they have had to deal with that, but it has overshadowed very much the human disaster, the tragedy of the tsunami and the earthquake, that this - the nuclear plant - which clearly has to be taken care of - has meant that, at not least, the world's attention, as well, has not been on - not so much at least - on the people who are really suffering.",
        "And as you said in your introduction, it could be as many as 20,000 people who have died, as well.",
        "And are people still going out by day to look for relatives, to look for whatever may have survived?",
        "They are, absolutely.",
        "The weather, it's warmed up a little bit.",
        "I was - we had snowstorms here last week, and it was bitterly, bitterly cold.",
        "But people were going round to the evacuation centers."

        "It's in Belarus, a small, former Soviet republic that feels very much stuck in history.",
        "Some of the things that we saw after the tsunami in 2004 around the Indian Ocean, these centers that have been set up, these boards where people write these heartbreaking notes saying who they're looking for, they gather there.",
        "And sometimes you find yourself in the midst of this, these emotional reunions.",
        "And Japanese people are not naturally very emotional.",
        "You know, that's a stereotype of Japanese people, but it comes from somewhere.",
        "They are quite reserved.",
        "And you see emotions flowing in a way that I think even long-term residents here say they've never seen before.",
        "And suddenly, you're caught up in the middle of that, and it's very emotional.",
        "And that is going on all the time, every day.",

        "We read of the recovery from the Kobe earthquake a few years ago and how much quicker that was than - well, maybe even quicker than many Japanese thought it might have been.",
        "But as you look at the scale of what's happened on the northeast coast there, is there any conception of how long it can be before those half-million people have somewhere else to go and new lives to lead?",
        "Well, they're talking about five years, actually.",
        "That has been talked about as a phrase, I think, by - I'm not sure if the government here has actually said that.",
        "I know - I think it was the World Bank who said it today.",
        "And various people have been talking about that.",
        "Even just ordinary Japanese people are saying this will take five to 10 years.",
        "I think that's, you know, that's true when you look at the level of devastation.",
        "I think in the short term, though, I think if they can sort out the nuclear plant - and there is sort of talk that that may be stabilizing.",
        "It's a big back and forth at the moment.",
        "You know, it stabilizes, then there's another kind of small explosion of some sort.",
        "But if they can stabilize that and get that sorted out so they can devote 100 percent of their attention to the relief effort and the recovery effort, I think that will go a long way.",
        "But in terms of actually rebuilding and constructing the houses, helping to rebuild the industries, like the fishing, the ports along the coast, that's going to take many, many years."

        "I have not heard that they are going back.",

        "So there is no way to know exactly what the condition of the -these various reactors.",
        "There are six on that site.",

        "But attention has been focused on reactors one, two and three, and of course the pond for spent fuel at reactor number four.",
        "And the reactors - one, two and three - seem to be relatively stable.",
        "Over the weekend there was reports of increased pressure inside the containment chamber of reactor number three.",
        "And there was some talk that they might have to vent from that reactor, they might have to release some gases, which would mean sort of a deliberate release of radioactivity just to get the pressures down.",
        "But in the end they decided that it was looking okay and they weren't going to have to do that.",
        "But it's just a reminder that even things that seem stable are sort of in flux.",
        "And so today the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said that he saw some signs of improvement.",
        "He just returned from a trip to Japan, but he said that the situation remains very serious.",
        "And you talked about the remains of building number three.",
        "We look at the pictures on television and we see what seemed to be abject ruins.",
        "Is there any way to know what's going on inside the containment vessels, where the nuclear material is?",
        "Well, they have some ability to do readings, but again, they need to get more information by bringing power to the site.",
        "They want to power up control rooms that will give them more information about what's actually going on inside.",
        "The building could look pretty bad, but that doesn't necessarily tell you about the state of the containment vessel.",
        "Thats the big steel and concrete structure that's designed to contain the radioactive materials.",
        "And so the building isn't necessarily what matters.",
        "It's that containment vessel.",
        "And what's the progress on bringing electricity back to these facilities so they can fire up the pumps eventually and get the circulation going, the system that's designed to keep these cool?",
        "The cooling system, yeah.",
        "Well, that assumes that that hasn't been damaged by the earthquake or the tsunami or the explosions that have been happening.",
        "But yes, over the weekend they did make some progress in laying electrical cables and hooking those up.",
        "So now there's external power hooked up to reactor number two and reactor number five, and I understand those can serve as hubs to give power to a couple of other reactors.",
        "But that doesn't mean those buildings are now powered up.",
        "You know, they have to go in and do a very thorough check of the electrical systems and then look at the equipment, and then they'll start to hopefully bring systems online."
