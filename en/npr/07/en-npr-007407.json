        "But again, I think that this is still an early part of the phase of making those assessments.",
        "Is there any timeline here?",
        "Is there any thought that in 10 days or two weeks or a month or two months this is going to be stabilized?",
        "I mean, officials have basically been saying that it could take weeks.",
        "Weeks.",
        "So there is also some indication that there were some problems at these plants, at these reactors, even before the quake and tsunami.",
        "According to an analysis of the Japanese regulatory document by the Wall Street Journal, the Fukushima Daiichi power plant was one of the most trouble-prone nuclear facilities in Japan.",
        "I have seen some reports.",
        "I haven't seen a report directly linking any problems to the events that are happening now, which are quite an extraordinary situation.",
        "There was one report suggesting that perhaps inspections at the plant had been delayed or had not been done.",
        "But I think that after this event, clearly what's going to happen is they're going to go back and review everything leading up to this, not only for this plant but I'm sure other plants in Japan as well.",
        "And as you look at these facilities, one of the things that's been of concern to people throughout has been the quality of public information that's been released.",
        "So there's been a feeling that they have not been completely forthcoming, maybe even edging into dissembling it sometimes."

        "Some of these buildings are releasing high amounts of radioactivity.",
        "And so it's not like workers can easily access these buildings and find out exactly what's going on.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR science desk correspondent, with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Now, on top of everything, there are growing concerns about radiation in food in Japan.",
        "The government said it found food with higher than normal levels of radioactivity at farms as far as 90 miles from the plants.",
        "It's shown up in milk and in spinach.",
        "Dr.",

        "And as you've looked at these reports, what strikes you?",
        "Well, it's a difficult balance that I think the government is doing a pretty good job trying to do.",
        "There are really two issues.",
        "So one is: Are there real, genuine, serious health effects?",
        "And the other is reassuring and calming the public and responding to normal, reasonable human concerns.",
        "Well, first is a problem for science, and the other is a more delicate problem.",
        "Well, the iodine levels are - in these foods are well beyond what the U.S.",
        "Food and Drug Administration considers a cause for concern.",

        "No, that's correct.",
        "It's both true that the levels are above that which is recommended and also that there's no known acute or any detectable probability of long-term effects due to the levels, at least so far that they've reported.",
        "When the levels of possible radiation exposure are set, they're really set on two grounds.",
        "One, again, is levels that are known to be scientifically - scientifically are known to be medically harmful, and the other is how low can you get the levels so that in case we're wrong about what's harmful, you'd like to keep it as low as possible.",
        "So as public limits - or limits for workers in radiation - the permissible levels keep going down not because the danger is going up but because it appears practical to reduce them.",
        "Because it - and any reduction, if it's possible, is a good thing.",
        "Nevertheless, as you look at the levels of radiation that have been detected thus far - yes, we hear this is, well, beyond recommended levels, but that also you could drink this milk for a year and still not have any problems.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's probably correct.",
        "One way of looking at it in perspective is the radiation dose differences - the amount of radiation that you're - that they're talking about is less than the difference that you would encounter living a year in Denver versus living for a year on the East Coast.",
        "That is in Denver, because the elevation is higher, you get more cosmic radiation so that your background radiation that you'd received as a citizen in Denver is quite a bit higher than you'll get living in New York.",
        "I don't see us recommending a mass exodus from Denver to New York.",
        "The World Health Organization said that the detection of radiation levels in the food represents a, quote, unquote, \"\"serious problem.",
        "Well, I guess it depends - you know, so it's a serious problem in terms of concerns of people, in terms of confidence in the food chain.",
        "So it's back to the dilemma that you correctly outlined earlier in terms of, you know, what's needed for the public versus a strict scientific fact.",
        "And this is a public in Japan that sadly has more experience with radiation than any other public anywhere in the world.",
        "Does that make them more sanguine about this, more willing to accept small levels of radiation, seeing that it is not necessarily catastrophic?",
        "Or does that make them even more sensitive to any level of radiation?",
        "Well, it's a good point, and I'm certainly not wise enough to be able to differentiate between that.",
        "I would imagine that, outwardly, people in Japan tend to be accepting and passive.",
        "I think, inwardly, they - there may be heightened anxiety having already experienced extraordinary exposures to radiation at the end of World War II.",
        "So as we go through this crisis, public information is going to be absolutely critical.",
        "And yet, we have also heard that people in Japan have been skeptical - and Americans will certainly understand that.",
        "Americans would be very skeptical of official announcements.",
        "But the people in Japan have been skeptical about the announcements they've been hearing from their government."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And probably, just as it is in the United States, on reasonably good grounds.",
        "I think governments from - in many areas, but particularly for radiation, have tended to be rather paternalistic and have shielded the public from unnecessary worries sometimes by outright lying.",
        "And so having done that that genie is out of the bottle.",
        "And now we have a really hard problem in convincing the public that they can trust us, having demonstrated previously that they shouldn't have.",
        "And if, as we heard just a few minutes ago from Nell Greenfieldboyce, if it is going to be a matter of weeks before the situation at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant is brought under control, if there are subsequent releases of radiation, small levels of radiation, but nevertheless some is too much, this is going exacerbate with time.",
        "You're absolutely right.",
        "Yes, it's going to be a problem.",
        "And it's compounded by the fact that we're so very, very good at detecting radiation.",
        "We can detect such minute amounts of radiation, so that we can say that it's going two or three or four or 10 times background.",
        "And when something increases tenfold, you know, that's kind of scary.",
        "But if a very tiny amount increases 10 times, it's still a tiny amount.",
        "But as human beings, we're really not very well-equipped to deal with that.",
        "You mentioned how good we are at detecting radiation.",
        "Indeed, some tiny amounts of radiation from the plant in Japan have been detected in this country.",
        "And there are people, particularly on the West Coast, who say the prevailing winds across the Pacific bring that material over here.",

        "So if you try to get potassium iodide on the West Coast, I understand you can't buy it.",
        "So now you have maybe millions of people taking what is really a very low-risk drug.",
        "But if enough people take the drug, even though the risk is low, then you multiply it by a large number of people, then you're going to start getting side effects.",
        "So it's really important, but I'm not sure that it's possible, to keep people from acting foolishly to protect themselves against really essentially non-existing hazards and introduce hazards in the act.",
        "What are the side effects or potential side effects of potassium iodide?",
        "Alicia Killsmall(ph) is almost at that point.",
        "She applied for food stamps last October and waited months for an appointed, but never heard back from the agency about her application.",
        "Killssmall has her hours cut back at the fast food restaurant where she works and says now her entire paycheck goes to feeding herself and her three sons."
