        "Yes, but fairly modest risks, but real risks.",

        "And the answer is, unequivocally, no. So the doses that - with the increased threshold that they've been allowed to go to, that still is less than one-tenth the amount of radiation that it would take to begin to have any significant probability of acute effects.",
        "And if you could...",
        "So they're not going to have acute effects of radiation.",
        "And if I could ask you to summarize the other one very quickly.",
        "Sure.",

        "Well, according to administration officials, the president wants staff from the National Security Council, the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to review whether providing cities, counties and states, whether they're big or small, grant funding or other assistance so that they can purchase these things like body armor and armored vehicles, automatic weapons even - these are equipment that are usually used at war.",
        "And the White House review is looking at whether or not it's really appropriate to use in policing our communities.",
