        "And isn't this conclusion, though, that you reach, well, you say it goes against the grain, it's heresy, isn't it, for psychiatry?",
        "Not really.",
        "I mean, you know, we now have a vulnerability model for most human traits and also for most mental illnesses that basically posits that, you know, behavior is the result of an interaction between, you know, inborn, congenital or genetic factors and the environment.",

        "Hey, no problem.",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "The responses were very strong.",
