        "And then I started doing what I have always done for the last many years, calling my sources in the police and intelligence service.",
        "Then I found out that there was an explosion targeting one of the Afghan intelligence services offices in the heart of Kabul.",
        "As I was trying to get to the bureau, then I heard that there was a second explosion.",
        "And it didn't take long for me to find out that my own colleagues were the victims.",

        "Yes.",
        "Shah Marai, the AFP photographer, was someone that I had met in Kabul in 2001 when I started working as a fixer translator.",
        "Then I ended up going on many, many different assignments with him.",
        "And to be honest with you, he was someone who was a self-made man.",
        "He was an example for my generation, for the post-9/11 generation.",
        "It really broke my heart because I thought about his children, about him, how committed he was.",
        "He had a chance to work outside of Afghanistan.",
        "He didn't.",
        "And then I also ended up remembering my time with the cameraman for Tolo News because I had been with him in Kunduz Province on several occasions.",
        "So these are faces.",
        "These are people with real stories.",
        "These are just not numbers.",

        "Why have you stayed?",
        "I think there are many different reasons.",
        "But I think for me, perhaps more than anything else, it was the murder of my friend Abdul Samad Rohani.",
        "He was a BBC reporter in Helmand.",
        "And other time I wrote about it, I felt like the weight of the whole world was on my shoulders.",
        "And I made a commitment with myself that, no, actually, some of us will step back.",
        "And, you know, this is the situation of almost majority of Afghans.",
        "I mean, you know, where can they go?",
        "Can't seek asylum.",

        "And, you know, they are living both under the control of the Afghan government, the Taliban or the so-called Islamic State.",
        "So I think you'll find a lot of Afghans tell you that they love this country, and they're staying.",
        "And there's always hope.",
        "I mean, no matter how much pain there is, how much suffering there is, I think Afghanistan has always had hope, even when it was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or the Civil War or the darkest days of the Taliban regime.",
        "Ordinary people really clinged (ph) onto that hope, and it really worked.",

        "Yes, independent expenditures they're called.",
        "Well, speaking about swift boat - now this is a great transition to the next question that I have for you.",
        "And that is news out today that a book is going to be published, highly critical book about Barack Obama, by one of the guys who was behind that swift boat book back in the last election.",
        "Yes, a book that went to number one on the New York Times Best Seller list, and that book was called \"\"Unfit for Command.\"\" And if you look at what it did to John Kerry, you know just how much any opponent would need to fear that sort of dynamic.",
        "Same thing happened to some degree to Mike Dukakis, a little bit to Al Gore, and we'll see if this new book, due out in August - which seems to be as much about the media as about Barack Obama - how much affect that will have.",
        "Unfit for Command\"\" contained a new and radically different view of John Kerry, undercutting his supposed strength as a war hero and, if you will, trumping his ace.",
        "That's not what we're promised, at least so far, on the Obama book.",
        "It looks more like this regulatory book is going to bring together a lot of stories we've already heard a little bit about and use them all together to make a portrait of Barack Obama as someone other than the person he puts himself forward as."
