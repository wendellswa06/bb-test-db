        "I mean, they're the ones that kids are learning from, and all these external things, and the first caller talking about the problems she had, if a parent doesn't have a skill set to help deal with that, the kid's going to seek either stuff from other outside influences, which probably a lot of times won't turn out well, or just become problematic.",
        "And when that parent doesn't know how to deal with that, then it's like, well, they're a bad kid, and, you know, Mr. Friedman, you know, he's talking to people that I'm sure that the love is there and that they care, and I'm sure that they are really at their skill set's end, but at the end of the day, they're not doing what's right, and they need to get some new skill sets.",

        "Some are just intrinsically better at it, like any other thing, and some learn along the way.",
        "But I think that he's right, that, you know, there are certain skills that, you know, you can acquire and get better at, and sometimes, depending upon where you are in the birth order, you'll be the recipient of, you know, an inexperienced parent where there are more problems, and by the time you get to your, you know, older siblings, I mean your younger siblings, who've, you know, actually had the benefit of, you know, parents who've had a little experience along the way, they have a different parent, in a sense, someone who's learned many, many more skills, has been through the ringer and understands, well, maybe this wasn't the best way to do things and I'm going to change what it is that I'm doing.",

        "One has to do with higher rates of marital conflict.",
