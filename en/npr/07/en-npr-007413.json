        "So I wonder if there's some kinds of changes that are going to come through, you know, his research, the doctor's research, to kind of change the focus of some of the therapy.",

        "If there's a problem, it's the parents.",
        "Right.",

        "Well, it's funny because he acts out, but specifically to the family unit.",
        "He's been diagnosed with oppositional defiance and all that, but he won't do it anywhere but within the family.",

        "I mean, truly, I can thank him for being a better parent, a better teacher and all kinds of things.",
        "But as the behavior is generalized to other family members, well, then all of the sudden, maybe he had a problem.",
        "Maybe it wasn't just me.",
        "But it took years for that to kind of happen.",
        "So that's some of the stuff that he shows.",

        "And I think sometimes parents of kids like that need to step back and kind of hear some validation, that maybe it's not everything that they've done.",

        "But at this point in my life, I really don't understand how my siblings aren't more difficult - outraged at people around us and our parents.",
        "I feel like it probably isn't my parents' doing because my siblings have turned out all differently than me.",

        "And I wonder, Dr. Friedman, is there genetic evidence that it's nature?",

        "So kids today who are five or six might act a little worse but they end up having better independent thinkers down the road.",

        "And I think on all three of those, he's making considerable headway.",

        "And that was exactly the right thing to say.",
        "But Russia does have means to put pressure on these countries.",
        "And so NATO's really got to do its homework on getting proper troops and supplies and equipment and all that sort of stuff into the Baltic states, so that Russia really sees that there's no mileage in trying to do any stunt or mischief there."
