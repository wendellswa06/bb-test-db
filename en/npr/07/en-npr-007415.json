        "Here is the interesting point Roland Martin--and Mary touched on it earlier--the idea that people like Governor Mike Rounds of South Dakota are really anticipating the idea of laying the foundation, laying the freeway, to drive this point through.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "What they want to do is utilize the state and setup a federal rights vs. state rights argument as it relates to abortion.",
        "And so that is one of the things they want to do in this case.",
        "Also by having such a strict Bill then you put the Supreme Court in a position to establish parameters.",
        "So if they are able to establish parameters in terms of limiting abortions, then they can go back and create additional laws based upon those parameters.",
        "And so absolutely by pushing the envelop as far as possible you want to say that hey we may not get complete explosion of abortion, but we could have some severe limits.",
        "But the important thing to remember is that they wouldn't even be pushing the envelop, but for the fact that they see the political wind blowing in their direction and the court is going in their direction.",
        "Alright lets turn our attention to something we just heard Farai talk with Walter Isaacson, one of the main forces behind the resurrection of New Orleans and that's the levees.",
        "We have heard so much about the levees.",
        "There is concern now from an independent team of experts monitoring the reconstruction project of these levees, that large sections of the rebuilt levees will be substantially weaker in their words than before the hurricane hit.",
        "We heard Walter Isaacson suggest that we are not going to see category five levees built--what he called these heavy-duty, category three levees are being put up.",
        "Is this again yet a mistake, Roland Martin, by government being far too short-sided with what may come down the road.",
        "Well not necessarily because that I see is that you have a very short window and hurricane season begins June 1.",
        "So the problem they are facing is how do you shore up as quickly as possible anticipating a hurricane?",
        "And so, could you have the ability to shore the levees up the way we want to, based upon the shortened time.",
        "And so again whether you like it or not when you are dealing with construction there is a certain period of time that you have to use, so to expect 3,4,5 or 6 months to be it, when you really need 2-3 years, this is what you can expect.",
        "But Jeff, if in fact these experts are correct, there suggestion is that to meet these deadlines as Roland said, that they are taking shortcuts that will clearly compromise the construction of these levees.",
        "Oh they are definitely taking shortcuts, but I would agree with Roland in the old adage, in life you get what you inspect and not what expect.",
        "So that you would expect that you have enough time to build this thing, but when you look in front of you, you have what you have what you have.",
        "And I think court spokesman, Jim Taylor said it, the people of New Orleans need to get back to at least a level of hurricane protection we had before Katrina.",
        "We are authorized to do it quickly.",
        "It is up to Congress to decided take it to a higher level.",
        "And so they are doing what they can, but the flip side is that something does have to be done in the interim and I am terrified at prospect of the levee issue getting trapped into the standard American way of doing things.",
        "The twilightzonian state of inactivity that were call the paralysis of analysis.",
        "Mary Frances Berry we also have to look at this economically when you talk about 1.6 billion dollar in terms of funds being put forth for this reconstruction project one has to hope and pray that we will not see the same kind of hurricane season that we saw last year that may in fact knock many of these levees down.",
        "And we had, you know, hurricanes elsewhere too in Florida damage, all of it expensive, but you know all of that optimism that Isaacson was expressing which is what he is supposed to do as Vice-Chair of that commission won't come to anything if the levees fail and we have a big hurricane again.",
        "But here is my take on it: the administration says that the levees are going to be fine.",
        "They put out a new story that came out today and that clay is being brought to use instead of the dirt that is there that is weakening it, although some of the experts say they were standing there and saw people putting in dirt that wasn't clay.",
        "So we don't know the answer to that, but what I think is that the people in New Orleans should go ahead and build and do what they have to do hoping that the levees will not break, but if a hurricane warning comes everybody should be prepared to leave so that they can test it out and see if it occurs, you should be prepared, people should be prepared to just leave for a little bit to see what happens if they get the warning.",
        "We won't know the answer as to whether the levees are fixed unless something happens again and then we find out that they are not."
