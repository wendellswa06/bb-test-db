        "He continued: In the past, I have competed for menial jobs with retirees and unemployed professionals alike.",

        "And it looks to be that the components of cannabis don't do that.",
        "They leave the healthy cells absolutely unaffected, and there's no toxicity.",
        "So that's important, and that really makes it a unique medicine.",
        "Now, Robert, behind the scenes there seems to be a little bit of disgruntlement about sort of winks and nods, people saying, `Oh, she's an evangelical Christian'; James Dobson, the radio talk show host, saying he knows something that no one else knows.",

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "There will be more women on the program than what we saw last time around.",
        "This march is more inclusive, more solemn, so to speak.",
        "It will not be as large, I believe, as the last march, but still we should expect a very sizeable and respectful crowd.",
        "Donna, it's interesting to note that Minister Farrakhan has received some support from the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Progressive National Baptist Convention, as well as from entertainers like Kanye West and Erykah Badu, and he's also got some ties in with Latino civil rights groups and gay rights groups.",
        "Why this outreach for a man who is famously homophobic?",
        "I think one of the lessons that Minister Farrakhan and other leaders who organized the first march came away with was that people felt that it was divisive, that it was `us against them,' male vs. female, black vs. white.",
        "And one of the things that the organizers of this march set out to do from the onset was to involve more people.",
        "Robert Traynham, but you are hearing from people such as the Jewish leader Abe Foxman, that Farrakhan remains an anti-Semitic figure in American life and that people should not be embracing him.",
        "That's very true, and basically, this is a classic example of learning from your mistakes, as Donna mentioned a few moments ago.",
        "This march will be much more inclusive, and the reason why is because, look, Minister Farrakhan, even though he is a minister, albeit he's also a politician, he takes the public temperature, if you will, of his perception.",
        "And his perception out there is that he is racist, the perception is that he's bigoted and the perception is, is that he is not inclusive.",
        "And so what you will see this weekend is, I think, a march that is much more inclusive, that is much more somber in tone and respecting different people's walks of life.",
        "But I--look, it's an open secret that Minister Farrakhan has been very hostile towards Jews, and hopefully this march will seek to kind of overcome those misstatements that he's made in the past.",
        "All right.",
        "I want to thank you both for joining us.",
        "I've been joined by Donna Brazile, former campaign manager for Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore in 2000.",
