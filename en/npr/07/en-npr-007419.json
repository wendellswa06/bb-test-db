        "Exactly.",
        "All the way back in 2011, Audie, Texas passed this voter ID law, which is considered the most strict in the nation.",

        "Well, in earlier legal wrangling in this case, a special three-judge court based here in Washington, D.C.",
        "found that the Texas law was the most strict in the entire country in a slate of voter ID laws that have come up through Republican state houses across the nation.",
        "And the special court found the law had a discriminatory impact on minorities, in part because it was so hard to get to a place in the vast state of Texas through public transportation, sometimes 200, 250 miles in order to go and pay a fee and get a voter ID.",
        "One quirk in this Texas law is that you cannot use a student ID in order to register to vote, or to vote; you have to use other means, including things like concealed handgun licenses.",
        "But state student IDs are not okay, and many minority voting groups and the Justice Department say that's just wrong.",
        "It's wrong because it imposes a greater burden on black and Latino voters and on poor people.",
        "And that's the basis of this Justice Department case.",
        "So what are state officials saying about this latest legal fight?",
        "Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is a Republican who is running for governor in the state, has been very resistant - the Obama administration butting into state affairs, as he sees it.",
        "He's defended the voter ID law at every turn and the state's redistricting maps, which have been under challenge as well.",
        "He's pointed out the DOJ will have a very tough road ahead, Audie, to prove that the state discriminated.",
        "That's because many election law experts say under the old system, before the Supreme Court ruling, the burden was on the state.",
        "Now the burden is on the federal government and the minority voting groups.",
        "And that's a really hard burden because back in 2008, not that long ago, the Supreme Court ruled that as long as there's a neutral, presumptively valid reason for voter ID, it's going to be very hard to throw those laws out.",
        "So, Carrie, walk us through what happens next.",

        "I think that is a euphemism.",
