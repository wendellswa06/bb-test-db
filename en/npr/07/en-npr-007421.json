        "There is some concern that, obviously, if minorities are stopped, you know, that there'll be kind of unfair discrimination, that they'll be stopped without reason, but a number of the the police chiefs have said that some kind of action needs to be taken to prevent, you know, potential suicide bombers traveling on the underground.",

        "And quite shockingly, what they show and what the pictures that have been released show is that the events that the Metropolitan Police had led us to believe weren't actually true.",
        "At the time, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said Mr. de Menezes was wearing a bulky jacket, that he ran over the two station barriers and made a dash for the train and that he was acting suspiciously.",
