        "One is that the vote - the Lieberman defeat - reflects an overall discontent that most voters in the country have -62 percent of them have - with the way that the war is going in Iraq.",
        "And then, I think specifically for Democrats, what you saw was a reaction to Democratic grassroots voters being tired of Democratic politicians who are willing to walk away from the party in a way that they consider gratuitous.",
        "I think that people in Connecticut thought that Lieberman was… It's one thing if you have different views than the Democratic party and you stand - you know, and there's a principle behind it.",
        "But I think that people thought that Lieberman gratuitously would walk away from the party because he thought it was good for him politically, nationally, and there's now a price to be paid if you do that.",
        "How much of this, Robert, is change for change sake, do you think?",
        "I think actually there is - there's actually a fair amount of principle involved and I tend to actually agree, generally speaking, with what Jennifer just said.",
        "I think in the context of the Tuesday races, the Cynthia McKinney one is sort of an outlier because - I mean, this is the second time that she'd lost a primary in the last four years and her controversies are well known.",
        "But in both Connecticut with Lieberman and in Michigan with Schwartz, you had cases where the grassroots of the parties, which are, basically, slightly more to the extreme of the broader party - in other words, the conservatives are the base part of the Republican party, the liberals are the base part of the Democrats - they basically said that they don't want Republicans in name only in the Republican side and Democrats in name only - DINOs, as it were - on the Democrat side.",
        "And it also has to be looked at in the context where grassroots organizations like the Club for Growth - which really focus on economic issues and lesser government - they have been running candidates against incumbents at the state level, particularly in Pennsylvania, and they had a number of victories knocking off incumbent members of the legislature.",
        "So I think you're starting to see a little bit more of a wave of the bases of the party trying to instill certain kind of principled opposition and adherence to principle positions, on both parties.",

        "I think it's pretty sad to hear, actually, because I think that Lieberman has… Quotes that I've seen that he made yesterday, he's kind of -he's gone over the edge.",
        "He's was attributing his loss to people in Connecticut that are sympathizers with the terrorists and with the insurgencies in Iraq.",
        "And I think lashing out at Maxine Waters, who is very liberal and is just… It shows how he has - I don't think he quite his bearings about him.",
        "And I don't know what's going to ultimately happen with his candidacy but I wouldn't be surprised if, within the next 10 days, you see him drop out because you can't - he can't continue to run a race where he is alienating liberal Democrats and not appearing to do anything to reach out to conservatives.",
        "So Robert, is this desperation or is it a strategic move on Lieberman's part to take on Maxine in that way?",
        "Well, it's partly - it's a little bit of both, I think.",
        "There's that old saying, you know, Paybacks are a you-know-what.",
        "And this goes all the way back to the 2000 race, frankly, where after Al Gore selected Lieberman as his running mate, Maxine Waters was one of the leading black officials questioning him on his view on racial preferences, for example.",
        "And so, there's been some kind of - She, basically, because he was Gore's pick, she basically said, Okay, fine.",
        "We'll stick with him.",
        "But they've had a certain kind of an animosity for quite some time.",
        "Lieberman, frankly, I think has to be very careful here, because if it looks like - If Lamont starts painting Lieberman as playing sort of the racial card, saying, you know, focusing on the role of Al Sharpton and Maxine Waters in the primary loss, Lieberman will actually, I think, start to lose part of his base which is African American voters."

        "Here's a quote from a strategist that was in the paper the other day that I thought was very interesting - and here it is: The question is no longer whether the Democrats can win the House but whether the GOP can do anything about it.",
        "So, to be successful - this is not part of the quote - what do the Dems have to do, in your opinion, Jennifer, that they have not done successfully since they lost both houses of Congress 12 years ago?",

        "And I think that they need to really come to grips with the fact that 62 percent of America is behind them.",
        "The majority of America doesn't think that the administration is doing a good job in combating terror and I think - and they believe that, by the way, because I think it's true - and yet Democrats still continue to be a little cautious in their critiques and I think that they need to have, you know, the courage of their convictions and be willing to state the obvious and not worry that they're going to get called out for being soft on security.",
        "Can the Republicans stop them, Robert?",

        "When you balance what happened on Tuesday with the whole - with the foiling of the bomb plot on the airplanes.",
        "Because what the Democrats basically have to try and do is detach Iraq from the war on terror.",
        "And in both 2002 - basically in 2004 they were not able to do that in the presidential election.",
        "And the Republicans immediately jumped on the fact of the terror plot to show that Democrats seem to be too willing not just to run away from Iraq, but to run away from the broader war on terror.",
        "So the Democrats, meanwhile, responded saying, well, the Republicans knew that these arrests were imminent and they're trying to play games.",
        "So this has been the really big problem that the Democrats have had for the last two years in terms of trying to say Iraq is one issue, the war on terror is another.",
        "And if they don't change that rhetoric, figure out how to engage the Republicans on this, it may very well be the same play that we've seen in the last two elections.",
        "I'm going to come to you Jennifer with the last question because we have less than a minute left.",
