        "There's been a great deal of conversation about A-Rod and number 600, but there hasn't been a great deal, it seems to me - tell me if I'm wrong - of interest in whether he hit it or not.",
        "He - well, I think you're right halfway in that - remember -and we talked about it a couple of years ago, that A-Rod was going to be the shining prince, the antidote to Barry Bonds.",
        "And then, of course, we discovered that there was no Santa Claus, and that A-Rod was just like everybody else, and he was juicing up to, you know, to perform.",

        "Doesn't that - can be a continuous distraction?",

        "So, currently, 15 people have been appointed.",
        "We expect 10 more to be appointed.",
        "OK.",
        "Let me also just point out that the line between church and state is one of the wisest things that our founders ever did.",
        "And President Obama has mentioned that wisdom on that particular principle several times in his public statements during the campaign and during the first weeks of his presidency.",
        "I think he's actually put forth a very sensible principle for maintaining that line even as the Faith-Based Office goes about doing its work, and that principle is this: that churches, synagogues, mosques and temples who apply for money to do programs like running soup kitchens in homeless shelters can only use those federal dollars in ways that are constitutionally appropriate and legal.",
        "But those programs that are funded by our government that help our society, that - those legal dimensions would only apply to those particular programs.",
        "And Catholic churches, for example, would be able to hire only Catholic priests to run Catholic mass, in other words, to maintain their unique religious character.",
        "I think it's an important balance to allow religious communities to maintain their religious character with the private funds that they generate themselves while also making sure that they abide by constitutional standards and the public funds that our government provides them to serve the greater needs of our society.",
        "That's the principle he's articulated.",
        "He said, in the gray areas, in the cases that are kind of on the line, he would ask the executive director of this office, Joshua DuBois, and the White House Counsel to review those cases on an individual basis.",
        "Well, there are cases where various Evangelical groups getting federal funds - this, of course, during the Bush administration, not the Obama administration - fired a woman because she was a lesbian.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, that's the kind of thing that Joshua, who - the director of the office, would look at and I would imagine that President Obama would say, if we have given you funds to run a social-service program, you have to hire according to U.S.",
        "federal law and constitutional standards.",
        "And clearly, that type of case I think would be problematic to the Obama administration.",
        "But let me tell you, Neal, about what I am really excited about when it comes to this office and my particular service in the council, is that President Obama has set this up as a take-action council.",
        "And one of the priority areas of the council is interfaith cooperation.",
        "It's something that President Obama has talked about a number of times even in his first couple of weeks as president.",
        "One of the most beautiful parts of his inaugural address was when he said that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.",
        "(Reciting) We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers.",
        "We are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of the Earth, and because we have tasted the bitter swill of Civil War and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatred shall someday pass and America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace."

        "What I am really excited about, as executive director of the Interfaith Youth Core, an organization I started basically at my dorm room in Oxford 10 years ago, is to help President Obama operationalize that vision, is to real create an interfaith youth movement with tens of thousands of young people all over the world bringing Muslims and Jews, Hindus and Buddhists, together to serve the common good.",
        "And it's that type of putting feet on the street to a vision that we have the opportunity to do with this new faith-based office.",
        "And as you look at the things that these faith-based initiatives, and neighborhood associations, too, can accomplish with government money, in part, well, there are things that they do that aren't done in any other way.",
        "I think what's interesting about the makeup of the council is just how diverse it is, Neal.",
        "So, it's, you know, faith-based social-justice heroes like Jim Wallis of Sojourners and David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, but it's also secular heroes, people who've been leading secular organizations who do amazing work, like the head of Big Brothers Big Sisters, like the head of Public/Private Ventures, and so, I think what President Obama is saying is that Muslim and Christian, believer and nonbeliever, what we have in common is a desire and a call to serve others.",
        "And we have to cooperate to do that, and that's the spirit of the council, in our first meeting, which took place in the Oval Office and then in the Roosevelt Room, was very much about what can we do together.",
        "Of course there're going to be some areas in which there's tension and rub, but how do we cooperate to serve others together?",
        "How can Muslims and Jews, Buddhists and Hindus, secularists and Baha'is, make sure that we are answering our call, the call of the golden rule to create a world where our brothers and sisters live healthy, happy, dignified lives?",

        "I've worked with a high-school youth group for - wow, I don't know - since I got out of high school about 16 years ago.",
        "And yeah, we simply don't even look at these federal options because of what they would then basically require, like you guys have been saying, us to do, which is hire non-discriminatively.",
        "As the statement has been made, I don't see how that - I mean, it's almost like it's discriminating - I see the same thing in the job force do, that, you know, you're the boss; this is how you want it to run.",
        "You know, the separation of church and state I see working both ways.",
        "We're supposed to be able to worship like we want, but if we want your money, yeah, I guess we'll open ourselves up to that, but I - that's why we won't because the faiths are not the same.",
        "They are all very, very different, and they all lead to a different way, and that's why we will never accept a federal...",

        "So, that's what we teach and preach, and we can - opening it up with other people would be opening it up to, oh, there's many ways, which is totally against what we see reading from cover to cover in the Old and New Testaments.",
        "And Eboo Patel, groups like the one Brad talks about, well, of course, the Obama initiative would have no impact on them whatsoever as long as they don't take the federal money.",
        "I think that that's right.",
        "But I think there's something beyond that, and I have deep respect for what the caller is saying about how he seeks to strengthen and deepen the religious identity of his community based on the biblical vision he adheres to.",
        "I think that that's actually entirely consistent with what we're trying to do with the faith-based office and really also the character of America.",
        "President Obama in his National Prayer Breakfast Address said as much - and I'm just going to quote a couple of lines from that.",
        "He said, there's no doubt that the very nature of faith means that some of our beliefs will never be the same.",
        "We read from different texts; we follow different edicts.",
        "But he also says that there is a dimension of all of our faiths which call us to serve others.",
        "And in this way, I think what President Obama is doing is something that we've been trying to do at the Interfaith Youth Core for a decade, which is, for the purposes of interfaith cooperation, really separate Heaven and Earth; say, people worship differently; they believe in some different things; they might think that there is only one path to Heaven or only one community that can get to Heaven, and that's something that should be respected.",
        "But when it comes to how we cooperate together on Earth, we should be highlighting those dimensions of our traditions that can be encapsulated in the golden rule.",
        "And President Obama listed a version of the golden rule in a variety of faiths; of course, Jesus saying, love thy neighbor as thyself; the Jewish tradition saying, that which is hateful to you do not do to your fellow; and Islam, a beautiful hadith of the Prophet Muhammad which says, none of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.",
        "Buddhists and Hindus have similar statements in their traditions.",
        "So, I think what President Obama is saying is we enjoy the freedom of worship in America to worship in our particular and unique ways, and at the same time, the American character calls all of us to cooperate on those dimensions of our faiths which encourage us to serve others.",
        "Brad, thanks.",
        "And if I may say really quickly, I certainly agree as far as working together to help people in physical turmoil and in literal ways, certainly, but I also - I've got to say that in personal life, if I'm helping somebody to their death, I don't see how that's helping, and that's where I think a very strong line comes into play that always gets brushed aside.",
        "If all faiths believe different things, then either they're all wrong - because they all claim to be the way.",
        "I mean, they - most that I've been - that I've looked into and searched, that's what they claim, yet that isn't possible because they're all so very different.",
        "And so, if there is but one true way, then what is it?",
        "And whoever has it - I mean, if they truly have it, then you can't waiver from that.",
        "You have to - and obviously, I believe there is a certain layout for that.",
        "Obviously, somebody is saying, oh, we know the way, but we can kill everybody.",
        "That's not - that's wrong.",
        "And oh, there's one way and it helps everybody out under any circumstance, and this is really sick (unintelligible).",
        "But I'm just saying that's why I see that separation as absolutely pivotal because I do not believe through study that any of this is, yeah, helping people that's great, but in the end the bottom-line issue for everyone is death and what happens after death.",
        "That's what everybody is concerned with...",
        "Brad.",
