        "My experience was working at an agency that was originally founded by Catholic sisters.",
        "I'm Protestant.",
        "And the work was with women on the margins, was what we were always, told based on - and this were kids that were - girls that were emotionally disturbed and had horrible backgrounds, and it was very tough work, and it required some sort of faith...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "To work with them, but it worked real well, and I never felt pushed, for example, as an employee to be Catholic.",
        "They were quite respectful.",
        "I know we had a Hindu staff member for awhile.",
        "You know, we focused on the work; we didn't focused on the other stuff so much.",
        "On proselytizing, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And they were - in fact, I remember taking a Jewish girl at one time - I went to a Seder meal with her because in that setting there wasn't anything going on for her.",
        "So - and they were very respectful of the differences.",
        "They were very strong in their own beliefs, and we walked some sort of line in between the school where I was and some of the other settings - I don't know how it was, say, in dorms where they lived, but it seemed to me - the girls didn't seem to be too upset by the whole thing.",
        "We used to have some kind of interesting discussions because many of the people that worked there had social-work backgrounds out of the then Baptist seminary, it was different then.",
        "And so there were a lot of Baptists and we had some Catholics, and then there others of us that were other things.",
        "And I found, you know, that just the focus on the work with the girls was really what bound us together and then the rest of it was just kind of extraneous.",
        "Hmm.",
        "The work, Eboo Patel, the work, in this case, really does overcome a lot of differences.",
        "Actually, what struck me about that story - and thank you so much to the caller for that - is how an institution set up by a particular faith community, in this case the Catholic community, drew a diverse, a religiously diverse, group of people who were inspired by their own traditions - in some cases Protestants, in some cases Hindu; I imagine Jews and Muslims worked there also - all of them who wanted to express their faith through the service of others.",
        "I think that's actually a great story in America.",
        "So many of our hospitals were started by a particular religious community.",
        "Catholic hospitals have Jewish and Muslim doctors, in many cases, called by their faiths to be healers.",
        "Catholic universities have some of the best interreligious-cooperation programs in the country.",
        "I think of, for example, of Georgetown University or I think of Notre Dame's Kroc Center on Peacemaking, which has focus on religion and peacemaking.",
        "I think what we are ready for in America is the type of interfaith cooperation that that caller talked about.",
        "We've had a civil-rights movement; we've had a human-rights movement.",
        "I think it's time for an interfaith movement, and President Obama is setting the stage and giving us the call for that.",
        "Nancy, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you."

        "The question isn't really asking people to send us their answers as to why believe in a God.",
        "It's really a way of reaching to our own audience, who already kind of think that way and really already think, you know, you can be good without belief in a God, that there are other bases for moral values.",
        "So, this was appealing to people who pretty much already agree with you; you're not necessarily trying to proselytize here?",
        "I can't imagine anyone changing their faith from two sentences on the side of a passing bus.",
        "That would be rather strange indeed and a rather weak faith.",
        "If our signs, our ads get anyone to thinking and get him to start questioning, we're not going to object or complain.",
        "That's fine.",
        "But we just don't think the idea of proselytizing is a very effective use of our time.",
        "And since there are literally millions of people who think like us in America - roughly, we guesstimate around 30 million - then we've got our hands full just gathering our own and making our choir bigger by just finding everyone who already sings the same tune, that we don't really need to try to change anybody.",
        "Just figure out a way to get to them all in the same place every Sunday morning maybe?",
        "Well, or any morning or evening or afternoon or - and in fact, just to let them know that we're here and how to find us and that they're not alone, because I think a lot of people like us feel that they're the only ones.",
        "Why buses?",
        "Well, buses in the Washington, DC, area are kind of necessary because billboards aren't allowed in the greater metropolitan area.",
        "And we have been running billboards in other areas - in the New York City area, in the Philadelphia area, in Colorado and Colorado Springs, and we've got ones coming up in North Carolina.",
        "And they say, don't believe in God?",
        "You are not alone.",
        "So, again, it's just our way of outreach to our own, and we want to make it interesting, though.",
        "We want to make it catchy, because then the news media takes an interest in it, and then we get even more publicity, which then lets even more of our own find out where we are.",
