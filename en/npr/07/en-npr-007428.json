        "And - well, people tend to be people after a while, but I was wondering - Fred Edwords, as you consider this, I guess part of your message was to try to reach out to people like Troy, like that young man whose mother wrote the email.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think a lot of people are of our mind, who are in the closet as it were, because it just isn't always prudent to acknowledge that - and many people, in fact, don't acknowledge it publicly until they've retired because they don't want to suffer any harm to their careers or anything like that by being out.",
