        "Precisely.",
        "How you define the term and also - for example, in some of the studies, they'll ask you what your denomination is, and someone might answer, I'm a Unitarian, in which case you're classified as a Unitarian.",
        "Well, there's a lot of Unitarians who are atheists, therefore, that might be slightly reducing the number.",

        "Yeah - and seemingly easily dismissed, and the end of her life and the end of her organization - well, it was very unhappy.",

        "Nevertheless, it was seemingly very quiet after that.",
        "Well, I think with them, we were in a very conservative period of time when - and maybe more of a conformist period of time, when there's less diversity in this country and less tolerance for diversity.",
        "And now, with - you know, we all know the reasons why this country's more diverse now.",

        "And if you're seeing more atheist activism - and we're using that term very broadly - do you think it requires a response?",
