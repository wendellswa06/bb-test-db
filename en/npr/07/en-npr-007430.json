        "And firstly, relating to just - I just hope that this sort of discussion and movement, you know, starts to educate the public for people who are atheist, humanist, and - you know, just then takes the edge of.",
        "Going back to what the previous caller had said very quickly, and this relates to what you were just discussing.",
        "I have a son who declared himself an atheist in a classroom, and he was shocked by the reaction to his classmates and the teacher.",
        "And I, you know, explained to him, you know, perhaps if you - and you could look at this on a broader application, too - you know, instead of - perhaps if you had described yourself as a humanist and given people a definition of what you were before you, you know, threw on the label of atheist, you know, you would have served to give people a little information about what you stood for, which really would've helped people sort of accept the idea.",
        "And you know, again, what Jacqueline had just said as far as people declaring themselves, you know, agnostic, atheist, what have you, after, you know, after great conflicts in the world where, you know, people would say, oh my goodness, there cannot be a God because this, that or the other thing.",
        "And rather than taking that approach, an approach that I like to think of is just to say to well, you know - which is really what humanists believe - that we have the good in us.",
        "You know, we as individuals have the good in us to do good things on earth - and then in parentheses, of course, without a deity.",
        "And you know, I tell my kids, you know, you've got everything you need when you walk out the door.",
        "And I think that put much more of a positive - like, I choose to be an atheist.",
        "I choose to be a humanist, rather than just wind up as one because, you know, conflicts in the world dispel the, you know, dispel the ability - or make it difficult for people to believe in a God.",
        "Does that make sense?",

        "Actually, I'm seeing - hearing more talk about agnosticism - people who simply find that they cannot affirm the existence of God, but acknowledge that they simply do not know.",

        "The percentage of people over the age of 60 who are atheists is quite small, and it grows the younger you get.",
        "And as I was saying before, what's going to be really interesting to see is whether that percentage of atheism stays in the population, which of course, tells you then that the percentage of atheism overall is going to grow, or whether, you know, as I mentioned almost half-jokingly, whether this is a phase for young people, and as they grow, as they acquire children, whether they then will acquire some faith.",
