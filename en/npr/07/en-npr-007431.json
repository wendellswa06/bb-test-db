        "Well, a couple of reasons.",
        "The first is the Justice Department and the FBI have been pretty much under siege from President Trump for most of the last year.",
        "He has said the FBI is in tatters; the Justice Department is the deep state.",
        "These new reports that the White House was disrespecting the independence of the Justice Department and that Sessions himself may have been engaged in a smear campaign against the FBI director are not good for morale at the FBI and the Justice Department.",
        "Another reason - legal experts are telling me this could fill in some of the blanks as to whether or not any obstruction of justice occurred last year.",
        "Now, Comey says he was fired because the president wanted him to go light on Russia, to influence the Russia probe.",
        "We now know the White House took more steps to try to lean on the Justice Department.",
        "And that's all of interest to the special counsel, Robert Mueller.",
        "So we've talked about Mueller's investigation into possible collusion with Russia.",
        "What do we know about Mueller's interest in these possible issues of obstruction of justice?",
        "We know a few things mostly from witnesses and other people in the case.",
        "Mueller has the memos Comey made reflecting his conversations with President Trump last year.",
        "Mueller's team has interviewed the White House lawyer, Don McGahn, and the former chief of staff at the White House, Reince Priebus.",
        "He's also talked with the deputy attorney general about Jim Comey's firing.",
        "Now, the White House denies any wrongdoing by the president.",
        "It's an open question whether any sitting president can be charged with a crime or indicted.",
        "Most people at the Justice Department don't think so.",
        "For some insight into this, I reached out to Chuck Rosenberg.",
        "Rosenberg's a former U.S.",
        "attorney, now a contributor at MSNBC.",
        "He says the disclosures here in the new book by Michael Wolff are probably not a surprise to Robert Mueller's investigators.",
        "I presume that everything in the book and all the folks that the author talked to are already known to Bob Mueller and his team.",
        "I can't imagine that he's sitting down and reading it, combing through it and getting ideas about who to interview.",
        "I have to assume that Bob Mueller has lapped us many times on the high school track and knows a heck of a lot more than we do.",
        "And sadly, Ari, Bob Mueller isn't telling us what he's doing with respect to obstruction of justice, at least not yet.",
        "Someone else who's not saying much about this is the attorney general, Jeff Sessions.",
        "Some Republican lawmakers this week called for him to go.",
        "What's the latest?",
        "Thank you very much for joining us.",
        "The reality is that, I think at one level, this is sort of the last gasp of the steroid era, but they also think, Tony, I mean, A-Rod is a great player, just like Barry Bonds is a great player, Willie Mays was a great player.",
        "These guys are great players.",
        "And whether you like it or not, he's got the record.",
        "He's the youngest major leaguer to achieve this milestone.",
        "It's a great record.",
        "It's going to stick.",
        "It's in the record book, no asterisks, and that's just the way it is.",
        "And if he keeps healthy and keeps on his pace, in three years, four years, you know, we're going to actually talk about him as the new home run person.",
        "So, you know, you could wring your hands about it, but this is it.",
        "It's in the record book, and just kind of get over it and move on."

        "All right, so he has time.",
        "How far could he go in terms of how many home runs he could hit, presuming that, you know, he's, you know, off the juice now and he's going to be the real athlete that we thought he was before his admission?",
        "Well, I think that, actually, I think he may be closer like 34, 35.",
        "But I think, given his work habits, I think he lives a relatively healthy lifestyle, I think he's got a tremendous shot, and particularly if he continues to play with the Yankees, because they're always going to surround him with a great team.",
        "So, all things being equal, without any sort of debilitating injuries, I think he's going to be right there.",
        "He's going to be right there looking at Babe Ruth, Henry Aaron and Barry Bonds.",
        "We're going to take a call in a minute, but I wonder, because you knew George Steinbrenner, the late owner of the Yankees, what would he have said today to and about A-Rod hitting homerun number 600.",
        "He probably would have been angry that he didn't do it at the Yankee Stadium.",
        "But besides that, what might he have said?",
        "No.",
        "I think he'd be bursting with pride because this is a reflection on him.",
        "He's the one who authorized, signed the big check to bring A-Rod to New York.",
        "In fact, you could probably argue that A-Rod was sort of Steinbrenner's last great signature signing.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks for letting me speak.",
        "I actually feel like baseball in order to clean up its image has a price to pay, and that price may be the big stars who cheated.",

        "The email address is talk@npr.org.",

        "That's a great observation, Tony, because I think there's a the approach is much more sober if you've noticed.",
        "You know, there's not sort of telegrams and all of that.",
        "I think that there's a much more restrained atmosphere because A - because sort of what A-Rod is going through and the admissions and all of that, and also just the fact that you just don't know.",
        "I think there was there's something called the steroid era, you know, Bud Selig hates to use that term, but it existed.",
        "A lot of players were using - and by the way, you know, the caller made this thing about Cal Ripken and all of that.",
        "There are a lot of pitchers who are using, too, so I think we all have to get off this holier than thou, and driven as pure as the driven snow, and accept these accomplishments for what they are.",
        "There are a lot of homeruns being hit by guys like A-Rod, and they were hit by - off of a lot of pitcher who are juicing.",

        "It is a mark on baseball to have the homerun record held by a cheater like Barry Bonds.",
        "At least A-Rod has admitted his mistakes.",
        "If he gets the overall homerun record, at least the record will be correct, and we won't have to hear about Bonds and his tainted numbers anymore."
