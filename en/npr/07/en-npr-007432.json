        "Number one, I think Alex Rodriguez is actually underrated as a baseball player.",
        "As funny as that might sound, he's the first infielder to make this list.",
        "And as a former Gold Glove winner at shortstop, I think that's pretty significant, to be, you know, that type of power hitter coming from the infield.",
        "But number two, I'd like to understand why we're not hearing more about the use of amphetamines, especially by guys like Hank Aaron and Willie Mays...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...who we're seeing the performance of players on the road suffering without the use of amphetamines.",
        "And that actually might be the greatest testing that the MLB is doing today rather than the performance-enhancing drugs that gets much more attention than the amphetamines issue.",
        "But thank you very much.",
        "Thanks, Robert.",
        "Tony, you know, that's such an outstanding point.",
        "Wow, what smart callers we have.",
        "Yeah, tell us.",
        "That's just - you know, because you hear guys like Willy and Hank and all those guys get on the high horse, and in our day - listen, in that day, that - he's exactly right - it's amphetamines.",
        "You know, everybody had to find a way to get through the day, and it was amphetamines.",
        "And so in every generation, you have people finding an edge, finding a competitive edge.",
        "That's why this talk, all of the sudden, of rewriting, putting asterisks and that kind of stuff is just ridiculous.",
        "There's an evolution to this stuff.",
        "And you're right, Bud Selig doesn't bring up that stuff about the amphetamines of that era because a lot of his friends playec in that era, you know, Hank Aaron and that group.",
        "You know, and everybody - not everybody, but so many players in that generation used the greenies and the amphetamines.",
        "So that was really a great point."

        "And I think the other great point that the caller make was about what Rodriguez has accomplished.",
        "I mean, this guy was a great shortstop.",
        "And the idea that a shortstop, an infielder, which historically is sort of like the anemic hitting position, the idea that a shortstop would be closing in on the homerun record and hitting 600 at an early age is really a phenomenal achievement.",
        "So to that extent, I agree that A-Rod, as superstars go, has probably not been given enough credit as being transformational.",

        "How would you characterize it?",
        "I'd just tell him, man, this is a great ballplayer, you know?",
        "He's a great ballplayer, and I probably would go over some of the stuff he said as he admitted juicing.",
        "And one of the things A-Rod said is that, you know, he was insecure.",
        "He realized he did not have to juice.",
        "He really didn't have to juice.",
        "And I think that's one of the things that I think we should emphasize to our children about a lot of stuff, not just cheating in sports but cheating in general, whether it's scholastically or anything.",
        "Once you -when you have self-confidence, an inner confidence, no, but you don't have to take shortcuts, you know?",
        "You don't have to cheat.",
        "But I think that all this ties in to self-esteem, knowing who you are and self-confidence, and that's what A-Rod said.",
        "He said, I was insecure, but now I realized I didn't have to do that stuff.",
        "I'd be great without it.",
