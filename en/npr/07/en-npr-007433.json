        "I think deep - a little deeper than that, I think there is the populist outrage, but I think there's also - this is also a move by Obama to try to reverse this disconnect that had built overtime, this income inequality, where we had a winner-take-all system - we were clearly had become a winner-take-all society, where executives were enriched for shifting jobs offshore.",
        "They were in - given bonuses if they were able to bring the company's cost-structure down by breaking unions.",
        "And I think it moves us back to a time when there's more of a common tribal bond between worker and management and help build the sense that, as Americans, we're all in this together.",
