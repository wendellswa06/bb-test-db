        "I wonder, have you ever found yourself in the middle of a negotiation for a, you know, very high-salaried athlete or entertainer and then thought to yourself, just for a minute, this is ridiculous?",
        "I have, and - but you see, I've represented people, extraordinary people, like Cal Ripken Jr., who are willing to leave ridiculous on the table - and they still earn enormous amounts of money - but go for other value-based, like being part of the community for a long period of time.",
        "I will say this, I have observed negotiations - you mentioned Alex Rodriguez earlier; when he went to Texas, the closest bidder for his services was something like $160 million, and the exuberance of the owner of the Texas Rangers said, I'll give him $250 million, and that was irrational exuberance in an economic sense, but it certainly pushed the entire sports marketplace dollar up the scale.",
        "And we can all rest easy because Alex has subsequently renegotiated that contract with...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, he's gotten a few more dollars in New York, but hasn't found happiness, which is another piece of this.",

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Traditionally, what happens in this country and what's made it operate so well is people at the forefront of their technology or the forefront of their field - you mentioned carpenters make about $31,000 - somebody that's a contractor that has a product, there's a lot of people like him make a lot more than that, and people who don't really have great ideas will make less than that.",
        "But you've got to be able to string an idea together and bring it to fruition to have money like that.",
        "I assume you're speaking both about those who come up with the great ideas, the inventors, if you will, and those who can...",
        "Well, or the ballplayers, it could be the athletes.",
        "People - me, I enjoy seeing a college game, where there's not professionals as much as seeing a professional game.",

        "He's talking about carpenters, so I'll mentioned that, in the sense that, you know, we're not talking about all athletes getting millions.",
        "We're talk - I'll never forget there was a news anchor, a national news anchor, I represented who complained about athletes' salaries.",
        "And I brought him to a batting cage that I had at my home, and I turned it up to 90 miles an hour, and he stood there for two minutes and watched the ball whiz by and was frightened and walked out and said, I understand."

        "The statistics I've read show that the majority of the jobs in the country are in small businesses and majority of the jobs created in the country are created by small businesses.",

        "Not on the stock market.",
        "And it's also - one of the most difficult thing is to take a small business, even one that's doing very well, and grow it into a big business, because the management difficulties go on and become very difficult.",
