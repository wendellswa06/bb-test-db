        "So, I am considering that physicians should make more money than - at least in comparison to some of the executives and so far who are mainly profiting because they're making money for people for whatever reason, while on the other hand, you know, doctors are working to take care of people's health.",
        "And a lot of us - I'm a physician myself.",
        "A lot of us make a lot of personal sacrifice in order to be able to practice medicine.",

        "Right.",
        "I know it's a very sad situation, and the thing that is surprising, I think, to a lot of my patients is, although they're paying more for health care, either, you know, through their insurance plan or other, you know, medications or testing that they're having done, the reimbursement for the physicians is actually going down, and we're losing good people who would probably go into primary-care health because the reimbursement is so poor that the salary does not compensate for, essentially, the amount or worrying that you do.",

        "You know, I have the opportunity to be sued.",
        "And I'm afraid that, you know, these things are weighing on us and it's keeping other people from coming into being a primary-care physician, because, you know, with all the headaches, you don't get at least a little bit of a reward.",
        "The thing that bothers me, or that I worry about, is we were trying very hard to move toward having everyone covered so that they can be taken care of and have, you know, some type of health care.",
        "I think that's wonderful, and I think the biggest thing that people are confusing is that if everyone had insurance, then everyone would get great health care.",
        "I think the problem is insurance, you know, and they're profiting...",
        "I think, Robin, we're going to have to debate the health-care system as a whole on another day.",
        "That'd be great.",

        "And indeed, that's already starting to happen.",
        "You're already starting to see people at the largest firms look toward the boutique firms, small firms, that are not under these restrictions, and when the job market improves on Wall Street, will be able to hire them away.",

        "You know, on one hand, we did have - we are in this mess because we had firms that were supposedly too big to fail that the government had to jump in and rescue lest they down the entire economy.",

        "I mean, you know, $500,000 a year may not be the greatest incentive, but that cap is only tied to government-infusion dollars.",
        "And the real issue, Neal, is that in the corporate world, in the public corporate world, we have compensation committees setting compensation who are appointed by CEOs whose compensation is being set, who go out and get compensation consultants who are paid by the corporations.",
