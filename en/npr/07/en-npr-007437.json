        "This seems suspiciously easy.",
        "Why does it work?",

        "When he says that, what do you think?",
        "My belief is history will judge the Iraqi intervention on the basis of the fact that there was no plan for what should follow, and then that was further compounded by the fact that the army was removed and the police were dismissed.",
        "And whilst the excuse of coming there, to some quarters of the United Kingdom with a long history in Iraq (unintelligible) the state of Iraq knew better than that.",
        "And really, that was Tony Blair's role as a good ally of the United States, to warn against the consequences of those actions.",

        "What impact do you think Tony Blair had on the British military as an institution?",
        "Well I think his main legacy will be the extent to which the armed forces were heavily committed in Iraq, and then further committed in a war in Afghanistan without any particular point.",
        "But there's no doubt that we can also thank Tony Blair for taking the efforts of the previous conservative administration and delivering peace in Northern Ireland.",
