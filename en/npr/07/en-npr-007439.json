        "He has made his recommendations.",
        "He--Secretary-General Annan has made recommendations.",
        "He has called for world leaders to convene in September in New York to go through these recommendations on Security Council expansion, on getting rid of the discredited Human Rights Commission, on streamlining the Secretariat, so we need our first team there, and the hope is that John Bolton will rise to the occasion.",
        "And obviously it was not an option to go into this critically important session, which begins in--What?--next month, September, without an ambassador at the UN.",
        "Well, actually we have an acting ambassador there now, Anne Patterson, who has gotten very good reviews for her work.",
        "And actually Secretary Rice has appointed a special adviser on UN reform, Ambassador Sharin Tahir-Kheli, who has been working this issue.",
        "So there's already a nucleus there of people that have been carrying the US message on reform.",
        "Let's hope that John Bolton will go there and work with them.",
        "And then one when his son came down with cancer and when he realized that other people - that they were very few children who are witnesses of the bombs who could be spoken to because most of the children had developed cancer by about age 60 and died.",
        "And then he realized where he had worked so hard to maintain an anonymous position in life.",
        "He realized that maybe sometimes on the road you try moving to escape your fate - that's where you meet your fate.",
        "And that's when he came out and started talking about the bomb.",
        "There is this haunting story that he tells of almost being pursued by this almost living thing that he saw first in Hiroshima and then again in Nagasaki.",
        "Yeah, that's something that's interesting to me, in that the Japanese often they give they see these things, a phenomena, almost as living things - demonic figures that seem to follow some people and personally - these strange fire worms; five and six, even 10 storey Tornadoes of fire that would come in groups, almost stop at the river.",
        "And one child said it was as if they paused and were looking across the river, determining what to do next before they advanced and became water spirits, and then went landward and drew up fire again.",
        "These are incredible stories that you tell in this book.",
        "Obviously, the situation that you describe, we hope it never happens again, nevertheless, there are some lessons.",
        "Again, who was it?",
        "It is the warnings of Dean Tsung(ph).",
        "This was another double survivor.",
        "Right, right.",
        "He was well, actually there are about up to 300 people that we know of who got on the trains, these two trains from Hiroshima, went to Nagasaki and experienced the bomb a second time.",
        "And like the dean of the medical college, about 90 percent of those people appeared to have been killed by the second bomb, which most people don't know was three times more powerful than the first bomb",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "but before the second bomb arrived, he had been going around the hospital and to the medical students, warning them of what he had seen, warning that, you know, if you're wearing white, even if you're behind a white sheet, it protects you from the flash.",
        "The things that we look at in the 1950s, the duck and over films, and we see people ducking behind sheets, all of that was true.",
        "If you are near enough to be seared by the flash that would actually protect you by reflecting the heat ray and he gave out information that saved a lot of lives."

        "So, he lasted only about a day after they found him in the center of the building.",
        "Yet he also felt terribly guilty that he hadn't been able to tell his story more widely.",
        "The people who left Hiroshima well, the government story was a small bombing had occurred, a few people had been killed, what President Truman had said was completely nonsense.",
        "Right.",
        "The government - in fact, some of the people who began talking, the pre-facto arrived in Nagasaki, Dr. Sunno(ph) the even Mr. Yamaguchi they were told, you can be hit with charges of treason if you keep spreading these bad rumors that Hiroshima has disappeared.",
        "In fact, Mr. Yamaguchi was in the - often one of the largest office buildings of the Mitsubishi Company.",
        "When the second bomb struck, he was in a room behind a steel reinforced stairwell that appears to have diverted the shock wave in much the same way that the prow of a boat will shunt water to either side.",

        "I did not know that the aluminum cylinders that were dropped by another plane, there were three over Hiroshima, included letter to Japanese physicists saying, please explain to your government what has happened, that there is no defense against this, that the time has come to surrender.",

        "And two of their physicists went right down to Hiroshima, came back.",
