        "And at that distance, and at that point, about five, six second later, the glass would have been flying into the room at about one-third the speed of sound.",

        "Mr.�PELLEGRINO: Yes, Mr.�Yamaguchi was one of the people in that zone.",

        "Glass had been picked up and fired like darts into the bodies of these children who were walking around near him stunned.",

        "So she decided to turn over the dead bodies one after another.",
        "At the time, Japanese were wearing, you know, the name tag and address on the clothes.",
        "And she came home without her husband.",
        "After maybe about 30 years after the atomic bomb dropped, I think the government finally admitted that he must have died in there, but we never got the body.",
        "But she suffered from the radiation effect for the rest of her life.",
        "Her lungs were destroyed.",
        "Her, I think, kidney was not functioning well.",
        "So the people who weren't directly affected still got effects of the atomic bomb.",

        "He had no family who were living in the hypocenter, but people who survived near him who, over those next very first days, when the ground was really radioactive, who went into the hypocenter, they picked up what they - in their lungs what they call the death sand, which was the fallout.",
        "And they had effects that just went on and plagued them for the rest of their lives.",
        "You know, in fact, you've described many stories of people who had this tremendous thirst after the water had been evaporated out of their bodies by the heat and the explosion, and found themselves opening their mouths to the black rain that fell from the sky.",
        "Mr.�PELLEGRINO: Right.",
        "And the thirst would've been caused also by the rays passing through them and causing damage.",
        "Some people were actually, literally burned on the inside.",
        "And then, of course, there was the fire all around, which raised the heat and was bringing on thirst and...",
        "It was also August.",
        "It was hot.",
        "Mr.�PELLEGRINO: Yes.",
        "And one case was the Sasaki Children(ph) in what became the lifeboat between these two bridges where the children were, and then the black rain started coming down and they were thirsty, and they started drinking the black rain.",
        "And that is probably how Sadako of the story of Sadako and the thousand paper cranes, it was probably more the black rain than anything else because this was all the irradiated material that went right up behind the fireball and then rained down as dense fallout.",

        "There was the possibility that with flak and everything, the bomb could've exploded in the plane itself, 30,000 feet above the ground.",
        "And Sweeney did all of this because Kokura was really a purely military target.",
        "It did not have this huge civilian population around it, as Nagasaki did, and Orikami(ph) and the Mitsubishi plants near Nagasaki.",
        "And Sweeney, with running low on fuel and everything else, he did everything he could not to hit a largely civilian target.",

        "The zone of absolute death would have extended another half mile, at least, beyond where he was.",
        "And had the accidents with - had the smoke over Kokura, and then, not only that, but the clad cover over Nagasaki and then, Sweeney having an idea that if I drop it two miles over of - upriver, I can take out all the military targets and I wouldn't have to use the rebound effect, the famous(ph) shotgun through part of Nagasaki and leave much of the civilian population there.",
        "Had the bomb not been dropped right two-and-a half miles upriver, well, the hypocenter would have been right over the Mitsubishi offices where Mr. Yamaguchi was telling his boss what happened in Hiroshima.",

        "And my question, you know - well, I also hear, you know, stories about estimated fatalities, you know, had there not been a bomb, you know, how many millions of Japanese soldiers and American soldiers would have died versus how many hundreds of thousands, I believe it was, from the bombs.",
        "And so, my question is, is that correct, that there would have been many, many more times estimated fatalities total between both sides have we not dropped the bomb, or is that an inaccurate statement?",
        "Well, part of the evidence comes from the number of purple hearts that Truman ordered to be printed up by the United States Mint, what they were expecting under the MacArthur plan if we went in without these fire bombings.",
        "And, remember, the atomic...",
        "That's atomic bombing.",
        "...bombs were just considered two more firebombs, two more types of firebombs in the arsenal.",
        "We - it wasn't just Japan at their clear blue skies in the day and we dropped these two bombs.",
        "We were firebombing the whole country for weeks and weeks, running out of targets by the time we'd hit Hiroshima.",
        "And Truman had ordered for the land invasion, 400,000 purple hearts to be minted, and - in expectation of our losses invading Japan.",
        "And we're still using those purple huts today, through the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Gulf War I, Gulf War II into Afghanistan, we haven't used up all those purple hearts yet.",

        "One of the scientists, Luis Alvarez, had feared that the atomic bomb made war more impersonal, and nuclear weapon use would be more likely because you didn't really see what was happening to the people.",
        "And Fuoco said something to me that I was not expecting.",
        "He said, when I was on Bad Penny(ph), hitting Osaka or hitting Tokyo, they were over 300 other planes with me, and I knew I hit those gas tanks I was aiming at.",
        "When there were only a - so that when he heard 200,000 people died, he said there were plenty of other planes to spread that around.",
        "When it was only us, he said, and when we heard 70,000 estimated deaths in Hiroshima and he got tears in his eyes and he said, every one of those souls came back to us and to our three planes.",

        "We're talking with Charles Pellegrino about his most recent book, \"\"Last Train from Hiroshima.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
