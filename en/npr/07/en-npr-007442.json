        "When did you first hear that these re-enlistment bonuses were going to have to be revoked?",
        "I first learned about it, I think, the way most members of Congress did - by reading about it in the newspaper last week.",
        "The LA Times?",
        "Yes.",
        "And it seemed appalling to me that we would be going after these soldiers who were recruited to re-enlist and often went off to Iraq or Afghanistan and received these bonuses 10 years ago, had no reason to believe that they were not authorized bonuses.",
        "And now to have the Pentagon come after them for this money, it just seemed unconscionable to me, and I'd certainly like to get to the bottom of why nothing was done about this beforehand.",
        "But - and the Pentagon does say that, by law, it had to ask for reimbursement - this was law - unless Congress waived that.",
        "So the Pentagon was doing something that was correct in the sense of the law.",
        "But would you have expected the Pentagon to really come to Congress and beat the drum?",
        "I would have expected that, yes.",
        "And I would have expected the guard also to come to Congress and beat the drum, not just to include it among a list of asks for the year.",
        "The Pentagon had a choice.",
        "It could, if it felt obligated by law, seek collection as, in fact, it did.",
        "Or it could come to Congress and say, this is terribly inequitable.",
        "This was the result of a fraud committed by people in management at the California National Guard and perhaps other guard units as well.",
        "This is a problem not of these soldiers' making, and we would ask you to help intervene.",
        "I would be shocked if Congress didn't respond favorably to that kind of a request.",
        "But the bottom line is, these soldiers shouldn't be on the hook.",
        "And I'm not sure that the solution thus far, which is just a halt in collection, is really the full answer.",
        "I think there ought to be forgiveness of the debt.",
        "If there are select cases where soldiers understood that the bonuses were being offered fraudulently, that's one thing.",
        "But I don't think we want to throw the net over all those who answered the call of duty and just assume somehow they knew that they weren't authorized to receive these bonuses."

        "Is there any reason to think that they would have known if they're offered a bonus by a recruiter?",
        "I would think that any soldier that's offered a bonus by a recruiter ought to be able to rely on the representations of the recruiter that they're entitled to that bonus.",
        "Now, I suppose, in theory, it's possible that a recruiter told an enlistee - look, I can get you a bonus.",
        "You don't qualify for it, but, you know, I'm going to look the other way.",
        "I have to think that would have been exceedingly rare if that happened at all.",

        "Well re-election or no re-election, I think we all need to commit to make sure that these soldiers are made whole.",
        "Anyone who has paid back these bonuses ought to be able to recover that money with interest.",
        "Anyone who hasn't paid it should have that debt forgiven.",
        "They should all, frankly, be given a profound apology that they were even subject to this process.",

        "The first new meat was produced last night, when documents from the Clinton Library surfaced indicating that Kagan, when she worked in the Clinton White House, had urged the president - for political reasons - to support a compromise bill on so-called partial birth abortions - a compromise that would have banned such abortions, except to protect the health of the mother.",
        "The president did support the compromise, but the Republican-controlled Congress rejected the measure in favor of a stricter Republican-supported ban, which the president then vetoed.",
        "Other intellectual meat is to be found among the papers submitted at the time of Kagan's solicitor general confirmation hearing last year.",
        "In particular, there's a letter that Kagan signed - along with the deans of the Yale, Georgetown and Stanford law schools - opposing a key piece of legislation proposed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.",
        "Now, Lindsey Graham is not just any Republican senator.",
        "He was the only Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee who voted for the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court last year.",
        "And he's been a leading player in discussions over detainee rights at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
        "But in 2005, he was trying to strip the courts of jurisdiction to review almost anything that took place at Gitmo, and Kagan and the three other deans wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee opposing the Graham legislation.",
        "To put this most pointedly, the deans said in their letter, were the Graham amendment to become law, a person suspected of being a member of al-Qaida could be arrested, transferred to Guantanamo, detained indefinitely, subjected to inhumane treatment, tried before a military commission and sentenced to death without any express authorization from Congress and without review by any independent federal court.",
        "The American form of government was established precisely to prevent this kind of unreviewable exercise of power over the lives of individuals, the deans said.",
        "When dictatorships have passed similar laws, they added, our government has rightly challenged such acts as fundamentally lawless.",
        "The letter all but assures that Kagan will get a grilling on national security questions involving presidential power.",
        "That is particularly ironic, since liberal and human rights activists have been critical of Kagan for defending what they view as the Bush-lite positions taken by the Obama administration in war-on-terror issues."

        "The other issue guaranteed to rear its head stems from Kagan's actions with regard to military recruiters on campus at Harvard Law School when she was dean.",
        "She did not originate, but continued the policy of denying equal access to military recruiters because the school viewed the military's don't ask, don't tell policy as discrimination based on sexual orientation.",
        "Instead, military recruitment had to be done through a veterans group with few resources.",
        "Congress then passed a law cutting off federal funds to schools which refuse to allow military recruitment on campus, and in 2002, the Defense Department said that while Harvard Law School did not receive federal funds, the rest of the university did, to the tune of $328 million, and that the school would lose all of it if it didn't allow military recruiters equal access on the law school campus.",
