        "Now, for clarity's sake, I'd like to think of the crisis as a spiderweb.",
        "And let's start at the center.",
        "I'm assuming that the spider in this web right at the center would be Greece.",
        "Explain what would happen to that web if Greece does finally default.",
        "Well, a default from Greece would amount to a debt restructuring, whereby they would reduce the amount of debt they're going to pay back to borrowers and people who hold their bonds.",
        "So, the market's sort of thinking about a 50 percent haircut, as it's known.",
        "So, various banks in Europe who own Greek bonds would take a 50 percent loss as would the European Central Bank, which owns a lot of their collateral.",
        "And the European Central Bank, or the ECB, as it's known, has become a major player in the bond market.",
        "This is a very big web and it stretches all the way across the ocean to the United States.",
        "Yes.",
        "First, what is it that the U.S.",

        "Here are a couple of bits of perspective on the presidential campaign.",
        "One is that Donald Trump's campaign imploded a couple of times before his most recent implosion and came back.",
