        "The Kurds really believe Turkish security forces are secretly assisting the ISIS fighters or, at least, turning a blind eye, while Kurdish people trying to cross - especially young men at the border - are subjected to grilling and investigation.",
        "One example - we're in a hospital today, looking for wounded from Kobani.",
        "And it very soon became apparent that people suspected us of trying to identify Kurdish fighters who might then be arrested.",
        "So Kobani people are very happy to have a safe place here, but they don't exactly feel welcome.",
        "And Turkey has been unwilling, so far, to intervene to save Kobani, but it's still taken in 180,000 refugees from there.",
        "Now it seems some of those residents are making the much longer trek toward Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.",

        "The underbelly of that protection though is it's frequently someone who has a streak of violence.",
        "Ethiopians also count daylight hours differently.",
        "There are 12 hours for when the sun is shining and there are 12 hours for when the sun has gone to bed.",
        "So 6:00 a.m. in Paris or Milwaukee or Los Angeles would be midnight in Ethiopia.",
        "And midnight in Paris or Milwaukee or Los Angeles, well, here they call that hour 6:00 p.m. Understand?",
