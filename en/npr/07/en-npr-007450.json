        "That's Larry Collmus with the call and now the question is, can this colt become the first Triple Crown winner in 36 years.",
        "California Chrome's trainer is 77-year-old Art Sherman.",
        "He became the oldest trainer ever to win the Kentucky Derby and he joins me now from the race course in Los Alamitos, California, where he stables and trains about 15 horses.",
        "Mr. Sherman, congratulations.",

        "He's just something special.",
        "They don't come around very often, but when they do show up, you got to be awful thankful.",
        "Well, Mr. Sherman, you were a jockey for a long time, 23 years, before you became a trainer.",
        "Did you imagine yourself riding California Chrome as you watched him win with jockey Victor Espinoza on?",

        "Well, it's just demeanor and, you know, he's not a horse that you can press all the time.",
        "He's got so much natural ability, I like to keep him fresh into these races because, you know, they're so close together, you know.",
