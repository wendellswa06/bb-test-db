        "What strikes me, though, is you're opening your campaign - and they've been doing this on the stump as well - with looking backwards.",
        "And the cliche of re-election campaigns is they don't vote for you because of what you already did, they vote for you, what you're about to do.",
        "And I would say that's because the Obama campaign has a relatively meager set of offerings for the next four years, but they've got what they think of as a good story to tell about the past.",
        "But it's a pretty backward-looking way to open a campaign, I'd say.",

        "What do you make of it?",

        "The left to say, hey, you may not be completely happy with Obama, but look at the tough stuff he did to make change.",
