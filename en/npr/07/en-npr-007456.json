        "So I think if people can be open to it, whatever their sexuality is, it can really be a sort of time machine, taking people back to some of the most vivid, passionate, all-encompassing times in their life.",

        "Obama outlined what he called the American Jobs Act, and repeatedly called on lawmakers to pass it right away.",
        "The proposal includes a cut in payroll taxes for both employers and employees.",
        "That would make it cheaper for employers to hire new workers, and give employees a boost in their take-home pay, some $1,500 dollars a year for the typical family.",
        "Workers already got a smaller break on their payroll taxes this year, but it's due to expire at the end of December.",
        "And Mr. Obama challenged lawmakers, including skeptical Republicans, not to let that happen."

        "So this new proposal is likely to face a much tougher hearing.",
        "Economist Nigel Gault of IHS Global Insight thinks the original stimulus worked, but many people don't see it that way.",

        "So I presume that I'm not going to be listening to the Beach Boys or anything else on this for a while, but what do you hope to do with it?",
        "There are many different applications.",
        "This was sponsored by a program here at Berkeley that is to develop small-scale sensors that can monitor air and water quality throughout the country.",
        "For that to happen, we needed very low-power small sensors and to transmit and receive data so you could click on the Web and say, well, what's the quality of air like in any place in New York today or Washington or San Francisco.",
        "And you'd get a real-time map of that generated by many sensors.",
        "One can think of other applications as well.",
        "For example, the size of this radio is now smaller than living cells.",
        "It can be integrated inside of cells or one could implant it in other biological structures such as a brain, transmit information to that and have that information be coupled into the biological system so people with brain dysfunctions or hearing loss, vision loss, one can imagine that this could help."
