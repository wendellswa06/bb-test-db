        "And the Republicans have told everybody they're all going to vote no. Well, if they think this can pop up really easily again, I think they may have another thing coming.",

        "David, just what is it that the Republicans voted against and what does that vote actually mean?",
        "Well, Michele, technically they voted against a motion to proceed.",
        "But this kind of move was, in fact, what's better known as a filibuster, which requires only 41 votes to be effective.",
        "And in fact, they got 47 Republican votes.",
        "And interestingly, several of those no votes came from Republicans who are actually sponsoring the resolution that rejects President Bush's troop increase - such senators as John Warner, its chief sponsor, Chuck Hagel, Susan Collins, Norm Coleman and Olympia Snowe.",
        "And some of them said that they were sure that the parties' two leaders will work how to compromise and the debate can then move forward.",
        "But, you know, I think what we saw today was Republican Party loyalty trumping the desire of some Republicans to distance themselves from the president's Iraq policies."

        "So this is the line that we put in place in April of 2009, and this replaced a line that had been here for about 25 years.",

        "His job is to figure out how to make things more efficiently.",
        "So he asked everyone - the factory workers, the designers, the marketers - to put their heads together, and they managed to cut down the time it takes to build that dishwasher by a third.",
        "On the old dishwasher line, the operators will have to mainly manipulate the dishwasher to get an orientation they needed for building it.",
        "Very simply, the team kind of used gravity and some simple rails to allow the dishwasher to tilt back so the operators in the next section of the line can do their work and not have to constantly manipulate it.",
        "Every time an operator manipulated a tub, it wastes a few seconds.",
        "If you did that multiple times, all those seconds add up.",
        "Even though it now takes fewer people to make that dishwasher, not a single person was laid off.",
        "Calvaruso explains that they were freed up to work in other parts of the company.",
        "And that process set in motion a company-wide re-evaluation of how GE should operate.",
        "A new philosophy: The idea that it might make more business sense to have everyone involved in a product work in the same place.",
        "And that thinking led to a change that couldn't have happened if some workers were in China and some were in Mexico and some were in the U.S.",
        "So here's an example: GE made a dishwasher that was good, but it didn't look good.",
        "The marketing team wanted to eliminate four visible screws in the door to make a sleeker-looking machine.",

        "Now, I think some Democrats may actually be secretly glad that this is not happening at this point because they were quite uncomfortable with some of the language in John Warner's resolution, such as the language that says there won't be any cutoff for funding for troops or that troop levels will not be reduced, another item in there.",
        "And I think that they thought that that would foreclose the possibility of taking binding action down the road for them.",
