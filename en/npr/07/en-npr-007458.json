        "Well, it could come up possibly next week.",
        "But most certainly, I think we're going to have a debate over the Iraq policies when Congress considers the money that President Bush is asking for in his budget, especially $245 billion for the war.",
        "Thank you, David.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "That was NPR congressional correspondent David Welna.",
        "If Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim does push to expand Iran's influence in Iraq, he will deeply unsettle at least one of Iraq's neighbors, Saudi Arabia.",
        "For more on this, we turn to Youssef Ibrahim, a longtime Middle East watcher and former journalist who's now in the risk assessment business.",
        "I asked him how tomorrow's visit is seen in Saudi Arabia.",
        "Well, in the general, the Saudis have been anxious and upset about the ascendancy of Shiite structure in Iraq, having already been upset for the last 20 years about an ascendant and very activist Shiite regime in Iran.",
        "And the reason for this, of course, is that they have a lot of Shiites in Saudi Arabia and they have them specifically in the oil producing regions.",
        "Now, you have been following all of this in the Saudi press.",
        "What are you reading there about al-Hakim's planned visit with President Bush?",
        "The visit itself is just coming onto the screen now.",
        "And I read yesterday and today a few columns in two Saudi newspapers expressions of anxiety about the failure of the Maliki government, the behavior of Maliki in Jordan, the fact that the current government is not proving to be much better than the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip, and with hints that the Hamas government failure is there to begin Iranian influence.",
        "Iran-Shiite catastrophe."

        "We've heard from our correspondents in Baghdad that there is talk that Iraq is now becoming a proxy battleground between the competing Saudi and Iranian interests.",
        "I'm afraid it is definitely heading in that direction.",
        "And it's not only Saudi.",
        "We know from intelligence reports and from several contacts in the region that the Jordanians are helping the Sunnis in there and eventually the Egyptians will be involved.",
        "Now, you say there are Intelligence reports that the Jordanians have actually been helping Sunnis in Iraq, and just this past week an advisor to the Saudi government had a piece in the Washington Post saying that Saudi Arabia might be stepping in and supporting Sunnis should the United States pull out.",
        "Now, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.",
        "has denied this.",
        "What's your sense?",
        "Would the Saudi government prepare to give military support to the Iraqi Sunnis?",
        "I have absolutely no doubt that this is going to happen.",
        "They have joint borders, and in fact the Kuwaitis are doing the same thing as well.",
        "And it's not only weapons.",
        "Mostly so far it's really been money and insurgent connections and smuggling of people.",
        "I mean people are going in there to fight and the borders are porous.",
        "Now, the Saudi government has ordered the construction of a fence along its border with Iraq, a 560-mile fence.",
        "Now, is this for security reasons or is this to prevent the flow of refugees?",
        "It's without any question for security reasons.",
        "They can handle Iraqi refugees and there aren't really that many Iraqi Sunni who will seek refuge in Saudi Arabia.",

        "Now, think about it.",
        "Just four years ago, fewer than 2,000 people worked at Appliance Park in Louisville, a place that once employed 23,000.",
        "But in just four years, the number of workers there as tripled with more coming soon.",
        "And reporter Charles Fishman, who wrote about Appliance Park in the latest issue of The Atlantic, doesn't think it's a blip.",
        "This past week, Apple announced it'll start producing some of its Mac computers in the U.S., even the Chinese manufacturing company Foxconn now says it'll expand its operations here.",
        "And Fishman sees the four-screw story as a metaphor for this insourcing boomlet.",
        "To me, the power of the four-screw story is no one ever would have known in the old method a year and a half ago that anybody wanted the screws to disappear, that making the screws go away makes the door cheaper, easier to make and a better product.",
        "And that's what that story sort of shows you.",
        "So why wouldn't it have been possible 18 months ago?",
        "I mean, why couldn't that four-screw story have happened two years ago?"

        "I kind of don't care what my other costs are.",

        "You don't have to do anything with the dryer.",
        "All of that gives the products, you know, a competitive advantage in the market.",
        "But what happens when you make them overseas is that the people making them knock off your products.",
        "So one of the reasons for bringing this manufacturing back home is to literally protect the special features that a place like GE or Otis Elevator thinks its products have in another country.",
        "How much of this so-called insourcing boomlet has to do with oil prices or even all the natural gas that's being exploded in the U.S.",
        "I don't think you can say just wages or just energy prices or just transportation time.",
        "But when you stack them up, it really gets to be incredible.",
        "So oil prices are three times what they were just 10 years ago.",

        "across the Pacific.",
        "Natural gas costs a quarter in the U.S.",
        "what it does in Asia, and a huge factory like Appliance Park can rely on natural gas to generate power.",

        "It takes five weeks from the moment you put a refrigerator or a dishwasher on the ship in China until it gets to the port in California.",
        "Then, of course, it has to get from Los Angeles to somewhere in the U.S.",
        "I said, so how long does it take to get the product into distribution from this factory?",

        "And if the economy picks up, companies are going to look at what GE is doing and realize they need to do this, too, in order to stay competitive.",
        "So, Charles, for the last four years of the recession, we've been hearing about job loss and how those jobs are not coming back, manufacturing jobs are not coming back to the United States.",

        "No.",
