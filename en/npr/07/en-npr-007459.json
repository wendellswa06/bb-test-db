        "Just like they did in Iowa, they've used millions of dollars in negative ads to destroy a Gingrich surge.",
        "For some reason, Gingrich held back in the debate in Tampa on Monday, but tonight, I do expect we're going to see the old tough combative Newt.",
        "He gave a preview of some of the attacks he might level tonight when he made a blistering attack on Romney in Florida today.",
        "We're not going to beat Barack Obama with some guy who has Suisse bank accounts, Cayman Island accounts, owns shares of Goldman Sachs who had foreclosures in Florida and is himself a stockholder in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac while he tries to think the rest of us are too stupid to put the dots together and understand what this is all about.",
        "Newt Gingrich knows that Florida is his last chance.",
        "He needs to win here in order to slow Mitt Romney's momentum.",
        "Now, after he lost in South Carolina, Mitt Romney in the first debate in Tampa on Monday directly engaged with Newt Gingrich in a way he really hadn't before.",
        "He'd been sort of taking a frontrunner's position taking on President Obama.",
        "Do you think that Mitt Romney again will continue that aggressive posture against Newt Gingrich to hold onto this lead that he has at least in the polls?"
