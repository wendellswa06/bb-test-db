        "Two of his soldiers are still missing after being abducted by insurgents over a month ago.",
        "Now we're past the four-week point, you know?",
        "And every day where I don't see some indication of proof of life causes me concern.",
        "Most of those killed in the division have been victims of roadside bombs.",
        "Lynch says he has a group of 18 experts from all the services and various branches of the government who do nothing but figure out ways to outsmart these bombs.",
        "One way is to move his troops by air.",
        "With the arrival of more helicopters, he hopes casualties will go down.",
        "Because it allows us to get to time-sensitive targets or get to locations for cordon and search operations in a quick fashion, and then conduct operations without endangering our soldiers by having to drive there or drive back.",
        "According to Lynch, 10 percent of his area of operation has no security at all.",
        "He points to four key sanctuaries where Sunni and Shiite extremists can base their operations.",
        "He believes his forces will be able to clear those areas by September.",
        "But he needs more Iraqi security forces to hold them.",
        "In unusually stark terms, Lynch laid out things the Iraqi government has to do.",
        "It has to clean up the police and the government has to stop undercutting the good security forces when they arrest bad people.",
        "Well, that's always been the case, right?",
        "And I took the camera very quietly and grabbed a couple pictures.",
        "The magazine ran one - not very big.",
        "Later on, about ten or eleven months later, the magazine then assigned me to photograph Bob Kennedy campaigning in 1966.",
        "I went and I introduced myself to the senator, told him what I wanted to do.",
        "I said I want to stick right with you, and he looked at me kind of funny, he says, okay.",
        "But no cigars, huh?",
        "And I just - he remembered me.",
        "What was Bobby Kennedy like as a subject?",
        "He was a gentleman.",
        "And as a subject, he did something that I really love and it's the way I've worked all my life, is that he did nothing special for me.",
        "He ignored me.",
        "And by ignoring me he allowed me to photograph moments that were really true moments; not set up, not photo ops, but just moments that happened, and I loved it.",
        "One of those moments would turn out to be the most tragic of them all.",
        "Bill Eppridge was with Bobby Kennedy the night he was shot 40 years ago and he would end up taking an iconic photograph showing a fallen Bobby Kennedy.",
        "His arms are outstretched, a glow of light illuminates his head and a young man kneels beside him."

        "When the senator was finished speaking, the exit that we were going to go out was across the ballroom, and the photographers usually formed a wedge in front of the candidate so that we backed through the crowd and gave him room to shake hands.",
        "Senator came off the stage, the bodyguard said, senator, this way, pointing to the door.",
        "And I remember, 'cause I was right next to him, Bob Kennedy said, no, this way, and turned and went to the right to the kitchen.",

        "And then the shooting started.",

        "Yes.",
        "The busboy who was holding him, Juan Romero - I made three frames of that situation.",
        "In the third one he's looking up and there's this look of, you know, help on his face.",
