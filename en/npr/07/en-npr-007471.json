        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "As you said, we saw really unusually early torrential rains in southern Africa.",
        "So these four countries - Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe - have really been hit hard.",
        "Mozambique hit the hardest.",
        "You've got nearly 450,000 people who need immediate humanitarian assistance.",
        "Everything the you can imagine, from clean water to basic medical care.",
        "I understand the U.N.",
        "has made a plea for help.",
        "What are you asking for and what's the response been?",
        "We launched a consolidated appeal on Friday, and what that means is that we need $89 million.",
        "It is the International Relief Aid Community that has come together to determine that figure, to help the hundreds of thousands of people in these flood-hit areas.",
        "This will also enable us to meet their food, shelter, water, medical, other basic needs, and prepare in case there are worse floods down the line.",
        "We're only halfway through the rainy season, so we really need to ensure that we can support the work that government and the international community have already been doing to meet the needs of these people going forward.",
        "So the people who've been displaced, where are they going?",
        "Are they going to camps that have been set up?",
        "What kinds of situations are they headed towards?",
        "Yes, they are in re-settlement areas.",
        "For example, in Mozambique you have 258,000 people, 90,000 of whom have been displaced over the past month or so.",
        "In Malawi you already have 700 cholera cases that have been reported.",
        "You have about 152,000 people who have been affected.",
        "So they are moving away from their home areas into re-settlement camps.",
        "Let's move to Kenya in the east of Africa.",
        "The talks between President Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga continue today outside of Nairobi and the negotiations are being mediated by former U.N.",
        "Secretary General Kofi Annan.",
        "Since the post-election violence began in late December, more than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.",
        "There are also reports of a wave of sexual violence against women who've been displaced by this turmoil.",
        "So Cassandra, what's going on here?",
        "Since the violence after the disputed elections on December 27th, we're seeing that this situation has put women and girls at great risk of sexual assault.",
        "We know that always in situations of conflict women and girls are in danger.",
        "And in Kenya it is no different.",
        "We are hearing reports from Nairobi, from the Nairobi general hospital, that there may be as many as double the number of cases of rape within the days following the eruption of the violence.",
        "And what we know is that for every case that is being treated or is being reported, there are many more victims who fail to seek help.",
        "Is this a situation where women are being raped as a retaliation or as a part of the targeted violence, or is it a crime of opportunity?",
        "You know, it's very difficult to know what the motivation is.",
        "We know that it's too early to tell at this stage.",
        "But what we can say is that as you rightly pointed out, these are crimes of opportunity.",
        "It's simply because of the breakdown in law and order.",
        "You have a gang that finds a woman who may be looking for firewood or a couple of young girls who are fetching water and they take advantage of the situation.",
        "They know that there is a climate of impunity and they are convinced that there will be no consequences.",
        "So what we are doing is really calling on all parties, all governments, to endure that there is consequence for these crimes, that rape is treated as a crime, that states must hold perpetrators accountable, and that there must be resources available for the victims to seek justice."

        "When you look at these issues from the perspective of your position at the United Nations Development Program, what kinds of solutions or protections or suggestions have you put out there?",

        "I mean, they're - it's kind of like shell shock.",
        "They're - in the metro this morning, it was sort of eerily quiet, people hunched over their cellphones watching these videos of riot police beating voters, dragging them by the hair, bloodied faces.",
        "Morning newspapers here, and frankly around the world, are a lot of variations on the same headline - \"\"Verguenza\"\" - shame.",
        "Here's one woman.",
        "She was on the street.",

        "I would say that psychologically a lot of the Catalan people, a big majority of the Catalan people, have already left the Spanish state.",
        "So as you said, Catalan leaders propose a declaration of independence in the coming days.",
        "This woman says it's kind of done already in people's minds.",
        "A red line has been crossed.",
        "Lauren, will you help us understand what the underlying narrative is here?",
        "And now that's actually a really important thing in a situation like this.",
        "What is the claim of this region to a separate identity, an independent national identity, from Spain at large?",
        "Catalans have their own language, their own culture, as do many regions of Spain, like the neighboring Basque country.",
        "The Catalan language and culture were repressed under a nearly 40-year dictatorship of Francisco Franco.",
        "That dictator only died in 1975, so anybody older than 40 remembers him and remembers that repression.",
        "There's also an economic argument.",
        "I mean, Catalonia since then has become Spain's richest region, and especially during the economic crisis, people here resented having their tax revenue subsidize poorer parts of Spain.",
        "They'd rather go it alone.",
        "And one other thing - is there a good sense of how the referendum turned out?",
        "Even though it was disrupted by police, is there any kind of legitimate result?",
        "It's important to note that it was the separatists who run the regional government here who were doing the vote counting.",
        "So they're not unbiased outsiders.",
        "But around 2 a.m. this morning, they announced results - 90 percent in favor of independence, 8 percent opposed.",
        "Turnout was about 50 percent.",
        "It's impossible to know if these figures are real and accurate.",
        "What we don't know is that - whether half of the Catalans who did not vote, vote - didn't do that because they're opposed to independence, whether they were intimidated by the voilence, or whether they would have voted in a referendum that was legal.",
        "This one was not, under Spanish law."

        "I mean, the early polls gave anything between 45 to 49 percent to Berlusconi's coalition--between 50 and 54 percent to Prodi's.",
        "So it's not, it's not a squeaker.",
        "And so what will this mean for Italy if Berlusconi is out and Prodi's coalition gains power?",
        "It will mean a lot of things.",
        "I mean, it may mean the end of the Berlusconi era.",
        "It's kind of hard to overstate how much he's dominated Italy's politics; its business world; its media; he owns, you know, the Milan soccer club.",
        "He's an incredibly idiosyncratic person, who some people feel that's sort of, you know, ruled Italy by, sort of, whim and eccentricity over quite a lot of years."

        "Right.",
        "And his support for President Bush's policies in Iraq has been controversial in Italy.",
        "It has been, but I don't know as I would say it was decisive.",

        "Plus, I think there were some character issues.",
