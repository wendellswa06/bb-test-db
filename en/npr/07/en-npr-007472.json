        "Western governments believe that flight MH17 was hit by a Russian surface-to-air missile, but there is still no official determination of who was responsible.",

        "Now the work, unfortunately and sadly, was suspended near the end of June because when it came to crossing over to Luhansk Oblast, which is under the control of the rebels, they weren't allowed in.",
        "So the quick answer is the investigation can't be completed because of interruption on the ground.",

        "Little green men meaning Russian paramilitary.",
        "Well, you had guys without insignia, in uniform, carrying light weaponry.",
        "We should explain - a number of news organizations have identified them through conversations with some of the soldiers as Russian.",

        "But there was growth in one corner of the musical universe, American Indian musicians who are embracing classical music.",
        "They're drawing as much from the music of Claude Debussy as from traditional American Indian harvest songs.",
        "And as NPR's Felix Contreras reports, the music and the musicians are getting noticed."

        "And that's how it was for Chickasaw composer Jerod Tate until his mother, a professor of dance and professional choreographer, asked him to write music for a ballet she created.",
        "He'd been studying European classical piano and composition.",
        "I didn't mix my identity of being a very classically trained musician with being an American Indian.",
        "I never saw that there was even a possible relationship with those two until I started composing.",
        "And that's when those two came together in a way that really made me feel just wonderful.",
        "Since 1992, Tate has been exploring his culture through classical music, and his work has been performed by orchestras in Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, New Mexico, and San Francisco."
