        "He was a major, like, top-top, like, radio singer.",
        "And so he popularized the style, like in a way, all over Brazil.",

        "Okay.",
        "It's a song by Luiz Gonzaga, and he wrote this song about a farm of his friend.",
        "And in this song, he states that there is a little river that goes by the farm that goes into a bigger river, then into Rio San Francisco, which is a big river in Brazil, and then all the way to the ocean.",
        "But that's the first verse.",
        "In the second verse, he said that, if he was a fish, instead of going downstream - the natural course of the water - he would swim all the way from the ocean to the Riacho Do Navio where - because the farm is really beautiful.",
        "Okay.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well, let me stick with the case of Kenya specifically.",
        "One of the things that we are looking the do is ensure that all recovery programs to help the country get back up on its feet would also look at women's vulnerability as a major priority and ensure that women are protected.",
        "We are suggesting that community patrols could help protect women as they go about the daily task of fetching water or gathering wood.",
        "And again, I would repeat that our feeling is really that rape must be treated as crime."

        "And we know that in Kenya some of the larger hospitals are setting up satellites centers in badly affected areas so that they can provide a minimum of service to all injured people, but particularly those who suffer sexual attacks.",
        "And as I said earlier, the Nairobi Women's Hospital in collaboration with the Psychological Association of Kenya has opened counseling centers in some of the slum areas and some of the worse affected areas hit by the violence in the capital.",
        "Some of the issues you've been talking about in Kenya really have to do with the role of the government and how well it functions.",
        "And the topic or the issue of good governance in Africa comes up again and again when it comes to everything from elections to how well governments function to their financial policies.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "We today are launching a $390 million governance program with the government, and you know, it's a real indication of the understanding that elections are not the be all and end all.",
        "They are an important step.",
        "But you must go much further and much deeper to ensure that government has the capacity to ensure the security of its people, that you give people access to government, that they have a voice, that government is accountable, that institutions in the country are able to manage their funds, their budgets effectively, ensuring that the media have a voice and that they have the space that they need, that non-governmental organizations have the space that they need.",
        "Looking after the human rights issue and ensuring that people feel that they won't be persecuted if they speak up.",
        "And these are things that we find very important in a country like DRC and across Africa.",
        "You know, I was in DRC when they had their presidential elections in 2006 and in Liberia during their elections in 2005, and those are monumental occasions, monumental achievements.",
        "But there is so much more that needs to be done in a country that's coming out of conflict after multiparty elections.",
        "What about the issue of how a government functions day to day, particularly who should have oversight - because there's also the touchy issue of whether or not outsiders should really have a large role in inspecting the day to day operations of another nation.",
        "From the United Nations perspective we understand that this is a partnership with developing country governments.",
        "So it is about national ownership and it's about partnering with them, but helping build their capacity so that they can do a better job to meet the needs of their people.",
        "You know, we look at political governance to ensure that institutions like the parliaments, like the provincial assemblies, can do their jobs more effectively; administrative governance to ensure that different entities in government speak to each other, that we know how many people are on civil service roles, you know, how many people are working for government.",
        "So we make sure that there is no waste and that you're not paying people who may not be there, may be deceased, may not be doing the job effectively.",
        "So those are all the kinds of things that we work with governments to do, to rationalize the kinds of services that they are offering and how best they should organize their institutions.",

        "The cancer had already spread through her abdomen.",
