        "Yet, as Edward Albee points out, when great American playwrights are celebrated, Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams are the names you usually hear, not Thornton Wilder, who wrote \"\"Our Town.\"\" He was also an acclaimed novelist and essayist.",
        "But no drama is more enduring than \"\"Our Town,\"\" which won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.",

        "It's folks like Ann Coulter, Newt Gingrich.",

        "That's right.",
