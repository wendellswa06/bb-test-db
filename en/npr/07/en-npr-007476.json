        "And with ovarian cancer, the signs are very subtle.",
        "They're very muted, and they're easily misunderstood - not only by doctors but by the patient herself, because many women experience fatigue or bloating or indigestion, and these are just symptoms you put up with.",
        "You feel you don't want to whine about them.",
        "And they're often misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome; or possibly as menopausal or depression or hernia.",
        "So I think it is easy to sort of not register these signs, to not really - to hear them as the noise of the midlife body, and not to really understand what they signify.",
        "But yes, in my case, I think I simply repressed it.",

        "Yes, I did.",
        "I was convinced that if I did a lot of stretching and yoga and breathing, and I ate the proper foods and enough fiber - and some prune juice, maybe - all would be well, and all manner of things would be well.",
        "You are also defying the sort of cultural place that we've put cancer - I know you say you're confused yourself; victims, survivors, whatever the term is - that you must always fight the disease, you must never give in to the - what you seem to have accepted as the fact that you're going to die with ovarian cancer.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think that some of this idea that you have to be fighting the disease till the very end makes people feel culpable for being discouraged, and for knowing at a certain point that the quality of their life will be hurt by the treatments that might extend their life.",
        "And I think we have to be more sensitive to people's decisions.",
        "They're very personal decisions, and they're very difficult to make.",
        "I wanted to read you this email that we got from Hayley(ph) in Portland: I'm 38 and underwent a hysterectomy for ovarian cancer eight months ago.",
        "My ovaries and uterus have been removed.",
        "What are some of the most surprising things you learned about the cultural perceptions about womanhood, as a feminist, after undergoing your debulking surgery?",
        "I, myself, never planned on having kids, but I still heard socking comments about how my surgery was not a big deal since I was never going to use my uterus anyway.",

        "Most debulking operations in America actually are called sub-optimal, which means that there is some visible evidence of cancer left in the body, and that means it will recur.",
        "So this is a devastating diagnosis.",
        "It is also one of those moments - you write in the book that patients, before surgery, normally have conversations with their surgeons about what's going to happen, and what's going to happen afterwards.",
        "Debulking - you don't know what's going to happen.",
        "And it's really not malevolence on the part of the surgeons.",
        "I mean, they don't know.",
        "The tests don't tell them what's happened inside the body.",
        "And even scans, even CT scans sometimes are completely inaccurate, in terms of what's going on inside the body.",
        "So until they slit the body open - excuse my explicit language - from the belly button to the pubic bone, they don't really know what they're going to find, and what they're going to have to do.",
        "And therefore, they decide after they've taken a look.",
        "Right, which means that the woman has no volition or agency, and no decision-making role in this.",

        "Yeah, that's what they used to do in the old days.",
        "They would open up a woman and if the cancer was very bad, they would just stitch her up again.",
        "And they called it peek and shriek.",

        "Not in time, right, right.",
