        "State media here in China is reporting that at least 40,000 companies and institutions have been hit by this particular ransomware attack.",
        "Universities were particularly vulnerable.",

        "Oil companies, too - PetroChina reported that the attack had disrupted the electric payment systems at many of its gas stations over the weekend.",
        "And finally, a couple of major cities in China reported that their traffic departments had to disconnect from the internet entirely after the attack over this weekend.",
        "Wow.",
        "So it also looks like Microsoft is placing some of the blame on all of this at the feet of the NSA, the National Security Agency here in the U.S.",
