        "Where and when did Thornton Wilder write \"\"Our Town,\"\" near as you can determine?",
        "He wrote the play all over the map.",
        "He wrote \"\"Our Town\"\" at the McDowell colony, up in Peterborough, New Hampshire.",
        "And he wrote \"\"Our Town\"\" in a little hotel on the outskirts of Zurich, Switzerland, and he wrote \"\"Our Town\"\" on Long Island.",
        "He wrote it on ships, and he wrote it on trains and he wrote it wherever he happened to be.",
        "And all the while, Scott, while he was traveling around to write, he was listening, he was observing, he was a witness.",
        "He loved to pick up some conversation in a bar, or on the train or in a restaurant and somehow later to incorporate that into the play.",
        "He's very much attuned to the American vernacular while he's working on \"\"Our Town,\"\" even if he's working on it in Switzerland.",
        "He still has, in his ear, the cadences and the vocabulary of the American experience.",
        "Does that moving around help to invest the play with a sense of Grover's Corner as an every place, if you please?",
        "I think so.",
        "I think that's a great observation.",
        "He invents Grover's Corner.",
        "This is a little mythical village.",
        "And in this mythical village, he incorporates characteristics from every mythical village.",
        "I grew up in a little town in North Carolina, population 800.",
        "When I read \"\"Our Town\"\" as a teenager, I was positive the play had been written about Waxhaw, North Carolina.",
        "And it's so interesting to look at translations - there have been 70 or more translations of \"\"Our Town.\"\" And I love picking up those editions and looking at the covers.",
        "And if it's been translated in Poland or Germany, Korea, the cover picture is not Grover's Corners, New Hampshire.",
        "It's a village or a town in that particular country.",
        "It's just vivid, graphic documentation of the universal connection that this play has made.",
        "I want us to hear one of the most quoted and moving speeches of all literature.",
        "It's recited by high school students, and in auditions and by actors and actresses.",
        "(as Emily Webb) Goodbye to clocks ticking...",
        "That, of course, is a speech.",
        "Emily Webb dies, comes back to earth for a day.",
        "The actress here is Maggie Lacey.",
        "(as Emily Webb) ...new, ironed dresses, and hot baths, and sleeping, and waking up.",
        "Oh Earth, you're too wonderful for anybody to realize you.",
        "Where do you think this speech comes from?",
        "I think it comes from deep within Thornton Wilder's heart and spirit.",
        "It brings to mind conversations I've had recently with so many people who are in the play, people who saw the play, people that directed the play.",
        "But two actors, in particular, who are in their wonderfully mature years have said to me they never fully comprehended Emily's words until now in their 70s and in their 80s.",
        "The play has brought them to tears in ways it didn't when they were 20, or 40 or 60 years younger.",
        "Reminds us - it's something I've certainly taken to heart since I've had the privilege of working on this biography - that is, as Emily says, every everyday matters; every moment.",
        "And Thornton was so concerned about just the value of every moment, of the most ordinary part of the most ordinary day, to look at the now and look at each other - really look at each other - how wonderful that Thornton and Emily remind us about those opportunities."

        "He was also a longtime associate of Abu Bakr Bashir.",

        "I don't think that the public in general have any particular sympathy for JI.",
        "What the public does have, says political analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar, is a deep suspicion of the West and residual distrust of its own government after 30 years of authoritarian rule under the ex-dictator Suharto."

        "I think JI has changed.",
        "I think there seem to be a number of people at fairly senior levels of the organization who believe that the bombing operations that have taken place have simply decimated the membership and thrown the organization into serious disarray, diverting the organization from its longer-term goal of trying to establish an Islamic state in Indonesia.",
        "Three years after the Bali bombings, Jones says it is no longer accurate to view Jemaah Islamiah as al-Qaeda's Southeast Asian affiliate.",
