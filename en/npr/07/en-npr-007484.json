        "Definitely do an internship.",
        "And for me, it was networking.",
        "I met my boss, she owned a restaurant.",
        "I asked to volunteer for one of her other businesses, and that's how I started working for her.",
        "So just be willing to take on something extra, and that's what I'm telling them.",

        "I do think so.",
        "In fact, that's similar advice to what I would give is keeping an open mind, really thinking through all the different possibilities that are out there early in your career and then networking and making it a little more personal.",
        "Making it personal so that - as opposed to that faceless resume people say, oh, yeah, I remember her.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that job as an intern, a lot of people say wait a minute, this is indentured slavery.",
        "Well, believe it or not, most internships are paid, and they're a great way to gain relevant work experience and also, you know, kind of add to that resume and skill set.",
        "But even if you can't get an official internship, you can get work experience.",
        "It gives you good soft skills that you can share in those examples that Mandolin talked about."

        "And I've done at least 40 interviews, and I'm being turned down just about everywhere.",

        "But I think really for me, what I'm hearing the most is that I'm overqualified for positions that I'm completely willing to take, such as being a receptionist or doing administrative work, but I'm not qualified enough, only having a college degree, for positions, you know, in the nonprofit field, in the nonprofit sector that I'd like to join into.",

        "I think a lot of it is the fear that you're going to leave.",
        "So companies are afraid to hire and put money and time investing into you as a receptionist, knowing that you don't have intentions of staying in that position.",
        "I think they'd really prefer to hire someone who, you know, that's what they want to do, that's what they're really, really good at, and that's where their skill set lies, and they are not interested in leaving in a year or two, even if it's within the same company.",
        "All right, Marie Artim, is there - there was once such a thing as the entry level job that you worked your way up out of, hopefully.",

        "It was.",

        "So I went over there.",
        "Funny that you should ask me that.",

        "So our management training program that I just spoke of is intended to bring people into our business, give them a chance to learn to run a business, learn a lot of different skills and then really kind of guide their career based on their skills, their qualifications, what they're strong at.",
        "You know, I started as a management trainee a while back and, you know, so did our CEO, COO.",
        "So there are plenty of companies still out there that look at it that way.",
        "I think that's back to that whole idea of an open mind.",
        "So if the specific job you want today may not be available to you, what are some paths or some skill sets that you can learn to help you get there?",
        "So Mary, what are you doing in the meantime?",
        "Right now I've got a little bit of success doing just some temporary work.",
        "I went to an employment agency, and they were able to find a part-time job doing technical writing for a local engineering firm, and I'm really loving the people there.",

        "We have a two-year-old daughter.",
        "I'm getting married in May, and there are certain things that you need.",
        "You'd love to be able to do an internship to get an experience or start at a really low, entry-level position.",
        "But at the same time, when you have a family, there are certain qualifications for a job you have to accept that have to be met."
