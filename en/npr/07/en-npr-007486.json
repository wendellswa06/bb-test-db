        "Thank you.",
        "I think he's missing perhaps a very important point, and Tom Freidman talked about it in an editorial in the New York Times recently, and it's that it used to be that if you had a college degree, you had a job if you wanted one.",
        "And today, the truth of the matter is average is over.",

        "What are you looking for when you hire?",
        "Sure, we actually do hire people from all different degrees, but it's people who no matter what the degree are interested in an opportunity in business and management or leadership because that's the opportunity we have available.",
        "So we have plenty of great success stories that are communications majors or communications degrees, but those who are passionate about writing may not find their niche with us.",
        "But those that do that and use those skills as a way to then develop their leadership and their problem-solving and their flexibility in their communication, to take that and be successful in the business world, we have a training program to help them to kind of hone those skills and develop that into something they can use.",
        "And how would somebody with a communications degree communicate those abilities to you in a resume?",
        "I think very similar to what William said.",
        "I agree, you know, wholeheartedly with a lot of what he shared.",
        "And that resume has to be about your accomplishments, your results and how they communicate to the job you're trying to get.",
        "So, you know, someone with a communications degree that's been involved in activities on campus, philanthropies, jobs while they're going to school that involve any type of business skill, any type of communication, leadership or management of a project, those are going to be transferable no matter what type of background you're going towards.",

        "So you outsourced your own job?",
        "I did, I did.",
        "I outsourced my own job.",
        "I found myself in a foreign country and didn't know the language, and, you know, all those skills worked really well for, you know, jobs after that."

        "No, I ended up getting a job in the States, and that just looked so great on the resume.",

        "Bill Holland, that's an important point: Doing something as adventurous as that is going to stick out on the next resume.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "In fact, in anticipation of coming on this program, I set down and wrote out what a good lead-in to a resume might look like, if in fact you can back it up with accomplishments.",
        "And a good lead-in might sound something like this: Computer literate, graduating honors college senior with proven communication, team-building and leadership skills, who has been able to make a difference under challenging circumstances in communities in which she has volunteered and worked.",
        "That, if you can put that forward like that and back it up with what you're doing and promise to do, that'll open a lot of eyes and a lot of opportunities."

        "Many of their employees are willing to help young graduates network.",

        "Network, everybody talks about it, what does it actually mean?",
        "For me, networking is just, you know, making those connections, having a conversation.",
        "It can be virtual.",
        "It can be an email conversation.",
        "You can do it even through a LinkedIn, but, you know, something like that.",
        "But if you're making the connection where you have something in common, or you have an interest that you share or a connection that you share that allows you to get someone that's kind of an influencer, someone on your side as you go through this.",

        "Hello?",

        "Hi, I graduated with a degree in English and sociology, and it took me a year and a half of working, you know, 10 or less hours a week in my field and waiting tables on the side before I ended up actually getting a referral to work at General Motors.",
        "So my degree, I couldn't find anything that was exactly, you know, what I had been looking for in either of those fields, but having the degree at all put me in a much better position to, you know, get hired in at one of the Big Three, which in Detroit, we're - it's still kind of a big deal."
