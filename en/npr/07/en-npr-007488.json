        "Oh, yeah.",

        "It's much harder to see a 2020 in which he can improve his numbers with women, young people and Latinos then try to double down on the white support that he has very strongly and especially because white voters still cast most of the votes in this country.",

        "And that's despite the economy before this week's drama.",
        "But I wonder if it's an instructive measure anymore.",
        "I think it's significant because it speaks to one of the most fascinating aspects about the Trump presidency in that, despite all of the conflict and division, he has the most stable approval ratings of any president since we began polling presidents, you know?",
        "Presidents have seen 30, 40, 50-point swings in approval over the course of their presidencies.",
        "Trump's has stayed in about this 9-point range.",
        "That 45% is the high end of that.",
        "So, right now, he's actually enjoying some of his highest approval ratings.",
        "I think what that tells me is that this is a country that really has its mind made up about Donald Trump and that the 2020 election isn't going to be about persuading voters to change their mind.",
