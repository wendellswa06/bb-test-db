        "That's at least one more besides the one we know about regarding the Trump campaign and possible ties to the Russian government.",
        "So we don't have a good idea of what these investigations entail, and investigators have done a pretty good job at keeping them from public view.",
        "Those investigations remain a mystery to the public this morning, and they might involve topics we've never even considered.",
        "OK.",
