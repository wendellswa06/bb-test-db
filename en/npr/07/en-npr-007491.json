        "What's the end goal here, William?",
        "I mean, what's the ideal jurisdiction for you to present this evidence in?",
        "That would be a Syrian, probably constituted Syrian court.",
        "And it's a Syrian war and ultimately requires a Syrian solution.",
        "But criminal justice is not an end in itself.",
        "And it's not about revenge or punishment because only a small number of offenders, I think, will ever be prosecuted.",
        "It's a highly symbolic exercise.",
        "So, what you want to do is create a certain type of narrative and at the same time break damaging social narratives that are false.",
        "So, the prevailing narrative on the opposition side is that the Syrian regime is an Alawite structure - Alawites are a subsector of Shia Islam - that the regime is a sectarian structure bent on the destruction of Sunni.",
        "And point of fact, the regime is a complex multi-sectarian power political structure.",
        "So, when prosecuting regime figures would be folly to only prosecute Alawites because you're going to reinforce a damaging social narrative which is in fact false.",
        "There's plenty of Christians and Kurds and Sunni and other groups in the highest reaches of the regime.",
        "I imagine you're closely watching the talks in Geneva right now.",
        "And, as you know, some of the options being floated out there include clemency for President Bashar al-Assad.",
        "Is that a frustrating option for you, if the evidence that you're collecting at great risk is never used to prosecute these people?",
        "It would be very frustrating for perhaps all of our Syrian colleagues.",
        "Now, let's say the current president is not prosecuted in the future.",
        "And indeed, if no one's prosecuted, the work will not have been for naught, because we're also collecting with the idea that our database can be used to inform a broader truth-seeking, truth-telling process.",
        "Most of our listeners will probably remember the Truth in Reconciliation Commission from South Africa.",
        "And these sorts of things are very common, and they need to be based on some sort of evidence as well.",
        "So, all is not lost if there's no criminal prosecutions.",
        "And indeed, as I've indicated, the criminal prosecutions are a very, very small part - high-profile part to be sure - but a small part of the broader transitional justice process to which a society torn apart by conflict needs to pass.",
        "So, it would not be a tragedy if there's no trials.",
        "But ultimately, I think the Syrians need to take that decision.",

        "But Bob Garfield argues that we sometimes overlook the portent of that word revolution, that metaphorical guillotines accompany sweeping change.",
        "The media giants we've all become accustomed to - newspapers, magazines, radio and TV are already losing their heads as audiences and advertisers drift away.",
        "And again, what follows will be very, very different."
