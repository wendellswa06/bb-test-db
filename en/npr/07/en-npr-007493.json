        "But in the end, we felt that this product was not worthy, and we agreed that it paints a more absolute picture than is accurate, and it is not the kind of work our committee should be releasing.",

        "But we don't think that these are intelligence products based on the records that our committee is developing.",
        "And we think that they are over-painting the threat, under-representing the caveats and qualifiers that serious people who are studying these issues have, and creating a picture for the public that's not accurate.",
        "And some people would immediately think that this is highly reminiscent of some of the things that were done three and four years ago.",
        "Well, those are the claims, and those are mistakes that I surely don't want to repeat.",
        "No question that Iran is a very serious threat.",
        "None of us is arguing that it is not.",

        "Good intelligence at least leads to the opportunity for good policy.",
        "And is it also seemly for something like this - which you know, again is not the product of the full House Intelligence Committee - effectively to be picking a fight with the IAEA?",

        "And I will be interested to see what Chairman Hoekstra has to say about this, but what I have to say about it as the ranking Democrat - and I think our members agree with me - is that this staff report, not issued as a full committee report, takes a number of analytical shortcuts and paints the intelligence committee's assessments as more certain than they are.",
