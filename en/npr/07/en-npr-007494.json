        "Right.",

        "Right.",
        "�we can extend this to complicated situations and things like that, that, you know, we would think about the timing of therapeutic interventions, clinical interventions for disorders as a key factor in their ultimate success.",

        "Right.",

        "You know, then maybe they'd actually have a snake in a cage and, you know, you learn to relax.",

        "What's different about this is the problem with regular extinction is it creates two memories: this thing is fearful and this thing is safe.",
        "And those two compete.",
        "And so you get stressed out, so the fearful memory comes back.",
        "Right.",
        "And all this would suggest is that if we do that same type of training during a window where we know from all this beautiful animal work that the memory is vulnerable, we might actually rewrite the memory or change the memory in a more permanent fashion so the fear doesn't come back.",
        "So to do that, I guess, practically, you'd have to know what the upper limit was on the time, right?",
        "We need to know all of that.",
        "I mean, we'd need to know so much more than we know now.",
        "I mean, I just described to you the experiment.",
        "It was incredibly simple.",
        "We've only looked at 10 minutes.",

        "We know by six hours, it's been too long.",
        "That's about it.",
        "We're talking with Elizabeth Phelps on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, talking about - interesting.",
        "So what you're basically saying is now we have enough confidence that we - in this working that we can study it more in people.",
        "Yes."
