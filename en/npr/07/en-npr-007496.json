        "You're either writing a factual book and using your memory as best you can--and with all of us, we're faulty to various degrees--or you're writing fiction, which means you're taking reality and transforming it for your own purposes.",
        "And this writer that we're discussing evidently came to a crossroads, and he wasn't sure if he wanted to write fiction or non-fiction.",
        "When he chose non-fiction, when he chose a memoir, which is not just a story as you see it subjectively--I mean, it's not one of these--I mean, I understand the truth has become relative in this country from the head of the government on down.",
        "But when you're writing a memoir, you're saying--you're making a covenant with the reader saying, `The facts in here are accurate as best I can remember them.",
        "So, you know, if there's a scene where you're writing a memoir about a member of your family and you're having dinner 10 years ago and you can't quite remember what the meal was or what the person was wearing, that's one thing.",
        "If you start appropriating other people's lives, as this writer did, as I understand it, and other people's tragedies and then transfiguring those, I think it's just unethical and bogus and lying after a while.",
        "It has nothing to do with telling your own story; it has to do with making up another story.",

        "Well, yeah.",

        "Fiction is not lying.",
        "Fiction is telling the truth about an active imagination.",
        "You're saying, `The truth is that I'm making this up in order to get at some other layer of truth.",
        "And the test of your interest into this is going to be whether you find it a sort of a story that corresponds to human truth or experience or the recognizable world.",

        "But if you're writing a memoir and they're things that actually happened, I gather the only reason you'd lie is to have incredible shock value because you don't think the truth or the facts can convey the truth you want.",
