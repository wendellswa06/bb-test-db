        "And I suppose from the perspective of, you know, maybe somebody who is--felt that their life was changed by this book, would they go back and say, `Oh, well, you know, he betrayed me and'--I mean, that's the value of this book, to me.",
        "I think that, you know, it speaks to people who are dealing with addiction.",
        "But don't you think the story becomes quite different if I say to you, `I was in jail 90 days, and four policemen hit me with billy clubs,' as opposed to whatever really happened to him--he was in a holding cell for a day?",
        "That's not what happened to him as an addicted person.",
        "He wasn't in jail 90 days, which, for some people, could be a really transformative and upsetting experience.",

        "On the other hand, what if you did say, `You know, I'm a pretty lucky guy, and I should become more generous'?--and this whole experience has made you a more generous person and given you a wider view about the pain and suffering in the world around you?",
        "Well, that's...",
        "Well, but that's not what's happened.",
