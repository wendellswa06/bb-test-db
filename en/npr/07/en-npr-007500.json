        "As the title implies, they run the show.",
        "They are the head writer-producers who straddle the creative and logistical sides of TV production.",
        "And one of them is Bill Prady.",
        "He's a TV veteran who's now working on the CBS sitcom \"\"The Big Bang Theory,\"\" or he was until the strike came along.",

        "Thank you.",

        "I'm going back to work in a couple of hours.",
        "Oh!",
        "And what will you do?",
        "Well, before the writing can begin, and the writing can't start until the vote has been taken and the writers end the strike and come back to work, but there is an astonishing amount of preparation that has to happen.",
        "It's sort of like stopping a ship dead in the water and then trying to start it up again and have it resume course.",
        "There's a lot of stuff to figure out.",
        "Well, one of those things will be scripts, right?",
        "You don't have any, do you?",
        "Well, actually, I was talking to my partner, Chuck Lorre(ph).",
        "We think we kind of have two that were in sort of rough shape when we stopped.",
        "Not in shootable shape but, you know, in a place where we can hopefully get them ready to go fairly quickly.",
        "But scripts are the big problem.",
        "When you start up the season traditionally, the writers have sort about an eight-week or - seven or eight week head start on production to develop an inventory of scripts, finished scripts, ready to go.",
        "Because once production begins, your ability to write - write, rewrite, edit and perfect scripts is hampered by the fact that you're also producing the series."

        "So you sort of imagine a shelf with scripts on it, and as you produce them you keep taking them off the shelf and scramble to add more back on the shelf.",

        "We're going to have maybe - and this is a discussion we're going to be having today - maybe one or two weeks before we get going, which is going to make the completion of this season a scramble every day.",

        "And, in fact, they - both of them end together.",
        "They have been a perfect yin and yang for 350 years, a perfect symbiotic relationship, depending equally on one another and giving us - you know, in the intervening time - newspapers and magazines and television, you know, the \"\"Green Acres\"\" and the \"\"CBS Evening News\"\" and the Super Bowl and the Kennedy assassination.",

        "It's not in the 10 Commandments.",
        "There is nothing there - I've pored over them - that says thou shalt have new episodes of \"\"Lost\"\" or a profitable New York Times.",
        "And it's a disaster in progress.",
        "It's interesting.",

        "He says, oh, I read it online.",
        "And then he looked at me, he says, I guess I'm part of the problem.",
        "Well, he is part of the problem.",
        "Ironically, the audience of the New York Times and just about every other major newspaper has dramatically expanded for the last - over the last 10 years because online, you can - you know, you can be read anywhere and - here's the key - for free.",
        "So because - you know, free is a really attractive price, and you can't argue with the convenience.",
        "So people are reading the New York Times more than they ever have in its history.",
        "The problem is the advertisers will not pay for an online ad what they've paid for traditional media ads for years and years and years.",
        "And that's because the Internet world - while giving us so many wonderful things the digital revolution has provided for us - it has created an almost bottomless reservoir of content, and therefore almost a bottomless reservoir of advertising inventory, which depresses the price that any publisher can fetch for its advertising.",
        "So the problem with the New York Times and it - ABC TV and everywhere else in the old media world, is they cannot generate enough revenue from advertising to pay for the content we have all come to love and depend.",
        "And it's not going to get better.",

        "They - someone has to produce them, and they have to have, you know, cash up front to do that.",
