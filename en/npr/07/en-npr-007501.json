        "Oh, I am tweeting.",
        "I'm tweeting my head off these days because of course to publish my own book we have embraced social media in a way that I'm pretty sure is unprecedented in publishing history.",
        "It's not the - it doesn't have the efficiency that mass media has afforded us for the last three-plus centuries, but it does have many other advantages -namely, I mean the most important being, when you get a message from a friend, a trusted friend or associate, even if it has, you know, some sort of commercial message embedded within it, you're apt to trust it far more than you would ever trust, you know, anything dictated to you by Proctor & Gamble channeling its marketing message through Mr. Whipple or something like that.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And it is - it's very difficult to achieve.",
        "You basically have to aggregate an audience, where before you just, you know, bought media time and shouted to everybody.",
        "But you know, not only is it a path to the future, it's pretty much the only path to the future, and it's not - it's not easy to accomplish.",
        "It's not going to instantly replace the beauty of the yin-yang symbiosis marketers and media have always enjoyed, but you know, got to do something.",
        "Renee, what's considered expertise in social networking?",
        "Well, they want to see professional blogs.",
        "They want to actually view your Twitter accounts and see what kind of tweets you're sending out.",
        "So it's a really slippery slope because having worked in PR, I'm quite aware that there's a difference between what you might tweet or post on Facebook personally and what you might put out there as an official company message.",
        "There have actually been some really interesting media campaigns that have been done by companies like Moonfruit and Ben & Jerry's in the last couple months using Twitter, and they are very, very viral when they do stuff like that.",
        "Like Moonfruit was giving away several Macbooks if you tweeted Moonfruit in your tweets, and it generated a whole lot of traffic on Twitter, and it was actually really successful because this company has been around for I would say over 10 years.",
        "I was marginally aware of them, but it brought a lot of people to their site and generated them tons of publicity and awareness that they wouldn't have done if they had done just normal advertising, which would have cost them a lot more money than the expensive 10 Macbooks.",
        "Ah, maybe we'll give away Political Junkie T-shirts if you tweet Political Junkie.",

        "Traditional media are in a state of dire retrenchment as a prelude to complete collapse.",

        "Tell about something called the Mindstorm Experiment.",
        "Yeah, this is fantastic.",
        "You know, what I did, Neal, in doing this book is I traveled around the world looking for examples of the new forces that are affecting media and marketing and also the relationship between all institutions and the group formerly known as the audience or the electorate or the congregation and what have you, because in the digital age, those - all of those relationships have been fundamentally changed.",
        "But my first stop, this was almost four or five years ago, was in Billund, Denmark, the home of LEGO.",
        "Now, LEGO makes billions and billions of tiny plastic bricks, which children play with and which dads such as ourself find lodged in the soles of our feet.",
        "And this is a great toy.",

        "Cache.",
        "Is it going to be difficult after not writing for 13 weeks to really ramp up and then go into overdrive, it sounds like, and churning - trying to churn out scripts so quickly?",
        "Cache, yeah.",
        "So of course they decided to make a robot toy that you can use LEGO materials with and then program to fetch and crawl off of tables, and I don't know what all, and they introduced it to their 10 to 14-year-old-boy market and discovered that it didn't really do that well because it was a little too complicated, a little too expensive, a little un-LEGO-y.",
        "But what they discovered by accident is that it did appeal a great deal to people in their 20s and 30s, nerds, engineers, robotic hobbyists and so forth, and a genuine subculture was forming around this brand.",
        "So they misjudged the market, but the market was there.",
        "Well, in a couple years Mindstorm's got a little long of tooth and LEGO needed to do a redesign.",
        "So what they did was the very heart of what I call the art and science of listenomics.",
        "They decided not to decide in-house what this line should look like.",
        "They went out to this fan base, which they located on chat rooms and Web sites around the world, and they invited them to come to Billund at their own expense and to participate in the redesign of the Mindstorm's line of products.",
        "And they filled up the roster on the first day, and the next thing you know, people were flying to Denmark, and they spent, I don't know what it was, I think six weeks there, again at their own expense, went in every day, got into the inner sanctum at LEGO, where no civilians hitherto had ever ventured and redesigned this line and then worked on it for another 14 months when they got home at their computers.",
        "And when the new line was launched after about two years, it was almost entirely the work of these volunteers who were nothing more than LEGO fans.",
        "And not only did they redesign the brand, they were 100 percent of the marketing force because using those very chat rooms and Web sites…",
        "They're talking it up."

        "government and other institution has the ability to mine the largest pool of value ever assembled in human history.",
