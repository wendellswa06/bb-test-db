        "And you know, in a world where you fetch less and less for your advertising, and publishers do, and broadcasters, and when there's, you know, a vast percentage of ad avoidance, nobody is going to be able to make the nut.",

        "Excuse me, I hope I'm pronouncing that right.",
        "Why does the large media give away their content online for free?",
        "I'd be willing to pay $10 a month to have online access to the content of, say, the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and Newsweek.",
        "Why does the media not offer this kind of bundled service?",
        "Because they're stupid.",
        "I mean - let me put it more precisely.",
        "They were stupid about 10 or 12 years ago when these decisions were being made.",
        "They believed that online advertising was going to sustain them in the way that advertising sustained traditional media for three and a half centuries.",
        "And they knew their audiences were going up so they made a play to have the largest audiences possible.",
        "The more eyeballs, the more advertising revenue.",
        "That was the idea.",
        "What nobody anticipated was the simple law of supply and demand, which said that the price of online advertising would be depressed.",
        "And they have big audiences now, but they get so little for the ads attached to them.",
        "In fact, they can't even sell the ads attached to that free content that - they just don't have enough coming in.",
        "So now, they're trying belatedly.",
        "The New York Times and Fox are talking about charging for online usage.",
        "But, you know, that is - that toothpaste is going to be hard to get back into the tube.",
        "We all believe that free content is now somehow owed to us.",
        "Free, I said it before, it's a very attractive price and nobody wants to go - very few people will want to go from free to $10 a month.",
        "But they did figure this out for music online.",
        "The iTunes, 99 cents.",
        "That seems like - it's not free, but people make money from that.",
        "Yeah, there is an argument to be made and it's not a bad one that, you know, if you charge a little bit, people will pay it because, you know, what's the point of shoplifting from the dollar store, right?",
        "However, I think you should know that, yes, iTunes makes a billion some dollars a year selling songs for a buck a piece, but there's still 97 percent piracy rate.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "In China, it's 99 percent.",
        "So, you know, a few people make a few bucks, but the overall economy is, as my editor and pal Chris Anderson writes, increasingly going to be a free one because once people get accustomed to free, they just don't want to pony up."
