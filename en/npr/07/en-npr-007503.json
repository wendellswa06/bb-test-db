        "That's where we met up with career truck driver Jeff Runions.",
        "I've done everything from working on trailers, working on trucks, being an owner-operator, being a company driver, management.",
        "In his latest job, Runions has found himself in the middle of a fight for the future of the $700 billion trucking industry.",
        "Companies like Uber, Google, Daimler and Volvo are all racing to get their self-driving trucks out onto the road first.",
        "Runions works for a much smaller company, Starsky Robotics.",
        "It's not the space race, but it's kind of a - you know, it's new technologies like when they went to the moon, right?",
        "And we're not going to the moon, but how many people would think a semi'd be driving itself?",
        "Instead of trying to beat their competition to developing fully autonomous vehicles, Starsky's strategy is to develop trucks that are autonomous only on the highway, and then let remote drivers in an office take the wheel when they hit city streets.",
        "It's all still in the testing phase.",
        "Runions is is a safety driver.",
        "He sits in the driver's seat of the cab, ready to take control if the truck gets into trouble.",
        "He also works alongside his company's programmers to test and tweak the truck's sensors and software.",
        "I come up with some suggestions once in a while, and they do work.",
        "I'm not a engineer like these guys are, but sometimes they listen to me.",
        "So that means I'm part of the team, too.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "Runions got his start in the trucking industry nearly four decades ago.",
        "I've been trucking since 1979.",
        "We were like the Cowboys in the old days, but we're doing our own thing.",
        "We own our own trucks and trying to make our own lives the way it is.",
        "He enjoyed the freedom that came with owning his own truck and the camaraderie he found with the fellow truckers he met crisscrossing the country."

        "We're truckers, and we're young, and we're having a good time.",
        "But he says that as the years dragged on, life on the road began to lose its luster.",
        "He says the lifestyle was unhealthy and the schedule became grueling.",
        "You just get tired of the same stuff all the time and sleeping in the truck.",
        "You're in this little box all the time.",
        "OK, you can't really go anywhere.",
        "I mean, you - the only thing you've got to do is go to sleep and get up and do it again.",
        "And he says that after fuel prices surged in the early-2000s, going it alone didn't make financial sense anymore.",
        "So he sold his truck and took a job with a commercial trucking company, but quickly found out that wasn't much better.",
        "A normal driver that works for a company - they've got to stay out three weeks at a time, and they give them two days off when they get home.",
        "As soon as they get home, after the two days, they've got to go right back out for 21 more days.",
        "That ain't much of a life.",
        "Then you're staying in that box again.",
        "Runions did eventually work his way up to management, but he says despite better pay, the hours and stress were even worse.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "I was always in there at 3 o'clock in the morning till 3 o'clock in the afternoon.",
        "I was wore out.",
        "So I figured it's time to try something that was different, and you can get no more different than this.",
        "It's not tense at all.",

        "I'm concerned about, you know, our camera people, our hair and makeup people, those people.",
        "I'm hoping they weathered this time well.",
        "And I will talk to my partner to see if there are any people who face particular challenges and if there's any additional help we can extend to them.",

        "Yeah.",

        "So we'll -either a week from Wednesday or two weeks from Wednesday we'll have a table read, and then we shoot the first show two or three weeks from Tuesday.",
