        "So Price has said he's going to pay out of his own pocket $52,000 to reimburse the government - taxpayers, essentially - for these private jet flights.",
        "But now the total costs, according to new reports, is a million dollars?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, clearly, this is a small percentage of the total cost here.",
        "And that's a question a lot of people are asking.",
        "And I think it's clear that this is not going to satisfy critics on this story.",
        "Did he just pluck that number out of thin air?",
        "I mean, how did he decide $52,000?",
        "Unclear how they got to that figure.",
        "He says that's the cost of his seat.",
        "But I think, especially if you're the one asking for the flight to take off to begin with, it's not like you were hopping on an existing flight that was going somewhere.",
        "So I think it's hard to argue that just his seat is the total cost to taxpayers for these particular flights.",
        "And he was traveling with staff, as well.",
        "Right.",
        "So the president has clearly expressed his view.",

        "So is this done now?",
        "I mean, does Price writing a check satisfy President Trump on this?",
        "I don't think so because the ground has already shifted on Price.",
        "He made that announcement yesterday, saying he'll pay $52,000.",
        "Since then, the figure has nearly - has more than doubled because Politico reported, after he made that announcement, about these overseas military flights that cost more than a half million dollars.",
        "So the question is how much more comes out not just on Price but on other cabinet secretaries?",
        "There are now multiple official investigations going on here.",
        "You have administration inspector generals looking into this.",
        "You have the House oversight committee looking into this.",
        "And, of course, you have reporters continuing to find more details on the story.",
        "And there are other members of the administration who have issues, shall we say, with air travel.",
        "That's right.",
        "You may recall treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin had several questionable flights on official government planes.",
        "There was that trip to Kentucky where he watched the solar eclipse.",
        "The inspector general's looking into whether that had something to do with it.",
        "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt have both been on charter flights, as well."

        "I mean, I thought she looked really great with the make-up on.",
        "Then I'd heard from some other people who had actually sat and watched the show that they didn't think that she did such a good job.",
