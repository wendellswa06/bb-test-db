        "But this study does not offer strong data, says Arthur Levine, former president of Teachers College at Columbia University.",
        "Levine has spent most of his career trying to reform schools of education.",
        "He gives the study an incomplete for relying too heavily on course descriptions rather than actually observing how faculty prepare students for the real world.",
        "The bottom line, is this, says Levine.",
        "The measure of the success of any teacher education program is how well the graduates are doing with the children in their classes.",
        "That's really the only thing that matters - not the process by which we prepared those teachers.",
        "Still, the study, with all its limitations, will have an impact, says Levine.",
        "The question is, how will institutions respond?",
        "Actually, we don't expect them to respond at all.",
        "Again, Kate Walsh.",
        "I can point to a hell(ph) graveyard of failed efforts to try to get teacher education to change.",
        "What's different about what we're doing is that if they don't change, they're going to feel it in the pocketbook.",
        "The concern, says Arthur Levine, is that this could backfire and further polarize the debate over the future of teacher education - whether it can be repaired or whether it's so broken it needs to be replaced.",
        "Claudio Sanchez, NPR News.",
        "Jewish girls go through the bat mitzvah, 15-year-old Latinas celebrate the quinceanera.",
        "And for generations of Indian-American girls, the culmination of years of studying classical Indian dance is a lavish solo performance before a crowd of hundreds.",
        "Reporter Arun Venugopal of member station WNYC attended what may have been the first such performance by a woman with Down syndrome.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARANGETRAM)",
        "There is a word for the graduation performance in Indian cultural circles.",
        "It's called an arangetram, which literally means ascending the stage.",
        "It is a major accomplishment, the moment when a student of dance or music asserts their artistic independence, often in their teens."
