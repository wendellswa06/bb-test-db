        "I want to emphasize that our study is not a treatment study in the sense that - that other people were just describing.",
        "We recruited a group of about 2,000 older Mexican-Americans who were living in the community, and they were - and we measured a number of things on them and followed them over seven years to see what kinds of factors predicted the development of new dementia and cognitive impairment cases.",
        "So in our study what we're basically looking at is the effect of statin use over a period of an average of five years in people that started out not having dementia or cognitive impairment.",
        "And we found that in that case, people who were using statins over that time period had about half the rate of dementia and cognitive impairment as compared to people who were not using statins.",
        "So it's more like a simulation of a primary prevention trial for statins and not - it's not a treatment trial.",
        "There might be some implications for treatment, but I think there are a number of issues that we were not able to address, for example, what kind of specific statin would be best.",
        "And they were changes over time in the types of statins that were being used.",
        "So I think there are a number of questions that are still open about how statins might work and whether they are - the benefit that we're showing is really related to early detection.",
        "None of the people that we recruited had ever had dementia - had ever been diagnosed with dementia before we got there.",
        "So I guess the final sort of thing I'd like to note about it is that statins do influence cardiovascular risk factors and a major purpose of our study has been to look at the influence of things like Type 2 diabetes and hypertension and other vascular conditions on the development of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.",
        "So that's - the statins are really attacking that pathway, I think, by lowering cholesterol and possibly by altering the body's immune response to developing pathology.",

        "But we also have some analyses that showed that statin treatment over time reduces the risk of all cause dementia not just the combined - combination of the cognitive impairment and dementia.",

        "That's what I meant when I was referring to the immune system response.",
        "When people are starting, perhaps in early stages of developing disease or even before that when they're just being exposed to certain types of risk factors, their body mounts a defense against that kind of exposure, and those inflammatory factors called cytokines may sort of contribute to the development of disease.",
        "And if statins can influence that, can lower inflammatory response, then that might be another possible pathway, but I think most people would agree that we're still not clear about which type of statins would work for this and if any and exactly how they work.",
