        "And I would like to know how one can go about getting a test to find out if that marker is one they possess.",
        "Dr.",
        "Nixon, does one exist?",
        "There is not a definitive marker.",
        "There are several gene variants that are common in the population that can be tested for.",
        "It is not something that is definitive in terms of its predictive value for Alzheimer's disease.",
        "There is promise for CSF test biomarker substances in the spinal fluid that do help the diagnosis and are starting to be used at least in a research way in the clinic, but by themselves, are not a definitive test.",
        "I think one still has to use them in the context of a very thorough clinical evaluation.",
        "But many academic centers can make them available.",
        "We do it at NYU Langone Medical Center, and there are other places where that type of testing can be done."

        "Are there lifestyle changes?",
        "We hear about exercising your brain.",

        "This is the new mantra of the Alzheimer's Association, really.",
        "Things that can be easily done by everyone, for which the science now is well developed enough to really show a scientific basis, and exercise is probably at the top of the list as something that can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and will actually increase and slow the decline once someone has symptoms.",
        "There were some reports at this meeting showing that you could see changes in the brain with imaging as a result of physical exercise.",
        "So, this is a no-brainer.",
        "Wow.",
        "Dr. Haan, where do you go with your statins research now?",
        "What's your next step?",
        "Well, I think one of the things that we need to do is as a scientific community is to try to figure out why these are working the way they are.",
        "We're certainly - what's happened up until recently is most of the statin studies that have been in randomized clinical trials have been focused on people with the disease in hopes that it would be a treatment that might slow down progression or possibly even cure disease.",
        "So, those have not worked.",
        "I think Dr. Nixon would agree with that, and so I think what our study and probably the bulk of other observational studies on this suggests is that primary prevention is important.",
        "As Dr. Nixon was just alluding to, physical exercise is being looked at as a kind of something that you could do if you're in early stages.",
        "But in fact, it points toward lifestyle factors that should be really practiced throughout life.",
        "And one of the things that we're trying to work on now is to establish a large study that will look at the early effects of some of these risk factors on the brain and on cognitive change, in people who are actually much younger than most Alzheimer's cases are.",
        "So, I think the statin study has a couple of implications.",
        "One of them is clearly that there's an important role for vascular factors in the development of dementias.",
        "Secondly, if that's true that vascular factors have an important role, and I would add metabolic factors to that like diabetes, then it would mean that...",
        "I'm going to have to interrupt because we have to take a break, but hold that thought, Doctor.",
        "We'll come back talking with Mary Haan and Ralph Nixon after this break.",

        "He is the director of the Silberstein Institute of Aging and Dementia at NYU's Langone Medical Center.",
        "And when I rudely interrupted Dr. Haan, she was telling us, she was working on the second thought about prevention.",
        "Well, I think I'm sure Dr. Nixon would agree and everyone who works in this field would agree that if we could prevent dementia and Alzheimer's disease that would be great, of course.",
        "We're not doing that right now, and we may never completely get there.",
        "But all of the evidences gathering now about physical activity, vascular factors, and a growing interest in early and midlife risk factors and how they affect the brain points toward, strongly toward at least the possibility that we could mount a more effective prevention campaign that we have so far.",
        "So, for example, actually at the congress there were a few people that presented results showing that if you measure - if you have high cholesterol, let's say at age 50 or you have hypertension or you have midlife obesity, that those factors are associated with a higher risk of late-life dementia.",
        "And this has been shown from some studies in Finland, from some studies in Kaiser Permanente, and there's a growing body of evidence that points that things that you do or conditions that you have in midlife actually are related to your late-life risk.",
        "So, if that's true, then it points toward intervention at an earlier age - reduction in weight, control of blood pressure, better control over diabetes.",
        "And I'm concerned because we see increases in most of those factors now in the population.",
        "And as a public health professional, that's really where I have to put most of my focus.",
        "But I think there's hope there, and there's growing evidence that could help us in trying to do a better job of preventing the development of dementias and Alzheimer's."
