        "People like to walk when it's nice out or - anyway.",
        "The fares that they get on rainy days are so lucrative, per hour, that they can reach their daily target income, which is what they care around in their minds - I'll work an entire sum of eight hours - much sooner than on a sunny day, so they quit early.",
        "If they would have a target monthly income, then the economic logic of decision-making would dictate exactly the reverse.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If it's in an isolated location, maybe it's worth bending down to pick it up.",
        "But it's probably an ad for a massage parlor that looks like a hundred dollar bill if it's out on a busy street corner.",
        "The joke really captures in a nice way the economic principle that there's no cash on the table, or at least not very much.",
        "So if an opportunity seems to good to be true, probably it is too good to be true.",
        "And what it really tells us is that once people have had a chance to react to events in the marketplace, the easy opportunities will have been used up.",
        "If there's a chance to make money at that point, it'll be only by some mix of talent and hard work and perseverance and luck.",
        "The easy money gets scooped up pretty quickly.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And these kinds of stories or these questions and answers, or even these jokes, this is in a way a critique of the way economics is taught in this country?",
        "Well, I think a lot of people think the book is just amusing stories.",
        "In fact, I intend it as a serious critique of the way we teach our subject to students.",
        "And I think the critique applies not just in economics, but in other disciplines as well, just from conversations I've had with people.",
        "What we know, Neal, is that when you give a student who's had the introductory course, a test, six months later to probe her knowledge of basic economic principles, she doesn't score any better on the average than somebody who didn't take the course at all.",
        "I mean, if you think about hundreds of millions of dollars spent on a course every semester, all the millions of hours students spend wrestling with the material we give them to ponder and yet we can't measure any value added from them, that's scandalous."
