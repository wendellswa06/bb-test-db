        "That's a great one.",
        "In fact, there's an example in the book that's a variant of that.",
        "The question was why you get free Internet access in a cheap hotel and you pay $15 a day or $10 a day for Internet access, you know, at luxury hotel?",
        "Why that, and then part of the same question was why do luxury airlines feed you for free, budget airlines charge you for a meal?",
        "I was fascinated by your chapter on discount, and the concept - I had not ran across it; I never took Econ 101, certainly not in your class - the discount hurdle.",
        "And by way of illustration, why don't you answer the question of why are hotel mini-bars so pricey?",
        "So, you know, these are all interesting variants on a theme.",
        "If you're in a budget hotel, you're probably shopping around pretty carefully for where you're going to stay.",
        "The cost of letting you hook up to an Internet network once it's established is essentially zero.",
        "They've got their cost all in place.",
        "There's no - what economist call a marginal cost of adding another user.",
        "Just let someone tune in.",
        "The more competitive a market is, the closer the price of something would be the marginal cost.",
        "So that's why you see low Internet access fees or zero Internet access fees in budget hotels.",
        "The luxury hotel goer is either rich enough not to care or on expense account, and so the extra ten or fifteen dollars a day on the bill isn't going to be a deal breaker.",
        "He wants to stay at that hotel because it's in that location or because it offers that special mix of services.",
        "It's not a question of how much is the Internet access.",

        "They always have the nine-tenths.",

        "If you jump the hurdle, then you get a discount.",

        "He'll pay the exorbitant price and enjoy the convenience of it.",
