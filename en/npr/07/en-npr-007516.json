        "Yeah.",

        "My TAs - both of them were women that semester - didn't like the question, and I thought it was really interesting, so it may be one that falls on different ears differently.",
        "But the question was posed by a student, a male student.",
        "He had a very attractive female friend with whom he'd enjoyed a platonic relationship for some extended period of time.",
        "She knew he'd been having trouble meeting people.",
        "And so, as he recounts his experience, one day, she said come on with me to a bar tonight.",

        "So they went to the bar and they're sitting at the table and she's just paying extremely close attention to him the whole evening - touching his arm, rubbing his shoulder, whispering his ear frequently.",
        "And then, she says to him abruptly, I'm going to head home now, but meet me at Starbucks in the morning for coffee and let's see how the rest of your evening went.",
        "And he reports at the moment she left, other women in the bar came around and started chatting him up, which was an experience he hadn't had before.",
        "What's going on here?",
        "He's wondering.",

        "And so you can't tell just by looking at somebody, he argued, whether they're interesting or going to be a good person to go out with, but that was a signal that conveyed a lot of information.",

        "And we've been seeing on-and-off skirmishes for a week, but in the open fighting that we've seen for the past few days, it looks like the Islamists are pulling back towards Mogadishu.",
        "What do the Ethiopians say their objective is?",
        "Well, at the moment, they say their objective is purely to defend the Transitional Federal Government.",
        "Certainly, they would like to crush the Islamists.",
        "They see the Islamists as a direct threat to their own security in Ethiopia, but they know that the further they push into Somalia, the more resistance they're likely to meet.",
        "And they run the risk of uniting the disparate Somali clans against them, strengthening the support of the Islamists.",

        "Well, that seems the only logical outcome.",
        "This being Somalia, you never really know what might happen, but certainly the problem the Ethiopians face is that somebody somewhere has got to prop up the transitional government.",

        "Just over 100,000 people managed to choose a health plan between October 1st and November 2nd.",
        "And only a quarter of those people, about 27,000, did it through the federal website that's enrolling people in 36 of the states.",

        "Good to see you again, Julie.",
        "Nice to be here.",
        "The administration has been talking down these numbers for a while now.",
        "Are they about what was expected?",
        "Actually, the numbers for the federal exchange are a bit lower than expected.",
        "Earlier this week, people were leaking numbers that suggested the number was about 40,000, so 27,000 is a lot lower than that.",
        "On the other hand, what it really tells us is that the HealthCare.gov website wasn't working, so people couldn't get all the way through the process in order to choose a plan.",
        "That's not exactly breaking news.",
        "On the state side, we had seen some numbers because some of the states had been reporting right along.",
        "The one number we didn't see until just a little while ago was California.",
        "It reported that 35,000 people had made it all the way through the process, which is nearly half of the total for the 11 states included in this report.",
        "Julie, you keep talking about people making it through the process.",
        "I want you to explain exactly what the administration is counting in these numbers.",
        "Yes, because that's important.",
        "In order to be formally counted as enrolled in a health plan, at least by the insurance company, you actually have to pay the first month's premium.",
        "But because no one's insurance they get through the exchange can begin until January 1st of 2014, very few people are going to sign up in October, and then front out money three months in advance."

        "So the administration is counting what are being called shopping cart people.",
        "They are people who have completed the enrollment process and chosen a plan, but not necessarily paid their first month's premium.",

        "What do we know about those people?",
        "We know a lot of people are qualifying for Medicaid coverage, or their children are qualifying for the children's health insurance program.",
        "Nearly 400,000 people have been deemed eligible for these programs so far; 213,000 in the state exchanges and 183,000 on the federal exchange.",
        "It's a lot more people qualifying for Medicaid than enrolling in private insurance.",
        "Is that surprising?",
        "Not really.",
        "Part of it is that in some states there was a big outreach effort to find people eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, and those folks signed up.",
        "Also, those systems were working better in October than the private insurance website.",
        "It's anticipated that eventually the numbers will even out a little bit more.",

        "Well, really not a heck of a lot other than, as I said at the top, the federal website wasn't working very well in October.",
        "Just about every health care analyst points out that you don't expect a lot of people to sign up during the first month of a six month signup period.",
        "So the numbers probably would have still been pretty small even if everything had been working just fine.",
        "What this does tell us, however, is that it puts more pressure on the system, particularly on that federal website, as we go forward, particularly if there's a surge of people who want to sign up in time to have insurance that begins January 1st.",
        "That means they have to sign up by December 15th.",
        "And if that website isn't actually working as promised by the end of this month, or even if it is, there could be a huge demand and it's not at all clear the system is going to be able to serve all those people in that very short period.",
        "Just to make sure that I understand what you've said here, of the 106,000 people who have signed up for a plan, they have all paid something already to enroll in that plan?",
        "No, they have not.",
        "They've signed up.",
        "They still have to pay their first premiums - for many of them."
