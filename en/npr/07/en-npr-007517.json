        "And what are the Islamists, the Somali Courts movement, saying in Mogadishu?",
        "Well, their position is very much they're having to rethink their tactics in the face of an air assault.",
        "They admit they have lost fighters, but they also claim to have inflicted heavy casualties on the Ethiopians.",

        "But the other reason...",
        "The destroyer, USS Cole.",
        "Yes.",
        "The other reason, though, is because without the Ethiopian military might, the Islamists would almost certainly have overrun what's known as the Transitional Federal Government, which is this U.N.-recognized, though powerless, Somali government that has penned up actually before the fighting started in the town of Baidoa and would have probably been overrun had the Ethiopians not been there.",

        "embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salem in 1998 were recruited and received some training in Somalia.",
        "So certainly there's a degree of circumstantial and historical evidence that there are links with al-Qaida, but I'm not sure that anybody really believes that's the driving force behind the Islamic Courts.",
        "There may be one or two rather nasty figures there, but I'm not sure that the leadership really wants to go down that route.",

        "There have been substantial efforts by the Horn of Africa taskforce, as it's known as, to do counter terrorism or counter insurgency types of operations in terms of hearts and minds, of digging water wells, building schools, this kind of thing, but there doesn't appear to be anything beyond that.",

        "So I don't think we can make this into a Christian versus Muslim struggle.",
        "Although inevitably, when you have these two populations involved, there may be elements of that beneath the surface.",
        "And, Jonathan Landay, any indication of what the United Nations may be discussing when they gather, well, about 40 minutes from now."
