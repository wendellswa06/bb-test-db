        "And it was the involvement of the Ethiopians.",
        "If you can a little later on the program maybe go into some of the history between them, because the Ethiopians and the Somalians are not really going to ever really get along.",

        "Yeah.",

        "They're always going to see them as being handed over to their enemies, so to speak.",
        "And don't the - many people in Somalia see the Ethiopians as proxies for the United States to some degree as well.",

        "The one thing that unites them is unity against the common external enemy, which is Ethiopia.",
        "And it's very easy to get them all riled up by just mentioning the word Ethiopia.",

        "And before the country fell apart at '92, there was big oil exploration going on in central Somalia.",

        "We just want you to have a democratic Islamic government.",

        "To just give you an idea, this is not necessarily a paranoia on the part of the Ethiopians.",
        "But Mogadishu, the capital, has a paranoia of the West, and it is - you could just categorize it and say it is just a revenge, or they're just being vengeful and trying to just basically create a (unintelligible) somewhat smaller states for Somalia where they can have some kind of control over."
