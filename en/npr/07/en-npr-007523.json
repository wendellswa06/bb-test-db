        "So he hasn't learned any of the lessons in the last 15 years.",
        "He was a promoter of regime change in Libya, which actually made us less safe, and he's been in favor of regime change in Syria as well.",
        "He's not only for regime change in Iran; he actually advocates Israel using nuclear weapons on Iran to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.",
        "So no, I think he's way outside the mainstream and really has a naive understanding of the world.",
        "I think he's a real danger to the world.",
        "So I will be a no vote for him for any position in the State Department.",
        "Which we should say on a very tightly - tight committee with almost as many Democrats as Republicans.",

        "President Obama was seen by your party as going beyond his executive authority.",

        "Well, many of us do believe in the separation of powers.",
        "One of my chief complaints up here for any president has been that our founding fathers were very clear that war is not initiated or declared without the authority of Congress.",
        "And we still haven't declared war on the Middle East, and they're using the 9/11 proclamation on getting those who attacked us on 9/11, which it's ridiculous to say that has anything to do with what we're doing in the Middle East now.",
        "So yes, I'll continue to advocate for Congress asserting its role, for not letting the president run amok through executive order.",
        "Domestically, most of that has been an overreach by President Obama, though, instituting regulations that could have never gotten through Congress.",
        "And I am confident that I think in the first hundred days we'll get dozens and dozens, hopefully, of onerous job-killing regulations removed.",
        "What's one regulation that would give people an idea of what you're talking about, a single regulation that you can really point to and you think limits jobs?",

        "They're more about how government agencies work.",
        "And what we've seen is in this climate, some government agencies have a tendency to work in unrestrained behavior, desiring to control other people in really an egregious way without any sense of self-policing.",

        "There was just no internal restraint.",

        "So they go all out on the leak and, as I say, I think overreach in - way overreach in the subpoena.",
        "And now they're on Holder for doing that, the very people who have supported very aggressive actions by government on anything having to do with national security, I'm talking about the Republicans.",
        "I very much disagree with David in trying to view all of this in one big government prism.",
        "I think the IRS agents were wrong, but I think they're dealing with a law that - a regulation that is almost impossible to understand as it's been interpreted.",
        "These 501c4s sprouted up after the Citizens United case, and they were struggling, and they made some bad decisions.",
        "But I don't link all of these together the way David does.",
        "So the question is, does the public?",
        "I mean, the other political conversation happening this week more generally has been about trust in President Obama, and has something substantial been lost in these last few days?",
        "I would say certainly distrust in government has to rise.",
        "Listen, the Tea Party and members - Republican members of Congress have been claiming for a long, long time that they were being politically targeted or at least targeted by the IRS.",
        "Now it turns out there's a lot of substance.",
        "For whatever motivation, that was absolutely true.",
        "And so how can you - that'll - this is a very cynical country about government right now, and a lot of these storylines, the overreach in the national security state, the IRS and the Justice Department, these underline the basic cynicism and distrust people have toward their government."
