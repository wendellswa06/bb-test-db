        "Obama, you may remember, was criticized for putting an expiry date on troop surges that he ordered.",
        "And the concern then as now was that if you say troops are coming home by such and such a date, then the Taliban has no incentive to come negotiate.",
        "It sends a signal to the enemy.",
        "And they can make decisions based on that.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, Mary Louise, some of the analysts we spoke to leading up to the speech were saying that there needed to be a real emphasis on diplomacy.",
        "And President Trump, I mean, he framed this as America's strategy in Afghanistan and also in South Asia.",
        "And he really singled out roles for both Pakistan and India.",
        "He did.",
        "He called for a stronger relationship with India, which of course is Pakistan's neighbor and also Pakistan's archrival.",
        "So it will be interesting to see how that goes down in Islamabad.",
        "Speaking of Islamabad, on Pakistan, he said he's going to put more pressure on Pakistan to stop providing safe havens to the Taliban, to other groups.",
        "What form that will take?",
        "We don't know.",
        "It was short on details there and how it will differ from what Trump's predecessors as president have tried.",
        "Putting pressure on Pakistan is not a new strategy.",
        "And I challenge you to name an American president who has found Pakistan an easy ally to work with.",
        "Yeah.",
        "None, probably.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So what struck you is the overall tone of the speech?",
        "Well, this was President Trump on script.",
        "He was on message.",
        "He was appealing for national unity.",
        "He said - he had one line that struck me.",
        "He said, when we send troops abroad to fight, they deserve to return to a country not at war at home.",
        "He never actually said the word Charlottesville, but the reference to recent events was clear."
