        "Yeah.",
        "If you just look at what's happened in the next several years, one: we played an instrumental part in electing the president and a progressive majority in both the House and the Senate.",
        "We are on the verge of passing labor law reform that will allow workers to have a choice in joining a union and have a voice at work without being intimidated, harassed or fired.",
        "We're on the verge of passing health care reform.",
        "We have changed the way that we do our political action.",
        "We've changed the way that we outreach.",
        "And more people look at us right now and say they are the answer to my problems.",
        "They can help me solve the problems that I have, whether it's stagnant wages, the loss of health care, the loss of pensions.",
        "Unions will give me a stronger voice on the job.",
        "Talk a little bit about the economy.",
        "I mean, with the state it's in, a lot of people would take a job regardless of whether it was a union job.",
        "Do you think companies are using that to their advantage?",
        "Well, I think companies always try to use something to their advantage when it comes to denying people a job.",
        "But last year, 60 - in polling - 60 million Americans said: I would join a union tomorrow if given the opportunity.",
        "Because they know a couple of things.",
        "One: our members get about 30 percent more than a non-union worker does.",
        "We're more likely to have health care.",
        "We're more likely to have pensions.",
        "And quite frankly, we're more likely to do things like vote.",
        "And so, people are looking to that and saying we are part of the solution.",
        "You said - and I've read some of the interviews that you've done recently - that any effort to overhaul the health care system must include a public option.",
        "Do you mean to say that the AFL-CIO will not support members of Congress or the president in the future if an insurance reform bill doesn't include a public option?",
        "Well, let's talk about that.",
        "Let's talk about an insurance reform bill.",
        "Right now, every 30 seconds, one American declares bankruptcy because of medical bills.",
        "Profits for insurance companies have risen over a thousand percent in the last seven years.",
        "And health care premiums have risen 300 percent.",
        "So, what we're saying is, if you really want to break that stranglehold, you need to set up a government program where you can negotiate tight costs and use the power of the federal government to reduce those costs.",
        "But if it doesn't happen, will you withdraw support?",
        "It's likely that our members will.",
        "That's what the American public is telling us, as well.",
        "They want real health insurance reform.",
        "But there's not a lot of support, or it doesn't seem to be much support, or the support is waning for a public option at the moment.",
        "Most Americans, we're hearing Americans say they don't want the government."

        "That's interesting.",
        "They don't want the government because when you look at it, 61 percent of all expenditures right now in the health care market are covered by a government plan.",
        "When you think about Medicare, all the government employees, all Congress, those that say, we don't want a government plan out there, are covered by a government plan.",
        "And then all the military - they're already covered by a government plan.",
        "And I think what you're seeing now is that the support for the public option is on the increase, not on the decrease.",
        "And so having people tell all kinds of stories - I mean, they came out with such ridiculous stories as the death panels and stuff like that.",
        "I guess there might really be death panels, but they're the insurance companies right now that deny 30 percent of your claims, so that if you need treatment, the insurance company says no, I guess that could have an adverse affect on you.",
        "The AFL-CIO convention is coming up and the president of your organization, John Sweeney, is going to be retiring.",

        "This isn't some tie-dye and dreadlock affair.",
        "It's suits, elevator pitches, business cards and, OK, the occasional whiff of something extra.",
        "To be fair, though, there is something for folks here to celebrate.",

        "states and recreationally legal in those eight, it's still all illegal under federal law.",
        "For the last few years, the Obama Justice Department has just been hands-off, issuing memos that basically say the federal government will not come after marijuana sellers or buyers in states that have chosen to legalize it.",
        "The problem is, Walsh says...",
        "Theoretically, the new administration could basically tear up those memos, and all of these businesses would be in clear violation of federal law.",

        "Steph Sherer is the executive director of Americans for Safe Access, a group that advocates for legal access of marijuana for medical and research use.",
        "Back at the Marijuana Business Convention and Expo, she says that she hopes states will fight the federal government if it tries to crack down on recreational as well as medical use.",
        "One reason they might, she says, is that marijuana is a huge money maker for those states since they can tax it and charge business licensing fees.",

        "Medical users, she says, will fight.",
