        "And I know that there's a great need for things to become clear in the end, but I actually think that kind of jittery feeling of uncertainty and, yeah, just a lack of clarity about who you are, how you define yourself, how you define yourself against the person who's next to you in the room watching the same thing with you is extremely vital.",
        "Kara Walker was born and raised in Stockton, California, but at the age of 12 moved to Atlanta, Georgia.",
        "She left a place where her race didn't seem to matter for a place where it did matter, on several levels.",
        "Her family's move coincided with the Atlanta child murders, a two-year period during 29 black youths were found dead.",
        "Dean of the Yale School of Art Robert Storr says the artist's work goes straight to the essence of the racial divide and splays it open.",
        "We would prefer to accept a sort of negotiated truce about race relations in this country, which are not good, and what she does is she destabilizes that negotiated truce and says actually there's still trouble out there, and I can look at it, I can laugh at it, I can smile at it.",
        "You can do that with me, but you can also know that it's real trouble and it's not over.",
        "It's what Walker calls the chasm, a well of stereotyped images that linger in our subconscious.",
        "From it Walker dredges up Southern belles with hourglass waists and flowing hair and what she called picaninnies, black girls with fat lips and short little braids.",
        "She creates them using an artform normally associated with genteel images of domesticity.",
        "Silhouettes were popular at the turn of the last century, placing profiles or sweet cherubic faces in black against a clean white background.",
        "Using just paper, a grease pencil and an X-acto knife, Storr says Walker has turned the artform on its head with incredible dexterity.",
        "Because you have one cut to make, you can't unmake it.",
        "Because the tool itself if very tricky, you have to sculpt a figure with no room for error in great detail before striking, and then when you strike you have to know exactly where you're going and what you're doing.",
        "NPR's Susan Davis, thanks a lot.",
        "You bet.",
        "Now there is support, as I said, for these families, and there is a sense I guess on the street - there is a growing sort of sense of frustration that doesn't appear up until now.",
        "You know, this has gone on for 10 days.",
        "There doesn't appear to have been a great deal of movement.",

        "How are people responding to what the government has been doing?",
        "Of course the prime minister, Blair, says Britain will neither apologize nor negotiate, that they insist on unconditional release.",
        "I think there's always a sense of kind of support in Britain for that firm sort of stance.",
        "Obviously in the sort of local communities, on the ground where people perhaps know these captives, and obviously amongst their sort of friends and families, there's a different element to that.",
        "People obviously want to see steps taken to secure their release, and if that means sort of some form of compromise and a slight sort of softening of the approach, if you like, from the British government, then I think people are keen to see that and keen to, as I said, basically to get these people back home.",

        "Yeah, yeah, it's tough diplomacy, really.",
        "It's - there's just no easy option here.",
        "There's not a military option to this crisis, so the British government is spending a great deal of time both with its own Iranian contacts - and unlike of course America, Britain does have diplomatic relations with Iran - as well as working with allies like America, eyes in the U.N., eyes in the European Union to bring what pressure can be brought on the Iranian regime.",
        "Yet every time pressure seems to be applied, Iran for example objected to the idea of taking this to the United Nations.",

        "Yes, I did.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "No, this is very difficult, and the difficulty is that the Iranian government is a very, very difficult beast to deal with.",

        "There's a lot of evidence to suggest that these sort of military maneuvers which resulted in these servicemen and women being taken was to some extent related to orders from Tehran from the spiritual, religious government in Iran, as well as the civilian government.",
        "Now actually we're dealing with, at the moment in Iran, where those two governments are closer together than they have been for some years, but it's still a very, very difficult situation.",
        "There are people in Iran who like to see confrontation, who see the best way of dealing with the West, dealing with Britain and other governments, is to confront, is to produce these sort of demonstrations of power.",
        "There are those who actually sensibly regard engagement and further discourse and dialogue with the West as a good thing and would be shaking their heads in despair at what's happening and having to - for the British government to be negotiating and maneuvering through this thicket of diplomatic complexity is very difficult.",
        "Do British people feel to some degree that they've been singled out as sort of an American ally in this, as sort of a proxy for the United States?",
        "Well, as you know and your listeners know, the war in Iraq was very controversial here in the U.K., and there is a strong body of public opinion that regards Britain's involvement in the war as a mistake.",
        "And that has often been weaved into a view about the weaknesses, if you like, of Britain being so closely identified with the U.S."

        "Four hundred and forty four days, if I'm not mistaken, on that count.",
        "And nevertheless, this also comes on the 25th anniversary of the Falklands War, a time when Britain took much more decisive action.",

        "And so I think rightly the default of the British commanders on the ground was to first see whether this issue could be resolved amicably.",
        "It could have easily been a mistake.",
