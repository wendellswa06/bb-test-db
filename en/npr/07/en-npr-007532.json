        "Absolutely, and I think that's the key thing to remember here.",
        "This may very well have been a small incident in which the Iranians may have thought that the Brits were in Iranian waters.",
        "Perhaps the Brits were in Iranian waters.",
        "But the reason why something like this has blown up to become this major international incident is because the political context that it's taking place in, in which Iran and the west is at a major standoff over various number of issues, particularly the nuclear ambitions of Iran, the nuclear program in Iran, which Iranians say is entirely peaceful and the United States suspects that it is not.",
        "And others (unintelligible).",
        "And others.",
        "In fact, the coincidence is the day these sailors were seized, the United Nations passed its most latest set of sanctions against Iran for its refusal to abide by the dictates of (unintelligible).",
        "A couple of days after this incident there was a second U.N.",
        "resolution that increased the sanctions on Iran just a notch or two.",
        "It wasn't particularly hawkish but it was still a defeat for the Iranians in the sense that the Security Council reacted rather quickly to their passing of the previous deadline and the fact that it was a unanimously approved U.S.",
        "Security Council resolution.",
        "And there is another factor that goes into this, and that is that several Iranians, particularly five men seized at what the Iranians called a diplomatic mission and the United States says it wasn't.",
        "But anyway, the United States says they are intelligence agents and were captured inside Iraq in Mosul.",
        "And the Iranians want them back, and maybe there could be some quid pro quo.",
        "I don't think they're looking for a quid pro quo necessarily, but I think what this probably is is that back in December 2006, when the Bush administration was under a lot of pressure to negotiate with Iranians, the Bush administration came out and said they can't negotiate at this time because they don't have the leverage, Iran is holding all the cards, and that this needed to change before any negotiations could take place.",
        "And immediately after that you started to see U.S.",
        "forces arresting Iranian diplomats, arresting Iranian personnel inside of Iraq.",
        "Those people have still been held in Iraq sovereignty.",
        "Iran has had no access to them.",
        "And at least two of them have been diplomats, several of them their status is disputed.",
        "I think what this may be is a response from the Iranians saying, if it is okay for the United States to abduct Iranian personnel in order to get leverage for a future potential negotiation, well then the Iranians can play the same game and they can also target coalition forces and take them in order to gain leverage over the U.S.",
        "The problem with all of this, of course, is that none of these countries are increasing their leverage.",
        "All they're doing is that they're closing the diplomatic window.",
        "And of course if those had been American sailors and Marines that the Iranians had captured this might be a very different story.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think just as much as the Iranians are a soft target for the U.S., I think the U.S.",
        "feels rather comfortable being able to take Iranian diplomats anymore without necessarily fearing too many repercussions.",
        "I think the Brits are soft targets for the Iranians in the sense that you can escalate it by taking the Brits, but it's a controlled escalation.",
        "Had you targeted American personnel, then it would have been an uncontrolled escalation and we may have seen a much, much greater military confrontation ensue."

        "This is Josh.",
        "Josh with us from South Bend, Indiana.",
        "Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the disputed nature of the waters where the British sailors were captured.",
        "I mean, obviously I think everyone hopes they're returned safely, but the point kind of gets lost in all the tension already in the region that, you know, as far as the Iranians are concerned, they were in Iranian waters.",
        "And the Brits see it otherwise.",
        "And to kind of have this standoff over something that most people can understand the dispute, to me, seems to be just too much fire.",
        "Well, Trita Parsi, the first position actually released to the Iranians where they said they captured the Brits was in Iraqi waters.",
        "Then they corrected it and they said the GPS equipment that the British sailors had showed that they were in Iranian waters.",
        "And the British says look, we flew a helicopter over the spot where this happened.",
        "It's clearly in Iraqi waters.",
        "There's not a dispute necessarily where the line is.",
        "It's a dispute with which side the boat was on.",
        "Well that is the British side of this story in the sense that they say the Iranians first agreed to a position that was in Iraqi waters.",
        "I have not heard that coming from the Iranians.",
        "I think it's really difficult to be able to say where they actually were.",
        "The British have produced some evidence that they say indicates that their sailors were in Iraqi waters with the GPS and showing where the Indian boats was and where the helicopter that was hovering above that boat was.",
        "Just to clarify, the British sailors were inspecting an Indian vessel suspected of smuggling.",
        "They didn't find anything on it.",
        "That's why they were on a small boat off of HMS Cornwall.",
        "They were heading back to the frigate when this happened.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And then the Iranians confiscated the GPS instruments of the British, at least one of the GPS instruments.",
        "And that one showed that not only, according to the Iranians, not only were they in Iranian waters at that time but also at five previous moments.",
        "And there is a lot of tension not only because of this, but there's a bad history between Iran and Britain.",
        "Britain had a major role in overthrowing the democratically elected prime minister of Iran in 1953.",
        "Recently, there's been a lot of bombings taking place on the Iranian side of the border with ethnic separatists that the Iranians suspect are supported or tacitly supported by the British because they're based on the Iraqi side, where the Brits are in control.",
        "So there's a lot of different factors that is really complicating this issue.",
        "And vice versa too, the British in southern Iraq believe the Iranians are behind some of the attacks on their forces.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well actually they have not been as - they haven't spoken out as strong as the U.S.",
        "may have done.",
        "Their indications have gone in different directions on this issue.",
        "But nevertheless, there's a lot of different tensions there, which then makes this issue so much bigger than just where were the sailors and where does the boundary go.",
        "Josh, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Let's see if we can go to - this is Travis.",

        "Correct.",
        "Correct.",
        "Yeah, my question is this.",
        "Your guest kind of referred to the British forces as being soft targets.",
        "Has the British military reputation decreased since Margaret Thatcher and the era of the Iron Maiden so much that they would even attempt that?",
        "And, you know, would the Iranians even think about doing that back when, you know, she was the Iron Maiden and she was in charge without worrying about, you know, the SAS, you know, stepping through Tehran to get their guys back?",
        "British reputation or British capabilities, Trita Parsi?",
        "Well, there's much of this context that has changed.",
        "The caller accurately points out that Margaret Thatcher is not around anymore.",
        "And that's absolutely true and that's an important…",
        "Still around but not in charge.",
        "Not in charge.",
        "But there are other factors involved as well, which one is the British public in general tends to view the British involvement in Iraq as a major mistake that has overstretched Britain's abilities not only militarily but also diplomatically.",
        "But what about the reputation of their military?",
        "I mean there was a time during the '80s when, you know, like when the British SAS went into the Libyan embassy, you know, the British SAS has operated extensively throughout the Middle East when it was just understood that if you did something to their men you might very well have, you know, the leader of the British - that Britain was more than willing to send off guys in the middle of the night to deal with you.",
        "I think we have to take a look at this in relative terms in a sense that, compared to the Americans, the Brits are soft target regardless of what the reputation was 25 years ago.",
        "Thanks for the call, Travis.",
        "No problem.",
        "Okay.",
        "The ongoing - the larger questions that revolve around this was brought up by our earlier guest, Ed Owen, saying: Look, we're not ever quite sure which government we're dealing with Iran, whether this was a rogue operation put forward by hardliners who were looking for an opportunity to put the pressure on domestically their rivals in Tehran."
