        "Throughout the election campaign, Rene Preval has been careful not to connect himself too strongly to Aristide's Lavalas Party.",
        "He ran on his own ticket, called La Esperanza, or Hope.",
        "But he allowed himself to be adopted by some Lavalas supporters, particularly those in the vast slum areas of Port-au- Prince, where violence is rife and gun battles with U.N.",
        "forces common.",
        "Well, tonight after these 9 p.m. rockets, Israel says it hit the rocket launcher that was used to fire the rockets in that attack.",
        "It's not clear at this point what else might have been hit.",
        "But the attacks continued beyond that time period.",
        "Earlier today, Israel says it hit a mosque in Gaza, where weapons were stored, according to the military.",
        "Also the Israeli military says it hit four militants that were involved in rocket attacks.",
        "According to the Palestinians, two nephews of the former Hamas prime minister in Gaza were among the people killed today.",

        "The Israeli military says they're looking into that incident.",
        "Is there any sense that there are cease-fire efforts going on?",
        "A little bit.",
        "It's good beginning to sound like there are some efforts.",
        "It's not clear if or when they would really blossom.",
        "And what each side might need to feel it's accomplished, before they could sign off on a cease-fire agreement.",
        "As Daniel mentioned, European and U.S.",
        "diplomats are expressing serious concern.",
        "Egypt has been a key broker between Hamas and Israel in the past.",
        "But there's a different government there now than the one that was more sympathetic to Hamas and brokered a cease-fire after the 2012 conflict between Israel and Hamas.",
        "The Egyptian president, el-Sisi's office put out a statement today saying that Egypt is in close contact with both Israelis and Palestinians to quote \"\"halt the violence and military operations that stem from stubbornness and intransigence.",
        "And we're seeing reports that Israel is now warning people to evacuate from northern Gaza.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Well, among Palestinians who've received those warnings, there's a fear that that means that a ground invasion is imminent.",
        "The Israeli military tells NPR that it doesn't mean that a ground invasion is necessarily coming, but that the military believes there is a concentration of Hamas operatives in that area.",
        "And they intend to step up attacks.",

        "The rising civilian death toll in Syria has increased calls to arm the Syrian opposition.",
        "And Turkey has been mentioned as a likely transit point for arms.",
        "It's a member of NATO and Syria's neighbor.",
        "But so far, Turkey has been reluctant to send significant arms across the border.",
        "NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul.",
        "As far as Syria is concerned, Turkey already is arming the Free Syrian Army, which Damascus refers to as armed terrorist gangs.",
        "But Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu recently dismissed that as transparently false.",
        "If Turkey is supplying arms to the rebels, he asked, then why are their weapons so few and so primitive?",
        "The mounting pressure for someone to do something to stanch the bloodshed in Syria has some eager to jump on the slightest hint that Turkey may act.",
        "For example, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan mentioned humanitarian corridors recently, and so did Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay, in remarks to Turkish broadcaster NTV.",
        "(Foreign language spoken)",
        "In cautious, highly-qualified comments, Atalay said Turkey is working with international partners, especially the Arab League, to better protect civilian life in Syria.",
        "In that context, he said, buffer zones were among the options being considered.",
        "Immediately, some analysts declared that such safe zones could be a game changer in the Syrian conflict, opening the door to foreign military intervention, which would likely improve the environment for opposition fighters and civilians alike.",
        "Istanbul-based analyst Hugh Pope, with the International Crisis Group, says that argument correctly concludes that there can be no such thing as a civil humanitarian corridor in Syria - it would have to be enforced by the military.",
        "But Pope says there are a number of reasons why Turkey doesn't want its troops to take the lead on this, including real questions about the ability of the Turkish army to carve out and maintain such corridors in a combat environment."

        "On paper, it has the second-biggest army in NATO.",
        "But you have to look at the situation inside Turkey, where the Turkish army has been pinned down for years trying to defeat its own Kurdish insurgency.",
        "And this is not a very credible idea that the army is sprightly enough to go and take on another army in even more difficult circumstances.",
        "The Syrian army is very well-armed.",
        "According to Western officials, the Syrian regime is getting its weapons from Russia and Iran.",
        "Pope says some of the Western enthusiasm for Turkey to flex its muscle can be traced to events from the late-1990s, when Damascus did give up a wanted Kurdish insurgent leader, after military threats from Ankara.",
        "But he says its wishful thinking to imagine that scenario playing out in this case.",
        "I think some people are remembering that when Turkey growls, Damascus folds its hand.",
        "This is absolutely not applicable in this case 'cause the Syrian regime is fighting for its existence.",
        "Others point out that it's not just the Syrian regime's survival at issue, but vital national interests of another neighbor, Iran, which uses Syria to project its influence into the Middle East.",
        "Gokhan Bacik, reached via Internet at Zirve University in Gaziantep, near the Syrian border, says two very powerful and very different forces are colliding in Syria - the international impulse to stop the horrific scenes of humanitarian suffering, and the age-old calculations of national interests.",
        "Bacik says, in theory, it should be possible to convince Iran that regime change in Syria needn't be a threat.",

        "But anything that you can get saved and add to over the course of a 18 or 21 or 25 years that you want to do for your child is just tremendous.",
        "And at least in my parents' case, it wasn't just that they were investing money for me through that account - where, again, they were the trustees but I was the actual owner, which is a very common way to do this -but it was that they were teaching me along the way.",
        "So they were interesting me in things like Hasbrow and Mattel, whether there ever will be a Monopoly-themed Star Wars.",
        "And so, you know, it makes it real for you as a child and then a teenager.",
        "And you start to realize that the stock market isn't really that much different from the farmer's market.",
        "It's just that rather than buying fruit and vegetables, you're buying part-ownership in American companies or foreign multinationals, you're looking for great businesses.",

        "It's a great question, John.",

        "For example, BMW is traded in Germany but you can be a part owner of BMW because it's also on the Pink sheets here in the U.S.",

        "So I think it's all coming together, but I would suggest to you that about 30 percent exposure is appropriate.",
        "And that can take one of two forms, you can buy foreign stocks outright, or remember that when you buy a company like Coca-Cola, the majority of Coke's business is actually outside the U.S.",
        "And so a lot of the large American companies, Dell and others - actually I can't say off the top of my head what the mix is for Dell - but these are companies that operate globally.",
