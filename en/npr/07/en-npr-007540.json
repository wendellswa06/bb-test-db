        "Well, because just last Tuesday, this Tuesday, the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, argued that these sorts of emergencies are best handled for limited things like the Zika crisis, the Zika virus and said that an emergency declaration wasn't necessary at this point and said that the administration was still working to develop a comprehensive strategy.",
