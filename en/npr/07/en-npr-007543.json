        "And again, I'm sorry to sound like a broken record here, but when they did take a look at this in 2000, I mean, one of the conclusions that they made was that, based on their look at all of the studies that had been done to that point, at that point, that the risk to women who consumed large amounts of seafood during their pregnancy is likely, and I'm quoting exactly from their report, is likely to be sufficient to result in an increase in the number of children who have to struggle to keep up in school.",

        "And the government doesn't really do anything.",
        "And so while various entities of the government, various people in government, are saying that this can be avoided, and it could be avoided, what they're not doing is giving Americans good advice so they can go to their supermarket and shop for something safely.",

        "Well, that's what some people would say.",
        "Why should you have to go to a very hard to manage government website to find some information, and then when you back out, what the government actually says, and you look at how they come up with some of their advice, they actually acknowledge there, and this is in public records, they actually acknowledge that they based some of their recommendations, not on whether the fish was necessarily safe to eat, but on market share.",
        "And should a government agency that's in charge of protecting public health, this is one of the points we make in the series, should that agency be basing something on market share, or should they be basing it on what's safe for public health?",
        "I think they should be basing it on what's safe for public health.",
        "And I think we all should be basing what we recommend on what's best for children's health.",
        "And if consuming fish is good for children's health, then we should be recommending that.",
        "If the toxicity of the mercury at higher levels is a problem, then we should recommend that they not consume things that are higher level.",
        "But, you know, the brain is a large percentage of fatty acids, and the fatty acids that are present in fish are basically building blocks for children's brains.",
        "And it's important that children get these.",
        "I mean, recently people have been arguing about, and recommending adding DEHA, which is one of the, long-chain fatty acids, to baby's formulas for this very reason.",
        "So, I think that we have to...",
