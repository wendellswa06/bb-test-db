        "But it really had a lot of really intricate detailing.",
        "It had some really beautiful embellishments with crystals.",
        "And there were tons of tiny little rosettes and satin that were all over the dress.",
        "And I think that the silhouette was really flattering on her, played up her arms which are her best assets, and I think the white was, you know, was really pretty on camera.",
        "And I think she looked, you know, she looked like a goddess.",
        "What impact do you think that she is going to make or perhaps, has already made regarding the way women dress and how they feel about their bodies especially since Mrs. Obama doesn't have what you might call a stick figure?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that Michelle really shows, you know, the average woman that.",
        "You know, it's easy to find pieces that are flattering.",
        "You know, it's just about knowing your body and knowing what works for your shape.",
        "And her use of color, I think, is really encouraging.",
        "A lot of women are afraid to wear color, but Michelle does a lot of fun things with color, where she'll mix brights and neutrals and all kinds of things, which a lot of women wouldn't think to do normally."
