        "Are you suggesting that it's now possible for hardliners, militants in Hezbollah, to determine the direction of events in the Middle East - and they can drag unwilling Arab governments along behind them?",
        "Arab governments are not going to be dragged behind them.",
        "And, I think the Israelis are banking on this by hitting civilian targets, making life miserable for people in Lebanon, now, with the electricity off - water.",
