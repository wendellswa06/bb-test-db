        "Now, as you mention, you know, the first boomer--not all, but the first boomer has just turned 60, and so in the next few years this generation will be thinking about not just retirement but what version of retirement do they want to live, do I want to live, do each of us want to live.",
        "And as we begin to kind of scratch our head and think about this new next chapter in our lives, marketers and even communities are beginning to realize that, my God, this is a lot of people, they got a lot of money, they're going to have a lot of benefits, a lot of entitlements, a lot of needs.",
        "And on the other hand, they're not particularly dangerous, so they're not a security problem and they won't necessarily need new schools to be built.",
        "Right.",
        "So it's a pretty attractive group to recruit to your community.",
        "Apart from the fact that there are more of us, I mean, is there anything different about the way--for instance, income, is there anything different about that than in previous generations?",
        "Well, the truth of it is that when people reach their 50s, they're in their peak earning years, and that usually goes on until retirement day, which upon average is around 64.",
        "I want to point out, though, that about 80 percent of boomers expect to be working beyond retirement day.",
        "They may want to work at something new and different.",
        "Maybe you've been a corporate executive and now you'd like to open up a coffee shop, or maybe you've been a schoolteacher and you'd like to try your hand at being a poet.",
        "It's a generation that intends to continue earning and partly, I'm sure, that's being caused by the realization that entitlements and pensions are sort of dissolving around us, but they'll have money to spend but even more interesting, Frank, compared to our moms and dads, and I'm 55 myself, our moms and dads grew up in the shadow of the Depression.",
        "And so even though it turns out they're now the wealthiest segment in American society, they've always grown up somewhat frugal.",
        "They were never inclined to be free-spending with their money.",
        "Boomers are quite the opposite.",
        "The boomers unfortunately sometimes spend more than they even have.",
        "So here you've got a generation about to have more free time than ever before, more willing to relocate, a whole set of new adventures in front of them and both with money and the willingness to spend it.",
        "That's a pretty interesting consumer audience, whether you're selling automobiles, furniture, software or housing in your community.",
        "Unidentified Man #7: Yes.",

        "Now, how important is the overseas vote?",
        "That came up a lot in previous elections, you know, with President Bush and military ballots, for example, being an important factor.",
        "But this time around, do you think the overseas vote, military and non-military, is going to make a difference?",
        "Any amount of votes can make a difference if a state is close.",
        "One of the things that's going on is that our voting systems have a substantial margin of error, and sometimes, like the 2000 election, the outcome is within that margin of error.",
        "And in that sense then, any votes, in particular votes that we aren't quite clear on how to handle, like overseas votes, military votes that come in late, sort of raise doubts and questions about the nature of the election.",
        "All right, Mark, we're going to bring in Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat.",

        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for having me today.",
        "So, you've been overseas for 15 years, and how do you find the process of voting?",
        "Is it easy?",
        "Is it hard?",
        "Well, I'm not sure you know much about Overseas Votes Foundation.",
        "We actually have taken what is a federal program, the Overseas Voting Program is, run under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.",
        "And there is a book of guidelines that's put out by the Federal Voting Assistance Program, an agency in Washington, and they publish the state-by-state guidelines.",
        "There is some commonality across the federal level, and voters do use the form across all states.",
        "What Overseas Vote Foundation has done is, we've taken that form and all the different variations that the states have in terms of implementing the regulations, and we've automated that.",
        "So voting has really changed from overseas.",
        "We run 17 websites, and we've had over three million, actually, over three and a half million overseas visitors come to our site this year.",
        "Things have really changed, and they've changed through technology.",
        "So, basically, you can be a clearinghouse for information just as there are domestic clearinghouses where people can go and register to vote for every state.",
        "I mean, at this point, though, you know, there is a closing of the voter registration window.",
        "Most states are progressing to the point.",
        "Some, you can register up until the very last minute, but many of them, some of them have already passed their voter registration deadline.",
        "So I'm assuming that, depending on where the people living overseas are from, some of them may, if they haven't registered yet, it's just too late.",
        "Well, that's true, but there are so many variations, like Mr. Sawyer was saying.",
        "It's really important that people don't take for granted that they can't vote.",
        "For example, if you are on the roles as a registered voter, then you simply need to file the standard form of what's called a ballot request, and you might have up to election day to do that, which means you can get online, in 10 minutes have that form, fax it over, follow up by mail, and then the next day, turn around and use the online ballot that we have and ship it over with FedEx.",
        "So, all of these things are possible very quickly now with the use of technology.",
        "I really do want to emphasis that the paradigm has changed this year, and the result may be surprising.",
        "Speaking of results, Mark, who's responsible for tallying up overseas votes, and, I mean, is it done in a timely manner?",
        "Probably not.",
        "And, again, that depends on state by state, county by county.",
        "The votes go to those places.",
        "And, across the United States, there's a wide variation in how individual ballots are handled, what kind of ballots are handed out.",
        "So, look, the thing is, is that people who are either displaced for various reasons, who are overseas really have to be proactive about trying to make sure they get their vote in and getting their vote counted.",
        "Susan, are you ever concerned or does your group ever deal with the question of what happens to the votes once they're delivered?",
        "Well, we're pretty familiar with the laws.",
        "And legally, every vote has to be counted, whether it comes from overseas or from next door to the election office.",
        "And we know that's the truth.",
        "Now, some voters - some ballots, excuse me, may get counted later.",
        "Many states now have extended deadlines for receiving the absentee ballots from overseas.",
        "So, if they're post marked from overseas in time by election day, they can still arrive at the election office for sometimes up to two weeks after the election.",
        "But they are counted."

        "How many were rejected.",
        "So this is a law.",
        "I mean, it is a requirement.",
        "I'm dismayed, and I know a lot of voters are dismayed from all the rumors that their votes don't get counted.",
        "That - I, frankly, don't believe it.",
        "What would you like to see change, if anything, in the policies in the way this overseas voting is run?",
        "What we'd like to see is that all states have the same requirements.",
        "Right now, you might have a couple that live together.",
        "They both vote in different states for the very reason that they both moved from different states.",

        "You might have extra questions in some states, and, fortunately, we've programmed all that in our website at overseasvotefoundation.org, but still, there's a benefit to some uniformity.",
