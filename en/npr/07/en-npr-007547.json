        "So today's retirees, who in a way are the guinea pigs of this retirement experiment, worked very hard, were not very well-educated and their dream in retirement was to be on vacation.",
        "And so today's retirement landscape is a lot about kind of retirement holidays and retirement housing and retirement communities and, in fact, if you go to Webster's Dictionary and look up the word `retirement,' it says `to disappear.'",
        "The other thing that's reflected is that today's elders were somehow promoted to the--consider the idea that living just with people their own age was really going to be grand.",
        "Boomers have had the benefit of watching their own parents go through these choices and neighbors and aunts and uncles.",
        "And, first of all, I think that what boomers really want is a life of the mind.",
        "They want to be where the action is, not where it's not.",
        "I think college towns and cities are about to have a revival as boomers want to be where the lectures are, the workshops, the cool people, the coffeehouses, the bookstores.",
        "And in addition, 93 percent of boomers in a recent study when asked `Would you like to live in a community that's just people your own age, you know, like a retirement community, or multigenerational?'--93 percent say, `I want to be with people of all ages.'",
        "Yeah.",

        "At the same time, there's been some creep in the idea that rules vary so wildly across counties, across states, means that people really have to be very proactive and knowledgeable about how to get in, how to vote, and how to make sure their vote gets counted.",
        "And it does matter.",
