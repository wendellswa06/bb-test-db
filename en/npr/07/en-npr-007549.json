        "Get too many retirees in your town, like we have in Grants Pass, and you have a heck of a hard time floating a school bond initiative.",
        "A lot of the seniors just don't want to pay any taxes.",
        "Oh, so there's the downside.",
        "We hadn't thought about that.",
        "I mean, the upside is that they don't need schools, so you don't have to build so many classrooms and hire teachers.",
        "On the other hand--had you thought about that?",
        "Is that a consideration, Ken?",
        "I mean, is there this downside before we get a comment from...",
        "Yeah, there is.",
        "By the way, I've been to Tyler.",
        "You know, it got hit by the oil boom a few decades ago and now it's perhaps a great place for people to consider relocating.",
        "But Malcolm is also right.",
        "If you're--if any population becomes too heavily concentrated with older people, you run the risk of becoming a kind of a `gerassic park,' G-E-R-A-S-S-I-C, where all of a sudden the older people just take over and often and unfortunately they tend to vote away from school programs, they vote away from certain kinds of infrastructure which then could cause the community to lose some of its appeal to younger families.",
        "Multigenerationality is really what it ought to be, not just one or the other.",
        "Tom, is that something that worries you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a common issue that comes up.",
        "And let me make two points.",
        "One is we don't want to become just a retirement community.",
        "I think I said that a minute ago that we want them to become a part of the community and we're going to be retirement-friendly.",
        "But we don't want that to be the dominant makeup of our economy.",
        "Secondly--excuse me, about 15 years ago, Texas A&M did an interesting study with Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi retirees that had relocated within the last couple of years, and they found out that people that are willing to relocate from where they've been for decades to a new retirement location tend to be higher income, higher education; a lot of them are younger retirees.",
        "And when they get to a community, they like to get involved.",
        "And when asked the question, `If you've been there for at least two years and have you had a chance to vote on a school bond issue, how did you vote?",
        "a strong majority of them voted to support the school bond issue.",
        "And what we found out is that the people who tend to be against growth and against schools and taxes are the people who never left town.",
        "Aha.",
        "That's an interesting way.",
        "That's very interesting.",
        "Thank you for your call, Malcolm.",
        "That's very interesting."

        "What does that mean?",
        "We put that program together ourselves.",
        "We looked at other states; Tennessee and Mississippi have a program at a state level where they'll certify communities after they meet a certain list of criteria that would be attractive to retirees, you know, like the list I read earlier, and then maintain that and have a point of contact and really work hard to take care of the issues and questions and needs of retirees.",
        "We put that program together on a regional basis here about five years ago and then just this last legislative session, the state Legislature has now implemented a statewide certification program for retirees.",

        "But there's fantastic other regions in the country to live for people at all levels of income, if you do a little bit of searching.",
        "And more people in the years to come will do more of that, and a lot of these regions are going to start reaching out for you because they'd like your Medicare spend and they'd like your dollar over at the coffee shop and they'd like for you to be paying rent or mortgage payments on your home.",
