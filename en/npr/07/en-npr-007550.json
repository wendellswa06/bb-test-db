        "Hi, Lynn.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "Good.",
        "I retired actually in my late--well, mid-late 40s and I'm now 54 and I've been in Truckee for almost eight years.",
        "But--and I initially picked Truckee because I wanted mountains and cross-country skiing and trails to run and stuff like that, but I'm finding Truckee somewhat intellectually empty.",
        "And so I'm thinking in a few years I will probably move to a town with a university or at least a research institute, but again another small town.",
        "I'm thinking maybe Santa Fe or a place like that.",
        "Hmm.",
        "How many people--thank you for your call, Lynn.",
        "How many people change, you know, go to a completely different kind of community or do you think will look for a complete change in lifestyle?",
        "You know, it's a great question, Frank, but I think for our grandparents, they kind of grew up and passed away within probably 10 miles of their childhood.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then our moms and dads may have moved a little bit and maybe even taken that big jump to move to a different town in retirement.",
        "Again, the boomers are just so much less likely to be anchored down.",
        "They have--and by the way, the biggest gold rush right now in housing for this new generation are these time shares.",
        "So you can spend three months in Cabo San Lucas and three months in Lake Tahoe and three months in Manhattan, which is really kind of the penultimate of not having any one location.",
        "But this is a generation, just like Lynn has mentioned, who, if they don't like...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...you know, the way it is right now, they'll do some homework and maybe gather up some friends and, by the way, maybe even move with a group of friends and buy a house together and start a new life that'll match their new appetites and interests."

        "We knew that there was a niche that needed to be filled.",
        "This market is desirous of living in the same location with each other so that they could share that lifestyle without having any ramifications of it.",
        "What are your customers looking for?",
        "What do you think they're looking for?",
        "They're looking for the same thing any other baby boomer is: the nice house, nice location, safe--everything that the baby boomers are looking for, but also the added amenities.",
        "Definitely want to have social areas that they can get together and have parties and a lot of amenities, like with the walking trails and the exercise rooms.",
        "Fitness is very important to my customers.",
        "So it's very typical of baby boomers and not so much golf, though; although I do have a lot of customers that play golf.",
        "But I don't think that it is such a big thing for them to have the big golf course.",
        "But, you know, it does against one of the trends we've heard, and that is people who want to make sure that they are staying in diverse communities.",
        "They don't want to go into, they're saying, old-age retirement places like their parents, but in this case it's people who want to be among people like them."
