        "Whereas today, Turkey is not only engaged in a war against ISIL on the ground in Syria, but Turkey has also allied itself with Russia and Iran and has brokered a ceasefire in Syria.",
        "But there's a sense that Turkey's no longer really determined to fight the regime of Bashar Assad.",
        "And ISIL has become more determined in hitting not just Kurdish targets but these kind of Turkish targets and making it known that it is them hitting Turkey, which is I think a sign that they're growing more confident.",

        "They say they have the capacity to take this on.",
        "From what we know, do they?",
        "There is definitely a growing sense of determination in terms of fighting terrorism.",
        "However, in the last few months, the Turkish government, the Turkish state has engaged in a major purge of the security and military establishment, including the intelligence community, mainly because a lot of people from the Gulen movement, which is an Islamic movement seen by the Turkish government as the mastermind of the attempted coup last summer - and when you have such a major crackdown with thousands of people being fired, discharged, this is bound to create a certain vacuum, a certain problem in terms of capacity and personnel."
