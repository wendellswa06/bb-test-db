        "It's a strange thing to be in the mindset of someone who had done so many terrible things.",
        "But I think that I was also interested in exploring how his great dream for what Iraq could have been came to dust in his hands and what it was about his character that turned what was, in fact, a very strong and powerful vision for Iraq as a leading light in the region - how that turned into a nightmare.",

        "But I think your appreciation, Shohreh, of what it's like to be a woman in that culture was really significant in the way in which we were able to bring that world to the screen because it would be wrong to think that women are without power in that culture.",
        "They just have to find their own particular ways of exercising it."
