        "Yes, that's correct.",
        "So in the Republican primary, who appears to be - they're spending a lot of time there or doing pretty well there?",
        "Mike Huckabee has been doing extraordinarily well here and considering the amount of time he spent here, which is not a lot compared to some of his competitors.",
        "He did not work the state, I guess, very early the Romney did, does not have the campaign operation and the high dollar campaign team, those experts who - the campaigns sort of locked up very early.",
        "So Huckabee is doing very well.",
        "Romney is still doing well.",
        "Thompson is doing well, but fading.",
        "But if you looked at the five candidates, the latest polling sometimes have them all bunched together with the top three being Thompson, Romney and Huckabee.",
        "Do you have any sense of - as Huckabee has risen in South Carolina, at whose expense his risen or is it just a lot of undecideds coming to his camp?",
        "I think it's a mix.",
        "I think it's some undecided.",
        "But I also think Romney's lost a little bit, compared with Huckabee's rise.",
        "He's the guy who had the most to lose.",
        "He courted a lot of the religious conservatives that Huckabee now has won over.",
        "And Huckabee is now on radio.",
        "He's doing some advertising.",
        "He's spending money here.",
        "He is building himself as a Christian leader.",
        "So I think Romney is the guy who loses the most with Huckabee's surge.",
        "Now, for the Democrats - the interesting thing about South Carolina is that while it's a state that they very unlikely to carry in November, it's the first time that a sizable African-American electorate will take part in the candidates election process, unlike Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "Who's doing well there?",
        "Obama is actually surging.",
        "He had been behind Hillary Clinton, who is still leading, but they are really in a statistical tie.",
        "John Edwards is lurking.",
        "But the race, really, is between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, who began surging after the big Oprah visit to Williams-Brice Stadium, where they drew 30,000 people.",
        "So he is surging.",
        "But Hillary Clinton, she did lock up a lot of Democrats very early.",
        "And I think it's anybody's race between those two.",
        "Well, Leroy Chapman of The State in Columbia, South Carolina, thank you very much.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Well, every time we've done polling statewide in Nevada, Hillary Clinton has had a huge lead as much as nearly 40 points.",
        "But just as we've seen the race tightening, and Clinton even losing her lead in some other states, it seem to tighten just a little bit here.",
        "And it's really an open question whether that support for her was always quite soft or whether she really has built up, as her campaign claims, a very solid and robust campaign infrastructure here in the state.",
        "My impression of a Democratic primary or caucus in Nevada is, couple of people saying, I am more against dumping nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain than you are.",
        "Well, that sort of true.",

        "That's out little parochial issue.",
        "But when I talk to voters here and when we do polling here, they're concerned about the same things that voters, especially partisan-based voters, are everywhere else, which is the war, health care, immigration and on down from there.",

        "Yeah.",
        "In the context of this sort of everybody seeming to want to repeal this law, more than half of the people in the poll say that the Affordable Care Act has done more good than harm.",
        "So people have a positive, you know, view of what this law has done.",
        "And - this was interesting to me - 55 percent of the people we polled said they would prefer to see a single-payer health system in this country.",
        "You know, that - it did break down on party lines.",
        "Seventy percent of those were Democrats.",
        "But among independents, 55 percent wanted to see single-payer.",
        "Tell us about what people did and did not know, given how important this policy has been to the Obama administration.",
        "One thing that stood out for me is that a majority of those surveyed did know that the Affordable Care Act protects people with pre-existing conditions from being refused coverage and that it requires insurance companies to pay for preventive care, but there was something that they didn't know."

        "And what we're hearing now since Congress came into session in January - and we're hearing it from President-elect Donald Trump - is we're going to repeal it and replace it simultaneously.",
        "So even though they're on their way to repealing it, there's a sense that they're going to potentially slow that down while they come up with this replacement plan that they haven't actually showed the public up till now.",
