        "Well, there were local Republicans, state Republicans, nobody of national reputation visible because, really, national Republicans, as you say, have backed away from him.",
        "So I think most important to the senator was the presence of the governor - Republican Governor Butch Otter, who throughout this ordeal has refrained from criticizing Senator Craig in public and, even at one point, made a remark about how these events really show you who your friends are.",
        "So I think that his presence was very important to Senator Craig.",
        "There is a sense that the Republican leaders in Washington wanted Larry Craig to resign.",
        "They did not want the scandal hanging over their heads during the upcoming election.",
        "What are you hearing from the constituents there in Idaho and the way they perceived the way this has played out?",
        "Well, I think that's right.",
        "People here really talk about how the final shove here came from Washington, D.C.",
        "Idaho Republicans were not supporting Larry Craig, but they were also not going after him publicly.",
        "It was a very, sort of, pained silence here.",
        "And as the week wore on, the unsourced reports in the wires and elsewhere about the imminence of his resignation were really coming out of Washington, D.C.",
        "There was a sense here that that drumbeat was a national drumbeat.",
        "What happens now as far as naming a replacement for the senator?",
        "Well, that's up to the governor, Butch Otter.",
        "He, as a Republican, of course, will name another Republican.",
        "And the question here now is whether or not he picks a placeholder, as they say, some emeritus figure who'll just finish out the yearend change that Senator Craig would have left or whether he'll pick someone like the lieutenant governor, Jim Risch, who is politically ambitious and would likely run for reelection in his own right.",
        "Obviously, the Democrats here would very much like to see a placeholder because they don't want to face an incumbent.",
        "You never want to do that.",
        "But I am pretty sure the governor was not going to listen to them on what they think he should do.",
        "I think we might be seeing here another very ambitious Republican taking Senator Craig's place.",
        "Martin, Senator Craig said his resignation is effective on September 30th.",
        "Congress comes back to work next week after the long summer recess.",
        "Is there any indication of whether Senator Craig might show up for work next Tuesday?",
        "I think that's a really good question that we can't really answer right now.",
        "He's talked about this final month that he's given himself as a transition period.",
        "He'd like to move some of his staff over to the new person, whoever that may be.",
        "Whether he has to be there in person to do that is probably not necessary.",
        "And their series is called, \"\"The Other Walter Reed.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit of another of these documentaries.",
        "And this one is called \"\"Americans All, Immigrants All."
