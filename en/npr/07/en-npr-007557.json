        "Correct.",

        "One, the direction of the ground motions that were recorded through our network.",
        "A naturally occurring earthquake produces on vertical sensors a mixture of up and down motions that are a natural consequence of the slip on a fault - the force field acting on a fault.",
        "In the case of a mine-type collapse, all of the first motions are systematically down and that's what we observed on our seismic network.",
        "Also, looking at the recordings or other experts looking at recordings on high quality broadband seismograph in the region and at larger distances recognize the recordings as unusual and not simply consistent with a naturally occurring earthquake.",
        "Is the evidence, or lack thereof, of aftershocks, would that be a factor here?",
        "No, that's ambiguous.",
        "If the source of the energy released was slip on a fault.",
        "What we've observed, for example, we've recorded at least 10 events through this morning - Utah time, the largest magnitude 2.2.",
        "If there were slip on a fault at depth, these would be interpreted as aftershocks.",
        "If the primary event was the mine collapse, these could be interpreted as readjustments in the rock mass surrounding the mine.",
        "And our preliminary look at these recordings suggest that they have a character more like the main event - more like a mine collapse.",
        "You said you've registered 10 other events all much smaller.",
