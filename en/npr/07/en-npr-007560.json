        "Was it significantly disruptive is basically the Tinker Test.",
        "And speaking there is John Tinker.",
        "The Tinker Test dates back to the landmark 1969 ruling of a case that started four years earlier when John, his sister, Mary Beth, and a friend, Christopher Eckhardt, wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam War.",
        "Jurisprudence geeks take note, they weren't actually armbands.",
        "We went up to the local department store and bought a few yards of black cloth and we cut them up, ironed nice little seams, you know, folds for them and made nice neat little pieces of cloth that we pinned on our arms.",
        "Wearing the small, quiet symbol of dissent got John Tinker suspended from his Des Moines Iowa High School in 1965.",
        "When the case was finally argued before the court in 1969, Tinker actually missed his flight from Iowa to D.C.",
        "But friend and fellow litigant Christopher Eckhardt was there.",
        "Did you see it actually argued in the court?",
        "I did.",
        "Oh, so what was that like?",
        "But jittery as this city is today, Mackey doesn't think the marathon bombings are going to intimidate Boston in the long haul.",

        "And of course that was their whole case and Herick had to say yes, you know.",
        "And our attorney, Dan, walked out on cloud nine."

        "The 7-2 verdict gave the students their victory.",

        "Three years later, the Supreme Court agreed.",
        "In the 7-2 decision, the court judged the speech sufficiently disruptive.",
        "Today Frasier is himself a high school teacher who's sympathetic to the administrators' need to keep order, but doesn't think he'd necessarily punish a kid when he says something mildly offensive.",
        "I asked Frasier what he would have done if one of his students had displayed a sign that said Bong Hits 4 Jesus?",
        "I think I would use persuasion, as I feel the school should have done in my case.",
        "And I would be telling the student, come on, let's take it down and let's talk about this later.",
        "Frasier would probably be convincing.",
        "He's the coach of Stanford University's debate team.",

        "Just because, you know, I felt like I could go in there and represent myself and just - I just thought, hey, you know, we just go up here and tell our side of the story.",
        "Eckhardt served four years in prison.",
        "He thinks the judge was out to get a former protester.",
        "Whatever the truth, Eckhardt has turned his experiences into a long, sometimes rambling, sometimes fascinating blog.",
        "His wish is to find a publisher because, he says, he still believes in the power of free expression."

        "That was really the most shocking thing.",
        "Barrett says frozen produce does lose some nutrients during processing when it's blanched or steamed.",
        "But she says part of the reason the nutrition holds up well in frozen fruits and vegetables has to do with how quickly they're frozen after harvest.",
        "Typically the freezing facilities are very close to the place where the vegetable is grown.",
        "So within hours, that vegetable is frozen."
