        "Her premium will go up - by $24 a month.",
        "But under the federal law, she'll no longer have to pay for preventive care, and she figures that alone will more than make up for the additional premium costs."

        "Her policy offers low co-pays for doctor visits and a relatively low $3,000 family deductible, but she'll shed no tears to see it go.",
        "Bradford says that's because she's found several plans that will cost hundreds less in monthly premiums - even though her husband's income is too high for the family to qualify for a federal subsidy.",
