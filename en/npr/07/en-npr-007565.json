        "Now, at 35, he calls himself a learned optimist, and he talks about the power of positive psychology with the zeal of a new convert, explaining, for example, his decision to get off the tenure track because, as he says, teaching makes him happy, but having to publish doesn't.",

        "And that is all there is to it.",
        "And is that what Congressman Murtha proposed?",
        "Not really.",
        "Congressman Murtha proposed that there be a withdrawal of US forces from Iraq as quickly as possible, but he did not suggest that they be withdrawn from the entire region, however, that they be pulled back to areas adjacent to Iraq, because he said that the presence of American troops in Iraq is only stirring up more trouble and making American troops targets of attacks.",
        "This is radically different from what Murtha proposed.",
        "And in fact, it was drawn up by the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Duncan Hunter, who said that he did so because he did not want troops in Iraq to get the impression that Congress was losing its will to keep this war going, and we heard him on the floor say that.",
        "Those 140,000 personnel presently stationed in Iraq are obviously getting an impression about the United States Congress and its position with respect to all of the publicity that's emanated not just from this body in statements that have gone out from this body, but also from the other body that happened just a couple of days ago, and the headline stories that emanated from that.",
        "That's Duncan Hunter, the Republican committee chair.",
        "It was obviously pretty heated there.",
        "It was quite heated.",
        "The Democrats said that troops in Iraq would be quite surprised to hear that Republicans were proposing an immediate pullout.",
        "And a Republican who was recently elected, Jean Schmidt from the southeastern part of Ohio, then got up and she read a letter from a soldier stationed in Iraq that caused a huge outcry on the floor.",
        "Let's listen to that."
