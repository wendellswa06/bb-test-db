        "Then there's the fact that he was a little person with a disability that really made him an outcast and made his own life pretty horrific in some ways.",

        "Well, you know, Violence and trauma was a world that Bushwick was not afraid to deal with, and it wasn't always fictional, you know?",
        "One of the heaviest songs on his debut album, \"\"Little Big Man\"\" - it basically lays out a real-life event where Bushwick lost his eye to a gunshot during an argument with his girlfriend.",
        "He even ends up being declared dead before coming back to life when this happens.",
        "He was drunk on Everclear at the time, he says in the song, and that inspired the song's title, which was \"\"Ever So Clear,\"\" which really ends up being this clear-eyed, really confessional song of enlightenment for Bushwick.",
