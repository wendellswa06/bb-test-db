        "People aren't happy with their current health-care system, but they aren't willing to trade up or down for anything until they know exactly what it is.",
        "From what Jennings can see, Obama's campaign promises were the right ones, that people could keep what they have, it would be more secure and less expensive, and there'd be more choice.",
        "Obama didn't get bogged down in detail, says Jennings.",
        "And so far, he's not pushing a lot of confusing mandates.",
        "You don't hear about price controls or premium caps, or you don't talk about new government agencies.",
        "Both Burke and Jennings are optimistic that this time around, something will happen.",
        "Burke says that's in no small part because health insurance costs more, and more people are uninsured than in 1993.",
        "People are increasingly frightened.",
        "And their economic situation has grown worse.",
        "But as a result, they are losing their coverage, they are getting sicker, they are more costly to care for.",
        "So it's hard to imagine from a policy standpoint not addressing this issue.",
        "Both Burke and Jennings are encouraged by the president-elect's pick of Tom Daschle to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and the health-reform effort.",
        "Daschle, they say, knows how to get legislation through after his stint as Senate majority leader.",
        "And he knows health care because it's been one of his issues since his time as a Democratic senator.",
        "insurers, doctors, hospitals, patient groups.",
        "And they're facing a skeptical public worried about losing what they have.",
        "Burke says the public has to prepare itself.",
        "I think they have to anticipate that things will change.",
        "Among the changes Obama has been calling for: Employers would have to offer insurance or pay some kind of fine; insurers would have to cover pre-existing conditions; the government would offer a health plan anyone could join.",
        "That's a lot simpler than the 1993 plan, but it's destined to get a lot more complicated as the details get worked out.",
        "The challenge will be to keep the public involved and onboard until there's legislation ready to sign.",

        "The president talked about infrastructure, about education, immigration.",

        "The first question came from an infantryman in Akron, Ohio who had just returned from his second tour of Afghanistan.",
        "He's now out of work and wanted to know where the jobs are.",
        "Here's what President Obama said, in audio that was a little glitchy, but you can hear what he's saying anyway.",
        "We are making a big push with employers to say, these folks have shown leadership, they have been trained, they have performed at high levels in very difficult situations, they're going to be great assets to help rebuild the country.",
        "As this was YouTube, there were a lot of questions from young people and many of them were asking about jobs.",
        "The president kept pointing to job growth numbers from the last two years that are, as he put it, smaller than anyone would like.",
        "The overall jobs picture is still very tough out there.",
        "We created a million, point - 1,300,000 jobs last year in the private sector, which is a lot better than we had been doing.",
        "But it's still not enough.",
        "You keep hearing this tension between the president's plan to create jobs and the frustration with Americans that right now the jobs just simply do not exist yet.",
        "Ari, we just heard from David - as we just heard from David Welna, there's been a lot of talk this week about cutting deficits.",
        "Did that issue come up?",
        "It did, but the president didn't offer much more detail than in the State of the Union Address.",
        "At one point the president even gave an answer to a question that was less specific than the interviewer Steve Grove would have liked and so, Steve Grove of YouTube followed up.",
        "Here's what they said.",
        "What sorts of things, what sorts of programs do you think need to be cut?",
        "I did, and we're listening to it right now."

        "China apparently discovered that they didn't want to lose all their little girls.",

        "And most of the children are older or have special needs.",
        "And then, South Korea has had a more methodical retrenchment over decades, during which they have tried to create more of an adoption culture within the country so that more of the children would wind up in families there.",
        "Now looking at a country like Ethiopia, which only recently became a more popular place for international adoptions, specifically from the U.S., and already those numbers went down in 2011.",
        "How much of this has to do with shifts in cultural attitudes domestically in these countries?",
        "Well, it has a lot to do with cultural attitudes.",
        "It also has a lot to do with politics.",
        "There isn't a country that is proud of the fact that it cannot take care of its own children.",
        "But it's also true that within countries, as they realize that there's corruption, that there are rules that are hard to follow, sometimes they just retrench and then go forward again after they fix the problems.",
        "I think Ethiopia is a good example of that.",
        "They've found some real problems, and now they're in the process of trying to fix those.",

        "It's devastating for the families.",
