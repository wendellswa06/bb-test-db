        "It wasn't an epiphany.",
        "He says throughout his decades in the U.S.",
        "his family always knew that if the opportunity ever came, he would probably go back.",
        "It was not unexpected that I will take this decision.",
        "What was unexpected is that I actually didn't think it would happen.",
        "I was doing the bravado thing all these years, you know, Gadhafi will go and democracy will come back.",
        "But 40 years is a long time and after a while you start thinking, hey, this is not going to happen.",
        "Now, Tarhouni is betting his security, and possibly more, that it will happen.",
        "He fled Libya in 1973, after his pro-democracy activism drew the wrath of the Gadhafi regime, which stripped him of his citizenship.",
        "Arriving back on Libyan soil last month from Egypt, he says familiar landmarks were at once comforting and confusing.",
        "I found the same smells, still recognized some of the streets.",
        "I found the familiar but, also, I have to be honest with you, I didn't have time - I still don't have time to figure it out."

        "So far, he still sees it as an exhausting, exciting privilege.",
        "It was almost surreal, in a sense that - as a matter of fact even up to now - sometimes I wonder if this is still a dream.",
        "But it's also exhilarating that once in a while, you know, I insist on leaving this building and, you know, go out and walk for 10 minutes.",
        "And you see the people, and you see the faces and you realize, yeah, it's really true and it's really worth it.",
