        "I stay home with the kids.",
        "And especially recently, I would say within the past two to three months, the cost of our food has almost doubled to the point of - when I go to the grocery store, like I did today, I'm thinking of what I'm going to feed my kids and then whatever's leftover we eat.",
        "So I'll make a meal and it may not be for a family of five.",
        "We put all the food on the kids' plates, see what they eat, and then we'll eat whatever is leftover because...",
        "Sarah, we're going to have to take a break and I thank you for calling and giving us your story because we're going to try and find out what this food crisis means for all of us, the poorest in Haiti, as well as those of us here in the United States with our next guest, Jeffrey Sachs.",

        "I don't know if you've been listening, but we were talking with Tyler Hicks about his experience in Haiti.",

        "And then we also heard from an American woman who just came back from the grocery store, very comfortable, apparently middle-class woman saying she and her husband are eating less so their kids can eat more because it's costing them so much.",
        "How are these...",
        "Yeah, really shocking.",
        "How's it all connected?",
        "How did it get to this point?",
        "I feel like I just started hearing about it a couple of weeks ago.",
        "It has to have taken a while to get here, though.",
        "We have had a growing world economy, which means growing demand for food.",
        "And we've had a stagnant, at best, food supply for the last few years.",
        "That's run down inventory stocks so that the stock on hand of rice or wheat or maize was whittled down to the lowest levels, in fact, in more than 30 years.",
        "And when you take the rising demand, the climate shocks which meant that there were crop failures in major grain-producing areas, and then the really ill thought-out policy of taking a substantial part of our own food crop, particularly our corn, and turning it into ethanol for the gas tank.",
        "We've made quite a brew and this is a worldwide phenomenon.",
        "This problem of a shortage now that is exacerbated by a diversion of food into biofuels and this growing number of adverse shocks, climate shocks and other disturbances to the food supply.",
        "Finally, I would add the one more thing that we feel here in the United States and that is that because of the more general financial crisis that we have, the dollar has fallen a lot in value and that pushes up all of the prices of internationally traded goods, fuels, of course.",
        "Oil prices are at shocking levels.",
        "Food prices are a part of that, as well.",
        "How do the high oil prices contribute to the crisis?",
        "How does it all fit in?",
        "Well, there are a couple of ways.",
        "One is, of course, that oil is an input to production, transport and actually all of the physical activities to make the grains, including the fertilizers that go on the grains, which fertilizer prices have themselves doubled in the past year to unbelievable levels, a sticker shock for the farmers.",
        "And at the same time, because of the biofuel program, these soaring prices of gasoline at the pump.",
        "More and more of our corn supply through this very poorly thought-out subsidy program that we have for corn farmers who turn over their corn to turn it into ethanol is diverting a greater and greater share of our food production into ethanol, and therefore taking it away from the food chain.",
        "So the high-energy prices are working on both sides of the equation, as it were.",
        "Right.",
        "And wasn't ethanol supposed to be an alternative fuel that would - I mean, it's hard to find solutions here because for all of the different things that are coming together in terms of these...",
        "Black, African-American political figures wanted to rally behind a black candidate.",

        "Well, that's a very good point.",
        "You know, I think that there is something even deeper going on, which is that we have a very crowded planet of 6.7 billion people.",
        "We have rapid economic growth, particularly in Asia.",
        "And it's been, up until recently, rapid in the United States and Europe, as well.",
        "And we're pressing against certain limits right now.",
        "Food production is one, water crisis, climate shocks to our harvests, and also very tight conditions for petroleum and natural gas.",
        "Even coal, which is much more plentiful, has about doubled in price in the past year.",
        "So I think that there is a real squeeze right now where demand has outstripped the supply of primary commodities.",
        "We've been through this 30 years ago when we had our last bout of what came to be called \"\"stagflation,\"\" that is,a slowing of our economy and higher prices at the same time because of soaring costs of critical inputs were added again.",
        "But I think this time is going to be even more persistent than it was last time.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And that, in fact, is playing a role in this, as well.",
        "Of course.",
        "Think about the scale of China and India together.",
        "China has 1.3 billion people.",
        "India has 1.1 billion people.",
        "The 2.4 billion people together constitute about 38 percent of the world's population, just those two countries.",
        "Both have been growing from conditions of great poverty.",
        "Their growth is quite heartening, in fact, in the sense that people are living better off.",
        "But they are both resource-scarce countries and they've put tremendous strains on their own food production.",
        "China, in particular, buys up a lot of feed grains and other food stuffs from the rest of the world.",
        "For many years, that's been noted to contribute even to the margin of deforestation, say, in the Amazon where trees are cleared to plant more soybeans which are used as the feed grain for the growing number of livestock in China.",
        "But now, with the very tight supplies, the inventories, the low levels not seen for 30 years compared to the level of total demand, now this growing demand has meant these soaring prices.",
        "And again, because of financial conditions, that excess demand has really been able to spill into these prices, really set them rising at an amazing rate that almost nobody predicted.",
        "We're talking with Jeffrey Sachs about the worldwide food crisis and how we got to this place.",
        "If you'd like to give us a call, the number is 800-989-8255.",

        "Hello, good day.",
        "Good day.",
        "Mr. Sachs has laid it out very well and he's absolutely accurate.",
        "But somehow, I think we're missing, or at least everybody's been avoiding, the no clothes on the emperor, which is the fact that all of this came together very well in the last six, eight months, as soon as all of the money that was able to be freed up from the housing went over into the commodities.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "We are going to take that up...",
        "That - I think if you take that up, and Congress had an opportunity to do a little bit of regulating a couple of weeks ago and they passed it by, you might find that all of these places - I don't believe that the people who are short of food at this instant are just going to be designated to die because of lack of food.",
        "I don't believe that.",
        "All right, Tom, thanks for raising that.",
        "I want to ask Jeffrey Sachs to address that.",
        "He's talking about the manipulation of the commodities market, I think, and how that has added to the food shortage.",
        "I wonder if he can explain that."

        "And with a weaker dollar, that means more demand at any dollar price abroad and that ratchets up the price that we face for dollars for these commodities.",

        "That that can be corrected, or as the caller suggested, perhaps it calls for regulation.",
        "Well, I don't think regulation is going to work because there is an imbalance of demand and supply.",
