        "Ironically, in the places where we have the worst crises like Haiti, which opened the show, or in Africa, even the farmers are so unproductive because they don't have access to better technologies, that often they are only scraping by to survive.",
        "They're not actually selling much if anything to the market.",
        "And with the higher fertilizer prices that have soared, doubled or tripled in the last year in various parts of the world, they may be even further away on their own from being able to get into commercial activity.",
        "One of the things that I've been recommending, which I confess has been falling on deaf ears among the high-income country governments, is that we ought to be helping the poorest farmers in these countries to grow more food by helping to provide the credit so that they can get this fertilizer and thereby grow more food and be productive enough that they can actually earn a surplus, sell to their local markets, drive down the prices and ease the hunger crisis.",
        "Our governments are unfortunately focused only - if they're focused at all, on the shortest of the short term.",
        "Some food aid relief.",
        "But this is not the point in our world.",
        "The point is to enable low-income countries to grow more food so that they're not hit by these shocks, and to ease the overall supply constraint on global markets.",
