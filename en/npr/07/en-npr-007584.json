        "Well, yes, and she said that before.",

        "That's what he says.",
        "Apparently he says that he's very aware of what Republicans went through in 1995, when then-Speaker Newt Gingrich basically balked at working with the federal government, led by President Bill Clinton.",
        "And you know, they could not get together on a budget.",
        "Gingrich basically dared the government to shut down, and the Republicans paid for it politically.",
        "And it's interesting.",
        "There would be a perhaps stop-gap continuing resolution.",
        "Speaker Boehner says it would include cuts.",
        "He didn't say how much in cuts, maybe not the 61 billion the House voted a couple weeks ago.",
        "Right.",
        "And I mean, they passed the $61 billion, I guess it was last Saturday, and on the Senate side, Harry Reid says: Look, we'll negotiate when it's time, when you guys get real about reality here.",
        "But obviously there's a March 4th deadline.",
        "If they don't come up with a compromise by then, then it's very possible the government shuts down.",

        "And I - we're clearly doing the right thing.",

        "More fiscally sound way.",
        "Specifically what do you mean by that?",
        "Well, one of the things in particular we're doing is we're focusing on outcomes and results instead of simply funding streams.",
        "I call it value-for-money budgeting that gets to the point about showing real results for citizens, where we're putting out metrics and a dashboard of things to show that these dollars are actually moving the needle, as opposed to simply continuing traditional funding streams, is part of it.",
        "The second piece of it is, is we're doing a two-year budget.",
        "We're doing a one-year legal budget, as required by our constitution, but we're showing a second year because that actually makes you be more thoughtful about planning for the longer term and simply - instead of simply a kick the can down the road bucket, where you may have accounting gimmicks or one-time funds.",
        "And the third piece in particular is, instead of just taking a cash-in, cash-out approach, which is the traditional budget approach, at least in Michigan, is we went and looked at our past obligations - our debt, our retiree obligations.",
        "We totaled those up, and we're actually including in our budget a responsibility to make a payment towards bringing down those obligations.",

        "How is your approach to the unions different, and how is it similar?",

        "But we have good labor relations in our state, and we're going to go through that process because we believe they're going to come to the table in a constructive, thoughtful way, and we're going to work through it."

        "And I'm excited about our future.",
        "By doing this, we really set the foundation for the reinvention of our state.",
        "Your GOP colleagues in Wisconsin and Ohio said they need to cut back on union collective bargaining rights to level the playing field, not just at the state level but also for counties and cities, so that they can negotiate with their public employees.",
        "Does that not apply in Michigan?",
        "Well, we do need to improve our practices.",
        "But again, I think we're taking a different approach on how we're going about it.",
        "In our budget, for example, on the issue of revenue-sharing for a number of our cities and jurisdictions, we didn't tell them what they had to do, but we cut the traditional funding stream out.",
        "In terms of simply saying we're writing you a check, we said no more.",
        "But we put back in a pot available for these jurisdictions based on them achieving best practice.",
        "So we're creating a positive incentive to say: If you come in alignment and you show best practice, here's an opportunity to get those dollars.",
        "And one of the things that - there are three categories included in best practice.",
        "One is improved accountability and transparency, having dashboards, having easier-to-understand financial guides.",
        "The second one is the topic you're talking about, is reforming employee practices and compensation, particularly with respect to benefit costs.",
        "And the third area is actually encouraging service consolidation and service sharing between jurisdictions, because that's a much more efficient way to run our government, is to share, you know, costs between jurisdictions and be more cost-efficient.",
        "When you talk about retirement and those kinds of benefits, are you talking about dedicated amounts of contributions, as opposed to dedicated amounts of pensions?",
        "Well, in Michigan we do need - at the state level we had already moved to a defined-contribution plan about a dozen years ago, which is a huge benefit in terms of both cost-planning, while at the same time providing for people's retirement.",
        "We need to do that much more in our schools and our other jurisdictions, and that's one of those best-practice items we're encouraging people to do, is to say it is time to change plans over, to move from defined benefit to a 401(k) model."
