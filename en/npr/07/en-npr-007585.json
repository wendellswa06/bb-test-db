        "Governor Snyder, thank you for coming on the program.",

        "The opponents to your budget proposal say that the people who are suffering the - paying the brunt of this are the poor, the disadvantaged, the elderly, and whereas corporations may not be paying as much.",
        "Is it fair to say it's a shared sacrifice?",
        "Absolutely, because in many respects we looked at our tax code, and we're wiping out most of our tax credits and most of our loopholes in our tax code as part of this process, because my view is, is there is no real difference between that and an appropriation, and it's only fair we look at people that got some benefits through the tax code and say you're just like someone getting an appropriation.",
        "Let's look hard at these issues and clean the slate for the future.",
        "Let's get some callers in on the conversation.",

        "Gorbachev, tear down this wall.",
        "Yes, I am in Michigan.",
        "My biggest concern when hearing some of the things that Governor Snyder had laid out is more cuts to school funding.",
        "And I know that the way our system is currently based, it's not working.",
        "I for one, as a mother of four, would certainly be willing to see an increase in my - excuse me, my personal income tax if it meant not having such drastic cuts to school funding.",
        "Yeah, in terms of school education finance, the K-12 level, we've talked about - about a five percent cut, about a half a billion dollar cut, which is about half the rate we're asking for other, or for the overall budget.",
        "So it is actually less than many other areas are going through."

      "utterances": [
        "And the second piece of that is when the K-12 issue came up, we actually had two recommendations for school districts to look at that would more than make up the cut we're suggesting.",
        "And those suggestions include, one, looking at employee medical insurance premiums, because in most of our districts they pay zero to 10 percent of the premium cost, and if we went to an 80-20 split to all our districts, that would essentially be a $300 million item.",
        "That would account for about 60 percent of the cut in terms of savings.",
        "And the second item we suggested is a 10 percent improvement in non-instructional cost buying patterns.",
        "If they can improve their buying by 10 percent in non-instructional issues, that's another $300 million.",
        "So we were constructive about this, saying we're cutting in the $500 million range, but here are just two suggestions, and there are more out there that would account for over $600 million in savings.",
        "But we have another email, this one from Michael Vieri(ph) in Grand Rapids: I have many friends and family members who would agree they'd rather see a five percent income tax rate up from 4.35 percent, rather than all the cuts.",
        "How about taxing the richest members of our state at a higher rate?",
        "I'm one of them.",
        "I don't mind paying even six percent.",
        "Well, I'm not sure that would be a recommendation most of our taxpayers are coming up with, because most people think we're paying too much in tax.",
        "And so we've got we're - overall package is about $200 million tax reduction.",
        "But it's making our system much fairer, simpler and efficient in terms of looking at those kind of items.",
        "And in fact, for people at the higher income levels, we're actually changing our tax code to phase out our exemptions and lower the point on our property tax exemptions.",
        "So it will be a net increase, in many respects, to people at the higher income levels.",

        "But one of the things that I really hate to see go are the tax credit for the blossoming movie industry here in the state of Michigan.",
        "It's interesting, Larry.",
        "We got a tweet from that from Kevin, as well, who said ask Snyder if he's keeping the film tax incentives in Michigan.",
        "Yeah.",

        "They're going to leave Michigan and those - if the movie industry leaves - I just heard that \"\"The Avengers\"\" has canceled their plans to film in Michigan.",
        "And I'm afraid we're going to lose a lot of young people.",
        "I think it's an important industry, and I think there's recent a study that said Michigan is getting back...",
        "I suspect you're not talking about John Steed and Emma Peel but rather the Marvel set of heroes.",
        "But in any case, Governor Snyder, what about the film tax credit?",
        "Well, the film tax credit was something that's been here for two or three years.",
        "It's a very expensive program in a relative sense.",
        "It's essentially - it's not just an incentive.",
        "It's writing filmmakers a check where we essentially pay 42 cents on the dollar of their cost in our state.",
        "And it's one of those challenges to say we have an emerging industry.",
        "It has created some jobs and good things, but you have to look at the opportunity cost compared to what other programs are possible and how all that comes together that - we've got other programs such as Pure Michigan, which is our tourism program that's showing a fabulous return on investment.",
        "Where the film credits, if you do the math - the recent study actually they've done, shows I believe it's about 18 cents on the dollar return for the investments we're making in the film credit program.",
        "At a cost of this current year, we've given out a couple of hundred million dollars of those credits.",
        "So we're trying to ramp it down in some rational fashion so it can be sustainable so we would expect spending in 2012 of about a hundred million dollars and $50 million in fiscal 2013.",
        "So it's just not cutting out totally but putting in some transition to say we need to wean off the credits and have it sustained on its own merits and hopefully that will take place."

        "So one of the things I'm communicating to people is instead of going to situations where you create divisiveness, I'm going to the common ground to say what are those areas that we can win together and be successful together on.",
        "And that's very much the concept of shared sacrifice in the tax and budget package we're putting forward.",
        "We're being extremely responsible.",
        "I believe we'll be a role model for the country, from a tax and budget side, with what we're doing and building a good long-term foundation.",

        "So it's that balancing act to understand that.",
        "It's both about government being very efficient in terms of cost and at the same time creating an environment where people can have a great lifestyle, which we have in the state.",
        "We just don't do a very good job of telling the rest of the country.",

        "We're only one of four states that have an income tax that don't tax pensions.",
        "And it's one of those questions to say, is that really the right answer in the long term?",
