        "With the Democratic primaries being piled on top of one another, thus minimizing the momentum effect, what's the chance that no candidate will reach the convention with the majority that's leading to an open convention on the second ballot?",
        "The ultimate political junkie fantasy.",
        "Of course, that has not happened for any party since 1952.",
        "The Democrat Adlai Stevenson was nominated on the third ballot in the 1952 convention.",
        "In '56, it took three ballots for them to come up with a vice presidential nominee, but every convention since then, it's always been on the first ballot.",
        "Ultimately, I think that whoever - if somebody wins Iowa and New Hampshire which is, you know, we saw that in 2000, 2004 with Gore and Kerry, you win the first two, you go on to an easy, early domination of the nomination process.",
        "At the end of this week, a great pilgrimage by Republican candidates here to Washington, D.C.",
        "It's the - it's the Values Voter Summit in Washington.",
        "And of course, on the Republican side that's an important issue given the fact that many - and we've said this over and over again, many religious conservatives have questions about their candidates.",
        "And it started with Mitt Romney who, when he ran for the Senate and governor of Massachusetts, was pro-choice, pro-stem cells.",
        "Rudy Giuliani, of course, has always been known as a pro-choice Republican mayor of New York, a pro-gun control mayor of New York.",
        "Again, he has to expound on his views.",
        "And a lot of conservatives don't trust John McCain, as well, because he has - by supporting campaign finance, it basically limits free speech, and a lot of conservative groups feel that that's not the way a true conservative would vote.",
        "So the conservative side - we've had several guests on this program from conservative parties and movements and saying, look, we haven't embraced anybody just yet.",
        "But that was before Fred Thompson got into the race.",
        "That's true.",
        "That has changed absolutely everything.",
        "Actually, wait, wait - it's changed nothing.",

        "But the fact is, here we are in the middle of October and we still have - in the national polls at least, and again, plenty of time to go, but the fact that we have Rudy Giuliani, the pro-choice, pro-gay rights liberal almost - well, at least he was a liberal when he was mayor of New York…",
        "On social issues.",
        "…on social issues, absolutely, as the frontrunner, and that's pretty remarkable.",
        "And that's what's talking - that's what's fuelling the concept of perhaps a third party or an independent candidacy if Giuliani is the nominee.",

        "It's not too late.",
        "I think it is kind of too late.",
        "On this whole thing, it's a very well-deserved honor, but I think he will actually take advantage of the momentum to continue pushing for action on the climate crisis, not to run for president.",
        "As you all well know, running for president is a massive undertaking.",
        "It takes a national organization, millions of dollars, it's really not something you can just quote, \"\"jump into,\"\" even if you have a national profile like Gore."

        "Your major donors, I think, most of them are already in the game.",
        "I bet you there's quite a few who, sort of, held out to see what Gore would do, but I think Labor Day was probably sort of the cut-off time for a lot of people.",
        "Doug, it'll be interesting also, given the fact that the top two Democrats at this point is a woman and an African-American, it will be an interesting signal if Gore would suddenly get in and try to obviously show disdain for those kind of candidates.",
        "Sure.",
        "I think there's a lot of excitement around Senators Clinton and Obama, no doubt about it.",
        "And like - I agree, I think Al Gore would be a great candidate, would be a great president and all that, but I just don't think he's going do it.",
        "And I think that time has passed in this race for him to get into it, and partly because I think these people are coalescing around the field.",
