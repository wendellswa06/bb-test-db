        "Well, the Republicans certainly hope so.",
        "The - as soon as the election results were in last night at the NRCC, the Republican Congressional Committee sent out a release saying that, you know, this is a sign of things to come, that the public - and polls show this, that the pubic is very unhappy with the Democratic Congress, although, I suspect it's more about the Congress than so much the Democratic part.",
        "And, you know, but again, we - the Republicans also point back - point to the special election last year when Duke Cunningham resigned from California.",
        "He went to prison for corruption.",
        "The Republicans who had won that seat by 25 points in the past barely squeaked by in the special election, and the democrats may try to make their point that this was a side of things to come if the Republicans are in trouble.",
        "As it turned out, they were correct.",
        "But I still suspect that this maybe an isolated incident.",
        "I don't see pro-Republican trend in Congressional races at this point.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I agree.",
        "I'm just wondering about these poll numbers that we keep seeing about the president being lower than ever, Congress is being lower than ever.",
        "But I never really see the data on, are they dissatisfied with Republican Congress or are they dissatisfied with the Democratic leadership?",
        "Well, there is.",
        "There are polls that show that if you had a choice to vote for Congress now, Democrats still, at this point, have higher marks than Republicans.",
        "All righty.",
        "Thank you, guys.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Tyler.",
        "And we do have a winner, two winners, in fact, to our trivia question.",
        "Both Timothy(ph) and Ryan(ph) correctly said, Vice President Charles Gates Dawes in 1925 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
        "Of course, three American presidents as well, Teddy Roosevelt, we mentioned, Woodrow Wilson and, of course, James Earl Carter.",
        "Right.",
        "And Dawes later wrote \"\"Light My Fire,\"\" which very few know that.",
        "Very - that is, in fact, a political trivia question, indeed.",
        "Yes, it is."

        "Ken, we can't leave without commenting on the news that it was discovered by genealogical researchers that there are relations between Senator Barack Obama, of course one of our leading Democratic candidates, and Vice President Dick Cheney, not a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
        "Well, I mean, the relations we've always heard are always interesting.",
        "I mean, we already know that Al Gore was the father of the Internet.",
        "But Lynn Cheney announced on, I guess, it was MSNBC that Dick Cheney and Barack Obama are eighth cousins or ninth cousins once removed.",

        "Professor�DAN KAMMEN (Professor of Energy, University of California Berkeley): Thanks, great to be with you again.",
        "Jeff, let me begin with you.",
        "An article in Science starts with the line: What's not to like?",
        "What is not to like, Jeff, about what's going on in the budget?",
        "Mr.�MERVIS: Well, as you said, the major science agencies do get an increase: NIH, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science for the Department of Energy.",
        "And while the budget is important, it's not just the numbers that are important.",
        "It also is important because of what it says about the capacity to do science.",
        "Last year, the scientific community got a $20 billion increase in that capacity.",
        "It's as if the government said we're building a wing onto the science infrastructure, but this year, there isn't enough money to furnish that wing.",
        "Researchers are being told they need to find the money to furnish it, and a lot of the community is concerned that they won't be able to do that.",
        "They use the term continuing the momentum, and that's the big question for a lot of scientists looking at this budget.",
        "Do you think Congress is going to be happy about the numbers it sees?",
        "Mr.�MERVIS: I think Congress is supportive.",
        "Science is a bipartisan issue.",
        "In fact, the doubling of the three major agencies that you just mentioned began under the Bush administration, and the Obama administration has continue to support that.",
        "It extended it by a year, which is about a billion dollars or so for the National Science Foundation, for example.",
        "Congress likes that, but Congress has a lot of other things that it likes and that it needs to fund and starting with jobs being number one and then going through health care, financial reform, climate change, energy, terrorism, immigration, education.",
        "Research is far down that list, and that's always the problem.",
        "Tom Kalil, but the budget does give money to stimulate science.",
        "That might create jobs there.",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Yeah, that's right.",
        "I mean, one of the reasons that President Obama made a decision to support increases in public and private investment in research and development is that it's a critical element of his overall national innovation strategy.",
        "And he believes that if we invest in R&D, that helps create the foundation for the industries and jobs of the future.",
        "So for example, past investments by the government in R&D have led to breakthroughs like the Internet and GPS and the entire biotechnology industry."

        "The administration has singled out autism and cancer research specifically to get more money.",
        "Why those two?",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Well, I think obviously because of the huge burden of disease associated with both cancer and autism, but also he is increasing support for biomedical research across the board.",
        "And under the leadership of our NIH director, Francis Collins, we're also emphasizing areas like genomics, translational research, the support that research can provide for health care reform and global health and also just more broadly reinvigorating the biomedical research community.",
        "But according to Dr.�Collins, who, as you say, is the head of NIH, he says that he expects the success rate, the chances that a submitted application for any individual investigator, is going to go down now because of the NIH funding.",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Well, the budget does provide an additional billion dollars, and we believe that is a very healthy increase in an environment in which overall domestic discretionary spending is being frozen.",
        "It is true that during the Recovery Act, Congress provided an additional $10 billon in biomedical research, and that is going to lead to somewhat of a cliff in terms of funding.",
        "Mervis, Jeff Mervis, how do you feel about that?",
        "Mr.�MERVIS: It's the cliff that really is the concern for the community, as Tom said.",
        "If the number of new investigators goes down, then that increased capacity to do research won't be satisfied because scientists will submit their proposals to NIH, and with a success rate of 10 percent or less, most of them will not get funded, and academic research lives on federal funding.",
        "Universities only provide a small portion, and industry provides only about seven percent.",
        "That's why the administration would like industry to step up, and I think scientists would like that, too.",
        "But so far, it hasn't happened, and you can understand why because this is the kind of basic research that may take 20 years or more to pay off.",
        "And do you think scientists are happy about when the president singles out specific areas of research like he did for autism and cancer, or do they want to be told where they should be spending their money in basic research?",
        "Mr.�KALIL: They would prefer to be given a free reign, but they realize that they are using taxpayer money, and so the president and Congress certainly has every right to tell them.",
        "There is flexibility, however, if I can use the DOE budget, the Department of Energy.",
        "The Secretary of Energy, Steve Chu, decided to place a large bet on a new agency called Advanced Research Projects Agency Energy that's supposed to hit homeruns.",
        "In doing so, he actually gave that agency, which has no budget right now, more money than a $5 billion Office of Science program, which has existed for 40 years and supports all the national labs.",
        "He's betting that a small, nimble agency can produce better and more important research than a large, conservative organization.",
        "So even within a flat budget, you can move money around and hope to have an impact."

        "Dan Kammen, the president, as Jeff was talking about, is giving $300 million to something called ARPA-E, which was described by the president's science advisor as sort of a DARPA for energy research.",
        "Is that a good idea?",
        "Well, I certainly think it is.",
        "I mean, the idea here is to give an agency the mandate not to do conservative steps and, you know, the goal is to really go for swing for the fences, to go for programs that really could change things to bring the cost of solar dramatically down, to make energy storage ubiquitous and cheap, to find ways to integrate energy technology and information technology in very new ways.",
        "Because there are some states, like California, that are totally wiping out science, because of their budgetary problems in the state, from their curriculum.",
        "And certainly at a time when so much is changing on the international competitiveness front we talk a lot about what's going on in China having this sort of group really makes a lot of sense.",
        "And so I think it is it's certainly a good bet.",
        "It is a tricky one, though, in the sense that you know from the outset that you are not going to get to see lots and lots of short-term successes.",
        "That's not its mission.",
        "And so I think it's a bold and important move, but it's one that needs to be supported and nurtured.",
        "If you ramp up the money for something like ARPA-E for a little bit, and then it goes away, you don't get there.",
        "And so really, I see this as part of a longer-term commitment that the president's making to ramping up our science and innovation capacity to address all the issues, from climate change to international competitiveness, to energy security.",
        "So I think it's right - it's right where you'd like to see bold efforts.",
        "Tom Kalil, the White House was pointing to the DARPA Find This Balloon contest, which we ran a lot with here on SCIENCE FRIDAY, as an example of the kinds of outside the thinking box outside-the-box thinking that might work.",
        "Is that the kind of projects were thinking of here?",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Yeah, no, absolutely.",
        "So the president has asked agencies to increase their use of prizes as a tool for stimulating technological innovation because we have growing evidence that establishing a prize, setting an ambitious goal and then letting lots of teams have at it is an incredibly cost-effective way to stimulate innovation.",
        "Obviously, it's not a substitute for the support for long-term, university-based research, but we're really seeing with the X Prize, with the DARPA Grand Challenge for Unmanned Ground Vehicles and this fascinating Red Balloon challenge, which was really all about how you crowd-source solutions for generating real-time information, we're seeing the powers of prizes and challenges.",
