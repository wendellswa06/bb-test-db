        "Welcome.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Now that science, for lack of a better word, has been made sexy on TV with such shows as \"\"CSI\"\" and \"\"NCIS\"\" and \"\"Numbers,\"\" what about science education?",
        "I mean, the president specifically mentioned that in his State of the Union address, and at a time when budgets are being slashed, where is the federal government going to step in with some money for science education?",
        "All right, let's ask Tom Kalil.",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Yes, absolutely.",
        "In fact, in the president's FY11 budget, he provides a 40 percent increase for STEM education.",
        "That's science, technology, engineering and math, in his at the K through 12 level.",
        "And also, he is leading an initiative called Education to Innovate, in which he's saying that there's a lot the federal government can do, but we also have to get companies involved, foundations, nonprofits, grass-roots volunteers.",
        "And he's launched a series of initiatives starting in November, continuing in January.",
        "One example is called National Lab Day, that listeners can check out at nationallabday.org.",
        "This allows teachers to post a hands-on project that they're excited about and then have scientists, engineers and other volunteers sign up to help them with that.",
        "Ira, can I...?",
        "Well, hang on, because we have to take a break, okay?",
        "And then we'll get right back to this.",
        "I don't want to give you 10 seconds and see the music it's in there and then it sounds bad.",
        "You'll like it better later.",
        "So stay with us.",
        "We'll be right back after this break, and we'll talk more with Tom Kalil, Jeff Mervis and Dan Kammen.",
        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255, also tweet us @scifri, @-S-C-I-F-R-I, and hang out there with all those folks in the cool costumes at Second Life.",

        "It doesn't happen this - the end of this year.",
        "The fiscal year started, you don't want to know, it's 2011, with Tom Kalil, he's deputy director for policy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Jeff Mervis, who is deputy news editor for Science Magazine; and Dan Kammen, who is professor of energy at the University of California Berkeley.",
        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255, and S-C-I-F-R-I, @scifri.",
        "A listener had asked a question about science education, and Jeff, you wanted to jump in there.",
        "Mr.�MERVIS: Yeah, I just wanted to say that was an excellent question.",
        "The picture is a little bit more complicated than Tom may have indicated.",
        "The overall federal budget for science, math and engineering education is actually flat because that includes higher education, and that raises a real dilemma.",
        "Universities are being asked to train more students.",
        "The president has said we need to be number one again in the number of college graduates we have.",
        "Everyone applauds that.",
        "But just yesterday, Yale University announced it was cutting its graduate class by 15 percent, and the reason is it doesn't have enough money to afford them.",
        "So there's definitely a problem out there.",
        "The federal government is not a major player in science and math education.",
        "That's up to the states and the local governments, and they just don't have the money in the current recession.",
        "I've always wondered how that is.",
        "You're absolutely right because all the school budgets, local school budgets, come from your taxes and things like that, and there's hundreds of billions, who knows, maybe trillions of dollars involved in these things.",
        "And I've always wondered how the federal government can play some role with the what seems to even a few billion bucks if it is to be just a drop in the bucket for a total education budget that's really local.",
        "Tom, how does that work?",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Sure.",
        "Let me give you one example.",
        "Secretary Duncan, our Education secretary, has launched an initiative called Race to the Top, in which he is providing $4 billion, which is being made on a competitive basis as opposed to going out on a formula basis.",
        "And that's really encouraging states to embrace bold education reforms around improving teacher quality, for example, turning around failing schools, making sure that they're embracing common standards that are benchmarked with international standards.",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Sad, but true.",
        "Ms. P.",
        "Williams: All right.",
        "Well…",

        "That's right.",
        "Nuclear got you know, the most high-profile thing is it received about a factor of three increase in the loan guarantees available, and this is, you know, going to be a very interesting statement.",
        "There was already lots of discussion about it.",
        "One is that, of course, loan guarantees can be a quote-unquote \"\"great deal\"\" because if you provide them, and you don't have to cash in on them, it can be a really cost-effective way to spur new development.",
        "On the other hand, it does put the government on the hook for a huge amount of money if they default, and nuclear's track record has been tricky.",
        "The other feature that's gotten a lot of attention and discussion, of course, is that we're pushing forward on new nuclear in the country, and the president two weeks ago announced a blue ribbon commission to review and evaluate our nuclear fuel our waste-fuel storage options.",
        "And so we don't have an answer on that yet.",
        "It's probably not critical because that group will come back within - with its recommendations within the next year and a half or so, and plants take quite a while to be built.",
        "But it does set up this sort of interesting dichotomy, that pushing ahead on new nuclear generation but not yet having the plan in place, the waste-management storage site.",
        "By that you mean Yucca Mountain is gone as an option.",
        "That's right.",
        "Yucca Mountain is not the only thing, but it is certainly central to what this panel is going to be examining.",
        "Why does the nuclear industry needs subsidies, stimulation?",
        "I mean, if it's going to be competitive, if you want it to be competitive with other alternative green energies, why does it have to be subsidized?",
        "Why don't you subsidize, you know, windmills and solar power and everything to the way you would be subsidizing nuclear energy?",
        "so, there's a couple aspects to that.",
        "One, of course, is that we subsidize essentially almost all the energy technologies.",
        "Right now, wind and solar receive subsidies.",
        "There's a production tax credit, investment tax credits.",
        "So they are receiving subsidies, and their proponents argue that they're needed to bring them into cost competitive on a landscape that's tilted towards the incumbents, and I share that view myself.",
        "At the same time, while nuclear has been around for a while, we haven't built a new plant in over three decades now, and the issue is that nuclear plants are, as they're built today, extraordinarily expensive in the up-front costs.",
        "They can be $10 billion or more in so-called overnight in the construction costs.",
        "It's not overnight, it takes a long time to build.",
        "But what that does mean is that without some certainty and some support there, both that the market will be there and also a way to overcome that really huge price tag, it's a tricky venture to get into the process of building new plants.",
        "And starting in the 2007 energy budget, there have been new monies put on the table.",
        "The estimates are that there are probably enough monies in the budgets to build a small fraction of the 25 to 29 new proposed plants that are out there.",
        "And so, it's a jumpstart but also a buildup of a new industry, and watching some plants that are being built around the world right now - there's a very high-profile case of a French plant being built in Finland, and the cost overruns on this plant that were it was designed to be a very lean operation, have been staggering.",
        "And so we clearly need to learn a lot more about building these plants properly if we're going to go ahead in terms of the logistics, the licensing, the cost of actually doing it if it's going to be competitive, and when thinking about the long-term mission, which is this low-carbon, energy-secure economy, it does appear that we really need this, and we don't know how to do it as of yet.",
        "They also talked about the president was saying he wanted to have clean coal, if that's not an oxymoron.",
        "Right, and there's quite a bit of money now put in for clean-coal work, and there's a couple aspects.",
        "One is, of course, we get almost half our electricity from coal.",
        "So if we can capture those emissions and store them safely, there's a big plus, but there's a big international piece of that, too."

        "While we get 49 percent of our energy from coal, China is in the 66-or-more range.",
        "And if we really do want to partner with China, as has been discussed quite a bit in terms of how we're going to move ahead on the climate side, having joint programs, having technologies to share, this is certainly a big area.",
        "And so there's a real logic to putting it in here.",
        "There are real questions, though, as to whether carbon capture and storage, CCS, as it's called, is, A, going to come in at a reasonable cost when we try to do it at a commercial scale, and when it will be ready.",
        "There is an issue that we really need to get on with the decarbonizing of the economy, and it's hard to envision that this technology that exists only now in some very small pilot plants is going to be ready for primetime all that soon, and that's a real concern.",
        "You might get it right, but you might get it right too late for the party.",
        "Yeah, Tom, let me ask you about that.",
        "How is work going on in carbon sequestration?",
        "We had a program not too long ago about Lamont-Doherty at Columbia University here finding a way to sequester all this carbon at the bottom of the oceans here on the East Coast, where all of the basalt deposits are way underwater when you pump down CO2 into the basalt down there, it actually turns into calcium carbonate.",
        "It turns into limestone and it stays there forever.",
        "Are people looking at things like that in the White House?",
        "Mr.�KALIL: Yeah, no, absolutely.",
        "And that's one of the areas that ARPA-E is looking at, as well: Are there some new approaches to being able to sequester carbon that would be a lot less expensive than the current approaches.",
        "But we also have to support some of these demonstration projects so that we can have some real-world experience with this.",

        "I'm wondering about my step-son told me about a current project, sort of a very large laser array project, that's got (unintelligible) where they're finally generating - maybe a military, perhaps maybe civilian energy - but they're finally generating a net gain.",
        "Oh, the nuclear fusion.",
        "It's a fusion reaction, yes.",

        "This is the first time that I've ever been called a liar, and a bigot, and an anti-Semite.",
        "This has hurt me.",
        "Sure, so this is very exciting.",
        "I mean, the idea here is it's actually a project taking place at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and this is essentially to use lasers, very powerful lasers, focused on very small targets so they actually look like little, tiny gold capsules, actually, to ignite fusion.",
        "And right now they are at a very exciting point.",
        "They are getting these very, very short-term-but-net-positive energy issues.",
        "The issue, of course, is that this is a huge facility.",
        "It's a massive building and project, and it is the kind of thing that, funded well for a short time, doesn't get you there.",
        "It needs to be funded well for a longer term.",
        "If we can get fusion out of the sort of the joke category, where everyone likes to say it's been 50 years away for 50 years.",
        "It's always 30 - that was my line.",
        "It's always 30 years away.",
        "Well, but this is one of the two most-promising approaches, and again, the sort of positive energy that they are getting out of it highlights its potential.",
        "We have to sustain it, though, and that's actually why I think this budget's so interesting.",
        "Even though we don't yet have a climate plan in the country, if you look at the budget, it does have a plan emerging.",
        "There is new money for basic research from solar and wind, these projects, but there's also a lot of money in the deployment and demonstration.",
        "There's efforts that would send money to the states for their energy programs.",
        "There are, again, these loan guarantees.",
        "There's new money for the Office of Science, and there's a great deal of money for energy efficiency and weatherization.",
        "So this administration has taken seriously what research has been saying for a long time, and that efficiency is your first and best approach, and needs that long-term support.",
        "How do we - how is Congress - and you can jump in here, Jeff, because maybe you followed - how is Congress going to play with all of this money?",
        "Are they going to see the same priorities?",
        "Well, I think that's a good question.",
        "Just to follow on what Dan said, the other major fusion project is an international collaboration in France called ITER, it's a fusion reactor, and this budget includes a considerable cut in funding for that project.",
        "And the reason why is that they've had technical problems.",
        "The joke about fusion is, unfortunately, still real enough to have an effect.",
        "They have extended the schedule to the point where Steve Chu decided they don't need the amount of money that the U.S.",
        "promised.",
        "So instead of $135 million, they're only going to give $80 million.",
        "Of course, if other countries do that, then ITER will never get built and fusion will remain in the distant future.",
        "But more broadly, Congress isn't going to go for all of these things.",
        "Congress, as you'll talk about later with NASA, is not going to be happy with that reallocation and savings.",
        "And the reason that's important to the rest of the science budget is because NASA is funded by the same committee that funds the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, which has NOAA and NIST.",
        "And so if they have a fixed amount of money, the more they give to one agency, the less there is for everybody else.",
        "So sometimes Congress makes decisions not because they're opposed to research, but because they have other higher priorities.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Tom Kalil, how do the - I'm trying to see the process by which these things are chosen and the other things eliminated.",
        "Were there surveys taken?",
        "Did you all sit around in a room and look at all the budgets and see what needs the highest priorities?",
        "How did this happen?"
