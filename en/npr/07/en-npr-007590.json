        "Sure.",
        "Well, the reason that the president decided to provide more money for research and development even in a flat budget is - as I mentioned earlier, that his belief that R&D helps to create the foundation for the industries and jobs of the future.",
        "And second, that R&D can help us meet a wide range of key national goals, whether it's developing clean sources of energy that reduce our dependence on foreign oil or allowing Americans to lead longer, healthier lives.",
        "Third, that by investing in R&D, particular in our nation's universities, we're helping to prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs, the young boys and girls who are going to come up with the idea for the next Google or Genentech.",
        "And then, finally, advancing the frontiers of humanologists and in itself.",
        "So a lot of research is motivated by what we still don't know.",
        "So we don't know how human consciousness emerges from 100 billion neurons.",
        "We don't know why the universe is expanding in an accelerating rate.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Dan, in a couple of minutes we have left, what would you like to see in the budget or move money around in energy that is not there?",
        "Well, I think that in my particular area, everyone is kind of focused on their own, is that solar gets a pretty substantial increase, about a 30 percent increase right now.",
        "I am most concerned on both opening of new frontiers and really competing on the global stage, that there is a suite of renewables: solar, wind, energy storage.",
        "These are critical areas, and I like the increases Ive seen.",
        "I also like the fact that a number of these got profiled in the ARPA budget.",
        "We need to build out the markets, and these increases would really need to continue for a while.",
        "But we're going to have to really get that energy bill and that climate change issues back on the national stage to make sure that we build out markets.",
        "And those two things will go together and the president has a tough job on the climate change bill after what happened in Copenhagen.",
        "But that really is the other part of the story.",
        "Spending on R&D is excellent.",
        "This is the first time we've taken it really seriously since President Carter.",
        "But we need to have those markets and that...",
        "And with China building everything now - they're building the wind turbines, they're building the biggest world - the biggest solar panels now -how do we bring those jobs here to this country?",
        "Well, there's two parts of it.",
        "One is that the U.S.",
        "though is still in a very important - you can argue who's number one or two but - I mean, very much in the lead position on innovation and innovation drives these industries.",
        "These industries, we and others have shown, are very large jobs creators.",
        "So I'm not worried about China's ramped up production.",
        "(Unintelligible) the more China gets engaged in being a leader on this process, the more there really can be a clean energy dialogue between two nations.",
        "And we're seeing parts of that now despite some of those sort of high level battling going on.",
        "That's critical.",
        "What we arguably have (unintelligible) the U.S.",
        "is a really good R&D shop, and our markets need to catch up.",
        "China is mainly focused on the manufacturing side.",
        "That's not a bad back and forth, but we've got to build all of pieces of that here in this country.",
        "Well, there will be hearings and there will be committees that will take up the bills.",
        "And as I said, even though they support individual agencies, they will have to be mindful that issue arise whether there are new terrorist attacks or immigration or other issues that will take precedence.",
        "I think what the academic research community would really like to see is stability.",
        "They would like to be given a long range promise about how to furnish that additional wing that they've been given.",
        "But unfortunately, Congress goes year to year in budget appropriations, and so that's why they don't get that kind of consistency.",
        "And any..."

        "It wasn't that the program was badly managed.",

        "Well, I think that remains to be seen.",

        "That's all their termination liability because of the contracts they signed.",
        "So people are saying, what is this compelling reason that makes NASA want to change courses in midstream, having invested what will be a total of $11.5 billion in this program.",

        "They want to turn that over to the private sector.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And NASA's role will be to invest in technologies.",
        "And so NASA would be getting out of the human space flight business, but not the United States.",
        "Andrew, the history of space flight has always been to find your mission and then build the hardware.",
        "Here it seems to be, lets build the hardware and see what we want to do with it.",
        "Well, I'm going to differ with you on that, Ira, because the only time - actually, if you go back and you look at all of our space programs, the only time when NASA was handed a mission and their job was to design hardware to accomplish that mission was Apollo.",
        "Actually, Mercury was created before Apollo just to see if we could put people in space.",
        "But after that, it really became something different, and I think you can't talk about this history without looking at the political background.",
        "You know, NASA has been trying to relive Apollo in many ways or had been trying before Constellation, not realizing that Apollo was a fluke.",
        "It was a proxy for a shooting war, and that's why it was funded the way it was.",
        "When they tried to do the shuttle, you know, Congress and the Nixon administration wasn't really going to go to that funding level so they said, well, we'll give you a fraction of what you asked for and you can take it or do nothing.",
        "So same thing, in a way, happened with the Bush administration and Constellation.",
        "The Bush call to put people back on the moon and send them to Mars eventually sounded great to all of us people who are passionate about exploration.",
        "But when it came right down to it, the money was not there to do all those things, not especially when NASA had to keep flying the shuttle for a while, then find a replacement and keep the station going.",
        "So I think you have to realize what we're talking about here.",
        "We're not talking about canceling a moon program.",
        "There was no moon program.",
        "NASA was working valiantly, and my hat's off to everybody who's been doing such amazing work trying to make it happen for less money than they needed.",
        "But the fact was we were not going back to the moon.",

        "Well, it isn't just about the current rocket that they're building, the Ares I, which, by the way, I take Marcia at her word that it was a well-managed program, but I have to say that there's been an awful lot of discussion in the space community about perceived technical flaws with Ares.",
        "I'm not sure that Ares was such a great way to replace the shuttle, but be that as it may, that was a vehicle that was just designed to get humans up into Low Earth Orbit.",
        "And yet, it was not going to be ready until 2017 at the earliest, based on the funding they had.",
        "And even then, you weren't going to go beyond Low Earth Orbit without another program, an expensive program, which I think is worthwhile, to build a heavy-lift vehicle to send people and landers and all kinds of other gear to the surface of the moon or to beyond, you know?",
        "So really, we're only talking about, how do you replace the shuttle for getting people to and from the station?",
        "And that's a test that we tackled 30 40-something years ago with Project Gemini.",
        "I mean, I'm not talking about it in terms of size, obviously, Constellation Orion was going to carry seven people, Gemini carried two.",

        "They charge $25 million for a seat, and yet the projected cost for every Ares I launch was something like a billion dollars a launch, which is (unintelligible)...",
        "Now, let me break - Marcia, why not just take some of the hardware that we have and some of the rockets that we've been using for 30 or 40 years, strap them together with the parts that we know that work and just use those as the launch vehicles for going to the Space Station?",
        "Well, first let me answer the question about Constellation being well-managed.",
        "I there's been a lot of talk about this Augustine committee that looked into options for the future of the human space flight program, and they looked at Constellation and their conclusion was that Constellation was a well-managed program and that it was well thought out.",
        "Its only problem was that it didn't get the funding that it needed.",
        "So that was really their judgment, not my own, because I'm not really qualified to judge how well-managed it was.",
        "But there was a debate, of course, before they started Constellation, as to whether or not they could do this using existing rockets, the Atlas and the Delta.",
        "And for a variety of reasons, NASA went through this exercise called ESES and they came up with the conclusion that the way to go was with Constellation.",
        "And so, the question is, do you want to go back and revisit all of that, or that decision having been made and $9 billion having been spent on it, do you want to walk away from that sunk investment go on...",
