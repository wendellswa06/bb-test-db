        "Was the choice of Ares, do you think purely a technical one or was it driven by a desire to keep as many of the shuttle workforce employed as possible without switching gears from that hardware?",
        "I wouldn't be surprised if there was an element to it of trying to have some heritage back to the shuttle program, but I really think it was driven by the ability of Ares I to feed into Ares V...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...which was going to be the vehicle that actually got us back to the moon and on to Mars.",
        "Okay.",
        "Let me we're running out of time because I want to get to a couple of other issues, and that and specifically then, if we're not going to the moon with the Obama administration, I mean, specifically, what are we going to do with the astronaut corps?",
        "What happens to the astronauts now?",
        "Do they vanish?",
        "Do we...",

        "Yeah?",
        "I can see and - then and now, that it could precipitate some hard feelings or some obstacles that might prevent the negotiation of a peace agreement.",
        "And I'm deeply concerned about the tensions that might have arisen.",
        "They ride Soyuz for a while.",
        "And then, if people like Elon Musk can deliver - which is not a sure thing, but I don't think we should jump the gun and say it's unlikely - if they deliver with their Dragon capsule, then they ride that."

        "He didn't get any of the money the president gave out the other day.",
        "Well, he's been using his own money.",
        "And if he he's also been awarded a contract by NASA to keep working on providing those services of getting to and from the Space Station, which by the way, you know, there are no pain-free choices here.",
        "The Space Station costs a tremendous amount of money that sapped other exploration programs, but it's up there.",
        "And it seemed insane to abandon it and not have NASA using it after 2015 or whatever it was.",
        "So, one thing the Obama budget does is extends that to 2020.",
        "So that's what the astronauts will be doing as far as we can see.",
        "Marcia?",
        "We say on the one hand, people are saying, you've sunk all this money into the Space Station so you should keep using it.",
        "But they're not saying, you've sunk all this money into Constellation so you should finish what you started.",
        "And I think that one of the risks that NASA is taking with this new strategy is this decision I'm calling it, whiplash, because we've all been through it so any times is that this is just yet another program that NASA is stopping after having started it.",
        "After the Space Station decision, you know, which was made back in 1984, then they were going to do the National Aerospace Plane.",
        "That didn't work out.",
        "It got cancelled.",
        "Then they had the Space Exploration Initiative.",
        "That didn't work out.",
        "It got cancelled.",
        "Then they had X-33, didn't work out, got cancelled.",
        "The Space Launch Initiative, the Orbital Space Plane and now Constellation - and you look back over the history of the past 20 years, and you just ask yourself, how much money have we spent on changing horses in mid-stream?",
        "And can you believe in this program anymore than one should have believed in all the others that came before it and ended up being cancelled?",
        "At some point, you just have to pick a program and see it through, which is what they did with the Space Station, which was way over cost and took way longer than anybody expected to get it built, but at least they stayed the course with it.",
        "So at what point is NASA going to do that for the next round of human space flight?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And of course, they've been successful with their unmanned space flights.",
        "Look at Hubble, look at all the Mars probes, things like that.",
        "Well, they've had their failures along the way as well.",
        "And people get upset about them when they happen and then they forget about them.",
        "But they did loss those two Mars probes in 1999, for example, and Hubble didn't work for the first three years that it was up.",
        "You know, there are going to be failures and it's going to be interesting to see, if we do start going with commercial companies to launch our astronauts, whether the public and Congress are tolerant of failures in that setup just as we have witnessed the reaction to the Challenger and Columbia disasters.",
        "Now, my feeling is we are still trying to achieve what NASA said they wanted to achieve with Shuttle, back in 1972 when they started that program.",
        "Remove this $10,000-a-pound barrier to simply getting up into orbit so you can do all the cool things you want to do.",
        "Thats the big cost.",
        "Its like, you know, you want to get in to New York City but theyre charging you a $5,000 toll just to get over the bridge, so you cant do all the cool stuff you want to do without paying a lot of money."
