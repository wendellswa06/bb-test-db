        "But there are ways to achieve high mileage that are still very expensive, and we can, you know, maybe launch into a discussion of hybrids here, because without a pretty substantial breakthrough in battery technology between now and 2025, the idea that we're going to have a substantial number of hybrids or all-electric vehicles to hit these targets may be difficult.",
        "Daniel Sperling?",
        "Yeah, clearly we're going to be using more batteries in the vehicles, and electric motors.",
        "But the analyses that have been done suggest that even by 2025, even to get this 54-mile-per-gallon goal, this standard, will not require very many, if any, battery-electric vehicles or fuel-cell vehicles, that it is possible, given these advances in the technology, in the lightweight materials and engines and so on, to achieve that 54-mile-per-gallon, at a number something like that $1,800.",

        "Every company is going to make its own decision.",
        "This is a very competitive industry now, and so even to say what is the position of the industry is probably a little misleading.",
        "When 2018 comes, there are going - there undoubtedly, there are definitely going to be some companies that are beating the standards.",
        "And so there's not going to be the this uniform position at any time into the future, and include with electric vehicles.",
        "As you see, Nissan has gone ahead with the Nissan Leaf, the electric, pure electric; GM with the Volt.",
        "Toyota has a plug-in Prius, and Ford is bringing in theirs as well.",
        "So what we're seeing really is a real revolution in technology, and it's really - it's very uncertain how this is going to play out.",
        "But we're seeing advances that were inconceivable five or six years ago.",
        "This is really a dramatic sea change in the industry, in the commercialization of technology, and in the changing consumer purchases.",
        "We're talking about the future of the car business, a future likely to get more fuel efficient based on new regulations.",

        "The CAFE standards were boosted by President George W.",
        "Bush in 2007, again by President Obama in 2009, one more time this past week, now requiring carmakers to average just over 54 miles per gallon by 2025, though with all the caveats to that we've been hearing from our guests.",

        "Yeah, I think I read that the first two or three on that list were pickup trucks last month.",

        "Certainly.",
        "But in today's world, they really want to find a vehicle that's going to fit their lifestyle, and more importantly, because of all the financial challenges we've had through the banks and so forth and financing, will find one that they can afford also.",
        "So that extra price tag for this new technology, that's going to concern people, you think?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "I mean even the EPA's comments during this timeframe, that the price would go up maybe $3,000, and our concern is that when that price goes up, that's going to take out seven, eight million people out of the market, that they simply can't afford it any longer.",
        "I think that was actually the Car Dealers Association's figure.",
        "The EPA's number was 1,800.",
        "But I can understand why you would disagree with it.",
        "In any case, as you look at the future, hybrids, we were talking about the various brands out there.",

        "Good afternoon, for me it's good evening, because we're quite a bit ahead of you, I think, in time.",

        "I think they're not going to hit their sales projections.",
        "And it's a lifestyle.",
        "They have to pay quite a bit more money for those products, and if people want to do that, fine; it's just - it doesn't fit everybody's lifestyle and the needs that they have.",
        "And the tradeoff is the same.",
        "Yes, they cost more, but you're going to save a bundle on gas.",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "So as far as car dealers, more market-driven approach, come 2017, do you think your voices are going to be heard in this discussion?"

        "The five-page way to get to the same place would be to raise gas taxes, you know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 cents or maybe a dollar or more to get to something approaching European prices.",
        "And European gas prices - and depending on where you're at - you know, six, seven, eight bucks a gallon equivalent.",
        "Those prices have driven a whole bunch of technology and innovation there and a fleet that gets the mileage close, pretty close to the mileage that we're shooting for.",
        "And I probably don't have to elaborate too much on the idea - you know, that the idea of raising gas taxes as much as that is heresy in Washington, and very few members of Congress are suicidal enough or politically suicidal enough to do it.",
        "But that's kind of what the dealers and the carmakers mean when they say market-driven.",
        "And the other part of this, though, the market is more and more overseas.",
        "Of course we all read that GM was selling more cars in China than it did in North America.",

        "To the extent that the carmakers can field, in America, a fleet that is similar in technology and design to the ones that they have to sell in Europe because that's what the customers want and what the regulators demand, and China, which has pretty ambitious fuel economy standards of its own, that's a good thing because they can spread those costs over a much larger fleet, and economies of scale still matter.",

        "And even if you doubled the mileage, if you drove something now for 16 to 18 miles a gallon, and you went to 36 miles a gallon, I mean I just can't in my mind figure out how much you have to drive in a day to save $8,000 over the life of a car.",
        "Daniel Sperling, that was your calculation.",
        "Yeah, well, that's the EPA and the California calculations, you know, based on a lot of studies.",
        "So, you know, it's based upon the idea that the - you know, that fuel prices will be somewhere around $4 a gallon.",
        "They're not assuming very high gasoline prices, which could be even higher, which would make this even more cost-effective if that happened.",
        "But it's just based upon the life of the vehicle.",

        "When you do the economic analysis from a consumer perspective, you get a return - you get your money back in about four or five years or so.",
        "And then after that it's, you know, it's all gravy.",
        "The problem we have, the reason we need these regulations is consumers don't act in an economically rational way.",
