        "And so we need policy to intervene in some way, which is, as I said, not only good for the environment and the country and the - but also for the consumer themselves.",

        "And I don't hear anybody screaming and hollering.",
        "And, you know, just a few years ago, the world ended when it was $4, so people have been - become inured, I think, to $4 a gallon gas.",
        "But if you talk about the $4.25 or 4.50, I think, people would be complaining.",
        "You know, the whole sort of fuel economy payback thing, it's interesting.",
        "I mean, people tell pollsters, almost unanimously, absolutely, we want the highest possible fuel economy standards.",
        "But when they go into the showrooms, the things are a little different.",
        "They - I think the caller suggested, they weigh fuel economy as one of a basket of attributes that are important and comfort and the sound system are sometimes almost as important as max fuel economy.",
        "So it's very difficult to thread for the car marketers, as you can imagine.",
        "Matt in Alaska emails: Things important for me in a new vehicle, one, four-wheel drive for the snow; two, it has to be a truck SUV, also for the snow, and you don't want to get hit in a small car during the winter; three, high safety rating; and four, high MPG.",
        "I am willing to spend more for a car that has better miles per gallon and would love to see it doubled.",

        "Will these new lighter materials mean cars that are inherently less safe?",
        "No.",
        "In fact, just the opposite.",
        "The engineers are getting so good at designing these vehicles in a structural way to make them safer.",
        "You know, you look at today's vehicle and compare it to 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, they are so much safer in any kind of collision, even apart from airbags, just in terms of how they're structurally designed.",
        "You can design a vehicle to be very, very lightweight but also very, very safe.",
        "You know, think of the Formula 1 racecars and the Indy racecars, I mean, you know, their drivers survive 200-mile-per-hour collisions.",
        "So there's - safety, I don't think is an issue here.",
        "What is kind of interesting is the market really is changing and shifting.",
        "Many - the baby-boomers, you know, my generation, we no longer have the kids around the house.",
        "We don't need the big SUVs, and we're finding it that it's much more comfortable, much more convenient and less expensive to have a sedan-type vehicle.",
        "We don't need, you know, that big vehicle.",
        "And so we're seeing a shift away from the urban cowboy pickup phenomenon from the big SUVs.",
        "And that's all contributing, and I think the auto companies - I know the auto companies understood that, and they saw it that way.",
        "And so this is - there's a whole number of factors why the automakers embrace this, and there's - and that, you know, the changing market was just another one of those."

        "But they're always going to have limited range.",
        "And so it is a limited market, but it's an attractive market to some people, an urban car.",
        "The Volt and the plug-in hybrids, like the plug-in Prius, are very attractive to a lot of people because they do.",

        "This was happening in the context of the Tour de France actually discussing banning Christopher Froome from the race.",
