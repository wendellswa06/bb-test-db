        "So I think it's that sort of thing that is going to raise some questions in the coming days, and there just were not enough monitors here who even felt safe enough to go out and really watch this in any kind of meaningful way.",
        "So when do you think people will start to - results will start to come out?",
        "How does the counting work, and how long do you anticipate it will take?",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Haiti.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: Jamaica.",
        "Well, this really should be - it's a bit of an interesting process, actually.",
        "I mean, this time, they are doing the counting at the local level rather than trying to get these ballot boxes into some central location, the theory being that tampering could go on if these boxes are taken away.",
        "So the counting began about 30 to 40 minutes after polls closed this evening, and we were expecting some sort of initial results, at least even for provincial council, within the first five to six hours.",
        "That time period has certainly passed and we haven't heard anything yet.",
        "But expectations are that tomorrow we might start seeing, you know, some results from certain areas, basically where polling stations will be declared, you know, victorious for whatever, you know, you name the candidate, for that person, and that perhaps even some of the presidential candidates might start counting these polling centers together and then formally declare victory.",
        "And basically, what I've been told about the counting, is that they were taking - in terms of the presidential race, they were taking 50 votes for each candidate for creating a stack and then throwing that stack into another box and then basically doing some sort of informal count that way, but official results are technically not expected until the beginning of next month.",
        "So can you - I mean, are these boxes open?",
        "Can you just look into them?",
        "They look like transparent totes, the plastic tote bins that you might see in…",
        "Like buy at Staples or Wal-Mart or something."

        "Yeah, exactly.",

        "And they really are.",
        "It's just sort of like, you know, Tupperware tote, or you name it.",
        "And what happens is they seal them with, like, plastic and then some sort of, like, metal number, or I should say a little metal plate that has a number engraved on it, and that has to match up to a registration list.",
        "So basically, there are some measures to try and make sure that there isn't tampering or isn't fraud, I mean, the idea being if you seal this empty tote, then basically only people putting votes in, you know, who basically show IDs and have their finger marked in indelible ink, that in fact those people will be casting votes.",
        "But again, if somebody's not really watch it.",
        "I mean, a lot of the - Mr. Karzai had the most observation monitors, basically, but you have to understand that each campaign tried to put as many monitors as they could at polling centers around the country.",
        "And down in this area, certainly, overwhelmingly, Mr. Karzai had the most.",
        "But for those candidates who couldn't either find, or can't afford, or whatever the case might be, you know, to put those monitors in at each station, how do you, in fact, guarantee that there hasn't been, you know, some kind of tampering or fraud?",
        "I mean, this is a question I think that's going to be raised in the coming days.",
        "Renee, you had a question?",
        "I just had a question a little while back, Soraya.",
        "You know, we were talking about people being afraid to vote and the actual threat, today, of going to the polls.",
        "But I'm wondering, especially in a place like Kandahar, where the - and in the outlying areas, the villages outside of the city - were people - the Taliban are all around - and when they threaten to cut off the fingers of people who have, you know, the purple marking on their fingers, or the night letters that have been posted in recent weeks, or days especially -really with some pretty serious threat, if people are also afraid - I mean, did you get any indication that people might also be afraid, because not so much they'd be hurt today, but that everyone knows them and that the Taliban would, in fact, deliver on those threats?",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "I mean, in fact, the fear, I would argue, bordered on paranoia here.",
        "I mean, as recently as yesterday, people were talking about all these night letters and leaflets posted on buildings, and quite frankly, nobody could produce half the stuff.",
        "You have to kind of wonder how much of it is sort of fear feeding on fear, but that definitely kept people away from the polls.",
        "I mean, this indelible ink in particular is something that stands out so much.",
        "And there's no doubt that the Taliban had threatened that anyone who actually casts a ballot or opens their home or businesses to election workers or to campaign workers, that they in fact would be hurt or would be attacked or would be a target, without really specifying what that meant, and…",
        "Soraya?"

        "I saw a lot of campaign material, a lot of posters which was really not the case when I was there back about 20 years ago.",
        "So, that was kind of odd - I mean, you would think from what you see in Afghanistan with all the posters of different presidential candidates.",
        "The most important thing is security, which means whomever wins this election, everybody else have to extend their hands and accept that and support that person, whoever that person would be.",
        "And the reason is that we are very first - we are taking very first steps toward democracy.",
        "And this is very important for our people to learn that we must go through these hard steps or taking the steps of processing very first steps of democracy.",
        "And in order to do that and teach Afghan people is to accept these elections, whomever it was, you know, chosen, and hopefully - and support him."

        "And what we have been trying to do actually is trying to encourage Afghan-Americans to participate in these elections and let their family and friends know that this is very important in order to participate in these elections for a democracy.",

        "Renee, we're listening to people talk about the idea of security being the most important thing.",
        "I'd say that is what, you know, my non-scientific estimation of how people feel, but from talking to everyone, security is the very biggest thing.",
        "Of course, in Afghanistan, security means peace.",
        "And much flows from that, the ability to move around the country; the ability to move goods and services around the country, so jobs would flow from that; the future of one's children, and in Afghanistan's case, it can also be education of children because, as we know - and it continues to this day in certain parts of the country, especially girls' schools are burnt down, I mean hundreds every year, and that continues unabated.",
        "So I think security is the top issue for most people, although I'm not getting this from the survey, and it'll be interesting to find out if that is, in fact, what people were saying.",
        "I'll say one thing, though, that Sahayla said that I think is really interesting because there was so much talk about it, and that was there was a lot of talk and a lot of speculation whether people would accept this vote.",
        "And if you know, whichever direction it went, and there was actually one candidate, one of his - it was Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.",
        "One of his campaign workers pretty high up made a comment about a week and a half ago along the lines of you thought it was bad in Iran, here we have AK-47s or Kalashnikovs."

        "There is a lot of talk about people coming out on the street to protest.",
        "My take on that, from talking to people, and I ask a lot of people - is that in fact, given the excitement about the campaign and the ability, as it turned out, for most people in much of the country to get out there and go to rallies, and we talk to people in the markets, for them to talk about who they were voting for - given the process that people went through, rather unexpectedly over these last four weeks, I would very much doubt that there would be, no matter what the outcome is, an outpouring of - certainly not violent protests, and even, like, great, long big protests, a lot of disappointment of course on the part of the losing candidates - but I would expect some level of acceptance.",
        "Sort of investment in the idea of having an election.",

        "Could you tell us how you square that with the fact that the poll also shows, as I read it, that the Afghans have a sense that the stability of their country is improving?",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "Well, two things.",
        "First, it's important to recognize that this poll, along with another poll IRI did in May, was conducted in the sort of run-up to this election that was held today in the country.",
        "And when that occurs, people typically start to focus in on the types of decisions that they're really going to be making when they go to the poll to cast the ballot.",
        "In most countries in the world, because IRI does a lot of polling around the world, people tend to pretty much consistently focus on the economy, and jobs, and sort of bread-and-butter, quality-of-life issues.",
        "Well, those are also the things that Americans focus on when we answer polling questions, as well.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And you'll find that in most countries in Western Europe and Eastern Europe, most countries in Latin America, that's the sort of issue that people focus first and foremost on when making a decision about who they're going to vote for."
