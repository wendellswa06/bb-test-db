        "Afghanistan is a very unique country in that regard because we asked open-ended questions.",
        "In other words, the respondents weren't prompted with any answer choices.",
        "We asked them if they were to name the first and second issue that was of greatest importance to Afghanistan, security was the response 34 percent of the time for the first issue, and those who said the second-most-important issue, it was 22 percent of the time.",
        "That response, those two responses, were more likely to be the response given than either the economy or jobs or unemployment.",
        "When you sort of combine those two categories together, security reflected voters' number one priority a full 56 percent of the time, versus, for example, the economy, which was only about 35 percent.",
        "Well, I have to say that if I were an Afghan answering a polling question, and there were soldiers walking up and down the streets and explosions from time to time, I think security - I mean, maybe it's just kind of obvious that security would be first - but still, there was a pretty good dose of optimism reflected in your poll despite that.",
        "My favorite polling question here in the United States is the right-track-wrong-track question, which is always a good hint as to what the electorate will do, what they're thinking.",
        "Did you - you asked something like that, is the country on the right track, is it going in the wrong direction?",
        "What did they think?",
        "That's right.",
        "And in the July poll, 62 percent said the right track, and that was up from about 30 percent in May.",
        "And that, going back to my first point about this sort of being a run-up to the election and people really starting to focus in on their decision, I think, is partly responsible for that sort of increasing enthusiasm.",
        "You know, one thing that always amazes me when I come to Afghanistan is people's optimism about the future in the country.",
        "And I think you're seeing that when you ask that question, about whether the country's headed in the right direction.",
        "Also, we see consistently in polling here, that people have a sense that the economy is improving, in fact.",
        "And so that's something that Afghanistan can, I think, be credited and proud about in the last several years.",
        "And so that, in part, I think, drives that optimism about the future.",
        "Renee Montagne, who is here with me, was just pointing out that she thought that the high degree of engagement in the campaign in the run up to the election that people were talking about it, thinking about it, wearing different colors to support different candidates and so forth, that all of that engagement seems to have made people feel better about what's going on.",
        "And I think that that's just about what you're saying.",
        "That, I mean, that would account for…",
        "Yes.",
        "…the big jump from May to July."

        "Some fairly incredible things have happened in this country in the past couple of months.",
        "For the first time, presidential debates were held on television.",
        "That's never occurred before in this country.",
        "And the incumbent, the president, actually participated in the second of those debates.",
        "That's something very new for Afghans.",
        "Also, what you saw is competitive campaigns wherein you had candidates trying to go out and convince the voters, based largely around platforms, that they were the right - that they are the right person for the - to lead the country in the future.",
        "And it was done in a way that people really were trying to expand support beyond traditional geographic and ethnic bases of support.",
        "Okay.",
        "So, I think all of those things are very encouraging.",
        "Additionally, we sort of saw as a reflection of that, and in this July poll, it was especially, I think, notable that people expressed a very strong inclination or desire to participate in this election.",
        "We asked about very - if they were very likely to vote or somewhat likely to vote.",
        "If you combine those two categories together, it was upwards of 90 percent of people said that they wanted to participate in the election.",
        "Now, I don't know that we're actually going to see that when we tally votes.",
        "There's - there are, as we've noted, very serious security concerns as well in this country.",
        "I think some of those were reflected today, but…",
        "Okay.",
        "Let's…",
        "…overall, you have this sort of enthusiasm and desire for participation and desire for engagement.",

        "Is that correct?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "I was back there about three, four weeks ago and visiting friends and family.",
        "And when I spoke to people over there, I think more than half the people that I spoke with, they were not excited about the election.",
        "Most of them actually said that they think that this is just a fake election like they used to have during the Communist - when they had the elections, when Najibullah was the president.",
        "And they said that America wants Karzai to win so Karzai is going to win.",
        "So, I'm actually hoping that Karzai loses so that it gives some confidence to the people that these are really not fake elections.",
        "Renee has a question for you."

        "I'm wondering if you might've missed that or if you're still talking to people.",

        "I went to a valley, the Kaghan Valley in the middle of nowhere, nine hours from Kabul for a Karzai rally.",
