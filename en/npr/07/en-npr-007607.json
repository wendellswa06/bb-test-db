        "Generally, it's - I'm curious when these foreign journalists go to Afghanistan, like Renee went there four times, and what kind of people they come in contact with and how realistically they can really say that, you know, considering the current security situation is not very favorable, they can really reflect their opinions or, you know, the report that they are giving is so realistic or…",
        "So what about that?",
        "How frankly can people talk?",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'd say - well, I think there's always an issue, of course.",
        "For one thing, we always work with translators.",
        "And there's at point at which, you know, there's that dynamic between us trying to talk to someone and it's going entirely through a translator.",
        "I will say one thing.",
        "Nowadays, this trip, it was very hard to move around.",
        "You want to go down to the south or the east, you had to embed, more or less, if you - I don't know any journalist who just waltzed down there.",
        "Travel with the troops.",
        "You traveled with the troops.",
        "In these instances, I think, today, Soraya who was embedded - and that's how she ended up down in Kandahar.",
        "She was in Helmand.",
        "She moved over to Kandahar, I do believe, with a group of - they were, you know, they were pretty well-protected, foreign press and even local press, people who came down from Kabul.",
        "I see lots of people as passionate as I - as me.",
        "I joined them.",
        "I had tons of media around us (unintelligible).",
        "And I shared my passion and enthusiasm with the people there and to the media, to all Afghan people around the country.",
        "It was a moment.",
        "It was a moment.",
        "You know, it's always an issue.",
        "I can't deny it.",
        "So how much can we possibly know?",
        "You know some things.",
        "And I'll tell you one thing, Zalmay, you know - in fact, I'd be curious what you think about this - one thing about Afghanistan is even when I've spoken through a translator, and this would be - I don't know if this is - I mean, you know, I don't want to talk about the whole culture, but my experience is people are very direct.",
        "They're not - they don't really - you know, it's sort of like they're not trying to shine you.",
        "I don't get the impression of being, you know, shined on.",
        "I'm not, now, speaking about trying to talk to a Taliban person down in Kandahar.",
        "I'm talking the average person in Mazari Sharif or in Herat or in Kabul or out in, you know, farm areas, you know, surrounding the cities.",
        "I always felt like people, as much as they could, were pretty straightforward.",
        "They tell me what they thought.",
        "I mean, we've had people complain.",
        "Well, I'll just give you a little quick story.",
        "I did a story on the - our cook that - NPR briefly, very briefly had its own house right after 2001.",
        "And the cook there was a typical story.",
        "His family had lost everything, he was in his mid-20's, he supported 10 people and, you know, wanted better and had thought he had better.",
        "His family, you know, had been middle class.",
        "Anyway, he's moved on and now he owns this very quiet, lucrative trucking business, which is also terribly dangerous.",
        "So when we went outside and talk to these truckers, they were not especially thrilled to see me.",
        "In fact, they were saying to our translator, what's the deal with the woman talking to the boss, you know?",
        "He's my friend, of course, American style.",
        "And they're truckers, young guys and pretty tough and a little hostile, I was told.",
        "But when I actually sort of waded into the group, people relaxed and they -these guys - and they opened up.",
        "And they not only said how terrible it was trying to deal with the Taliban, and they had - one had just recently been himself.",
        "His truck had been - you know this, how they take the trucks, they shove them to side of the road and they set them on fire, actually, and will kill enough of the time, you know, the drivers."

        "But at one point they also started speaking in a very heartfelt way about how the military - when they get to - they finally - they were doing a lot of military deliveries.",
        "And when they would get to the bases, they would be treated like dirt in the bases and that they would be - yeah, and they offered that up.",
        "I didn't ask them because I was pretty open.",
        "But they offered up this to me, the American, to say they weren't shy at all about saying, you know, and it was a very touching stuff.",
        "I mean, this older gentlemen said, we have children.",
        "We're people too.",
        "And what would - they were made to - were allowed to sit out in the sun for 10, 12 hours, not told what was happening with cargo.",

        "So, you know, I know, but it's - I get your point.",
        "That's the question we ask ourselves, you know, everybody who does reporting has to ask themselves.",

        "Yeah.",
        "…it's very isolated that they can just stay in a box and they can talk to the people.",
        "Right.",
