        "And the Democrats said, OK, we'll go after Newt Gingrich.",
        "It's not that simple, but it seems to be a tit-for-tat mentality in Washington that could very well happen in Wisconsin and elsewhere.",
        "And Fred Zimmerman - excuse me, Jonathan Zimmerman, you point out it's not merely that recalls could escalate, and the purposes for them be - could come more petty, but that it could affect the behavior of politicians once they are elected.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, I think that's another really kind of compelling reason to be very strict, to limit it in the way we use recall, especially in these times when everything is so carefully poll-tested and focus-grouped.",

        "I mean, in fact, that's one of the things that we expect from our leaders.",
        "But I think if we have this expansive idea of the recall where you can recall somebody because you don't like the position that they're taking, I think it's going to become less likely that our politicians take bold and unpopular stances.",
        "We're talking with Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of history and education at New York University.",
