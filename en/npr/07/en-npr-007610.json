        "Thanks for calling in.",
        "I wanted to tell you the reason that I think many of us in Wisconsin are supporting the recall and - is that during the course of the campaign, Governor Walker never talked about the fact that he was going to ask for a change to the law to repel the rights of public employees their engage in collective bargaining.",
        "He actually only talked about that at a speech before the Milwaukee Press Club that occurred two weeks after the election, and it stunned us.",
        "He put it into a budget repair bill and that is what triggered off the walk outs from colleagues in the state Senate and triggered off a filibuster by the 39 of us out of the 99 who are members of the lower house of the legislature.",
        "Don't elections matter?",
        "I mean, if the Republicans fair and square, they get to make policy, or they get to at least put it to the legislature.",
        "Well, I think the elections do matter, but I think you have to be honest and lay out a platform.",
        "You have to tell people what you're going to do, and I think most of the people who are running lay out an idea of what will happen.",
        "And this is not something that was a crisis that suddenly came up and was not anticipated.",
        "I mean, we've had collective bargaining rights for public employees for 50 years.",
        "And so what he did was he surprised everybody.",
        "He didn't run on this.",
        "And then once he got a big enough margin, he turned around and added a devastating item to the agenda.",
        "Ken?",
        "Fred, to me, this all feels very spurious to me.",
        "I mean, if Scott Walker said, I will limit - curtail the rights of public employees, you don't think there'd still be a recall if he was elected, if he did it?",
        "I mean, the fact that just because he didn't say it - I mean, President Obama - every president says they would do things, and if they don't do it, do we recall them because they didn't say it?",
        "I don't...",
        "No.",
        "I think here it was a major campaign, and I don't think there would have been a momentum for recall if we had been elected.",
        "It's just like if he had, for instance, announced I'm going to support a right-to-work law.",
        "Well, that certainly would have triggered off all sorts of people.",
        "But you have to understand, a number of public employees actually supported it.",
        "Mayor Villaraigosa's move to control L.A.'s school system is a first for the city but not for the country.",
        "Michael Kirst is a professor at Stanford's school of Education.",
        "He's been studying the issue of mayoral control for more than seven years.",
        "One thing he's learned in that time, Kirst says, is that mayoral control of the schools only works when the mayor has absolute control.",
        "I do hereby declare.",
        "One of the most fascinating thing that's in the state Senate recalls that occurred last year, probably the strongest community that supported Governor Walker in central Wisconsin was the city of Waupun, which has a prison.",
        "And in the state Senate recall, that became one of the strongest Democratic communities because the prisoner - the prison guards were absolutely stunned that this candidate that they supported suddenly took away what they believed was their job security and the cost and the things that they had.",
        "And this was more than just pensions and wages and things like that.",
        "This is work rules.",
        "This is seniority.",
        "This is what do you think would change this.",
        "All these things was - that was so disrupted to the orderly eyes that people had already had over a number of years."

        "I'm a big supporter of unions, including civil employee unions and especially teacher unions, as an educator, and yet I do contest not what he's saying about Walker, but what he's saying about the recall, and I think it's important to draw a distinction there.",
        "Look, is it arguable that Walker, in some ways, dissembled that he said one thing and did another?",
        "I think it - I think there's a lot of evidence for that.",
        "And that, indeed, makes him human.",
        "I think everybody does that, including politicians.",

        "I'm also a supporter of President Obama, but I recognize that he, too, has flip-flopped on several important issues.",
        "To me, the most important one is Guantanamo Bay.",
        "You recall, and Mr. Kessler will, that when he was running, he said he would close Guantanamo Bay.",
        "He has not.",
        "I could list many other items and, indeed, listing them as a supporter of Obama.",
        "I don't think anybody would reasonably say, he should be recalled for saying one thing and doing another.",
        "It's important to understand also that the Founding Fathers deliberate this point at some length because under the Articles of the Confederation, before the Constitution, there was a recall provision.",
        "And so they debated whether to include a recall provision for Congress people, and they decided against it.",
        "I think they made the right call.",
        "And I would ask Mr. Kessler and others who are demanding the recall of Scott Walker, would we want to amend the Constitution to allow the recall of Congress people who are as deceptive in their campaign promises as Scott Walker?",
        "Given the Congress' approval rating, that was at eight percent, I rather doubt it.",
        "I'm sorry, Jonathan Zimmerman.",
        "Let's get an answer from Fred Kessler.",
        "Sure.",
        "OK.",
        "My - there's a different issue here and that is that this isn't something where Walker said one thing and then did another.",
        "This is one where Walker never talked about it during the campaign, and it was absolutely devastating to teachers and all the public employees.",
        "Now, I'm not a public employee, but I was a judge for 11 years in Wisconsin.",
        "I know that the tough decisions that people have to make.",
        "And even as a legislator, I have to make these tough decisions.",
        "But I think that in issues such as this, if you know that you're going to do something like this, you have a moral obligation to tell the voters, this is one of the things that I'm concerned about.",
