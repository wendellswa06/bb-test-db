        "BP spokesman Ronnie Chappell says his company has been engaged in corrosion control since the first day of operation.",
        "It's a big part of our maintenance effort up there now.",
        "We have 25 engineers who do nothing but work corrosion and who are focused on insuring the integrity of our pipelines and operating facilities.",
        "You know we do a hundred thousand inspections a year and it's growing.",
        "I mean we're spending eighty percent more money on corrosion inspection and monitoring this year than we did in 2000.",
        "But Chappell says those inspections are usually done by taking x-rays of cross sections of pipe.",
        "The company believed that was the most effective method of monitoring corrosion.",
        "Pigging also pushes sludge toward the main trans-Alaska pipeline or sale stream, something industry seeks to avoid.",
        "That is the technique that we have, had generally used on the, on the North Slope.",
        "However we're going to be doing more maintenance pigging and more smart pigging as a result of this incident.",
        "There's a saying in the field that corrosion works twenty four-seven and Chappell says BP has stepped up maintenance efforts as the pipeline has aged.",
        "But critics like Feinberg say BP and other North Slope operators have a history of resisting regulatory efforts aimed at updating detection and monitoring systems.",
        "Taking the leaky pipeline out of service for weeks caused a drop in production of as much as a hundred thousand barrels a day.",
        "And BP's recent decision to shut down two other transit lines is another disruption of flow.",
        "None of this is good news for the consumer and environmental groups have been quick to point to the spill as reason not to allow industry to drill in more sensitive areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
        "Pearson, of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation says while there are no regulations specifically mandating how or how often industry should maintain its transit lines, she's confident BP will now be more vigilant along with other operators on the slope.",
        "I mean when an incident occurs on one side of the field, the tundra telegraph works really well up there and so its not uncommon to see the other operators take a good hard look based on the cause of an incident and take some corrective action too.",
        "Feinberg and other oil industry watch dogs are not as optimistic.",
        "The irony of it is that even at twenty dollar oil it clearly, the ounce of prevention is worth the expense but the owners say we'll take the risk.",
        "Our job is to maximize the returns to the shareholders.",
        "But with oil at seventy dollars a barrel, lawmakers and regulators are not about to accept cost cutting measures as an excuse for a leaky pipeline.",
        "As one member of Congress put it, it can't be that BP doesn't have enough money.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Elizabeth Arnold in Anchorage."

        "I mean we'll be immediately investing in fuels that have already been discovered like ethanol plants.",
        "But what we need to develop is things like cellulosic ethanol, which can break down the sugar from the waste products from, you know, stems of plants and the rubbish that we throw out.",
        "You know, we to, you know, look for even newer fuels.",
        "You know, there's a fuel called butanol, which is more powerful than ethanol.",
        "But there isn't a lot of money going into this area and we want to kick start getting money into this area and hope that we can get other business leaders to follow suit.",
        "And do you figure this makes good business sense that these places you're investing will eventually returning profits to you?",
        "Well, it'll be very worrying if it doesn't make business sense because if alternative fuels don't catch on, the amount of CO2 that is causing the world to heat up, it's really practically a blanket that is getting thicker and thicker around the world.",
        "The amount of CO2 is building up every year.",
        "And we will get to a tipping point where if we go beyond that tipping point, we will not be able to reverse it.",
        "I mean basically the world will ultimately be snuffed out, and that is just too sad.",
        "So the only way to take on the oil companies and the coal companies is to come up with fuels that actually pay their way.",
        "So we've got to somehow make a success of it so that we can reinvest more in it so that we can actually replace dirty fuels."
