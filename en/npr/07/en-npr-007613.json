        "Peter Dunne, the attorney for the city of the Ferguson and three police officers in a lawsuit brought by Davis, says Davis was defiant and refused to enter the cell.",
        "And after his persistent refusal to do that, one of the officers puts his hands on his chest and pushes him backward into the cell.",
        "And then Mr. Davis recoils and strikes that officer in the face, breaking his nose.",

        "And while other officers restrained him, the bleeding officer came running back into the cell.",
        "And that's when Michael White ran in the cell and kicked me in the head.",
        "He ran in the cell and kicked me like he was kicking a football.",
        "Davis' attorney, James Schottel, asked Ferguson police for the videotape from the cameras that monitor the jail cells.",
        "Schottel says he figured that would show what really happened.",
        "But the police turned over the wrong tape from later in the day, and then said, the tape for the hours in question had been recorded over.",
        "Schottel doesn't buy that.",
        "This would've all been recorded on the videotape.",

        "Well, I guarantee you if Mr. Dennis punched one of the officers, and he wasn't kicked in the head, that video would have been blown up on a big screen and would've been delivered with a bow on it from them immediately after the case was filed.",
        "Eventually, Davis accepted the guilty plea and played $3,000 in court fines and fees.",
        "He says his attorney at the time said, it was the only way to avoid trial.",

        "Almost to the finish line, right?",
        "Well, maybe just new beginning actually (laughter).",
        "Well, as you said, we found two different fossils and both have a slightly separate story to tell.",
        "One fossil is a beautifully preserved little braincase of - that we identified as Homo erectus, and what's special about is that it's a really small specimen.",
        "It's in fact the smallest adult individual Homo erectus that has ever been discovered.",
        "And it points out to us - it showed us that the size variation among the skulls of Homo erectus was really quite large, more comparable to what we see among gorillas today than among modern humans.",
        "And that is in itself interesting.",
        "This amount of variation usually points at the fact that there might be major differences between male and female individuals of a species.",
        "That and again is interesting to us because it says something usually, at least, among primates large differences between males and females, say, something about behavior.",
        "Different strategies of how the group operates.",
        "Usually with these large differences it coincides with having a dominant male with multiple females associated with the one dominant male.",
        "Your listeners may know about the famous silverback male among gorillas where we have this situation.",
        "But among baboons and mandrills, we see the same thing.",
        "Let's talk about a bit more about - the comparison of the two fossils and how they have upset the succession.",
        "We thought one was…",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "…descendant of the other.",
        "So, that's the other story.",
        "The other fossil - the second fossil is not as nice, but it's still incredibly informative.",
        "A fossil doesn't have to be nice to be very exciting scientifically.",
        "The second fossil is a little upper jaw of something that we identified a Homo habilis.",
        "And the exciting thing about it is when we asked our geologist how old is this thing, pointing out where we found it, et cetera, they came up with the date of about - just over 1.4 million and that is a good deal younger than we knew that Homo habilis survived.",
        "And now, we actually notice Homo habilis survived approximately for the same time that we see Homo erectus here in - on the east side of Lake Turkana here in East Africa.",
        "If fact, Homo habilis and Homo erectus both come in at about the same time, at about 1.9 million.",
        "And at about 1.4, Homo habilis disappears, Homo erectus continues then.",
        "But it means that they lived side-by-side for about, almost, half a million years and that must surely mean that they really had separate ecological niches to survive in this way for such long time.",
        "And then you can ask the question, is it likely that one was actually the ancestor of the other, because classically, Homo habilis has been portrayed as the ancestor of Homo erectus who either gradually or through a rapid speciation gave rise to erectus.",
        "So if he is not - and one was not the ancestor of the other, that you're saying that they lived at the same time, and that means they must have possibly had a common ancestor somewhere there.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "And then the time that this common ancestor lived is - we suspect is between two and three millions years ago.",
        "And unfortunately, that is a time period that we have very few Earth layers here in East Africa that produce fossils, and in fact, we only have a handful of teeth and some fragmentary parts of bone from that time period.",
        "And so, although we have some candidates that could represent this common ancestor, which could, by the way, be a primitive version of Homo habilis.",
        "That cannot be excluded.",
        "But we just simply don't know.",
        "More research is necessary to find the correct earth layer that link that represents that enigmatic period."
