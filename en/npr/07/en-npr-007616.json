        "senior leadership.",
        "And a couple of key themes emerged from those interviews - especially from the Iraqis, that the fact we didn't consult well enough with them about the projects, and that meant that when it came time to transfer projects to Iraqi control they frequently didn't want them.",
        "And hundreds of projects were transferred to the Iraqis, simply unilaterally - signing a piece of paper, handing it over to them saying it's yours.",

        "What we have seen is that Trump tends to win in less equal states, and that his opponents, mainly Ted Cruz...",
        "Right.",
        "...Tend to win in more equal states.",
        "And as far as why that is - once again, just guesses - but one thing is that Donald Trump tends to do really well among voters who have less education and lower incomes.",
        "So maybe, just maybe, in places with higher inequality, those people are more - they gravitate more towards Donald Trump's populism.",
        "Yeah, I mean, this seems so counterintuitive to me.",
