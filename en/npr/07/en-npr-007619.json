        "She goes to a wonderful school for girls, a special school, and she becomes one of Girton College's first pupils when Girton is still a brand-new school.",
        "It will later become part of Cambridge University.",
        "What is she like, this young woman?",
        "Why is she remarkable?",

        "She worked her head off.",
        "She was known - everyone consider her the biggest workaholic they ever had known.",

        "She had a knack for making friends.",
        "Her best friend, Dora Black, said that she was, in fact, the most driven and - person who had the clearest sense of what she wanted to do of anybody.",
        "She develops a theory of the way proteins are formed, the architecture of proteins.",
        "Could you tell us about that?",
        "They had just discovered - they being the protein chemists - the chemists in general had just discovered that proteins were molecules.",
        "And this is so taken for granted today that it's hard to imagine a time when they didn't understand that.",
        "When it became clear that they were molecules, meaning that there was a definite structure, that the atoms were in particular places, their role in our lives keeping us alive had to do with where those places were.",
        "Then the question is, well, where are those places?",
        "And the one theory that had been proposed before was that it makes a long chain.",
        "That's still what people believe.",
        "But she said, no, that that's not the way it is.",
        "So she proposed, instead, that the chains form rings, and the rings join together, and she came up with a model that looked like lace.",
        "It was absolutely beautiful.",
        "And then she would have the lace fold up so as if you're making an origami cage.",
        "You have many pictures of that in the book, and you describe her as going to the grocery store to buy tapioca balls and then dyeing them and sticking them together.",
        "And she told you what store you could go to in Cambridge to do this.",
        "It was very funny because she dyed them with food dye - I still have all that stuff - and then use Elmer's glue to stick them together with a piece of toothpick for the applicators.",
        "It was very funny.",
        "But I - they work.",
        "I mean, you can make beautiful models that way."

        "And then later, I have: What is she doing here?",
        "And every single way that you could read it is what people were saying about her.",
        "And then, not long thereafter, science being a world that is now supported by grants, torn by rivalries, she's attacked by another scientist, Linus Pauling.",
        "Now, we know now that Linus Pauling will go on to win two Nobel Prizes, but he is utterly vicious to her.",
        "And he thought it was perfectly fine to be that way, because here she was, she was a mathematician.",
        "She didn't know what she was doing.",
        "It's true she didn't know very much chemistry, and he can always nail her on the details, but she had a beautiful vision that had excited many, many people - many, many scientists - many of them Nobel Prize winners - thinking that she had - there must be something to what she's saying because - in her model because it explained things so well, so many of the properties that they had wanted to have explanations for.",
        "And Linus Pauling thought she's wrong because she doesn't have the chemistry right.",
        "She was assuming there was a bond that he didn't think existed, although it did, and so he just decided to do her in - it was literally that - and to march into this fray and get rid of her by laughing her out of the profession.",
        "What impact does it have on her career?",
        "It destroyed it.",
        "It just destroyed it.",
        "She pulled herself together and began working on X-ray diffraction theory.",
        "She becomes an academic.",
        "And I think you could say it's certainly not a bad thing to wind up teaching at Smith College, but that was not the life that she'd envisioned."
