        "When I hear you talking capitulation, though, it makes me think about this general hand-wringing in the Republican Party, which brings me to Mitt Romney.",
        "For the first time since the election, the public heard from the Republican nominee and it was in a phone recording and it was leaked.",
        "It was a conversation that Romney was having with donors on Wednesday and it was him giving his take on President Obama's reelection.",
        "Here's a clip.",
        "What the president's campaign did was focus on certain members of his base coalition, give them extraordinary financial gifts from the government, and then work very aggressively to turn them out to vote and that strategy worked.",
        "Went on to give some examples of some of those gifts, one of them being the health care law, which he said was a gift to African-Americans, went on to talk about young people, Hispanics.",
        "And a wide range of Republicans have trashed Romney for these comments.",
        "David, what's going on here?",
        "Well, this was Mitt Romney's gift to the Republican Party because he gave Republicans something to push against and distinguish themselves from what just happened.",
        "And it's crucial because what happened from Governor Bobby Jindal and others was them saying that government programs that help people are not gifts.",
        "And so, it goes to the core of what I think of as the Republican problem, the adjustment they have to make, is how do you treat government?",
        "If you think government is never - should never be in a position to help people out so they can rise and succeed, then those kind of programs that are gifts.",
        "But if you accept that government has a role to help social mobility, then they're not gifts, they're legitimate programs.",
        "So I think it's going to help Republicans reposition themselves, and they now have Mitt Romney to push against."

        "They get cheap grace out of attacking Romney and can distance themselves from this.",
        "But I think there's something substantive there, which is that if the Republicans are rejecting this, they are also rejecting a view very popular in what the conservative writer David Frum has called the conservative entertainment complex - talk radio and Fox News - because they really believe what Romney said.",
        "And I think they are setting themselves up to have a very different view of government that will be more congenial to Obama's, and anyone - the other thing is anyone who thought the 47 percent Romney wasn't the real Romney, well, he popped right back up again in this tape.",
