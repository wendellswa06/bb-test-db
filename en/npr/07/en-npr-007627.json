        "So it's a huge infusion of cash to what is still a relatively small company.",
        "Now, you say relatively small, let's put that in context because Goldman Sachs has figured that Facebook is worth about $50 billion at this point.",
        "Where does that number come from and do you think it's real?",
        "Well, it's based on projecting into the future all the businesses that Facebook is already successfully operating, and that includes selling ads to major advertisers.",
        "It includes its self-service ads, which small businesses buy, which is actually its single biggest revenue stream, and it includes its credits product.",
        "So just those businesses alone are projected to grow enough that Goldman's, you know, financial experts believed it will be very soon that a $50 billion valuation will be justified.",
        "And I'm sure they anticipate that Facebook will eventually be worth a lot more than that."
