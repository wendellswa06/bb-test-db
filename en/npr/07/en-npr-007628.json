        "What would some specifics be about things that Facebook might be doing in the future, a bigger, bolder Facebook, that it's not doing now?",
        "Well, I could think of two really big ones.",
        "One is to deploy its currency which it calls credits in a more broad-ranging way.",
        "At the moment, Facebook credits are something that you buy with a credit card or Paypal, and then you spend inside the network that Facebook operates.",
        "Predominantly you're doing that on games today.",
        "So, Zynga, which is the biggest Facebook game company, lets you buy a new cow for Farmville or whatever, and in order to do that, you have to use Facebook credits.",
        "Another big opportunity is search.",
        "Something they could directly compete with Google on and, you know, by bringing all the social data that they have and the information about what people like and don't like, there's a lot of things they can get you information about more effectively today than Google has.",

        "How realistic is it that India might become a permanent member of the Security Council?",

        "Is it saying we'll finally be able to veto whatever the Pakistanis think they can get out of the U.N.? What's their interest in being a permanent member?",
        "Well, it's kind of a complicated question, because so many people think the U.N.",
        "Security Council is relatively ineffective.",
        "Prestige is definitely a factor, but the council is involved in security issues all across the globe and if a country wants to have a regular say, there's just nothing better than having a permanent seat at the table.",
        "Is the assumption, by the way, that any additional permanent member would have veto power as the five current permanent members exercise?",
        "No.",
        "In fact, that's an issue that's quite contested.",
        "The U.S.",
        "position is that the veto should not be extended to the new members.",
        "If the council were to be expanded, probably the new permanent members would not have the veto power.",
        "India is hardly the only country to be proposed as a new permanent member.",
        "There's been talk about first Germany and Japan, which aren't there because they were the defeated powers in World War II, but also Brazil has been talked about.",
        "Yes.",
        "But each of these potential permanent candidates has a country that opposes their membership.",
        "And so for India, obviously Pakistan; for Brazil, Argentina; for Germany, Italy.",
        "And so you have kind of evil twins of these countries that are trying to get in the way of them getting permanent seats."

        "And members of the regime are still allowed to exchange this pretty worthless local currency for dollars, which they can then sell for 100 times as much.",
