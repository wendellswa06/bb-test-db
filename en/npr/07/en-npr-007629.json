        "Well, Coca-Cola has always been the nearest thing to capitalism in a bottle.",
        "And, in fact, in 1997, The Economist did this correlation of Coca-Cola consumption in different countries.",
        "And it turns out to correlate positively with wealth, quality of life and social and political freedom.",
        "Now, of course, that's not because Coca-Cola causes all of those things.",
        "It's because, we think, free market capitalism encourages all of those things.",
        "It's not clear how much old skeletal remains have contributed to the total number of deaths in the southwest - 372 bodies as of September 1st.",
        "Kathryn Ferguson claims it's not significant.",

        "for jobs are sending for their families.",
        "Good morning, Mary Louise.",
        "Thank you for the opportunity.",
        "Well, we've done a few things actually, and I'd like to just clarify, we do in fact notify the Office of the Inspector General of every death, and we make that notification through our joint intake center here at ICE, and have been doing that for quite some time.",
        "Now, in addition to that, the assistant secretary has directed that we immediately begin notifying the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics on any detainee death.",
        "That directive has been in place now for probably almost a month and is in full effect.",
        "And then in addition to that, she's also directed that we coordinate with the state and local authorities in each state to make sure that they receive the appropriate notification.",
        "When you think about the Washington Post series and the individuals that we also spoke with to put together our report.",
        "They said that 83 detainees, by their estimates, died under your agency's care.",
        "So, they also said that many of those problems that led to the deaths and to other illnesses can be blamed on lack of staffing, lack of interpreters.",
        "What do you say?",
        "I can say a few things.",
        "First, we disagree with the number.",
        "You know, first and foremost.",
        "But I think, most importantly, any death in custody is a regrettable and sad occurrence.",
        "And we have to evaluate those deaths to determine if there are processes that needs to be done differently, if there was any sort of negligent care or if it's a matter, as was the case in the majority of those deaths of natural causes.",
        "I think people need to understand that individuals who come into our custody have very little preventative on ongoing medical care, and they present with a myriad of medical challenges.",
        "And so, we certainly believe that it is our duty and responsibility to provide them with adequate health care.",
        "We do that to the tune of 100 million dollars annually.",
        "And we believe that we have appropriate oversight mechanisms in place.",
        "However, you know, we are committed to continually evaluating our performance into making changes that are necessary, and so we have initiated a comprehensive review.",
        "We want to take a look at the health care services that are provided, identify any gaps, and then, set a course to address those gaps.",
        "When you say you disagree with 83 as a death toll.",
        "Well, do you have a number?",
        "Actually, there were 72 deaths that had occurred during the period of time from 2004 until present.",
        "And, you know, I think it's also important to note that the number is dramatically reduced.",
        "In 2004, there were 29 deaths.",
        "There were seven in calendar year 2007.",
        "That's a 30 percent reduction.",
        "I think that there were a lot of facts that were missing in the Washington Post series, or they certainly did not put their information in the context.",
        "I'd give you another example.",
        "The series had talked about an increase in suicides in ICE custody.",
        "Well, in fact, the facts don't bear that out at all.",
        "There's actually been a decrease.",
        "We haven't had a successful suicide in more than 15 months, and you know, we attribute that to a number of things.",
        "I don't want to suggest for a second that we're claiming any sort of victory, but we identified where there may have been some problems or lack of training, a lack of awareness in suicide.",
        "We aggressively address that, and the result has been a reduction.",
        "So, I think that the Washington Post series was frustrating in that it did not provide any sort of context into the big picture.",
        "You know, I'm just sort of thinking about the population in ICE.",
        "We've had nearly a million and a half individuals come through our custody since 2003.",
        "And there have been 70, you know, 72 deaths as I said.",
        "Now again, every death is sad and regrettable, but I don't think that statistically it's an indication of a system that is providing inadequate health care."

        "On any given day, ICE detains about 32,000 individuals and on any given day, there are more than a million and a half people who are in removal proceedings.",
        "So, 32,000 out of more than a million and a half people who are currently undergoing immigration proceedings, I don't think is unrealistic or a very large number.",
        "I think that we take our responsibility to ensure that individuals who don't represent a threat to National Security, public safety, or a threat to flight or individuals whose criminal history would not require them to be detained, are not.",
