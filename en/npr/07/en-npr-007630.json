        "He said he could set aside his personal beliefs to consider what the law is, the Constitution and, of course, stare decisis, which is an important doctrine in preventing the overturning of existing precedent.",
        "Certainly that would be crucial in making any decisions concerning abortion.",

        "His most detailed abortion ruling came in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs. Casey.",
        "The Supreme Court used that 1992 case to reaffirm a constitutional right to abortion.",

        "The majority opinion in that case had gone through all of the difficulties that women who are going to face physical, psychological abuse, economic vulnerability, exposure to those harms.",
        "Judge Alito disregarded that factual evidence and found that this law should stand.",
        "Pro-lifers not surprisingly are happy with Alito's dissent in Casey, but ironically, they're also reassured by a case in which Alito helped strike down New Jersey's ban on so-called partial birth abortion.",
        "That case, Planned Parenthood vs. Farmer, came in 2000 just weeks after the Supreme Court struck down a similar Nebraska law.",
        "The majority of his fellow appeals court judges in the case ruled against the law, but for substantive reasons.",
        "Alito, on the other hand, agreed that the law should fall, but for the sole reason that the Supreme Court said it should.",
        "And while they disagreed with the outcome, that's the kind of reasoning pro-lifers want to see.",
        "Cathy Cleaver Ruse is a senior fellow for legal studies at the Family Research Council.",

        "It's not proper for us to go off on our own and write our own opinion about the law, but let's follow the relevant precedent.'",
        "Cleaver Ruse says she's not that worried that in respecting precedent, a Justice Alito might feel compelled to allow previous abortion rights rulings to stand.",
        "Even without directly overturning Roe v.",
