        "We actually have a better response capability now because of more manpower and things such as sensing an air support coming online, and yet the smugglers continue to take high risks.",
        "Across the entire Southwest border, deaths are actually down 13 percent.",
        "But they're up sharply in Arizona, by far the nation's busiest area for illegal crossing.",

        "Or have we begun to, a little bit, already?",
        "Well, they talk a lot about the various environments around the world that are quite unstable.",
        "And I think that this is going to come up soon.",
        "I mean, the dedication to eradicating poverty is something that John Edwards talked a lot about on the campaign trail.",
