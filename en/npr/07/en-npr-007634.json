        "And it consists of onion, sour cream, sugar and horseradish plus the raw cranberries.",
        "Is there some tactful way that my guests might express their dislike short of saying yuck?",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "I don't think guests should be expressing their dislike of your food.",
        "Outrageous.",

        "He brought with him some Republican former congressmen who have endorsed Eric Holder for attorney general.",
        "When Leahy asked for reporters' questions, the first was, what's with the full-court press?",
        "That's a valid question.",
        "Normally, I would have expected it to be just an easy nomination because everybody knows Eric Holder and everybody knows how extraordinary qualified he is.",
        "But it is not an easy nomination.",
        "Leahy's Republican counterpart, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, delivered a speech on the Senate floor last week.",
        "Specter listed Holder's academic and professional accomplishments and then said...",
        "But aside from these qualifications on Mr. Holder's resume, there is also the issue of character.",
        "Specter asked whether Holder has the stature and courage to tell the president no. Under President Bush, Democrats repeatedly accused Attorney General Alberto Gonzales of failing to tell the president no. Republicans plan to ask tomorrow about instances when Holder was deputy attorney general and sided with President Clinton over career prosecutors."

        "Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.",
        "At confirmation hearings for the last attorney general, Whitehouse pointedly asked about the definition of torture.",

        "Is that happening?",
        "Is the president hurting?",
        "Well, and this is fascinating because one of the things that Sulzberger has told people privately in the last 24 hours is he thought that Trump sort of seemed delighted when he raised that as though he was about to make an ask of the president - they can strike a deal, \"\"The Art Of The Deal\"\" sort of thinking.",
        "But in reality, Sulzberger said, hey, you want to beat up on - beat me up by name, go for it.",
