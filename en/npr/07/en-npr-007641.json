        "Right.",
        "And shed read my book and decided to read excerpts from the book out loud to her class.",
        "The boy came in to her afterwards and said, you know what?",
        "His story is my story.",
        "I cant read.",

        "So I dont see any conflict between my job and my faith walk, because, you know, we are a nation of people of many different faiths.",
        "And so I can still function, do my job, be respectful of all people in all situations and still worship the way that I choose, raise my family that way.",

        "You know, my grandmother used to say that God doesnt put heavy burdens on weak shoulders.",
        "So I think God kept me small with freckles and a big head so I wouldnt grow up to become a bully, a discipline problem.",
        "I was one of those kids that Cathy talked about.",
        "I was one of the quiet kids who kept to myself.",
        "But, you know so in the book, I wanted to tell people who have my kinds of struggles that theres joy on the other side of struggle, to tell people like Cathy to keep encouraging young people, keep working with them, that we can make a difference for people if we step out on nothing to help them.",
        "Byron Pitts, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "And good luck with the book."

        "I think that's true, and I also think it cuts both ways.",
        "I think there's contempt that both sides have for each other.",
        "And part of what I'm trying to do in these stories is to bridge that by showing how universal so many of the sort of baseline emotional struggles that people go through are - the desires for love and understanding.",
        "These are just as true in Libby, Mont., as they are in Denver or Portland or New York City.",
        "But there's so much that happens in these stories that does feel alien, that feels violent and animalistic - people behaving in ways that I in my life have never seen."
