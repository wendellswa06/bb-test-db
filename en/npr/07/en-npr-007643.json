        "That's what they call a killer ad.",
        "It started out on the Internet as a two-and-a-half-minute ad, which a lot of people downloaded and saw.",
        "But then there is a shorter television version, which I believe is what we just heard, and that is killer because so many more people will see it.",
        "In fact, it's being shown so often in Iowa it's difficult to imagine anyone interested at all in either politics or even watching television has managed to avoid seeing that ad in recent days, and many people in all camps are attributing the sudden drop-off in Gingrich's numbers in Iowa largely to that ad.",
        "Now, you're seeing some - a lot of attacks against Newt Gingrich, some attacks against Mitt Romney, largely from Rick Perry, and then you're seeing Ron Paul attacking Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney.",
        "But the one person who seems to be escaping all of the attacks is Ron Paul.",
        "Ron Paul has been a fringe figure in the minds of most people, in the mainstream media and among the other candidates.",
        "In fact, when you ask the other candidates who do you really like on this stage or who might you want to take ideas from, they love to say, oh, Ron Paul, you know, he really stands for what he believes in - mostly because they think that overall, his views are not acceptable to the mainstream of the Republican Party.",
        "And while his fierce partisans, his loyalists, will always be with him, that he's not salable to the broader Republican Party, particularly on his foreign policy.",
        "And that once you get out there to independents, people are going to say whoa, cut 80 percent of the federal government, 80 percent of the federal government?",
        "Defense, Social Security, Medicare?",
        "All aid to Israel.",
        "All aid to Israel.",
        "That gets a little spiky.",
        "So they don't fear Ron Paul, and that's why they haven't been doing anti-Ron Paul ads.",
        "If they could have known a few weeks ago or months ago where Ron Paul would be sitting in Iowa right now, they might have done so.",
        "As we mentioned, Gary Johnson will no longer be running as a Republican.",

        "He will in fact now be running as a Libertarian.",

        "Go back to 1988, Ron Paul was the Libertarian Party candidate for president.",
        "Then he came back to the House as a Republican later on.",
        "Look, Ron Paul is a guy who knows that he is at his maximum leverage right now.",
        "He knows that people are listening to him in a way they have not listened to him at any other point in his career, even when he did run as a third-party candidate for president.",

        "Why in the world would he want to rule out running as a third-party candidate right now?",
        "It wouldn't do him any good.",

        "All right, Southern Methodist University Mustang, Craig James, who was in that famous Pony Express backfield with Eric Dickerson back in the late '70s, early '80s, had a pretty good pro career of his own, was offensive player of the year on year, I believe he was in the Pro Bowl, had quite a career.",
        "And more recently, of course, and more broadly known to people today as an ESPN college football analyst.",
        "Craig James is a guy who is probably about as universally known in Texas as you can be without being currently playing football.",
        "Or Roger Staubach.",
        "Or Roger Staubach, who will always be playing football in Texas, or for that matter perhaps a officeholder in Texas.",
        "He has never run for office before.",
        "So this would be his inaugural run in politics, and he's already gotten a lot of attention.",
        "Presumably he'll be able to raise a fair amount of money.",
        "This may be more of a wide-open race than we knew, or maybe he's just getting in too late.",
        "And it was interesting, Sarah Palin said this week it is not too late for folks to get into the race, unclear whether she was speaking for herself, but all of a sudden we see an editorial in the Wall Street Journal from the former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the brother and son of a president of the United States, and all of - robocalls for Hillary Clinton."

        "I'm not sure when Sarah Palin said it wasn't too late for folks to get in she was referring to Hillary, but she certainly was thinking about somebody other than herself, one assumes.",
        "If she wanted to get in, all she has to say is I don't see anybody emerging from this field who expresses everything I want in a candidate, and she has refused to endorse any of them, saying she's still thinking about which one is most reflective of her views.",

        "The president announced this fall he'd wait until after next year's elections before deciding whether to approve a pipeline that would pump oil from Canada's oil shales to the United States.",

        "Absolutely nothing.",
        "This was thrown in as pure politics, at the end of the day.",
        "And what I think is so interesting about this issue is the Keystone Pipeline has been on the table since 2008.",
        "It was first proposed in 2008, during the Bush administration, and has been kind of a back-burner environmental issue for three years.",
        "Environmentalists have always opposed it.",
        "The oil industry has always supported it, and most Americans didn't really know all that much about it.",

        "And the State Department gets the final signoff on this.",

        "And environmentalists are very, very opposed to this pipeline because it doesn't just bring conventional oil into the United States.",
        "It will open up a market for pretty much the dirtiest kind of fossil fuel that there is in the world.",
        "It's - the Canadian tar sands oil - you know, regular oil that we produce now contributes to global warming, but the oil that's in the Canadian tar sands is kind of special.",
        "It's in this dense, gooey mix with sand, and the only way to get it out is by using so much energy, that you create about 30 to 70 percent more global warming emissions to get it out.",

        "So building this pipeline, some environmentalists say, could really be a tipping point for climate change.",
        "And so environmentalists kind of geared up and got these protests going, elevated the issue and got the president's base so activated on this that they threatened to leave him.",
        "This is sort of the environmental base that, you know, knocked on doors, got people excited, you know, really brought out the vote for President Obama in 2008.",

        "Just the tiniest little move in the economy, just the tiniest little move down in the unemployment rate helps him enormously.",
        "So we have to assume that the one issue that is completely paramount in this election is that economy, and here is a symbolic moment, a totally symbolic moment because we're only talking about maybe a few hundred or a few thousand jobs at most in this connection.",
        "But it looks like the symbolic yes or no.",
        "And that's what's really elevated this issue from the backburner to the front lines of the political debate.",
        "Republicans hadn't paid a lot of attention to this, and then it just - the nature of the issue itself just fit so perfectly what the political narrative is going to be for 2012.",
        "It's about oil security.",
        "It's about the economy.",
        "And yes, it's about jobs.",
        "There's dispute over how many jobs it would create, but it's clear that the pipeline will create jobs.",
        "So Republicans love the idea of jumping on this and saying the administration - you know, this administration is saying no to a job creator and no to something that could help the economy.",
