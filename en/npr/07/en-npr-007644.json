        "Now, there is one other obstacle in the way of the pipeline, and that is Nebraska, a Republican state with a Republican governor who said wait a minute.",
        "We opposed this pipeline crossing land that - underneath which lies the Ogallala Aquifer.",

        "This makes a certain amount of sense to them as an environmental question.",
        "But there's always the prospect of re-routing the pipeline, getting it away from Nebraska, getting the Nebraskans set to one side so that we can go back to the symbolic issue.",
        "And Coral Davenport, some say even if it's blocked in the United States, these oil sands are going to be tapped, and that oil is going to be sent - perhaps by pipeline - to the West Coast, where it can be shipped to China.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That part of the debate is - you know, the demand for oil globally is so great right now, that with or without this pipeline, you know, someone's going to get to that oil.",
        "One reason this source of oil that is so polluting and so expensive...",
        "And so big.",
        "...and so big - has not yet been a major source of oil is because it's extremely expensive to extract.",
        "But now that we are - we've really entered the era of, you know, $100-a-barrel oil kind of as the norm, people are looking - you know, companies are looking for oil in unconventional places all over the world.",
        "And it's certainly - it's an appropriate argument to say with or without that pipeline, someone's going to figure out a way to get that oil."

        "The only problem I have with it is that I think the politics are getting too much involved with it, and - but they're also not listening to the people in Nebraska and understanding that, you know, if they didn't provide this many jobs, what about helping out some of the Nebraska people and understanding where they're coming from?",

        "A, he doesn't quite believe them, but he thinks they will vote for him, if not work for him, if not fund him.",
        "But in any case, do they actually prefer a Republican president and a Republican Congress who would be on the policy of drill, baby, drill, not just the pipeline but fracking and offshore oil?",
        "This is where it's interesting to see that Republicans have really gone up to the brink on this.",
        "There's this classic tension between Democratic lawmakers, Democratic presidents and environmentalists, because a Democratic president, you know, kind of knows that there, you know, he or she has to make pragmatic political decisions, and they know that there are times where they can do things that will disappoint the environmentalists.",
        "And the environmentalists aren't going to go and vote for the other guy.",
        "So they're always, you know, we see this administration always trying to maintain that balance.",
        "You know, we've seen this administration disappoint environmentalists on some other issues, and they know that the environmentalists will still stay with them.",
        "This is the case where all the environmentalists organized and got together and said we will abandon you.",
