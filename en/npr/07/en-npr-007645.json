        "You know, something I recently learned that's very interesting is there are actually more than twice as many jobs in the renewable energy industry in the United States than there are in the fossil fuel industry.",
        "There's - according to a study by the Brookings Institution done over the summer, there are 2.7 million jobs in the United States in the renewable energy industry and only about 800,000 in coal, oil and other fossil fuel extraction; which is interesting, you know, it's surprising to, you know, understand that discrepancy in numbers.",
        "And this project is expected to bring, you know, two to 5,000 additional jobs, which is, you know, not insignificant but it's a small - it's a much smaller number than the number of jobs in the renewable energy industry.",

        "There will be new supply entering the global market, and that will be produced - you know, the demand for that supply will come from North America, potentially reduce demand from the Middle East.",
        "But, you know, the oil market is really global, and so, you know, it's not a guarantee that this will be injected directly into the U.S.",
        "market.",
        "And there's no guarantee whatsoever that will make any difference in oil prices or gasoline prices in the United States.",
        "All of those are influenced by global developments around the world.",
        "So all of this comes into play when you think about whether or not it's a good decision to do it.",
        "So in some ways, it's symbolic, but symbols are important.",
        "Yes.",
        "And the fact that it's so symbolic is so clear if you look at the history, if you look at how this, you know, sat as a backburner issue until we were approaching a heavily contested presidential election.",
        "All of a sudden, you know, it became something being touted by the campaigns.",
