        "The problem is a disproportionate effect on racial minorities, particularly African-Americans and Latinos.",

        "Well, we would hope to see bankers and other lending institutions sitting down with people who are in peril, those whose homes are now being threatened, to catch them before they go into the foreclosure period, to find an opportunity to help put them into a package they know they can actually afford.",
        "Because clearly what we're seeing is something that's not only affecting those who have the loans, but we're also talking about what's happened to our economy across the board.",
        "We know that 52 percent of African-American borrowers and 40 percent of Hispanics receive subprime loans.",

        "But the $1,500 a month, again, is based on an introductory rate of somewhere around four percent.",
        "They go into that for a while.",

        "They find out that in a couple of years the loan is going to explode; that is, it's going to increase to somewhere around $2,400 a month.",
        "They realize they can't afford that, but then go to say, well, perhaps I can refinance.",
        "So they go back to the broker, they go back to a different bank or a different lending institution and say to them, listen, I'd like to refinance my loan because it's going to increase significantly to a point I can't afford in the next three years.",
        "What they also didn't tell him is that for most subprime loans there's also something called an early payment penalty.",
