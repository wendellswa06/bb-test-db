        "You talk about that in the book quite a bit.",
        "What generally sparked this outburst from the whites against the blacks?",
        "In about half the cases it was the allegation of rape, or rape and murder, but there are also instances where it was economically based.",
        "In other words, where whites saw blacks as a threat economically as they competed for jobs.",
        "So if you drove out the blacks, you improve your economic position.",
        "And so that clearly was the case for example in Polk County or in Marshall County, Kentucky.",
        "Let's talk about Forsyth County, Georgia.",
        "Now this was 1912 when you recount the ethnic cleansing that took place there.",
        "But you can move forward 70 years, 70-plus years and the issue of racial involvement or the lack of racial involvement in Forsyth County is still a sore point, is it not?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "What happened, briefly, in 1912, and then what happened when you tried to get that story told?",
        "In 1912, a young girl was raped and murdered.",
        "Two blacks were convicted of that crime.",
        "After they were convicted, they began intimidation of blacks in Forsyth County, which spread to other counties, Hall County, Cherokee County.",
        "At its height, it engulfed an area about the size of Delaware.",
        "And there were slightly over a thousand blacks living in Forsyth County, and within a matter of months it had been reduced to around 20.",
        "And in a neighboring county it went down to zero.",
        "In Forsyth County, the fable was, yes, the blacks left but they were paid for their land and so no harm, no foul.",
        "And you will be amazed at the hold that these fables have on the public.",
        "In the case of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, they were particularly upset about the idea that black-owned land had been stolen."

        "Now the editors at the AJC have gone on record as saying that they made an editorial decision not to run your material in part because they said nothing was new and secondly because they had some questions about, again, the veracity and the validity of the research that was done.",
        "That's the last word we have publicly from them.",
        "Well, I detail their objections in the book.",
        "And the fact of the matter is that what they wrote in 1987, which was the last time they visited this issue, is wrong and it's easy to document that it's wrong.",
