        "I'd say it's a testament to how surveillance methods have kept up with the geometric progression of these communication methods.",

        "They ask whether other types of intelligence gathering might be just as effective.",

        "Then that phone number was monitored through signals intelligence.",
        "And then his movements were tracked by geospatial intelligence - drones and so forth.",
        "So it's actually the integration of these different methodologies that actually give you the best results.",
        "The expanded use of telephone and Internet surveillance is, in part, an adaptation to the information revolution.",

        "And that the migrant workers are really experiencing high levels of wage theft, they're working in hazardous conditions with no protection, and they're experiencing harassment by police and immigration officials.",
        "I was really struck when I went down to New Orleans right after Hurricane Katrina, and then I went back again six months later and I struck by how many Mexican immigrants there were in the city.",
        "Has this kind of pitting of two different employment groups caused racial tension in the city?",
        "Yes.",

        "Does this case exemplify some of the issues going on, and can you tell us a little bit more about it?",
        "Sure.",
        "This case was filed on behalf of a group of almost 600 workers who where employed immediately after the hurricane in the reconstruction of St. Bernard Parish schools.",
        "They were removing the toxic mold and mud and floodwaters in October and November of 2005.",
        "And the treatment of these workers I think is a good example of what was happening to many workers at the time in New Orleans, and many of the problems workers are still having.",
        "Many were paid late and oftentimes not paid at all for up to a month of work.",
        "And this was at a time when there were no resources in the city to rely on for workers not being paid.",
        "So the impact of wage theft was much more severe than it might be in any other circumstances.",
        "Workers were hungry.",
        "Workers were living in employer-provided housing and faced losing their housing if they complained about wage theft.",
        "And workers were, in fact, threatened when they asked for their wages, when they asked for wages for work that had already been completed.",
        "Judith, is it easier to exploit undocumented workers or is that a distinction at all that your research has found?",
        "Well, we didn't find that distinction.",
        "I mean, all workers are victims of exploitation.",
        "And so documented, undocumented, it doesn't matter.",
        "The thing that may matter is whether or not the worker feels like they have the status and the ability to fight back.",
        "And so you may see that with workers who are citizens that they kind of take on the system because they don't have as much of a fear of reprisals.",
        "I think, following up on that too, I mean the lack of resources going in to allow worker complaints is real critical.",
        "The failure of the U.S.",
        "Department of Labor to have a strategy to respond immediately is just outrageous.",
        "And the worker protection infrastructure in New Orleans and Louisiana, like in many Southern states, was weak before the hurricane and was decimated like everything else.",
        "And so what we found is that all workers have very few avenues to exercise their rights, while employers have most of the power to set the terms of the game.",
        "And what we found was just basic lawlessness that came into being after the hurricane and continues, and workers feel it and employers exploit it."

        "So when you have these policies, these governmental policies that are working in conjunction with contractors who have no level of accountability and who are really trying to make the most profit that they can and do that at the expense of the workers, what you find is that you have a structure and institutional racism that keeps people on this race to the bottom.",
