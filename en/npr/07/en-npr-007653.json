        "Were they able to talk to each other at all over the course of that time?",

        "So I'd like to get your perspective as a person who's been following this very closely from the beginning.",
        "Well, my perspective, frankly, comes from watching Cindy and Jimena go through this process.",
        "The government talks about a very well-coordinated process for reuniting these families, but, in the 24 hours leading up to the reunification, Jimena's mother got four different accounts of how this is going to happen.",
        "First, there was going to be a vetting of both mother and the people that she would live with, and that process was supposedly going to take up to two weeks.",
        "Then there was this waiving of the vetting process, and there was only going to be a DNA test and that the results of that test would take five days before perhaps mother and daughter would be reunited.",
        "And then, late on Thursday night, Cindy, the mother, gets a phone call saying there's going to be a drop-off, and her daughter's going to be brought to Houston.",
        "So, in just the span of 24 hours, this reunification process became several different kinds of reunification processes.",
        "It's unclear that they knew exactly how this was going to happen until the very last minute.",
        "As a person who watched this whole thing closely, though, do you think it's true that Cindy and Jimena were reunited faster partly because she was able to memorize that number - that she did know who her relatives were, she knew their names, she knew the phone number, and she was able to communicate that?",
        "Do you think that that was a factor in their being reunited?",
        "And, if so, what about kids who don't have a phone number?",
        "I think that's a very scary reality.",
        "I think that number was crucial.",
        "It's become clear to reporters covering this to a judge in San Diego who has been sort of ordering the government and setting deadlines for the government to reunify these children that there was no real plan for reunifying children.",
        "The government separated them without keeping records of which child belonged to which adults.",
        "So what's next for Cindy and Jimena now that they are reunited?"
