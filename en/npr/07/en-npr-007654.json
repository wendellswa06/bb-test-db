        "That much seems clear to a lot of insiders but American Enterprise Institute congressional scholar Norm Ornstein says the general public may be fuzzy on whether the Abramoff is Republican or bipartisan.",
        "But if past experience is any guide, as time passes, and especially as we approach the 2006 elections, we're going to see more prominent Republicans caught in the snare here and more of a sense even if it's relatively evenly divided that if it's time for a change the people you most want to change are those who have the most seats, the ones who are running things in Washington.",
        "The political pedigree of the Abramoff scandal will also become more clear as the Justice Department probe continues, a probe that could ensnare more than a dozen other lawmakers.",

        "Two months ago, a group of moderate Republicans, led by Michael Castle of Delaware, threatened to withhold their votes on a must-pass budget resolution.",
        "What they got from the leadership was a promise for an up-or-down vote on Castle's stem-cell bill.",
        "The bill would ease limits imposed by President Bush in 2001.",
        "Those limits allowed federal funding for stem cells derived from human embryos, but only on cell lines that were already in existence as of the date the policy was imposed.",

        "Still, the president vowed to veto the bill last week, and a formal statement of policy reiterated his threat today.",
