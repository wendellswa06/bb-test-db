        "Which is really interesting because people do worry about how what their 401(k)s are doing.",

        "He - and it's unclear whether he was being facetious or serious, but many people took this as serious.",
        "He tweeted, I am all alone, poor me, in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security.",
        "And the tweet goes on, but the point there is that negotiations aren't really happening.",
        "There were some - just as the shutdown started - some talks.",

        "And then that would dissuade the attorney general from issuing an indictment at all.",
