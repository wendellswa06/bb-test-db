        "In other words, Darwin is not the controversial figure in the U.K.",
        "he remains in the U.S.",
        "Bloomfield says the reason for this is science has proven Darwin right.",

        "Now you ask, what is the relationship between scientific theory and Christian faith?",
        "The simplest way of thinking is to say, well, they're really answering different questions.",
        "Science is trying to address the question, how do things happen.",
        "And in answer to that, you get the theory of evolution.",
        "Things happened over millions and millions of years by a very gradual process through natural causes.",
        "But Harries says if you ask why did things happen, then you get a completely different answer.",
        "It's the why of life that belongs in the spiritual domain.",
        "Harries says the problems some religions have with Darwin and evolution come from a literal interpretation of the Bible.",
        "And he says, while the Bible contains profound truths, it's not word for word true.",
        "Right Rev.",
        "Lord HARRIES: First of all, take the issue of the age of the Earth.",
        "I mean, do people really think that the universe is only 4,000 years old where every science - chemistry, paleontology, physics, astronomy - every single science points with huge amounts of evidence to the Earth being billions of years old and the universe being even more billions of years old.",
        "So you just have to ask people, what do they make - do they think that the vast majority of scientists in every scientific discipline on Earth are liars?",
        "Yeah, and the colorful dinosaurs."

        "What I was saying is we don't need red tape, right?",
        "While I was governor, we went through 24,500 rules and regulations.",
        "And we looked for the red tape that really is not adding regulatory value.",
        "But at the same time we were doing that, we sat down with the oil and gas industry and the environmental community, and we created a complete, integrated system of regulations around what they call fugitive emissions, but escaping methane.",
