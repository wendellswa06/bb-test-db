        "Well, for me, it's more the ongoing inspiration from these guys.",
        "There is not the anger and bitterness that you might expect.",
        "They're true survivors.",
        "Each time I learn a new thing: Herman graduating from college, going back to help other people who are leaving prison and helping them re-enter society.",
        "So it's more the inspirational surprises that keep coming up.",
        "Herman Atkins, how can you let go of what I would think most of us would have, and that would be anger, not only with the judicial system but possibly with society as well?",
        "I'm a very spiritual person, and I made God a promise that if he ever provide a platform for me to speak on and share my story to help others, then I would do just that.",
        "And with that, I just put the blame where it belongs, which was in the hands of the prosecutor for indulging in prosecutorial misconduct, as well as the police, who indulged in police misconduct, and I left it there.",
        "Mark Simon, one of the interesting things that the documentary brings up is the idea of mistaken identity.",
        "We hear so often and have certainly been raised with the hour crime saga on television that, `Oh, we have an eyewitness,' as if that means it's a closed-door case.",
        "But the reality is, misidentification happens a whole lot in cases like that.",
        "It's not in all cases where misconduct happens, but in the case of eyewitness identification or misidentification, it is a leading cause of wrongful conviction of the innocent.",
        "And that is why these DNA exonerations open a window into the system, into the flaws of the system.",
        "Mark, we should note, we keep talking about DNA, DNA, DNA; we should talk about the idea of how extraordinary this has become in really correcting some of these wrongs.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are over 400 DNA exonerations where there was biological evidence at the scene of the crime that was collected and then, decades later, was able to be re-examined.",
        "That biological evidence, whether it be from blood, skin or semen, is then tested, and it leaves a genetic fingerprint that is only unique to that one individual, and it can prove whether that person was or wasn't the person who committed the crime.",
        "Herman, I'm curious; as an African-American male who went through this, talk to me about if you believe there's any way that we can make sure that we get black men standing on a more even playing field in the judicial system.",
        "Black men most definitely have to prepare themselves about how the system works, how it functions.",
        "You know, it seems as though that Americans' justice system target two types of people to put in the prisons nationwide, which is the uneducated and the undesirables.",
        "And, unfortunately, the face to the uneducated and the undesirable is people of color.",
        "Let me ask you, Mr. Atkins, have you had the opportunity over the years now to talk with the victim?"

        "Well, the global steel industry has just gotten very big.",
        "There's been too much capacity, and this causes prices to fall.",
        "So the steel industry in particular has been in a lot of trouble.",
        "The steel industry accused other countries of dumping steel at a low price.",
        "President Trump said he wanted to revive the industry.",
        "He wanted manufacturers in the United States to use American steel.",
        "And what he did was he cited a trade law which is known as Section 232.",
        "And what that says is if there's an industry that is needed for national security, the president can take steps to protect it by restricting any imports that might compete with it.",
        "Now, this really angered Canada in particular because it is the biggest supplier of steel to the U.S.",
        "And Canada said, you know, how can you be citing national security reasons to block our steel when we're one of your most loyal allies?",
        "Yeah, but Canada had been saying that for a while.",
        "So is President Trump's decision to eliminate the tariffs now a recognition that his strategy for the last year hasn't worked?",
        "I think he did it because he has bigger fish to fry.",
        "The president has this new revised version of NAFTA that he negotiated with Canada and Mexico which he says is this huge improvement over NAFTA, although a lot of economists would say, you know, it makes basically incremental changes in trade policy.",
        "It's good for auto parts companies, for example.",
        "But the new treaty is called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
        "It has to be approved by Congress.",
        "There is a lot of opposition to it.",
        "Some Democrats in the House want to rewrite it.",
        "But also some Republicans like Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley made clear there's not going to be - there wouldn't be a vote until these tariffs are gone.",
        "So President Trump said today, now these tariffs are gone, Congress should get down to the business of voting on his treaty.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "So that deal is going to be a fantastic deal for our country.",
        "And hopefully Congress will approve the USMCA quickly.",
        "And then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will make our economy even more successful than it already is, if that's possible.",
        "Jim, just in our last 30 seconds or so, what kind of impact did these tariffs have over the last year?"

        "Well, the steel industry loved them because once you cut off imports, the price of steel went up for a while.",
        "Later on, though, it came down.",
        "But there was a huge downside because once you make steel and aluminum more expensive, it hurts all the other industries that use them in their own manufacturing like automakers and, you know, canned goods companies.",
        "A lot of them saw their prices rise.",
        "So there was a lot of pressure on the administration to reduce these tariffs.",
        "And it came from these industries, but it also came from members of Congress.",

        "Juan, how much of the factor is race playing in this poll numbers?",
        "Well, it's a tremendous factor, Alex, and I must tell you, among the people who are the political professionals, it is the X factor, because they worry that voters don't tell them the truth, that white voters don't admit that they won't vote for Obama once they get in the voting booth.",
        "But what we saw this weekend in that Pew poll was that when you look at white voters, that McCain is apparently padding his lead.",
        "It was 48 to 40 in June.",
        "It's 51 to 39 now, and that's why in that Pew poll you've seen a shrinkage, about a five-point shrinkage, in the last month, with Obama now leading McCain by three points, 46 to 43.",

        "There'll be a roll-call vote on this.",

        "Well, you know, that's interesting, because the conventional political narrative around town - and I've been of town, I've been out of town, I've been in China, so I've just come back and reengaged in the conversation - is that somehow Senator Clinton has really snookered Senator Obama and that she will be the talk of the conventions.",
        "It's Senator Clinton on Tuesday night.",
        "It's former president Bill Clinton on Wednesday night.",
        "Also Wednesday night, Senator Clinton's name put in nomination for the presidency and, of course, she got about half of the votes in the primary.",
        "So, there's the possibility that her delegates will rise up and stage some long, lengthy, and it will get lots of TV coverage and mar Barack Obama's moment.",
        "But according to people inside the campaigns, Senator Obama is fully in charge of this convention, that wanted Senator Clinton's people to have the opportunity to make a display, to honor her efforts, are to bring the Democratic Party together, and to have people feel good about him because he's been assured that Senator Clinton's remarks will be very positive about him.",
        "Let me ask you about China, because you were there for the Olympics.",

        "I don't have the authority to make it.",
        "My point was that by raising doubts about Darwin at the beginning, by getting our first reaction wrong, even though as the Church of England, we pretty quickly got OK with Darwin, we legitimized, to some extent, later movements, particularly in the States in the early 20th century, to raise creationism as an ideology and make Darwin a whipping boy.",

        "Krishtalka knows this book, with its notions about how life appeared on earth, is threatening to some people, and even though Kansas has grabbed headlines with its fights over teaching Intelligent Design in schools as an alternative to Darwin's theories, it's not a problem unique to Kansas.",
