        "And it is sad that a nation will not even go as far as acknowledging the mistakes they made, when a person who actually committed a crime and gets out on parole has more resources to acclimate themselves back into society, when in actuality a person who has been wrongfully convicted and exonerated from a crime doesn't.",

        "And over the following years, the weeds spread like a plague across America's farmland.",
        "They're practically everywhere in the South now, spreading northward through the Midwest.",
        "The impact is just unbelievable.",
        "We've invested over 1.2 billion - with a B - just in the cotton industry for controlling glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth since we first discovered it."
