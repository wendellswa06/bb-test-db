        "Biotech companies have rolled out a new answer - new genetically engineered crops that can tolerate two other weed killers, called dicamba and 2,4-D, so farmers can spray those chemicals on their fields to kill the weeds.",
        "There's a lot riding on these new products - billions of dollars.",
        "But now, even before they've been fully launched, they may be starting to fail.",
        "The evidence for this is sitting in a greenhouse at Kansas State University, carefully tended by a graduate student here, Chandrima Shyam.",
        "These are plants that were sprayed with 2,4-D.",
        "And this is the resistant plant.",
        "You can see that the resistant plants are pretty vigorous.",
        "I see trays and trays of growing pigweed.",
        "These plants are the offspring of weeds that another Kansas State scientist, Dallas Peterson, noticed last summer in a field where he does research.",
        "They seemed to survive every chemical he threw at them.",
        "We were just not able to control or kill those weeds following those herbicide applications.",
        "So we went to the field.",
        "We took - dug out the whole plant and brought them to the greenhouse and kept them in isolation.",
        "Shyam and her colleagues collected the seeds, grew new generations of these plants to study them and found these plants can survive sprays of 2,4-D.",
        "Some also seem immune to dicamba.",
        "They're probably resistant to glyphosate.",
        "And if they showed up in one field, they're probably in other fields, too.",
        "Basically, they're a farmer's nightmare.",
        "Stanley Culpepper at the University of Georgia says he's not surprised; nobody should be surprised anymore by the superpowers of pigweed.",
        "I'm telling you, as a weed scientist, it's just an absolute fascinating plant.",
        "It - you have to respect it.",
        "And the first thing to respect is, this plant will outsmart me if I do the same thing over and over again.",
        "Culpepper tells farmers they still can control this weed, but they'll need to use a bunch of different tools - multiple chemicals, alternating crops, extra crops in the off-season to cover the soil.",
        "This can get expensive, though.",
        "Some farmers say they can't afford to do all of it.",
        "But Culpepper says they also can't afford to lose this battle with herbicide-resistant weeds.",

        "A few people, whose names might be familiar to NPR listeners, were in this conversation - Audie Cornish, who is the host of All Things Considered; Sam Sanders, who's a national reporter; as well as Celeste Headlee, who sometimes guest hosts here, and a few other people.",
        "What was funny - Audie said to me that one of the jokes she shared with me off-line was sort of that it's not that her voice that people respond to.",
        "It's when people google her and realize that she's black that people respond to.",
        "And so there was this really robust discussion about the assumptions of who the hosts are, which also inform who people assume the audience is as well.",
