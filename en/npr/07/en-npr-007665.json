        "I understand that in the first couple of days after the attack, they might not have been available, but afterwards, was that kind of equipment standard and would that have affected what kind of symptoms people had afterwards?",
        "Well, there were some respirators that were available.",

        "One, they weren't available in a systematic fashion in the early weeks.",
        "People didn't get trained on how to use them.",

        "A lot of the filters got clogged, and people didn't know how to change them, so they might have been using a respirator that was no longer effective.",
        "It was also very hard to communicate with a respirator, and the only way to communicate was by voice, so people had to take them off.",
        "Overall, though, if respirators had been available, if people had been trained in how to use them and been given the proper respirators, then it is possible that we would see less disease now.",
        "I think that certainly, you know, we wish we could go back in time and say it should've, you know, this should've happened.",
        "And we can do that for the next disaster if one should occur.",
        "You know, hopefully, that won't be the case.",

        "I would hope so.",
        "I don't think it has.",
        "I think that it needs to be part - in the same way that we have push-packs for antibiotics in case of, you know, some major infectious disaster, we need to have push-packs of respirators that can be responsibly allocated to various sites, rapidly deployed.",
        "But it isn't enough just to give someone a respirator.",
        "You need to show someone how to use it, and we need to make sure that there are people available to show people how to use these properly.",
        "It's the first line of defense, but if it's not used effectively, then it's no defense at all.",

        "But what you're asking raises a very important issue, which is that we have to be able to monitor the health of the people who worked at the site for years and decades to come, because many of the diseases that might result from the inhalation of toxic particles and fibers don't show up immediately.",
        "The body's response to these particles takes a long time to develop, and we'll see the disease years from now.",
