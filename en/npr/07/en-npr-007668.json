        "Once she left the administration, she was somewhat less enthusiastic.",

        "It would have higher standards that would help business and workers in the U.S.",
        "And when she did finally come out against the agreement last fall, it probably had as much to do with what Bernie Sanders was saying as what Donald Trump was saying.",
        "But she did come out against an agreement that she had supported before it was finally negotiated in the past?",

        "Ken, you know, is that her, you know, a Sarah Palin moment, you know?",
        "Much of that concentrated in a number of big cities.",
        "Overall though, it's important to note crime is still well below the levels we saw in past decades.",
        "Clinton and Trump also had a back and forth about what happened to crime in New York after stop and frisk was ended.",
        "Clinton said murders went down.",
        "Trump said they went up.",
        "We'll call that a tie.",
        "There was an increase in 2015.",
        "So far this year, though, murder in New York City is on the decline.",
        "Scott Horsley, we've got time for one or two more items here.",
