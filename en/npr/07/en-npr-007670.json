        "I'm old enough to remember the single wing, and it looks like that.",
        "But nevertheless, Michael Vick, hard to find a quarterback better suited for the wildcat.",
        "Yes.",
        "For listeners who don't know, the wildcat means that your quarterback takes the snap and is immediately in a position where they can run down the field.",
        "I mean, running is such an important part of the wildcat that the Miami Dolphins, who really reinvigorated it, had Ronnie Brown, their running back, play quarterback in that set.",
        "But to have somebody like Michael Vick do it, I mean, that could be a very powerful weapon even if he's only 80 percent of what he was.",
        "And this is something that's usually trotted out just, well, a few plays a game, maybe two or three series a game, not the whole game.",

        "Like we're saying, two years in Leavenworth and going bankrupt, that's a heck of a debt to play(ph).",
        "The second thing is that Michael Vick has already made commitments to do work, to teach young people about why they shouldn't get involved in dog fighting.",

        "Animals are defenseless, animals are unable to make it by themselves and they rely on human compassion.",
        "And someone who would abuse that for not only his own emotional excitement but for financial gain in a dog fighting situation for a long period of time, isn't something like vehicular manslaughter that happens one night on accident and someone's convicted of vehicular manslaughter.",
