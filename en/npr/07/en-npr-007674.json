        "I don't know whether he was - his seat is open right now or whether he is going to resign or not.",
        "But I am just wondering what the deal is in Delaware, whether they have chosen a replacement for Joe Biden or not.",
        "Joe Biden was sworn in yesterday as senator from the state of Delaware.",
        "He was re-elected as senator in addition to be elected vice president-elect, and that decision has also been made.",
        "Yeah, unlike Barack Obama, who resigned his Senate seat, Joe Biden has not done that.",
        "He has been in the Senate since '73.",
        "He was re-elected, as Neal just said, in November and was sworn in yesterday.",
        "Vice President Dick Cheney was there, one vice president who was succeeding vice president to another.",
        "But he will resign the next couple of days and or weeks, certainly before January 20th.",
        "And Ted Kaufman, who was a longtime Joe Biden aide, has been named by outgoing Governor Minner to succeed Biden in the Senate for just two years.",
        "And basically, it's keeping the Senate seat warm for Joe Biden' son, who is the state attorney general of Delaware who is currently in Iraq with the National Guard.",
        "So Ted Kaufman said he would accept appointment to the Senate.",
        "He will not run on 2010, and it will be wide open for Beau Biden to come back when he comes back.",
        "Now, I heard this on CNN last night.",
        "I heard Joe Biden's name mentioned now.",
        "Does he have a calculus or a strategy for waiting so long?",
        "Well, his son is serving in Iraq at the moment, and so the idea, I think, was that it would be inappropriate for him to serve in the United States Senate and serve in the National Guard at the same time.",
        "No, I think what Steven was asking is why did Joe Biden not resign already and let Ted Kaufman takeover the seat?",
        "It's not clear.",
        "I really don't know - it's something that I need to investigate because it seems very odd that he has held on this long because they already have the appointment named."

        "And it was just about an hour ago that Roland Burris held a news conference where he said he expects very shortly to represent the state of Illinois in the United States Senate.",
        "Let's listen to bit of what he had to say.",
        "When we get these two matters out of the way, the signature on my good friend - and I say my good friend - Secretary Jessie White, and, of course, my testimony before the impeachment committee tomorrow in Springfield, we will proceed then to submit our documentation to the Senate.",
        "This will go to the Rules Committee, and they will then assess it and let me know what the outcome is.",
        "So, Congressman Davis, like everybody else, I think you now expect Roland Burris to be the next junior senator from the state of Illinois.",
        "Well, it does indeed look very promising, and it does indeed look as though the Senate may very well confirm Roland Burris to become the junior senator from Illinois.",
        "That their replacement...",
        "Well, that is true.",
        "That is true.",
        "The governor did not call me, actually sent an emissary that I met with and had discussion with, who offered the position to me from the governor.",
        "And, of course, we have to ask, what was that conversation like?",
        "Well, I was a little bit surprised, not too much.",
        "But it was actually Christmas Eve, and I indicated that I'd need some time to think about it, and that I would think about it with my wife on Christmas Day, and I'd let them know the next day, which was going to be Friday morning.",
        "We agreed to meet again at nine o'clock.",
        "We did, and I shared with them that I really appreciated the governor's of confidence, but I felt that there was so much turmoil surrounding the situation and because of the fact that I've got so many issues that I am dealing with of a what I called different substantive matter, such as how do you successfully reintegrate ex-offenders back into communities?",
        "How do you get more kids to go to school and not drop out?",
        "How do you keep people from having their lights and gas turned off in the winter time?",
        "All those kinds of things and that it would take too much of my time just answering inquiries about the governor, why did I take the appointment, that I declined, that at this time, I would not do it.",

        "No, as a matter of fact, to be very honest about it, I actually suggested that they go and see Mr. Burris.",
        "Really?",
        "Yes.",
        "And everybody says that, though he's, I think, lost the last four times he's run for election there in the state of Illinois, everybody seems to think that he's an outstanding public servant.",
        "Well, he was an outstanding public servant.",
        "For 20 years, he was a state-wide elected official without any hint of impropriety, without any hint of scandal.",
        "As a matter of fact, he was always known as Mr. Clean.",
        "We used to jokingly say that he was as clean as a hound's tooth.",
        "And that's pretty much been Roland's life, not only in terms of elected office, but in other public, civic, community, public service activities of which both he and his family have been engaged.",
        "And so, he's a great appointment, and I look forward to his confirmation and to him going ahead and doing the best possible job that could get done.",
        "There is speculation that part of the deal here - I know that it's impossible to think that deals might be made, but that part of the deal here is that, in fact, Mr. Burris might have agreed that maybe he will not run for election in two years' time in 2010.",
        "Of course, he is 71 years old.",
        "Well, I don't know that I think Roland would be engaged in any kind of deal.",
        "Of course, one of the reasons I did not accept the appointment is that I got a strong feeling that, you know, there's going to be a stiff election in 2010, especially unless you're able to really coalesce the Democratic Party in Illinois, and Roland may very well be able to do that.",
        "I said early on that he had more confidence in his ability to bring all of those disparate forces together by 2010 than I'd be.",
        "And since I knew that I intended to be around longer than 2010, it just simply was not the best option for me under those circumstances.",

        "I think that it poses a real challenge, but I think that Roland feels that he's up to the challenge.",
        "And of course, by 2010, he may have such an outstanding record in the Senate that maybe nobody challenges him in the primary.",
        "Maybe nobody challenges him.",
        "But, I mean, he's willing to take that kind of risk, whereas I was not prepared to take that kind of risk.",
