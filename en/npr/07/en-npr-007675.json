        "How do you feel about that?",
        "Well, I think that people felt, because they couldn't come up with any other reason - I'm saying, you know, if somebody had said, you know, we think that maybe this candidate would have a difficult time raising money, then money is the issue, you know what I mean?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Or if somebody said, this candidate does not have a certain amount of experience, then experience would have been the issue.",
        "And since initially, none of those issues were raised, then, of course, there were some people who would think that race had something to do with it.",
        "I've always felt, quite frankly, that there were individuals who felt that an African-American would have the more difficult time of winning an election than perhaps a non African-American in the state of Illinois, though which was strange given the fact...",
