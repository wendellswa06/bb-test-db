        "And in this particular case, this guy got his guns legally.",

        "Again, I don't think we're going to overturn the power of the NRA tomorrow morning, but you're seeing among Senate Republicans a realization that they can't just do the same old thing.",
        "They are allowing a couple of votes in the wake of the Murphy-led filibuster.",

        "Right, and there's much reason to be skeptical about whether he will go beyond what the NRA already supports, which, as I say, would be ineffectual.",
        "But I think the fact that Trump felt a need or a desire to put that out suggests that he's well aware of this contradiction that his side is dealing with.",
        "We've seen a lot of prominent Republicans say this is not an issue about guns; it's an issue about terrorism.",
        "We don't have any evidence that the shooter in Orlando coordinated with any organized terrorist group, although he apparently did call 911 and pledge allegiance to ISIS.",
        "David, do you think there is a gap in America's terrorism policy here that needs to be filled?",
        "Well, I don't really fault the FBI and the people who screened him and didn't catch this.",
        "As I say, these are - these are extremely unusual cases, and it's very hard to predict human behavior.",
        "I think this is primarily a social and psychological problem.",
        "Whether it's the shootings of this sort or the shootings we've seen in Sandy Hook and elsewhere, it's always a lone male.",
        "It's always a guy who suffered some sort of injury, who's socially isolated, who's fallen through the cracks, who's decided to blame others rather than himself for the injury he's felt, who wants to feel some heroic sense of grandeur and grandiosity, grasps onto an ideology that justifies an act of violence and revenge on society.",
        "The pathways are pretty similar.",
        "And I think it's up to us as citizens to look around for, basically, young men in our midst and say, is this person potentially on that pathway?",
        "So is the counterterrorism step that needs to be taken just - if you see something, say something?",
        "Well, see, I - we could go on on this argument forever.",
        "There are - every country in the world has troubled, socially isolated people in it.",
        "We are the country that produces more events like this than any other.",

        "I think a lot of the people in leadership positions and certainly where Dr. Quatromoni at Boston University, an expert who works with athletes who have eating disorders, would say there's a lot of thought about how to think about nutrition.",
        "I was surprised at how little a lot of these elite athletes understood about nutrition.",
        "They were thinking in terms of I'm fat, I'm thin but not in terms of what do I need, nutritionally, to make my body most effective so I win."
