        "The brain now is still at Massachusetts General Hospital.",
        "It was removed the morning after Mr. Molaison's death.",
        "And it's presently being fixed in formalin.",
        "It was too delicate to be moved while it was still fresh.",
        "I see.",
        "And what are you going to do with - after it's fixed by the formalin, you'll move it to California.",
        "What are you going to do with it there?",
        "So, yes, as you said, you know that we had quite some time to plan.",
        "It was quite an exceptional project setup in advance, and to this we need to give credit to Dr. Corkin for thinking pretty much about everything, every possible detail about this project.",
        "And things are organized as such that when the brain is ready to be move here, the first step is a second round of MRI scans.",
        "The great thing about MRI is that it gives you an image of the brain - of the whole brain before it is, quote, \"\"destroyed,\"\" by the histological techniques.",
        "So, we...",
        "And histological - I'm just going to interrupt.",
        "So, histological techniques are this business of making slices of the brain so you can actually study the tissue.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So, MRI has this wonderful feature of being able to give you a volume representing an entire brain.",
        "The problem with MRI is resolution.",
        "So, still, the only way to be able to image structures or processes that are at the cellular level in a brain, we need to cut it into slices that are thin enough to be looked at under a microscope, pretty much.",
        "So, actually when I was flying to MGH the night that HM died, to be there for the autopsy, my colleagues were already running a scan of HM as if he were alive, get a final picture of the brain.",

        "We can tell people that stand...",
        "Yes, it's the acronym for the General.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So, why is it important to get this kind of precise - are you trying - I mean, obviously people have been able to study Mr. Molaison and his behavioral deficit and his learning deficit, his memory deficit.",

        "We - exactly because he was studied so extensively.",
        "So, we wanted to make sure that we understand what structures were removed, and by that infer what structures are important for the different aspects of memory, that the study of HM help to tease out.",
        "And this, of course, you know, if done at microscopic resolution, would give the information that we need to know exactly which - as these cognitive abilities have been teased out to see if there is a neural substrate for each of these different capabilities.",
        "So, in other words, you may be able to identify particular - I mean, we know that there was some damage during this surgical procedure that Mr. Molaison had, but - and we know in sort of a gross sense of where in the brain it is.",
        "But this is going to get you down to the level of almost - well, not exactly individual connections, but certainly very small sections of the brain.",
        "Well, certainly individuals cells so...",
        "Really?",
        "We'll be able to count the number of cells in the area that is around the lesion.",
        "But you know, when you take a - when you take out a piece, a structure, out of a brain, not only you create a deficit in a particular area, but you also affect the circuits that include that area.",
        "So, that's why we also wanted to have different approach.",
        "We wanted to slice the entire brain into giant histological sections so that we can navigate the brain in different areas and see what happened also to structures that we know are normally functionally connected to the medial temporal lobe, which is the area that suffered the lesion during the surgery.",
        "How big are these slices that you're making?",
        "The slices will be five-by-seven inches.",
        "It's a size of the - one of the picture frame, which is enough to accommodate the entire slice.",
        "We're talking with - I'm sorry, we're talking with Dr. Jacopo Annese about the work that's going to be done on the brain of HM, a famous amnesiac patient who died last week, and his brain is going to be, well, not dissected but inspected, we'll say...",
        "Inspected.",
        "Inspected to be - to see exactly what the nature of his deficit was and hope to understand how that affected his memory.",
        "I'm Joe Palca, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "One of the things about this project that I think is so fascinating is you're planning to do this, you know, almost under the public eye.",

        "When Hitler came to power in January of 1933, he immediately began his anti-Semitic policies.",
