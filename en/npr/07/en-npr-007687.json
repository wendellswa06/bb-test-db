        "But before too long, Slava's assisting with more and more of these counterfeit briefs with people in the neighborhood, producing beautifully narrated sequences about Jewish life amidst Nazi horror that just doesn't happen to be the experience of most of the people who are filing them.",
        "Slava finds himself torn between his loyalty to these old Russians and his worries about breaking the law by forging the claims.",
