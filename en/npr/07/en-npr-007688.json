        "Congressman Murtha, when you talk about redeploying to the periphery, what role would U.S.",
        "troops be playing then?",
        "Well, I would say we would have about the same number of troops in Kuwait that we have now, because they're logistic support, and we'd reduce our fighting forces substantially - send them back even to the United States because we really don't need that large a force.",
        "If something happens, then, that affects our national security - I'm not talking about the civil war now between the Iraqis, I'm talking about our national security or our allies' national security - we're not deserting the Middle East.",
        "We're just providing more stability in the Middle East.",
        "That's the key thing.",
        "It's unstable the way it is.",
        "It's gotten worse every day.",
        "And when you think about - they say well, there's cell phones, there's this, that and the other -there's only four-and-a-half hours of electricity in Baghdad right now, and of course less oil production than there was when Saddam Hussein was there.",
        "And terrorism has increased substantially, so…",
        "Since this would be a phased withdrawal, what about the safety of the troops who would be left behind as this phased withdrawal is taking place?",
        "Well, the military - if you tell the military that they have to have a phased withdrawal, there's no question they could do it.",
        "You have to do it the right way.",
        "You can't do it precipitously.",
        "When I call - my resolution says we should redeploy as soon as practicable, and that means involving the safety of our troops.",
        "And so that's the key.",
        "And then you initially have our troops on the periphery in case they had to go back in for a short period of time to protect our troops, and I don't think that would - I think that would send a signal that the Iraqis have to take over their government themselves, and I think in the long run it's the only answer.",
        "It's not a matter of are we going to get out.",
        "It's just a matter of when and how we're going to get out, and I think my plan is the one that'll be - the American people have certainly endorsed it because the vast majority of the American people say $8 billion a month is depleting our resources substantially, and we need to change the direction of this country.",
        "Congressman Murtha, the study group we were talking about earlier - the bipartisan commission - I've read is likely to recommend that the U.S.",
        "bring Iran and Syria into discussions on Iraq.",
        "Do you agree with that?",
        "I agree with that.",
        "I think you have to talk to your enemies as well as your friends.",
        "One of the problems this administration's had, it doesn't even talk to Republicans, let alone Democrats.",
        "And now they're beginning to talk to Democrats, and I think that's a major problem.",
        "His father, Bush One - when he was president, he talked to everybody.",
        "He listened to everybody.",
        "He brought the allies into it.",
        "As a matter of fact, the cost of the first war - the '91 war - was $60 billion dollars, paid for by our allies.",
        "There was 170,000 troops in the coalition versus 500,000 American troops, so we went with overwhelming force.",
        "We know what the goal was.",
        "We went up, we took them out of Kuwait.",
        "We didn't go into Iraq because we didn't want to occupy.",
        "So he's now got people who were involved in that first war who understand the policy who are involved now, and I think - I'm hopeful we'll see a change in policy.",
        "You know, there's been a lot of talk since the election about the two parties working together.",
        "First of all, how united are the Democrats on the positions you've just been laying out?",
        "We have people like Senator Lieberman, for instance, who would not agree with what you're saying.",
        "You also have Republican leaders like Senator John McCain who not only would not support troop withdrawals, but in fact wants more troops in Iraq.",
        "You've got a lot of different ideas up there.",
        "How are you going to bring this all together?",
        "How are you going to make it work?"

        "The American public has spoken.",
        "When I first spoke out, less than half the people opposed this war.",
        "Now it's up 70 to 80 percent, depending on who you talk to and how you pose the question.",
        "So, when the public speaks, you have to have a change in direction and we have to work it out.",
        "Now, there's no question that the major thing they're saying is we want our troops to be withdrawn because most people believe it's a civil war.",
        "It's the Sunnis fighting the Shias, and we're targets.",
        "We're caught in between.",
        "That's the key issue that has to be answered.",

        "Now, most people begin to recognize that's really the first step towards stability.",
        "So, you know, you always have ideas that have to be changed some.",
        "I'm willing to look at any other idea, but I really think that the first step towards stability - not deserting the Middle East, not deserting Iraq - but the first step is to redeploy our troops and let the Shias and Sunnis work it out because that's in the best interest of the United States' foreign policy.",
        "Let me ask you another question about the politics of this.",
        "Over the weekend, you received a letter of support from the presumptive Speaker of the House to be, Nancy Pelosi.",

        "Is this kind of intra-party infighting going to in any way undermine the Democrats' ability to influence policy on Iraq?",
        "It won't influence it at all.",
        "The White House for the first time wants to talk to me, it wants to listen to my ideas.",
        "No, I think it's the opposite.",
        "I think by Thursday this will be behind us and we'll go forward, and I think as long as the administration understands staying the course is not the answer the American public - and they understand.",
        "The American public's spoken.",
        "As I said, I've spoke out for a year and had some impact, but when the votes came in, they began to see that something needs to be done.",

        "What is your reaction to that?",
        "Do you support that?",
        "Well, of course, we all want to be able to withdraw our troops in a reasonable time and under - actually, the most - the quickest timetable possible.",
        "The question is how we do that, and if by phased redeployment they mean an arbitrary timetable, I think that's a mistake.",
        "If they mean creating stability in Iraq so that the country doesn't descend into either sectarian civil war or turn it over to al-Qaida and the former Baathists, then I think that's a basis upon which to have conversation and try to reach consensus.",

        "Al-Sadr is entrenched in al-Maliki's government with 23-something seats in the parliament.",
        "I mean, how do you think that we should deal with him?",
        "It's obvious that if we oust him out of the government that we delegitimize that government, and because he was democratically elected - but he and most of his death squads are entrenched in the National Guard, the police, and they're the ones doing most of the death squad and killings and kidnaps.",

        "Let's let the Senator respond.",
        "Thanks so much for your question, Matt.",
        "That's a great question.",

        "It's unfortunately one of many problems.",
        "But I think clearly the government of Iraq needs to gain a monopoly on the use of force, and right now you have militias vying for that authority in the streets and the government not asserting itself.",
        "So one way or the other, either through the political process or through disarming al-Sadr and his militias, the government needs to gain a monopoly on the use of force in order to provide some stability in the region.",
        "And unfortunately, as we all know, that has not happened.",
        "Sectarian violence is not the only problem, as you said, but it's certainly one of the biggest problems.",
        "And, you know, what ideas do you have for solving that, given that there's a great deal of mistrust on the part of Sunnis toward the Shiite-dominated government?",
        "Can the government really get a handle on that sectarian violence?",
        "I don't know the answer to that completely, but I do know that as long as you have the government with trained policeman and with trained soldiers and at the same time have these armed militias which are accountable to no one except for their leaders like al-Sadr, that it is an untenable situation.",
        "And so these militias need to be disarmed either by use of force or by bringing them into the political process.",
        "This is not - I think Mr. Murtha and I would agree on one thing and that is, this is not something that the United States can force Iraq to do.",
        "This is something they need to do for themselves.",
        "We need to use all measures available to us to encourage them to step up and make the hard decisions and to bring the violence there and the instability to a close.",

        "They may well just be staking out starting positions for negotiations, but I fear that the Iraq war has been so divisive and polarizing in this country, including in Washington - especially in Washington - that we may find that the majority of Democrats and the White House simply have no common ground on this.",
        "And we will have this fought out in speeches and in hearings for the next six months without any real change in policy because there's no common ground for them to change the policy on.",

        "Well, I'm not quite sure what he meant by periphery.",
        "When you asked him, he said, well, we'll keep our logistics troops in Kuwait at the same numbers and the rest can go home.",
        "At least that's what I heard him say, which sounds less like redeploying to the periphery than simply getting out of the region with all except maybe a few brigades left in Kuwait."
