        "And if that's the case, then it really is an abandonment of the Middle East.",
        "I think he's a little blithe about his assumptions of what would happen in that case.",
        "He says that if we leave, there will be greater stability because we are the main force of the chaos.",
        "I simply don't think that's true anymore.",
        "It may well have been true in the first year or two of the war, but now it's a civil war in which we're playing the role, essentially, of the buffer or the lid.",
        "And without us, I think it simply widens dramatically - the number of killings go up dramatically.",
        "And we are no longer in a position to do anything about it, and we're watching.",
        "And that has, I think, a devastating effect on the Iraqi people, of course, but also on the way the world sees the United States.",
        "So I think to say that redeploying will create greater stability is simply wishful thinking.",
        "It's a way to make that policy more palatable.",
        "I think if someone's going to make that argument about redeployment, they should be very honest about what the likely consequences on the ground in Iraq are.",
        "A lot of hope is sort of being pinned on this bipartisan commission, which met today with the president.",
        "But do you really expect that they're going to be able to come up with some startlingly new strategy or solution that hasn't already been followed?",
        "No.",
        "And I think they may be somewhat staggered by the amount of expectation that has steadily accumulated on their report.",
        "I mean, when they were announced by Congress earlier this year hardly anyone took notice.",
        "And suddenly it seems as if the entire body politic is waiting for their report so that we can move.",
        "And in the meantime we're utterly paralyzed in Iraq.",
        "But there is no answer that no one has thought of.",
        "There is no magic bullet.",
        "And they said that when I met with them on a panel of journalists in Washington about a month ago.",
        "They know that there is simply no easy way to fix this.",
        "My guess is that they will come up with something like a proposal to tie our continued support for the Iraqi government, which includes reconstruction money, troop levels and the functions of those troops, especially in the training and advising of Iraqi forces.",
        "They will attach conditions to the continuation of that support, and those conditions will be that there be a real movement toward a political settlement among the factions in Iraq.",
        "At this point they're barely talking to each other, and that will require the involvement of the neighbors.",
        "My guess is it will be somewhere between stay the course and withdraw.",
        "But that has to have a time on it, and if in X number of months the Iraqi factions show that they're incapable of a settlement, which is quite possible, then I don't see an alternative to beginning to pull out American troops.",
        "We're talking with George Packer, author of Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq.",

        "I believe that it will bring something constructive, perhaps in the sense that it will help to sort out the regional divisions and religious and ethnic divisions.",
        "And there is an immediate precedent, for instance, with the Balkans in which at the end it seemed to be what people wanted to have.",
        "I think also that it is a practical way to sort of keep the soldiers there until a particular period of time, and at the same time have a deadline.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "could bring something constructive in terms of organizing that and bring a complete package of reorganization and reconstruction.",
        "All right, Pablo.",

        "Now, if it came with oil, then perhaps you can talk about it.",
        "But what I've said earlier still holds.",
        "There needs to be a political negotiation which all the key issues - oil, federalism, militias, de-Baathification and the status of Kirkuk are on the table.",
        "And if the Iraqis at the end of that negotiation decide that they're going to have three autonomous regions so be it.",

        "troops, for instance?",
        "I'm sure that the Baker Hamilton Commission is going to call for that.",
        "They have been utterly mystified why this administration has seemed to want to do it alone and has never really made a serious effort to bring the neighbors, the Europeans and others, into Iraq.",

        "It may be too late.",
        "Why would European countries, or Muslim countries, want to send troops into a civil war or want to pour money down what looks like a rat hole in Iraq?",
        "I think it may be too late to get them to.",
        "However, the Iranians and the Syrians do have interests, and they themselves cannot contemplate Iraq in a full-blown civil war without some concern.",
        "And so that is the leverage we can use to try to get them into the negotiations.",
        "They're not going to bail us out, but they may find that their own interests and ours coincide at some of these peripheral areas, and that seems to be the only hope for bringing them into a settlement.",
        "Without them, I don't think there can be a settlement.",
        "And just one last question.",

        "I think it will change.",

        "I talked to him in that meeting I had with the Iraq study group, and he asked some very skeptical questions about the way things are going.",
