        "But I look at myself as environmental technician - you know, brewing has been around for thousands of years and what we've learned over this time is that Mother Nature's a wonderful thing.",
        "And if we take these raw materials that Mother Nature gives us and put them in a very specific environment that they have to behave in a certain way.",
        "They're never going to let you down.",
        "And that's quite frankly what we do.",
        "We take this for the most part, malted barley and malting is a process where the barley is wetted, allowed to germinate to a certain point.",
        "Then that growth is arrested by the use of heat, which activates all sorts of biochemical systems in the barley and make it a lot more suitable for what we want to accomplish in a brewing process and it makes it taste a lot better.",
        "And then, what do you do?",
        "What happens?",
        "What's this process?",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm Phil.",
        "How are you?",
        "We take this barley and basically ground it up, mix it with water, make an infusion of mash, a porridge per se.",
        "Hit a series of temperature steps to break down complex substances, taking advantage of enzymes that are actually present in the barley to cause breakdowns of complex things such as starch into simpler forms.",
        "And in the case of starch, simpler sugars that the yeast could eat.",
        "When you see the kettles associated with a brew house, we don't make beer in that particular - those vessels, we make a fermentable liquid called wort.",
        "And then we cool this wort, oxygenate it and it's over to Dr. Ryder's department.",

        "The difference between a ale and a lager would be the yeast.",

        "That is the...",

        "We've seen now the commercials are all showing, it's hops.",

        "Any of you want to...",
        "Yeah, well I can - perhaps I can start on that.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "There are five things which actually hops do generally.",
        "First, they were first used because of their antimicrobial properties, stopping nasty things from actually growing in beer.",
        "Beer is actually safer than water.",
        "You know, water can harbor nasty microorganisms such as salmonella or shigella or even cryptosporidium.",
        "But beer never does that because, partly because of the hops.",
        "So, the antimicrobial properties are very good.",
        "Then it has flavor, mouth feel, sort of bitterness and also aroma.",
        "So, hops are very, very important to the overall, you know, makeup and the flavor of the beer.",

        "I think it's a combination.",
        "I think also, when you get to larger breweries like Miller, there may be more trade secrets than when you get to the craft industry where they tend to share information a lot more readily and in fact, share raw materials, they'll, you know, trade malts.",
        "They'll trade hops.",
        "So, there're less trade secrets.",

        "The oldest known recipe for a foodstuff ever found is a 7,000-year-old recipe from ancient Mesopotamia for beer.",
        "So back then, we didn't understand science like we understand it today, but as time, you know, went on, we became a little more educated, let's say, as a species, and in terms of beer making, sure it's an art.",
        "You have to develop a feel for how to put these, you know, raw materials together, but as you learn more about the science, the biochemistry, the specifics behind it, it can help you in your art, and help you know how to modify the situation you're dealing in, and try to make a better glass of beer.",
        "What's the difference between beer and malt liquor?",
        "That's a governmental designation from the United States, where at one time any beer that was more than five, or five and a half percent alcohol by weight, it was called, it was called malt liquor, and that kind of morphed into today what's considered a relatively inexpensive beer with a lot of syrups in it that give a lot of alcohol kick per se, but not a whole lot of malted barley flavor, and the alcohol can vary quite a bit.",
        "And some of these new drinks in bottles, these hard sort of drinks, people think they're actually drinking alcohol, when they're drinking malt liquor, right, hard alcohol when they're drinking malt liquor.",
        "Is that correct, David?",
        "Well, so, you know, malt liquor is really, as Kirby said, it's just designation of beer, and it's just slightly higher in alcohol content than, you know, say, your normal beer, such as, say Miller Lite, Coors Light, Bud Light, which are about 4.2 percent alcohol by volume.",

        "Why is it called light?",
        "What makes it different than the other beers?",
        "Well, in...",
        "Is it just calories in the beer?",
        "Well, in this country, and I have to specify, it's this country, it's calories and carbohydrates, so you're low in calories, and you're low in carbohydrates, but in other countries, such as Australia, such as the U.K., where I originate from, it can mean lower in alcohol, but here in the States, we don't do very low alcohol beers."
