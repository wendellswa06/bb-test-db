        "Lyn, as someone who tastes light beer, is there real difference in taste between them?",
        "Between different brands of light beer, or between light beer and regular beer?",
        "Take your choice.",
        "OK, I think, depending on which light beers.",
        "Light beers generally tend to taste fairly similar.",
        "I would think there are some that are different, and they certainly taste quite different from a regular beer.",
        "For example, if you talk about, you know, Bud and Bud Light, or Miller and Miller Lite, there is a difference in the body, the mouth feel, and in this case, the alcohol concentration is slightly different as well.",

        "Thank you, thank you for being with us today, Mr. Shepard.",
        "My pleasure, thank you.",
        "Let me ask you this question about Wisconsin, and maybe Milwaukee.",
        "You've written a guide to the local breweries.",
        "How did you get started in this venture?",
        "Was this something you just wanted to go around sampling, or was it an academic?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, at one time, it was all organic, way back when the United - when Wisconsin first started brewing beer, we - all the beer made here was organic, because it was made without any heavy fertilizers, or pesticides on it, and in 1996, we became the first brewery in the country to make an organic beer under our own label, and so, it's a little bit challenging with it.",
        "Did they blow you out of the room or did you survive?",
        "There were also reasons of vanity in some cases.",
        "Well, it does definitely start with, where can I get a good beer and a good meal to go with it, and - but, I'm probably like a lot of folks, maybe a few in the audience where, you know, you begin to get fascinated by what your panel does in the way of the products they make, and I can remember standing in a small little brewpub, and actually on - looking out over, sort of, the Green Bay area, one evening late at night, and it was just me and a work colleague there, and lo and behold, the person on - across in that bar, was the owner of the little brewpub, and he started talking to us about the different styles, and the different flavors, and I was probably hooked from that point on.",
        "It went from there to, like what a lot of beer enthusiasts do, you know, you squirrel away a coaster from time to time, you take a menu home, after the great dinner, you know, and next thing, you know, in my house, I had a couple of file cabinets, filled with beer memorabilia."

        "Wow!",
        "So, you seem to have sample thousands of beers then.",
        "I'd hate to have to put a number on it, Ira.",
        "So, have you, in all that time, have you found a favorite?",
        "Well, you know, I got to admit, wherever I'm at, probably is the answer of the day, but in reality, no, I hope I don't find that favorite one, because I love the journey, that pursuit of good beer, good food, the culture of what you see along the way, and particularly, the brew masters.",
        "In another life, I was a broadcast news reporter, and I learned very quickly that everybody has a fascinating story, and in the brewing industry, some of those stories are indeed very fascinating.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So, what is fascinating then about this area, about Wisconsin, that made it the beer capital?",
        "Well, you don't have to go too far.",
        "The Great Lakes were one big reason.",
        "It was really almost a clash of both the culture and the natural resource base, is what made us a beer state, and in particular, Milwaukee.",
        "If you think about the Great Lakes for water, for ice, for storage, some of these - the older breweries, that have been here, have actually restored their caves where they would have stored ice and beer to lager, before the mechanical refrigeration came on line.",
        "We also, in Wisconsin, folks may not realize it, but we have a strong forestry industry, and you need - you have companion development that happens with a brewery, the cooperage industry, those people who made barrels.",
        "We had a lot of forest in the state, in fact, to this day.",
        "We're over 45 percent forested in Wisconsin.",
        "Then you couple that with our heritage of who came here.",
        "In 1850, our state population was somewhere around 300,000.",
        "Of that, about a third of that population base were foreign born, and of that number, about half were Irish, and then there was a big German contingent.",
        "All of that, that European heritage, where beer was part of who they were, they brought with it.",
        "If you look at some of the early manifests of the brewers themselves that made Pabst and Miller, and some of the small town breweries, they listed brewer on their manifest when they immigrated to this country.",
        "So, the culture, combined with the natural resources, we also were a state that could produce a lot of barley in the 1800s, and we were once the leading state for the production of hops, prior to Prohibition.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And my question for the panel is, I am an avid home brewer, considering a career change, and I was just wondering if I wanted to get into professional brewing, how am I to go about that?",
        "How do you turn a hobby into a business is what you're asking, right?",
        "Precisely.",
        "All right, well, I can, maybe, start off.",
        "We are, in fact, a brewing school, and one thing that you can do is get a, you know, formal brewing education.",
        "We have, probably half our diploma class this year were home brewers looking to change profession, to become professional brewers, so we offer a lot of different programs and courses from introductory to, you know, to diploma level, to actually give you the training and education you would need to make that transition at Siebel Institute.",

        "Yes.",
        "Is that more challenging to do than - what's the difference?",
        "We see organic on the labels of everything now.",
        "Why shouldn't beer all be organic?",
        "You use - the grain is a little bit smaller in size.",
        "You have to crush it a little bit differently.",
        "The hops - there's not as quite of a wide variety of hops; when you style a type of beer, you want to make sure the style is matching with the style of hops.",
        "Yeah, it was a - it's almost a unprecedented time for us in the industry in terms of, we're getting hit, just besides fuel cost, you know, going through the roof, also on grain cost and hop.",
        "For many, many years, there was a glut of alpha acid; the bittering compound that we achieve out of hops is called alpha acids, and this can be cut in - put in an extract form that'll keep for quite a while, and from what I understand, there was a lot of extract in the market for a long time.",
        "Combine that with hop farmers getting beaten up very badly for price.",
        "We went from well over 200 hop growers in this country in the '80s down to 45, and in the last year, we had, I would say a biblical-type set of events happening.",
        "There was a - one of the hop companies in this country had a huge warehouse fire that destroyed four percent of the alpha acid, I believe, that was available in this country, perhaps the world.",
        "The British hop crop was in tough shape, in the steering region that grows a lot of hops in the weekend, two out of three days, got destroyed by hail all over the place.",
        "There were issues, and all of a sudden, we went from hops being, for example, the classic American hop Cascade, I was paying three-thirty a pound for this, a couple of years ago.",
        "This June, if folks can get it off of, you know, market, in that contract, it's going to be up to 50 dollars a pound.",
        "And it was a combination of many things, and let's say, well, let's just plant more hops.",
        "Ironically, I believe it takes three years for a hop field to get into full production, so there's a turnaround time here, and it is going to flatten out as we've been contracting for hops.",
        "I've noticed that they're asking us to contract out for quite a few varieties five years out, and the price is dropping on an annual basis, so I believe, the hop shortage is a short-term thing."
