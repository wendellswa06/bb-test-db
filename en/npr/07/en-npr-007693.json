        "David Ryder, did you want to say something?",
        "No, you know, I think that the American hops, we use 100 percent American hops at Miller, and I think the hop varieties here in the states, states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho right now, are, you know, absolutely superb hops, but you know, Kirby is right.",
        "He gave you the history, and the prices are very, very high right now.",
        "In fact, for some varieties, some, you know, very specific varieties, you can pay up to about 500 dollars a pound, because they're so scarce.",
        "How do you make - you make an awful lot of beer every year, right?",
        "And would that be - how do you keep it so consistent to stay exactly, to taste the same, with all those batches that you make?",
        "Well, I think as the whole panel will actually tell you, you know, the, right the first time, if you're going to make say, the Miller Lite, which is a single wort stream, and to make it right the first time is actually very difficult because you're doing it batch after batch, you know, you're doing it brewery after brewery.",
        "In our case, we've got six major breweries across the country.",
        "So it's not an easy thing to do.",
        "But with the right procedures and the right quality, and all the panel are very experienced in those things, then you can certainly do it.",

        "Is there a holy grail of beer that hasn't been achieved yet?",
        "Something that you'd like to make, and you would like to figure out, have a certain consistency and - Russ, you're sort of laughing at me here, like, what is he talking about?",
        "That's like saying all the music's been invented.",
        "There's always something out there you can take and right about now, there's a lot of different styles of beers being made without the four major ingredients.",
        "But do you have to craft it for a new generation of drinkers?",
        "I mean the kids who are going to be the new beer drinkers, do they have to have something different that their grandparents didn't have, or some sort of attraction to the drink?",
        "Well, you're always looking for a new ingredient or something that gives it a little different style or type to it.",
        "But you know, beer's been around for 600 years or so.",
        "And it's been a pretty successful beverage in most periods of time.",

        "I survived.",
        "And it was absolutely one of the most exciting and exhilarating experiences that I've ever had.",
        "It was tremendous.",
        "Yes, I think perhaps I could answer that, and we've actually forgotten the kinds of beer styles that used to be in existence.",
        "There are hundreds, thousands of beer styles that used to be made, and that are just not made anymore.",
        "And I think it's a challenge to all of us to sometimes go back in time, and to look at some of those older beer styles.",
        "And could I just, could make a comment to the question that was asked earlier about sort of education in brewing.",
        "I'm a biochemist, and a bit of a microbiologist, and so on.",
        "We always have places for biochemists and chemists and microbiologists."

        "And I just wonder, I don't know if it's made that way anymore, now that Miller's making it.",
        "But I wonder, is all beer made, you know, using heat, and if not, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using heat or not using heat?",
        "Did they ever tell you, Doug, what fire brewing meant?",
        "Well, they, I know they had, you know, that you would see - I never made it to the brewery before they tore it down unfortunately.",
        "But you know, they would - you could drive by and see these big copper kettles right in the window.",
        "And apparently, the beer was brewed, you know, was actually heated during the brewing process.",
        "Let me see if I can get an answer.",
        "Anybody know what fire brewing is?",
        "Yes.",
        "First of all, in the preparation of wort, which Kirby was explaining earlier, you have to use heat.",
        "You use heat in the mash tun, you use heat in the lauter tun, in the kettle and so on.",
        "And so heat is always used.",
        "But as the fire brewing for Stroh refers to the kind of heat that was used.",
        "You have these gigantic flames underneath these particular vessels that were being heated up, where the wort was boiled.",
        "And that was what was called, sort of, fire brewing.",
        "You can use steam coils.",
        "You can use other types of heat.",
        "But Stroh particularly used fire brewing with these gigantic flames.",

        "Oh, when you're using a flame, it's much hotter per se, as it's hitting the vessel.",

        "For example, we were on contract brewing, making beer for another brewery as they were undergoing growing pains.",
        "And they had a flame-heated kettle.",
        "We have steam.",
        "We had to compensate for us using steam than using fire by adding some caramel malt to the recipe to compensate for this different type of heat.",

        "You know, once a beer is put into bottles or cans, it starts to age.",
        "And aging, unlike wine, is not good for beers.",
        "So you need to drink beer as fresh as you possibly can.",
