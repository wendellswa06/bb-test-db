        "Really is.",
        "It gives you the tactile properties of the beer, you know, and which is why in this country, if you pour a beer too cold, and particularly down the side of a glass, you're not going to get any foam.",
        "And that's a shame, because brewers put a lot of effort and all the people here in the panel here put a lot of effort to actually make beer with good foam.",
        "And Lyn's right.",
        "The CO2 in the beer will actually give you foam.",

        "Which means, when something's too cold, the flavor doesn't come through.",
        "And milder American beers were eventually looked at as, at least from my standpoint, being a very, very thirst-quenching liquid.",
        "And their flavor became milder over time as they became more mass marketed.",
        "So again, it became more of a very pleasant chilled sensation.",
        "And so it was sort of a marketing technique thing?",
        "Again, someone once said the best way to mass market something is to offend the least number of people possible.",
        "And so beers were made you know, very, very well made.",
