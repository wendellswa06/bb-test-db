        "The president has defended his secretary, and after the charges surfaced, a second group of generals emerged to support Secretary Rumsfeld and attack his critics as opponents of military transformation, and in some cases, as officers trying to deflect blame for their own mistakes.",
        "Beyond the substance of the case, many in uniform and out question the circumstances.",
        "It is highly unusual for even retired military officers to criticism civilian leadership in public, especially in time of war.",
