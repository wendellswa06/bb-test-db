        "Well I think it's a threat in if tomorrow Rumsfeld announces that he has resigned, regardless of what the president says, it will be understood that he was fired.",
        "Regardless of what the president says, it will be understood that he was fired because he fell out of favor with senior officers.",
        "And, in effect, we will have created a situation in which future secretaries of defense will be seen to be serving at the pleasure of the generals, in which secretaries will impart the appointed based on whether or not they are perceived to be acceptable to military officers.",
        "In which, senior officials will have to be looking their shoulders to try to make sure that they are--that they are satisfying general officers and again, that's not civilian control.",
        "It would transform America's system of diversity in immigration into an India-first policy of immigration.",
        "That is something other than civilian control and going all the way back to the founding of this republic and the modeling done by General George Washington, civilian control has been a paramount value.",

        "This is all about accountability and there is no leader in any organization I've ever seen who's indispensable.",
        "If I had been killed or wounded as a commander of the First Infantry Division in Iraq, there would have been a replacement identified instantaneously and that major general, in that division, would not have missed a beat.",

        "I did it because it's the right thing to do.",

        "MAJ.",
        "GEN.",
        "DAVIDSON: It is, but again, I think we need to encourage them to do this for this reason: If the war was going well, we would be nominating Rumsfeld for sainthood."

        "This past presidential campaign, both presidential candidates surrounded themselves with a coterie of former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs.",
        "I think a point well made that really, in my judgment, this latest flap is really indicative of a much larger problem with civil military relations.",

        "He should go, but it's not the business of generals to hold him accountable.",
        "Quite frankly, I have my problems with the performance of the senior military leadership in Iraq.",
        "And it seems to me that recently retired senior military leaders might do a better job of trying to bring constructive criticism on the performance of the military itself, rather than simply targeting the failure of Secretary Rumsfeld.",

        "At the same time, we live in a democratic republic and without people standing up to let us know what's going on, neither Congress nor the public is aware of these issues.",
        "And so it is a fine line to walk between when you speak up and when you don't.",
        "Throughout our history this hasn't been a practice that you see all the time; it is very rare and that's one of the reasons why it gives an impetus to really listening to what these generals have to say and, personally, as a citizen, as an ex-military, I served in the United States Army during Vietnam, and I'm just really proud of these gentlemen for standing up.",
        "But most importantly as an American citizen, I know that by them standing up and taking a position they create the opportunity for that middle ground that some of your guests have referred back to again.",
        "Perhaps, there is the opportunity to make constructive change and that opportunity would not exist if these generals had not taken the initiative.",
        "Andrew Bacevich, if the generals don't talk, how do we know something's wrong?",
        "Thank you.",
        "I mean, maybe I'm living on another planet, but the one I'm on suggests that about two-thirds of the American people had decided that this war was misguided and bungled long before any of these generals spoke out.",
        "We don't need retired military officers to tell us when our policies are going awry.",
        "Andrew Bacevich, thanks very much for being with us today.",
