        "The two Americas that we kept hearing about during the presidential campaign are nose to nose in Congress.",
        "Whether people see Trump as keeping his promises or shredding the Constitution depends on which of those two Americas lawmakers represent, and each side believes the other is missing the real story, as NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis reports.",
        "When asked to sum up his first impressions of the Trump presidency, Idaho Republican Raul Labrador pointed to a piece of wisdom he read on Twitter.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "I saw a tweet this morning that I think encapsulated how we should all feel as Republicans.",
        "This is the first time in American history that people are complaining that a president is keeping his promises.",
        "For conservatives like Labrador, that is exactly what Trump is doing.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "He told us what he was going to do when he was running for president.",
        "He said exactly what he was going to do.",
        "There's no secrets about what he wanted to do, and he has done it at a expeditious rate.",
        "Trump's executive orders to build the wall and temporarily halt the flow of refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, as well as his nomination last night of conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, have all galvanized his political opposition.",
        "There have been spontaneous protests across the country, and Democratic leaders in Congress like California's Linda Sanchez speak plainly of their contempt for the president's actions.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Donald Trump has essentially stepped into office and shredded the Constitution.",
        "And I searched mightily to try to characterize what the first 10 days of his presidency have been like, and the only words that come to mind are dumpster fire."

        "It's yet another example that when it comes to Trump, Democrats and Republicans are often living in parallel universes.",
        "And in Republican's universe, Trump's actions are cause for celebration, like in Republican Scott Perry's predominantly white working class district in central Pennsylvania.",
        "He says his office has been flooded with calls of support.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "By and large most of the people that contact the office are very invigorated by what they see.",

        "It's what they came to rallies for.",
        "And once again, the president is fulfilling promises.",
        "The fact that maybe it's not as smooth as many of us would like to see or maybe we're used to seeing, I think, also underscores the fact that he's operating without a full team.",
        "Most Republican frustration is over how Trump's immigration orders were rolled out, not on the bottom line of what they aim to do.",
        "Speaker Paul Ryan said the confusion over the weekend regarding Trump's immigration orders was, in his words, regrettable, but he said Republicans agree on the end goal.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "So what is happening is something that we support which is we need to pause, and we need to make sure that the vetting standards are up to snuff so we can guarantee the safety and security of our country.",
        "That is what this does.",
        "The first national poll conducted after Trump issued the travel ban finds more Americans support his immigration decisions than oppose them.",
        "That's consistent with past polling that indicates the public is generally supportive of tougher vetting standards for foreign visitors, and it's why Republicans like Pennsylvania's Lou Barletta shrug off Democratic protests as tone deaf.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "It's actually making him stronger among those who voted for him which were not all just Republicans, they were Democrats as well as independents.",
        "So, you know, for the Democrat Party who is - would hope to win back their own Democrats and the independents, they may be actually pushing them even further away.",
        "Barletta is part of the Tea Party class that swept into power on a promise to shake up Washington.",
        "For the first time, he says, they're starting to feel like they're delivering."

        "That project wasn't going to work out.",

        "And I think what we loved about them is that there were these sort of blue-collar working class people working in space and they were very much character-centric films about what it would be like to be in that kind of environment.",
        "And so these were all films not only character-centric but, generally, I think, some alone character or one or two people somehow marooned in space.",
        "They tended to be, and they also tended to be about sort of that first generation of spacefarers or people who were sort of pioneering living in space.",

        "So you developed the story for this film.",
        "I did.",

        "So that's an interesting point.",
        "Right at the very beginning of the film, we see this - what's happening on the moon as helium-3 is being mined and shipped back to Earth, and I wondered whether there was some real science there.",
        "There is a little bit.",
        "I mean, that's basically kind of - Robert Zubrin's book is really where I got that initial concept from.",
        "And the interesting and slightly eerie fact is that the moon does hold a huge - a vast concentration of helium-3 on the surface, basically impregnated into the first few feet of the lunar regolith.",
        "And it's, you know, you could literally just harvest it up, cook that lunar regolith to release the gas, and then compress it into a liquid form and send it back to Earth.",
