        "I mean, they had about 9,000 samples.",

        "I mean, what are some of the theories for how the fluctuations in the climate could have contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire?",
        "Well, you know, the Roman Empire was a large empire.",
        "And like any large civilization, including the civilization we have today, it was highly dependent on predictability of natural resources; the predictability of water supply, the predictability of food resources.",
        "It was very heavily adapted to the climate conditions that had persisted for centuries.",
        "So whenever you have unpredictable and dramatic changes in climate, you're likely to see challenges such as those that led presumably to the fall of the Roman Empire."
