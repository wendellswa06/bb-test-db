        "Mayor Borane, welcome to DAY TO DAY.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Well, first of all, reacting to that interview with Yuma's mayor, he said that the so-called OTMs, Other Than Mexicans - many people coming from places like Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan - I believe he was implying that there is a terrorist threat at the border.",

        "And our southernmost street and their northernmost street are separated by that same international boundary.",
        "We depend almost 100 percent on the economy from - not only from that sister city, but from other cities near the border.",
        "On any given day, you know, one-third of their population will be over here and one-third of our population will be over there.",
        "So we have a completely different perspective because we consider ourselves one bilingual, bicultural community.",
        "We just heard from the Yuma mayor who represents a lot of feelings in this country, people who live further north than you do.",
        "And they think, Well, I'm sorry that you may suffer economically, but we're suffering, too -economically - and we're afraid of an increase in crime and attacks on social services with all these illegal immigrants.",
        "So what do you propose to allay their fears and concerns?",
        "Well, you know, a lot of times my philosophy and attitudes towards this whole situation - which has been molded over the last eight years - is completely different because my constituent's well-being and their livelihood is why they put me in office.",
        "They're not that concerned about all of the other ramifications of illegal immigration.",
        "And we're very concerned that, you know, we're all loyal Americans and we're all concerned about terrorism and people coming through here illegally."
