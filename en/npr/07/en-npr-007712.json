        "Well, the first thing is that that document you're referring to, which was put out in 2004, was entitled \"\"Catholic Politicians and Politics.\"\" And the canon lawyers I consulted on that said that it applies to people like Ted Kennedy or Nancy Pelosi, or maybe even Vice President Biden, in the sense that these people say, I am vigorously pro-life, as my party is, and I'm also a good Catholic, and I can do that.",
        "That's one kind of thing.",
        "Mr. Obama is not a Catholic, and I don't think that statement by the bishops - however wise or unwise it was - applies to him at all.",
        "He is, after all, the president of the United States.",
        "And I think any university would be very proud to have him speak.",
        "So, you would say he should be invited even if he was a Catholic who held pro-choice views?",
        "Well, I say - then I think the university is in a little different situation.",
        "No, I'm not saying that.",
        "I - look, I'm a Notre Dame graduate.",
        "I vote independently.",
        "And I have, on occasion, voted for a president or a senator or a congressperson primarily because of their pro-life stand, when other issues don't seem to be as important.",
        "So, I'm very concerned about where the president stands on this.",
        "But I think that Catholicism is not a church that shuns the world.",
        "And therefore, should engage the president, and they will, because - let me add from that piece, as I noted - when he comes to speak, he won't be the only speaker.",
        "The awardee of the day, of the nation - I mean, of the university's highest honor, the Laetare Medal, goes to Professor Mary Ann Glendon of Harvard Law School and recent U.S.",
        "ambassador to the Vatican.",
        "She has written wonderfully, in a wonderful depth, on the abortion issue, and she is very pro-life.",
        "So, he's going to have to listen to her.",
        "That's the kind of engagement I'm looking for.",
        "You wrote that some alumni, especially Republicans, are threatening to withhold contributions and bequests.",
        "Are you suggesting that this is politically motivated, that these people…",
        "Oh, Neal, listen.",
        "Our class has been talking by email about this election since way before it took place.",
        "And it just - if our class is any example, the majority of these people who are objecting are very conservative Republicans who get most of their news from Fox News.",
        "We know that because we took a poll, where do you get your news.",
        "So - and if they had brought up the abortion issue when we were discussing all of these matters before the election, they might have more credibility for me, but they brought up the threat of socialism.",
        "They brought up - we'll be weak in Afghanistan.",
        "And it was only as a last resort they brought that up.",
        "But I think, you know, I think the people for whom this really is an issue, it's very good that there is a bit of a brouhaha because I don't think Mr. Obama's advisers understand or appreciate the depth of feeling among Catholics on these abortion and stem cell issues.",
        "Now - so I think that he's got a real opportunity to engage the American Catholics through his speech there.",
        "And I think he's already backed off on a number of the key points.",
        "He's restricted the embryonic stem cell line far more than he said he would when he ran for office.",
        "So already, there's being an impact.",
        "And I don't think the Freedom of Choice Act, which you can talk to your audience about, in which concerned Catholics (unintelligible) doctor and nurse being coerced to do something against their conscience.",
        "I think that's a dead issue.",
        "But you can't - you have to look people in the face.",
        "You can't say, I'm not going to talk to you because I don't agree with you.",
        "All right.",
        "You've mentioned that, well, there have been another half-dozen American presidents invited to speak and any number of other politicians, and of course, I don't think anybody could've agreed with them all.",
        "No.",
        "I mean, since I went to Notre Dame, and that's, you know, that started with Eisenhower.",
        "I think the only one that didn't speak there was Bill Clinton, if I'm not mistaken.",
        "So - and let people protest.",
        "I mean, students - you've got some crazy people like Randall Terry coming in, you know, from the outside and they're, you know, they're going to have, I'm afraid that they're going to have to be restrained.",
        "But I also think the bishops have got something to think about, too.",
        "People who are objecting to the president speaking at Notre Dame are saying, well, 31, 34 bishops have complained about this.",
        "Well, there's almost 300 of them, so we got about 12 percent.",
        "Bishops tend not to get involved when their local bishop is the one who is in authority.",
        "And the local bishop is going to go to the graduation, but he's not going to go on Sunday when the president speaks.",
        "So he's kind of split it down the middle.",
        "They will, out of deference to him, prob - you know, not say anything.",
        "But I would think that of the - what do I say, 88 percent, perhaps, who have said nothing about this, I'll bet the majority of them support the university in what they're doing."
