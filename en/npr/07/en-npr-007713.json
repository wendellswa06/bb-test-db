        "And we'd stopped and gotten out of our Humvees to check out an area where a roadside bomb had gone off the day before.",
        "The captain we were following wanted to talk to locals and see what they had seen.",
        "So it was intelligence gathering.",

        "And as we were walking towards a group of Iraqis, the car bomb went off.",
        "It turns out, whoever had left the roadside bomb the day before, they believe it also left this car bomb planted there that was supposed to get the rescuers who responded to the roadside bomb the day before.",
        "No rescuers came the day before so the car bomb sat there waiting for a target.",
        "And whoever was sitting with their hands on the trigger, just kept watching the street until we walked in.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And you, of course, where critically injured.",
        "Since then, you write that you've learned more about how the medical profession puts injured troops back together again than you ever wanted to know.",
        "What it did take to put you back together again?",
        "Well, head to toe, I had small penetrating shrapnel wounds to my head so I did have what they call TBI, traumatic brain injury, the shrapnel had to be removed.",
        "But I joke with Bob Woodruff from ABC as he looked, you handle TBI and I'm going to handle the arms and the legs stuff.",
        "From then on, I had minor burns to my arms.",
        "And then my legs - the shrapnel hit both - broke both femurs, one of them in three places, and burned flesh away, skin, in some cases, muscle from my hips all the way to my ankles."

        "So they put hot packs on my leg, gave it 36 hours, brought it back.",

        "Universities were exuberant.",
        "They thought that they could keep running this kind of scheme - where the NIH budget would keep going up, and they could keep hiring more people.",
        "But that didn't happen.",
        "After the NIH budget doubled, it stagnated.",
        "In fact it's declined more than 20 percent when you take inflation into account."
