        "Ms.",
        "Dozier, first of all, thank you for going and trying to at least get some good information, because there's a lot of really bad misinformation out there about Iraq and about what's going on with our soldiers.",
        "I'm currently serving on active duty after two tours in Iraq.",
        "The last one put me in Landstuhl for a month, ahead slightly (unintelligible) there, Ms. Dozier.",
        "You know, when I was in Landstuhl, I was in such bad shape I wasn't allowed to leave my room.",
        "So you're one up on me.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right.",
        "I ended up spending a month there.",
        "And I had a broken jaw, a broken shoulder and shrapnel across the abdomen and leg from an IED attack.",
        "But the reason I was there for so long was because the Air Force lost my paperwork - not just once, but twice.",
        "Wow.",
        "All right, Rick.",
        "Well, thank you so much for the call.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Actually, she's way crooked.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I totally agree with Rick about the family input.",
        "One thing that CBS was able to do for me that, you know, doesn't happen for most injured troops, is that they brought my family members all to Germany - as many as they could gather.",
        "And then kept them up at some pretty pricey hotels in Bethesda, Maryland to stay with me during my six weeks in Bethesda.",
        "Now, that cost a pretty penny.",
        "And only if you work for a U.S.",
        "television network can you afford something like that.",
        "Most of the troops on the haul, even if there was space at Fisher House - which is a fantastic facility that provides low-cost - like $10 a day housing for the families of injured troops - even if there's space there, well, you know, most of these families, they work, and you can't take six weeks off from work to be with someone who is lying in a hospital bed injured.",
        "But when you're lying in that hospital bed, one of the most important things for me is not just the emotional support of having my family there, but having them there as patient advocates.",
        "Every time I came across one of these really tough decisions, you know, when I had this bacteria infect me, this Acinetobacter, I had to choose between one course of action, which meant the drug they wanted me to take would kill the bug but it would also kill my kidneys and I would have to on dialysis, or I would have to take risks.",
        "Now, that was a scary decision and I needed all the help I could get.",
        "So my family provided both emotional support and then they called around to different doctors and got second opinions.",
        "And that was part of what helped me get out of there faster and in better shape than I believe some of the troops are coming out."

        "Well, there have been folks pushing for more funding to do sort of more research on these kinds of injuries which, as you suggest in your piece, are so prevalent with the kind of war we're involved with and the kind of protection afforded to soldiers now.",
        "Why hasn't there been more funding for this research?",
        "What is slowing it up?",
        "Well some of the staffers I've spoken to - CBS allowed me to speak to Senator Inouye, Congressman Murtha, as long as I don't lobby for a particular program.",
        "So I've tried to educate them about all the programs I'm aware of in this field.",
        "And what they told me is that, wow, we didn't know this was a problem.",
        "What happens is it's probably the media's fault.",

        "At first, it was combat amputees because, hey, especially in TV, there's nothing that tells the story quite like seeing that picture.",
        "And so there was a rush in Congress - let's fund combat amputee research, let's build great facilities to help them out, and all that was done.",
        "And then TBI -traumatic brain injury - started to become an issue.",
        "And then my colleague Bob Woodruff over at ABC was badly injured.",
        "He had massive TBI damage.",
        "And he worked hard to bring attention that.",
        "So, as I understand from the staffers I was speaking to, they got a big aid package through to fund that kind of research.",
        "Now, I walk in the door and say, well, folks, guess what?",
        "There's something else.",
        "And guess what?",
        "Four out of five of the injured troops from Iraq and Afghanistan are suffering from it, or this laundry list of different problems.",
        "And so they were kind of blindsided, surprised, happy to be educated.",
        "But like everything else with this war, there's funding fatigue, like, okay, we didn't know we had that problem.",
        "Now, where are we going to get the money to pay for that?",

        "Since the news broke of a $50 billion swindle allegedly carried out by financier Bernard Madoff, one big question is where's the money?",

        "As a certified fraud examiner, what fascinates you about the Madoff case?",
        "Oh, I could be here all day telling you what fascinates me.",
        "There are so many fascinating aspects - the fact that this man has been around for 50 years in the investment business, the fact that the people who are involved in this are high net worth individuals.",
        "As a fraud examiner, you're just fascinated by how these schemes continue to work, even though people in the past have been told and have heard about all the schemes that have gone on before, yet another one can be perpetrated.",
        "And this time, probably bigger than any others that have gone before.",
        "If authorities are looking for the money, do they have any idea what happened to at least some of it?",
        "Because it's a self-titled Ponzi scheme, we know that at least a good amount of the money went from one pocket into another.",

        "And that's really how a scheme like this works.",
        "The people who get in early have to make money, because otherwise they tend to get disgruntled, and maybe the rug would have been pulled on this a lot earlier.",
        "Is there any legal basis for the folks who did make money early on to have to give it up in any way?",
        "I'm not a lawyer, but I will tell you, I have been involved in cases where, you know, people have what they would call ill-gotten gains.",
        "If they can quantify how much money these people have received from a scheme like this, they may well go after them to try and get that money back and put it into a pot to pay the people who are out the kinds of money that we're seeing now.",

        "Her compact body, combined with years of gymnastics as a child, has meant that in less than four years of diving, this tiny girl has perfected one of the most difficult dives in the world.",
        "It's the back three-and-a-half pike.",
        "From the 10-meter platform, the diver flips backwards into the pike position, where the body bends forward, keeping the legs straight.",
