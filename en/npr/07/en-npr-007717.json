        "And we don't want to vote on it with the midterm elections coming because we believe that it's probable that our actions would be unpopular.",
        "So if Congress docks its responsibility to weigh in and actually take a stand on whether the use of force should be undertaken in a serious and extended way, then our constitutional design, in which the public is supposed to play an important role in the decision to go to war, is deeply, deeply undermined.",

        "And therefore, that the president can act on his own without authorization from Congress and without involving the public - that seems to me quite wrong.",
