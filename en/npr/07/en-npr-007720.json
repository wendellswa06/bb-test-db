        "Well, that's the hope.",
        "Ultimately, the hope is senior Sunni leaders would be able to convince at least the nationalist insurgents to lay down their arms, get involved in the political process and calm things down and at least be able to differentiate between terrorists, who would be then considered criminals, and the insurgents, who were nationalists essentially.",
