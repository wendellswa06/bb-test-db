        "New York state law allows the city to impose a strict quarantine on TB patients and some can even be detained in a lockup at Bellevue Hospital.",

        "Most of our patients that get to that point have had significant substance abuse issues or mental health problems that are not being addressed.",
        "But most of the city's 650 or so active TB patients each year manage their treatment like Karim.",
        "He asked not to use his full name because only a small number of people very close to him know he carries the disease.",
        "He thinks even if he explained to friends and colleagues how he isn't contagious anymore, they'd still treat him differently.",

        "We know that patients with tuberculosis are not infectious except when they have a high degree of disease that's not being treated and they're coughing.",
        "We know that persons with Ebola disease are only infectious once they develop symptoms and transmit the disease through bodily fluids.",
        "So there's really no reason to quarantine somebody who's not a high risk to the public.",
        "Meanwhile, Karim is looking forward to a day, hopefully next spring, his 18-month drug regimen will be finished and he'll be free of TB.",
        "He says at that point, he'll tell more people about his ordeal and do more for an organization he started working with that's trying to find better, shorter treatments for the disease.",
