        "I think there are supporters of Elizabeth Warren who are coming at it from a prism of big ideas and trying to capitalize on this grassroots movements of progressives and really identify where the energy is within the Democratic Party.",
        "What's been interesting about Elizabeth Warren is that this isn't a post-debate bump, like the one you saw for Senator Kamala Harris, which was temporary.",
        "She has steadily risen in the polls over the past few months by really introducing herself to voters one policy proposal at a time.",
        "Her big identifying, I think, factor or trait as a candidate is that she has a plan for everything.",
        "Now, the flip side of that is, because she was kind of flying under the radar, she hasn't been held to much scrutiny in recent weeks.",
        "And I think what you're going to see on that debate stage is perhaps Warren weather some attacks for the first time from some of her opponents, who now recognize that she really is, at least for now, this - the runner-up to Joe Biden, who still holds a commanding lead in the polls."

        "At the same time, I think that Donald Trump has very much changed the standards for what's acceptable.",
