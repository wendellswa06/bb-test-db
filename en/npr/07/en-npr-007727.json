        "So how did today's military operation compare to yesterday's?",
        "Is the military offensive still escalating even on this holy day?",
        "In pure terms, it probably - you can't call it more intense than yesterday.",
        "That was the most intense since this uprising began four months ago, and certainly the most coordinated happening in several cities at once - in Hama, in Deir al-Zour to the east and to Dara'a in the south, and in suburbs of Damascus, the capital.",
        "But it has been continuing.",
        "The government insists that its forces are simply clearing away roadblocks and battling armed gangs, although that assertion is coming in for increased scorn among Western diplomats.",
        "The main focus still seems to be Hama, the symbolic city where there was a massacre in 1982, which was an armed uprising in that case.",
        "But the activists we're speaking with say, yes, the crackdown is continuing.",
        "The international community has strongly condemned the violence.",
        "And today, the European Union expanded its sanctions against the Syrian leadership.",
        "Are the Syrians you're talking to taking any heart from that?",
        "There are some satisfaction in hearing world leaders condemn the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.",
        "The rhetoric has grown a lot sharper.",
        "The press attache at the U.S.",
        "embassy in Damascus called the government delusional yesterday.",
        "President Obama speaking of new pressure, and as you mentioned, the E.U.",
        "has added new Syrian officials to their list of travel bans and asset freezes.",
        "But the diplomatic fundamentals haven't really changed, and Syrians seem to know that.",
        "Russia, China and others are still opposed to new U.N.",
        "sanctions.",
        "Washington and NATO seem to be in no mood for international intervention a la Libya.",
        "And serious questions remain about the nature of this opposition, So, the path forward remains cloudy.",
        "Ramadan will last for the next month.",
        "Are we likely to be watching for these kinds of evening protests every night throughout Ramadan?",
        "Well, I think in the short term, in the beginning of Ramadan, yes, I believe so.",
        "I mean, both sides have vital interest at stake here.",
        "Bashar al-Assad seems to have no desire to repeat that 1982 massacre in Hama.",
        "He has also shown, though, that he's either unwilling or perhaps unable to follow through on his promises of political reform.",
        "Now, the opposition is loath to nominate any leaders on its side.",
        "They seem to think that a determined escalation of protests and demonstrations will cause cracks to form in the regime.",
        "So at the moment, there's really no obvious third way, no way to get past this cycle of protest and crackdown.",
        "That's NPR's Peter Kenyon.",
        "He was speaking to us about Syria, but he was talking to us from Beirut.",
        "Peter, thank you very much."

        "His austerity measures aren't working.",
        "And Europe's not going away.",
        "He's got a big summit on the 13th of January, where his party will again expect him to stand up to whatever Chancellor Merkel Or President Sarkozy propose.",
        "We in the United States, of course, are watching with interest what happens to David Cameron, because we have some conservative candidates that the American people are looking over in the next few months.",
        "Do you think that the idea of conservativism is what attracted the British people, or was it they didn't like the other guy?",
        "I think in 2010, when the electorate here threw out the Labour government of Gordon Brown, it was more to do with a time for a change, 13 years of Labour, we were off the back of a financial crisis.",
        "And the Conservatives looked like they had moderated a little bit.",
        "What's so interesting, of course, is that David Cameron has presented himself always as a compassionate conservative, as a moderate, as a modernizer.",
        "And yet, here he is, the defining issue of his premiership is cuts to spending, is rolling back the state, you know, the archetypal Thatcher-Reagan symbol of conservativism.",
        "And what you'll see in America, interestingly, is you've got a series of candidates who are much to the right of our own conservative leader on social issues, climate change, etc. But one issue they all share a belief in is austerity.",
        "And here in the U.K., austerity isn't working so well.",
        "Our growth has ground to a halt.",
        "Unemployment's at a 17-year high.",
        "If that's the path the Americans choose, well, good luck to them with conservative economics."

        "The one bright spot, though, that I see in the immediate future of Great Britain are the Summer Olympics.",
        "Is that going to be a good thing for the U.K.?",
        "I think cynics amongst us will look at 2012, will look at the calendar and see a series of troublesome European summits for the government, will see a recession on the way and think, well, good for Prime Minister Cameron to have the Olympics in the summer and the Golden Jubilee - you know, the British people still love the royal family - coming up in 2012 as - almost as distractions from the gloom, the squeezed living standards, the rise in unemployment.",
        "I suspect it won't work.",
        "I think there's already a lot of irritation in this country about the Olympics, the fact that they've gone over budget, the fact that they only kind of will help London, and the rest of the country will really see no benefit from the games.",

        "David, this bill took so many weeks and a lot of compromises when that Senate Gang of Eight came together.",
        "What are the chances of it emerging from committee with that bipartisan support intact?",
        "Well, Audie, as the Judiciary Committee markup got under way today, there were more than 300 amendments being offered to the immigration bill, and two-thirds of them were from Republicans, and many of those were aimed at moving the bill more to the right.",
        "But there are Republicans who are very much in favor of passing an immigration bill this year if only to keep from losing even more Latino voters than they've already lost.",
        "And because Democrats have long supported more generous immigration laws, we've had a fairly unusual, for this Congress, bipartisan collaboration putting this bill together.",
        "New York Democrat Charles Schumer is a leader of the Gang of Eight who's also on the Judiciary Committee, and he implored colleagues today not to drive a stake through the heart of the bill.",
        "If you don't agree with everything - no one does - be constructive.",
        "We are open to changes.",
        "But don't make an effort to kill a bill that is the best hope for immigration reform, I believe, that we've had in this country and, frankly, the best hope to help break the bipartisan - the partisan gridlock that has strangled the Senate, the Congress and the country.",
        "So what options do opponents of the bill have to undermine it and make it unpalatable to its backers?",
        "Well, I don't think that there's a lot of mischief that those opponents can do while the bill is still in the committee because they're simply outnumbered there.",
        "One of those opponents is the newly - the new Republican senator from Texas, Ted Cruz.",
        "He's strongly against the path to citizenship that the bill offers most of the millions who are now in the country illegally.",
        "He warned the bill will have to change if it's to make it through not just the Democratic-led Senate, but also the GOP-controlled House.",
        "In my view, if those provisions are insisted upon - and the majority has the votes to insist on those provisions - it is likely to scuttle this bill and cause it to be voted down in the House of Representatives.",
        "I don't want this bill to be voted down, and I hope the stakeholders who want this bill to be passed will be interested in amendments to craft a bill that will pass.",
        "But Cruz failed to get much support for an amendment that he offered today that would have tripled the number of border patrol agents and quadruple the money spent on other border security.",
        "Democrats reminded him that his proposal would cost a lot of money that's not in the bill.",
        "And, of course, this is just the first day of amendments.",

        "Paul Krassner honed his outrageous humor as a contributor to Mad Magazine.",
        "He then refined it on the standup comedy stage and brought it to fruition in the magazine he founded called The Realist.",
        "It captured the zeitgeist of 1960s counterculture.",
        "Krassner died yesterday at his California home.",
        "He was 87.",
        "Reporter Jon Kalish has this appreciation."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "As a kid in high school, I only aspired to have the wit and cosmic insights that Krassner seemed to just effortlessly toss off.",
        "Krassner had a lot of very big names writes for The Realist over the years - Richard Pryor and Woody Allen and other people - but I read The Realist for Paul Krassner."
