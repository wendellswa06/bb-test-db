        "To qualify as an authentic miracle, the Vatican has to determine that Jake's recovery was unexplainable and that it occurred because people prayed to Kateri to intercede with God on Jake's behalf.",
        "Father Paul Pluth, who's coordinating an investigation into Jake's recovery, says that would suggest that Kateri has special access to God.",
        "That means we have received assurances that this person now stands in heaven before the throne of God.",
        "And one of the evidences for that has been miracles of healing.",

        "Father Peter Gumpel is a Jesuit priest in Rome who has investigated more than 100 potential miracles for the Vatican.",
        "He says the church dismisses about 95 percent of the miracle petitions it receives.",
        "There are many hoops to jump through - interrogating witnesses, examining medical records, calling on medical specialists and theologians, and finally, years later, presenting the evidence to the pope.",
        "It has to be rigorous, because we do not want to submit to the pope a statement unless we are absolutely morally certain that this case merits to be approved by him as a miracle by God.",

        "Are you positive that there is no other way to explain this, that - you know, logical explanation or a scientific explanation or it was just pure coincidence or whatever it was?",
        "The panel interviewed each doctor for more than an hour, asking details about Jake's condition, his recovery after each surgery, fatality rates.",
        "They asked nothing about miracles.",
        "Dr. Rubens says they were the consummate professionals.",
        "They took a very hard look at whether this really was something beyond what they described as the wonders of modern medicine.",
        "Of course you can't prove a miracle, says Dr. Rubens, and clearly Jake received the best medical care possible.",
        "Still, he does believe the family's faith was crucial.",

        "Today, Jake is back on the basketball court, despite nearly 30 surgeries.",
        "He's a little famous in this town and his story is also making the rounds of the Vatican - a story of a boy who nearly died and the recovery that may be declared a miracle."
