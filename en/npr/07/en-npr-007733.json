        "I agonize for months over first lines.",
        "It is so important and so indicative of the book to come.",
        "Once you have the language and the rhythm and the point of view and the tone of the first line, the novel has, in a matter of so many words, set itself down.",

        "The opening line that needs to be used is: Some people swore that the house was haunted.",
        "And the closing line that I need you to use is: Nothing was ever the same again after that.",
