        "I think what's different this year is that the bishops are united in getting involved in pushing these issues; whereas, in the past, it tended to be individual bishops who would speak out.",

        "Conference of Catholic Bishops, is leading the fight.",
        "And it comes on the heels of the bishops' Fortnight for Freedom Campaign, in which they say that the Obama administration's birth control mandate threatens religious freedom.",

        "But he says they're getting all the attention.",

        "Perenyi says he sold more than 1,000 forgeries over 30 years.",
        "His ability is so impressive his work has passed inspection by experts worldwide, and it's made Perenyi millions.",
        "He lays it all out in his new book \"\"Caveat Emptor: The Secret Life of an American Art Forger.\"\" His publisher says they have vetted the book, and it's all true."

        "In previous talks like this, and there have been several that were attempts at getting a negotiating process going, the Iranians essentially wasted a good deal of time enumerating a long list of complaints that Iran has about its relations with the United States and its relations with Europe, and basically they don't go anywhere.",
        "And apparently that did not happen this time around.",
        "They got down to at least talking about where each other stands and where each other wants to go.",
        "And the mood coming out of it sounded mildly hopeful.",
        "And I thought before the talks that if they were to announce there would be a second round, and if they gave a specific date and place, it would indicate that something serious may have started, and I think that's exactly what happened.",

        "One is Iran's continuing enrichment of uranium to the level of 20 percent U-235.",
        "This is a significant step toward highly enriched uranium, and the United States wants to see that capped and stopped and then some kind of ultimate dispensation for this arranged between the West and Iran.",
        "Iran clearly wants the economic sanctions that it is now suffering under removed or lightened at least as a confidence-building measure early on in this process.",
        "And it doesn't look like there was any substantive discussion of those issues.",
        "That's going to come up very quickly, however, in May when the two sides meet again in Baghdad.",
        "And I think it was the Danish foreign minister, now one of those groups of six countries, but nevertheless a member of the EU who said today the Iranians are masters of delay and prevarication, and we're not going to lift any sanctions until we see concrete steps.",
        "There was also a quote from a figure in the Obama administration who said that there wouldn't be any lightening of sanctions just in response to dialogue, which is another way of saying that something concrete has to be given by Iran in order for something concrete to be given by the U.S.",
        "and the Europeans.",
        "And it does seem like both sides know what that is.",
        "It also is a problem the degree to which both sides can sell it politically back home.",

        "That's when the European Union says it will stop buying Iran's oil altogether.",
        "It's been buying less and less all the time, and in fact Iran is seeing its oil sales dwindle by the week or by the month.",

        "Do we know what Iran's goal here is?",

        "There was, today, published an interview with Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, in one of the official news agencies from Tehran.",

        "He said enrichment, uranium enrichment is Iran's right, but we can negotiate on how we obtain uranium with different enrichment levels.",
        "Making 20-percent enriched fuel is our right, as long as it provides for our reactor needs, and there's no question about that.",
        "Then he went on to say if they, the other side, guarantee that they will provide us with the different levels of enriched fuel that we need, then that would be another issue.",
        "And that is a real serious trial balloon.",
        "This harks back to a few years ago, when there was a similar effort to make such a deal that fell apart.",
        "And it's interesting that the foreign minister is bringing this up again.",
        "There is also the question of access to facilities like the previously secret facility at Fordu, which is where some of those centrifuges are buried deep under a mountain.",
        "There is regular access to that facility now by IAEA inspectors, who probably go there at least once a month, more frequently than that.",
        "But nevertheless, the United States and the Europeans would like to see that facility stop its operation.",
        "They now are falling back on looking perhaps to allowing low-enriched uranium to be produced at the initial facility at Natanz that the Iranians use to enrich uranium.",
        "But they're very worried about Fordu because Fordu is in a mountain.",
        "It's buried deeply, and obviously it's much more difficult to get at should a conflict occur.",

        "Hi, thanks, Neal, for inviting me again.",
        "And I wonder, there was a recent meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama.",
        "The subject was widely believed to be Iran and Israel's open conversation about when it might need to strike, when Iran's facilities might be too deeply buried for Israeli attacks to be effective anymore.",
        "And is there still any reason to believe that Israel is not pretty well convinced that it's going to have to strike?",
        "No, I'm afraid to say that from the point of view of Israel, at least the Israeli leaders, mainly Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Minister of Defense Ehud Barak, nothing has changed.",
        "And, you know, it's interesting, Neal.",
        "There's no debate on the facts on what actually happened in Istanbul in the last weekend.",
        "But the interpretation of what happened there is significantly different between Europe and Israel.",
        "While (unintelligible) sees this as a great success, the continuation of the talks in Baghdad on the 23rd of May, the fact that the Iranians do not insist anymore on the abolishment of these sanctions before the negotiations start, the Israelis see this as a great failure for the international community.",
        "They believe that this is just another trick for the - of the Iranians to stall time.",
        "They want - the Iranians, the Israelis believe, just want to gain more months or a year, delay the Israeli strike until their sites are immune to an Israeli, the air bombs.",
        "And they just think, they think that the Europeans again are too naive to understand that the only thing the Iranians want is just to gain the nuclear military capability.",
        "In order to...",
        "I'm sorry, excuse me.",
        "So the Israelis, the Israeli leadership in any case, and this is not unanimous, nothing in Israel is unanimous...",
        "No, no.",
        "...but the Israeli leadership sees this as Iran sees that time is on Iran's side.",
        "Yes, and in order to prevent this scenario from happening, the - in secret talks between - in the talk that you mentioned between the American president and the Israeli prime minister, and in other extensive, the rest of the extensive dialogue going on between Israeli and American officials, the Israelis have put terms that can set up the end of the dialogue.",
        "And only by fulfilling all these terms I would say that Israel would be satisfied and call off the strike.",
        "If Iran, according to the Israeli terms that were submitted to the United States secretly, recently, only if Iran disassemble completely the secret site in Fordu, stop the enrichment to 20 percent, give away to a third country every - all the materials that were already enriched to this percent and maintain only a very small portion of enriched uranium to 3.5 percent and open all of its sites to the IAEA inspectors, only if these terms are fulfilled then Israel would reconsider a possible strike during 2012."
