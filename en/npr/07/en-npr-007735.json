        "It's still nuclear weapons.",
        "It's going to be a lot of radiation, a lot of fallout all over the Middle East, and it's going to be totally, totally destructive to the American troops in Afghanistan, in Iraq, the rest of the world.",

        "Ronen Bergman, there's a lot in there, but in there is the belief that Israel wants a war with Iran.",
        "Yeah, you know, Neal, many times when I appear in shows that takes questions from the viewers or the listeners, Al Jazeera, et cetera, I've been attacked by - as if I'm an official representative of the government of Israel, which is of course not true.",
        "And I have strong criticism on the policy of Benjamin Netanyahu's government for not doing enough to advance the peace negotiations.",
        "Iran is the only country in the world that calls for the destruction of another country, and that is Israel.",
        "Iran publicly, overtly, is not ashamed for giving massive support to jihadist movement in the Middle East, mainly Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, sending suicide bombers to kill Israeli citizens."

        "And I do have some understanding to Benjamin Netanyahu, when he says I'm not going to give Iran the ability to do so.",

        "The United States government wants to find a way to stop the clock, that is to say to come up with an interim measure which will give us more time to see if we can't negotiate a comprehensive settlement but to start with some kind of a confidence-building measure because right now the two sides lack confidence that the other side will carry through on whatever deal is reached.",
        "And so the focus for Baghdad and the May 23 next meeting, is to come up with some kind of a confidence-building measure that stops the clock, addresses the Israel concerns that time is on Iran's side and which gives the two sides more confidence that they can work on a permanent deal in the coming months.",
        "Is this a tactical measure, let's punt this decision until after the election?",
        "No, it's a sense that we don't have the confidence in each other to be able to come up with some kind of a comprehensive deal.",

        "And the United States has used force in the region in the past, of course, as well.",
        "Yes, although we would argue that we have only done that in defense of the status quo, not trying to overthrow the status quo, but...",
        "But I just wanted to go back to something that you wrote in the piece, and this is - wait a minute, I'm just flipping through, right, too long - interestingly, you said, the record suggests Iran does not respond to pressure, it only responds to great pressure.",
        "These are the sanctions that are, as Mike Shuster described earlier, really beginning to have an effect in Iran.",
        "The Iranian currency has lost almost half its value in the last eight months, and Iran's finding it harder and harder to sell its oil.",
        "Right away, the insurers are not wanting to insure Iran's ships, and it's making it hard for them to carry oil in anything other than their own tankers.",
        "And more and more countries are - more and more companies are deciding it's just not worth all the hassle that comes with dealing with Iran.",
        "Mike Shuster, I wanted to bring you back in, and there seems to have been at least tacit agreement, at least we read in the newspapers, nobody quite says this publicly, from American and Israeli intelligence officials that there is still time.",
        "Iran has not yet assembled a nuclear weapon and has not yet clearly indicated that it will assemble a nuclear weapon or develop a nuclear program.",
        "Well, there is certainly no information in the public domain where we can be confident that we know that they've moved toward a full-scale program to develop a nuclear weapon.",
        "The consensus view in the U.S.",
        "intelligence community - and it's been this way for the last five years - is that Iran did have a full-scale nuclear weapons program up until 2003.",
        "After the discovery of it and the U.S.",
        "invasion of Iraq, it stopped it - that's according to the intelligence community - but that components of that program may have continued and may still be underway.",
        "And that's the part that the International Atomic Energy Agency is trying to find out and has had very little cooperation with Iran on answering those past questions, which is why confidence-building measures are so important here because Iran has spent the last - nearly the last 10 years, once it was known that they were enriching uranium, destroying the confidence and trust between the United States on the one hand - or the United States and Europe on the one hand and the Iranians on the other.",
        "Let's see if we can go to another caller, and let's start with Pat(ph), Pat with us from Danville in California.",

        "Iran's supreme leader is convinced that the Western governments are using the nuclear issue as an excuse, and that their real agenda is to promote this kind of a soft overthrow of his government by stirring up women and youth and intellectuals through channels like international broadcasting.",
        "And that's how he reads the 2009 protests.",
        "And he worries that Western values have infiltrated his country, and that these mass protests he saw on 2009 confirmed his viewpoint that the - in fact, the Islamic Republic may be losing the hearts and minds of young people.",
        "That you use - cite the example of Libya, once Colonel Gadhafi agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction, that from that point on, Western agencies - commercial and otherwise - infiltrated the country and, voila, a few years later, Gadhafi is dead in the desert.",
        "Well, it's a real problem when the carrots that we can offer Iran of international investment, international engagement are seen as poison by the supreme leader.",
        "And he seems to be more afraid of our carrots than he is of our sticks, because, as you pointed out, he has his view - which I think is wrong, but it's his view - that an attack would unify Iranians behind the revolutionary values, whereas I think that an attack would actually cause Iranians to say: How the heck did we get in this situation?",
        "We're talking with Patrick Clawson of the Washington Institute, where he's director of research.",

        "And, Mike, this sense of the window closing, we've heard that from American officials up to Secretary of State Clinton.",
        "Is there any indication of how long this window is and how much hinges on these talks, the next round of which go to Baghdad?",
        "Well, it - you know, I've been thinking about that, Neal, and I think that we're talking about some months at the very least.",
        "The European Union's oil embargo doesn't go into effect fully until July 1st.",
        "And clearly, the Obama administration, the president himself, wants to see whether - what kind of an impact that will have on Iran before taking any other action.",
        "And presumably, there is some period of waiting after July 1st to see what kind of impact the oil embargo may have and the continuing pressure that the United States - has been put on Iran's banking sector, which has made it difficult for Iran to realize the revenues from the sale of oil, where it's still selling oil."
