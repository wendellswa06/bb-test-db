        "So I think we're talking about several months, a couple of months until July 1st, and then several months after that.",
        "That gets us very close to the November election.",
        "And I think lots of people might argue whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing in October or September, later this year, if there was a conflict - direct military conflict with Iran.",
        "But that's at least one way of looking at the question of what the window is.",

        "Yes.",
        "And, Patrick Clawson, it was interesting that you said there is, however, still time.",
        "Iran's program is not mature.",
        "It is much more likely to be aimed at developing a - if it is aimed at nuclear weapons, a multitude of nuclear weapons, a robust program of some sort, rather than the strike for something program, a place like North Korea.",
        "Well, developing one nuclear weapon and then testing it is a way of saying to the world I'm dangerous and I'm unarmed.",
        "And that's an invitation to be whacked.",
        "And so the Obama administration is quite confident that the Iranians are going to instead develop an arsenal.",
        "I wish I shared their complete confidence in this.",
        "I think it's the most likely case.",
        "But the North Koreans did pretty well with developing a primitive device - not even, really, a bomb that you could deliver - and exploding that.",
        "And so at some point, that could become attractive for Iran.",
        "But at the moment, with all the effort the Iranians are spending on developing missiles which will carry the weapons, it does appear that the Iranians are taking their time and are more interested in having an arsenal that they could deliver by a missile.",
        "And one other question you don't address in your piece: We heard Ronen Bergman say containment is not an issue for the Israelis.",
        "Why would not - in the Israeli view - deterrents work?",
        "Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons.",
        "Well, the Israelis have their argument, but Obama has a very different argument, and that Obama's concern is that this would lead to an - an Iran with nuclear weapons would lead to a nuclear arms race across the Middle East, if not across the world.",
        "And Obama has been dedicated to reducing the world of nuclear weapons.",
        "That's been a passion of his from many, many years.",
        "And so Obama is worried, not just about containing Iran, but about containing the many other countries that might follow the Iranian example.",
        "So for Obama, the big issue of why containment is not acceptable is that he worries about a nuclear arms race if Iran gets nuclear weapons.",
        "The Israelis, on the other hand, that's a small country, and they worry that it's very hard to - for Israel to survive a nuclear attack and continue as a nation.",
        "And so that therefore this is an existential threat if Iran were to miscalculate and use nuclear weapons.",
        "Patrick Clawson, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "We appreciate it."
