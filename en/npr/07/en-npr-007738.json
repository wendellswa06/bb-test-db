        "By the 1970s and '80s, though, Blue plans faced competition from for-profit insurance companies.",
        "Because the Blues accepted all comers, regardless of health status, their rates were typically higher.",
        "These new insurers who didn't offer universal coverage attacked younger, healthier people with better deals.",

        "Clearly, part of what Blue Cross intended and, in fact, did, was use the capital that they raised from stock sales to acquire other companies to grow, to get bigger, and in so doing, put them in a position where they could sell to national accounts, 'cause that's where a lot of the money is in the group health insurance market.",
        "WellPoint bought non-profit Blue plans in Missouri, Wisconsin and elsewhere.",
        "At the same time, Anthem, the for-profit owner of Indiana's Blue plan, went on a multi-state buying spree of its own.",
        "Then in 2004, WellPoint and Anthem merged and became the largest health insurance company in the country.",
        "And that meant the non-profit Blue plans that remained faced an even tougher marketplace, says Laurie Sobel of Consumers Union.",
        "They are competing in a marketplace for those for-profits.",
        "So they have been doing some of the same bad practices as the for-profits.",
        "While many Blue plans remain not-for-profit, Chris Conover, a Duke University researcher, says the for-profit and not-for-profit Blues are now indistinguishable.",
        "For 90 or 95 percent of their business decisions, they're going to make the same business decision.",
        "And then at the margin, maybe the for-profit plan is going to be a little more aggressive about, I don't know, their provider contracting or something like that.",
        "Sobel of Consumers Union says something larger has been sacrificed.",
