        "When we talk about a patch in an ocean which is greater than all the land mass put together, it means that this is the predominant thing that we see there.",
        "It doesn't mean that it has piled up like trash after a football game in a stadium, in the parking lot.",
        "So most of the debris we find is actually slightly below the surface.",
        "Okay.",
        "So what does it look like as you're traveling through it?",
        "Well, it looks like the rest of the ocean.",
        "I mean, the surface of the ocean is disturbed by way of which, which reflect light.",
        "So satellites can see it.",
        "Only like spy planes and low-flying aircrafts can actually see down into the water.",
        "But some fishermen can spot these large agglomerations of debris that the ocean has knitted together.",
        "We've picked up one, weighed a couple hundred pounds.",
        "It had a toothbrush in it.",
        "Even though, it was mostly composed of net and tarps and stuff like that.",
        "Is it mostly marine debris or what else do you see?",
        "No.",
        "The proportion that we recognize has been most accurate.",
        "Its 80 percent land base, 20 percent from ships at sea.",
        "The main point to emphasize is that there's a kind of trash that doesn't go away and that kind of trash is plastic.",
        "Is there any one sort of thing that you see?",
        "Is it mostly plastic bottles or is it mostly grocery bags?",
        "You know, I dove in for a night dive as far from land as you can get anywhere on Earth.",
        "We deployed the sea anchor to keep the boat still.",
        "And the first thing I saw about 30 feet below the surface was a T-shirt shopping bag and all the typical lightweight plastic shopping bag floating by.",
        "I was pretty shock so.",
        "You always see shopping bags.",
        "We see bottles.",

        "There's a western garbage patch, too, off Japan, which is equally polluted.",
        "And there's a triple highway between the two patches.",
        "What you've got is a giant high pressure system, easily as big as a continent of Africa, between Japan and California.",
        "And that circulates in a clockwise direction, and the center actually has a little lower sea level, sort of, a toilet bowl effect, where you get this maelstrom with a depression in the middle, drawing things from the Pacific rim into the central area.",
        "This debris doesn't go away.",
        "It just breaks them to smaller and smaller particles.",

        "And the result was \"\"A Game of Thrones,\"\" the first volume in an epic fantasy series based loosely on the English dynastic struggle known as the Wars of the Roses with a few dragons and demons thrown in.",
        "Fifteen years later, George R.R.",
        "Martin's series, known as \"\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\"\" has sold more than 15 million copies, and he's inspired the kind of cult loyalty known only to a handful of living writers.",

        "And I said, I've got to capture this in a fantasy book.",
        "But of course, fantasy being bigger and more colorful, I couldn't have a wall that was 10 feet tall like Hadrian's Wall, so I had a 700-foot-tall wall, and I made it out of ice, and I gave it this storied history.",
        "And then, of course, I wanted something to emerge from those hills and trees to the north that was a good bit scarier than Scotland.",

        "Yes.",
        "So I came up with that too.",
        "So you start with the kernel of reality, and then you extrapolate and you build from there.",

        "So that's one reason.",
