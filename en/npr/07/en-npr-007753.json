        "One of the reasons the United Nations has approached this religious organization is because they realize that they're diplomats, they are scientists, they're economists, they have no idea how to talk to ordinary people, and they're coming to terms with that, and looking for help from who else but the church who has been changing people's minds for millennia.",

        "And the real issue for them is they are most likely to be the victims, and the solution for them is probably to become less poor, to develop economic resiliency and so on.",
        "And the question is how to do that without harming the planet, and the answer seems to be not to ask them to hold back on development but to help them develop in such a way that they can take whatever comes.",
        "And we're not sure what they're going to be faced with, but clearly they're living a life right now that is - has very little margin for error.",
        "Not that your work or the work of NPR's science unit is finished with global warming by any means, but after this entire experience do you come away essentially encouraged about this movement to cope with climate change or discouraged?",
        "Well, I'm encouraged a little bit, to the extent that people are more aware of it now.",
        "But I think the more we realize how huge a problem it is - and I must say I did not come away from this year more optimistic that we will find an easy way out of it this at all.",

        "I mean, I have a fair amount of faith in human ingenuity, and I think that once people grasp (unintelligible) and say this is really serious, I mean if they can begin to understand just how expensive this is going to be, then I would hope that human ingenuity is going to help us get through by inventing new ways to get around.",

        "When did the sheen of all of it start to wear off - I imagine it did - when it stopped being such an adventure and so new, when the severity of the war and what you were witnessing really started to hit home for you?",
