        "Right.",

        "But right before I started to write \"\"The Squid and the Whale,\"\" I kind of found myself at a position where I think like my career ambition had sort of exceeded my sense of self.",

        "That's interesting.",
        "In other words, you'd sort of outpaced your own development.",
        "Yeah, and this movie, in a way, I think, for me was a kind of breakthrough on every stage, the writing all the way through the directing, of kind of finding who I was as an adult filmmaker in a way.",

        "There are a lot of people who will be caught up by the phrase, `Well, you know, I made two films in my 20s and I really didn't know what I'--how did you end up making two films in your 20s?",

        "This is a transcript of the raw interview.",

        "And I sent it around and, you know, ultimately I got money to make it, and it's a--but, you know, it took me--after having made two movies, it took me--you know, it was about a seven-year period between my last movie and this one.",
        "So it wasn't all easy.",
        "Are all of your films at least semi-autobiographical?",
        "In different ways.",
        "I mean, they're all personal, I would say, but you know, I probably wouldn't describe them all as semi-autobiographical.",

        "Yet the dialogue is really crisp.",

        "Yeah, and--I mean, that's an interesting question.",
        "I mean, I think it's a process.",
        "I--dialogue is something that comes easiest for me in writing screenplays and I generally start with conversation and, you know, I might have an idea of character or I just might have an idea of a conversation and I'll figure out who the characters are based on what they're saying.",
        "But early drafts are, you know, like real conservation.",
        "People say the same thing, they keep going over the same topic, and you know, it's the sort of later drafts that become about really, you know, getting into--turning it into a movie scene, but still keeping that natural, you know, largely unconscious sense of real conversation that I started with.",

        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "I always--in movies particularly, like pitch meetings, are always based on concepts, you know, and I've always tripped myself up if I start to think that way, 'cause I start writing ahead of myself, and I think I really need to start with character and come from the inside out.",
        "Nevertheless, I'm going to ask you.",
