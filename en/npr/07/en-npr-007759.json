        "The minutes passed like days, and the president was very concerned about the security of our personnel.",
        "That was what was on his mind throughout, and we wanted to make sure that we were able to get through this and accomplish the mission.",
        "But it was clearly very tense, a lot of people holding their breath, and there was a fair degree of silence as it progressed, as we would get the updates.",
        "And when we finally were informed that those individuals who were able to go in that compound and found an individual that they believe was bin Laden, there was a tremendous sigh of relief that what we believed and who we believed was in that compound actually was in that compound and was found.",
        "And the president was relieved once we had our people and those remains off-target.",

        "And there's also the possibility of some people in the opposition to say that there are elements in the armed forces that have turned against other armed forces members, or even, there's - there are many stories that the army itself is killing its own soldiers if those soldiers refuse to shoot protesters.",

        "So this is a very difficult time for the government of Syria.",
        "And in that statement, where it reported the death of 120 of its own members of the armed forces in what it said was an attack by armed gangs, the Syrian government conceded that it had lost control part of the country.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And if you follow the pattern of what's happened in the last three months, it's - areas on the borders of Syria, you had Daraa in the south, near Jordan, you have in the town in the Lebanese border, you have, now, Jisr ash-Shughur in the north, in the Turkish border, it's the periphery that is - where most of the problems are, partly because these are - as in the many of Arab countries, these are - the periphery is neglected.",

        "More troubling is that you have people all over the country in Syria, even Damascus today - there's a report of 300 demonstrators in one of the, you know, sort of upscale parts of Damascus - people demonstrating publicly in support of the people of Jisr ash-Shughur.",
        "As happened in the last two or three months, where people all over Syria were demonstrating in support of the people of Daraa in the south, which have been the first place that was really faced with a severe military crackdown by the government.",
        "And what's happening is the government is moving its elite brigades, elite troops, the fourth division under Maher al-Assad, the brother of the president.",
        "It keeps moving these elite troops from one hot spot to another and, you know, things quiet down a bit.",
        "And then, when the troops move on to another hot spot, the former hotspot boils up again.",

        "That there may be a huge decisive crackdown that would kill, you know, huge amounts of people as happened in Hama in 1982, when thousands were killed.",

        "It's the weekly day of prayer and that's when the people congregate and that's when, historically, in the last three or four months all over the world, you have this huge public demonstration.",

        "You mentioned Hama in 1982.",
        "That was tens of thousands.",
        "Nobody is ever quite sure about the actual number, but tens of thousands of people may have been killed in that massacre, I think is the only safe way to say it.",

        "And, you know, the extraordinary thing about Hama is that, until today, nobody knows how many people died.",

        "Sure.",
        "Well, its legitimacy is certainly being challenged.",
        "You know, the Syrian government has assets that it can play.",
        "And one of them is that people don't - many people don't want to see it collapse and see the country fall into turmoil or civil war.",
        "Because the collapse of the Syrian government, especially in a violent way, would have major implications within the country but also would spill over into so many other parts of the Middle East.",
        "So that's one huge asset that the government has.",
        "And Assad - President Assad has been talking for years about reform but didn't really do anything other than the economic reform.",
        "No political reform was done, so he has pretty much lost his credibility.",
        "Most of the people who follow Syria and the region and many Syrians you talk to in the country and out say that, well, it's, you know, he just lost his chance.",
        "He should have done this six months ago, five years ago, eight years ago, and he hasn't.",
        "And now that he has come out with this massive military response, it's really probably too late to get a political solution.",
        "It's a very difficult situation, because the government is strong.",
        "It has a lot of supporters.",
        "There's two or three million people in Syria who are part of the armed forces and the Ba'ath Party and the government system.",
        "And many of the Alawites were close to the ruling regime, and they were all going to fight to keep the government in power.",
        "So this is a Ceausescu, the Romanian-type situation rather than a Jaruzelski and Lech Walesa Poland situation, where you had a peaceful transition.",
        "I think Syria is facing a very difficult situation because the regime either stays in power and stays in control or it falls.",

        "Hey, I just wanted to say that I'm a naturally born Syrian citizen, and I agree 100 percent, that the Syrian government has lost its legitimacy to rule, and the military has lost its legitimacy from the first shot that was fired on the protesters.",
        "If we look back on situation of Egypt, the military chose not to get involved.",
        "The military is for - is to protect the people, whereas in the Syrian situation, military is attempting to protect the regime and not standing by the people who they are sworn to protect.",
        "And, Rami Khouri, we tend to think in the West, of militaries that are set up to fight and win wars, but Mohammed is, in some sense, is correct.",

        "Well, that's correct.",

        "And then, this is the reason why you got literally tens of millions of people throughout the Arab world, now challenging their regimes and demanding either serious reforms or overthrowing the regime, changing the regime, getting more legitimate, more accountable, more humane leaderships.",
        "And the Syrian situation is quite typical of the Arab world.",
        "I mean, they've done some terrible things recently, but it's a very similar situation to most of the Arab countries.",
        "And you're getting, now, these situations where, you know, you're getting these iconic figures, especially these two young boys, Hamza al-Khatib and Thamer al-Sahri, 13- and 15-year-old boys, whose pictures of badly mutilated and tortured bodies have now appeared on the internet.",
        "And they've been pretty well verified, I believe.",
        "And these have, in the last two weeks, these have sparked, you know, a new wave of demonstrations around the country.",
        "And once you get demonstrations all over the country and in different places at once, and people still come out into the streets even after the army shoots them - and a thousand people have been killed - this is a pretty serious sign that the government has essentially if not lost control has certainly lost much of its legitimacy and will rule by military force.",
        "And this is not something that will go on for a long time.",
        "So I think there's still a very, very slim sliver of chance to have a political solution if Assad makes that move.",
        "But the chances of him doing that, now, seem very slim.",
        "Mohammed, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Finally, Rami Khouri, as you look around the region, probably Syria's most important economic partner in the past few years certainly has been its neighbor Turkey.",
        "Is Turkey now reconsidering its relationships with Damascus?",
        "Yes, Turkey has opened its border - it's in the north - and clearly said so openly that it will allow any Syrian refugees who want to leave the Jisr ash-Shughur area to go there.",
        "And about, I think, three or 4,000 have already moved there in the last few days.",
        "And it has publicly called on the Assad regime to find a political solution to the problems, and the Syrian - the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan called the Syrian president two, three days ago.",
        "So the Turks are trying to use their influence, but it doesn't seem to work.",
        "They don't really have the capacity to get the Syrian government to try a different approach.",
        "And the Turks, like many people in the U.S.",
        "and in Europe, were caught off guard when these Arab revolts started all over the region.",
        "But now I think they're coming around to realizing that free and democratic citizens are the best guarantor for civility within every Arab country and within the region as a whole and for relations between the Arab world and its non-Arab neighbors including Israel and Turkey and Iran and the Western world.",
        "So I think Turkey - at Turkey, it's now much more clear that it is going to come down on the side of citizens who are fighting for their rights, but would like to achieve a political solution, not a military one.",
        "Interesting there, are elections in Turkey, a country which had a rocky, sometimes, history with democracy, but of late, rather more continuity with that.",
