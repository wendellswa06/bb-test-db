        "Sheila Kelley has been acting for almost 20 years.",
        "She's appeared on some of TV's biggest shows, including \"\"The Sopranos\"\" and \"\"ER.\"\" In 2000, she produced and co-starred in the film, \"\"Dancing at the Blue Iguana.\"\" Let me tell you, that dance wasn't ballet.",
        "It was erotic dance.",
        "She saw it and practiced for the role, which inspired her to teach others.",
        "I walked into the club and my jaw dropped.",
        "What I saw on stage was this gorgeous, beautiful woman moving.",
        "And I felt like, Oh my God!",
        "There's our fire.",
        "Somebody stole our fire and took and put it in this seedy place where we can't have it, but men can.",
        "And I feel like I've stolen that fire back.",
        "And I feel like I'm giving that fire back to you, and you, and you, and you.",
        "Now women from coast to coast take the S Factor classes.",
        "Sheila explains the name.",
        "S Factor stands for the natural curvaceous movement of a woman's body, which if you look at a woman walking naturally, and totally relaxed, their body undulates like an S.",
        "It curves.",
        "We curve out at the bust, in at the waist, out at the pelvis, in at the legs.",
        "It's so beautiful and natural.",
        "It's like a mountain range.",
        "It's like a river.",
        "It's like the tide.",
        "Women's bodies are just exquisite.",
        "But not a lot of women feel that way.",
        "When I walked into the studio, what I didn't see was just as important as what I did.",
        "There was no harsh overhead lighting, and no mirrors.",
        "My teacher Amy Olsen explains why.",
        "The great thing about the classes though, is that they are in the dark, for the most part.",
        "We do have some very nice red lamps.",
        "Red is a very kind color, and we want everybody to feel very comfortable.",
        "So the room's kept fairly dark.",
        "Still well enough lit that you can see what's going on and you can see everything.",
        "There's also no mirrors on the wall, so you don't have to worry about how you look doing something.",
        "We just want it to feel good.",
        "As I learned in my yoga class, what feels good to one person can be torture for someone like me.",
        "Okay, so we're going to start in a seated position with your legs crossed in the front, just whichever one is more comfortable.",
        "Amy put me on a yoga mat and started the warm-up.",
        "She used to teach ballet, and she's lean and flexible.",
        "I'm neither.",
        "Just slowly, just exhale letting your shoulders relax down.",
        "Nice.",
        "And letting your hands just start to feel the curves in your legs, the curving knees and just slowly start to let your hands move.",
        "Feeling the fabric of your pants underneath your fingers, underneath the palm of your hand.",
        "And now I want you to lift your breast.",
        "As you start to take your next nice, deep inhale, sort of let your breast lift your chest up and out into the center of the room."

        "We're going to learn the pole slides.",
        "I want you just to step with your back and your butt up against the pole.",

        "And then we're gonna take just a comfortable tiny step out away from the pole.",
        "Come up on your toes.",
        "And then we're gonna just start to bend your knees, gonna have your hands wherever it's comfortable.",
        "Put one up over your head or both, and then we're gonna slowly just start to slide down.",
        "Just letting your knees bend.",
        "And then we're gonna sit your butt down on the floor and slowly start to push your butt out away from the pole.",
        "And slowly just roll back, letting your body melt into the ground, and letting your head just lean up against the pole.",
        "And then we're gonna peel your legs up and you're going to go into a flirt.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "This is more complicated than I thought.",
        "I asked for the easiest pole trick!",
        "All right, let's see what I can do.",

        "I could see how this workout would reshape my body, but my teacher Amy said the best benefit is self-confidence.",

        "People you would never, ever suspect, and I can't tell you who.",
        "During my trip to the studio, I didn't see any celebrity clients, but women of all ages and sizes were lined up to strut their stuff.",
        "Just from one class, I can see how this could be addictive.",
        "And by the end, I finally figured how to flirt, like a dancer, that is."
