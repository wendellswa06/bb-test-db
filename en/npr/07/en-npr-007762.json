        "What does the end of bin Laden in these circumstances, what does that say about the future of bin Ladenism?",
        "Well, I keep thinking that he died as an irrelevant figure to these young revolutionaries that I have been seeing in Cairo, in Beirut and across the border in Syria.",
        "He had nothing to offer them but rage, and these young Arabs believe in a nonviolent approach.",
        "And I think what al-Qaida stands for is unappealing to the vast majority of Arab youth, who want a more open system of governance.",
        "That's what they're talking about.",
        "One thing al-Qaida never offered was a way to organize society.",
        "It simply was a nihilistic organization, and the idea was to cause as much mayhem as possible.",
        "It is interesting that he dies at this moment of turmoil in the Middle East, but positive turmoil in many, many ways.",
        "And he dies at a moment where, if he could have picked a way to die, maybe, as we read from his writings, going down in a gunfight with U.S.",
        "Special Forces might have been his choice.",
        "Will he wind up a martyr?",
        "I think for those people who do still follow him, of course he will.",
        "But across the Middle East, you heard much more cheering.",
        "Some conspiracy theories, I have to say, when I was looking at comments certainly in the Saudi newspapers, but much more cheering than mourning.",
        "I think that there are small groups, pockets of people who believe that his way is the right way.",
        "But those groups are becoming smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller, and his death will in some ways disrupt that movement."

        "Already this morning, there are reports in regional papers that Taliban who have set up shop in the same way that he did, across the border in Pakistan, are moving themselves across the border, that Pakistan now is not safe, as they see it, that the Americans' relentless pursuit of bin Laden has made them nervous.",

        "And Deb, one of the places you were in was Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, bin Laden's home country, which was, if one has to say yes, he launched attacks at the United States, but Saudi Arabia was his true target.",
        "Indeed.",
        "In - between 2003 and 2006, there was a terror campaign inside Riyadh.",

        "He was stripped of his citizenship in 1994.",

        "There are people in Saudi Arabia who believe that he was an American creation, that we put him out there.",
        "But those are conspiracy theories, and they will live for a long time.",

        "And I think that there's nothing in the press that I've seen so far that tells us one way or the other.",
        "They are, you are right, a very wealthy family in Saudi Arabia.",
        "They are just part of the normal social scene there.",
        "And you see the name, Osama bin Laden - not Osama bin Laden but bin Laden - on big buildings.",
        "His father was a very wealthy construction magnate in the country.",
        "And one of his brothers is a racer.",
        "He races cars.",
        "And you can go to the races in Saudi Arabia, and there he will be.",
        "So they are very comfortable there.",
        "They have repudiated this sort of black son of theirs, and to have his body back in Saudi Arabia would simply complicate their lives, and I think the Saudis simply would not countenance his body being buried there."

        "I think there's also been a change in even those who did support him, to see that there was no path that got you anywhere with al-Qaida, that there was nothing at the end of the road in following al-Qaida, unless you simply thought that rage was the way to go.",
        "Kelly McEvers, there are groups in the Middle East that do align with al-Qaida, even some, we are told, in Gaza.",

        "You know, in some ways, that kind of aligns you with these Arab leaders who are now being, you know, publicly insulted for the first time ever in decades.",
        "And so, you know, even he was a little bit reluctant.",
        "You know, we have to get rid of these troops.",
        "But on the other hand, he would say: But, you know, if people are willing to negotiate, maybe (unintelligible)."
