        "And let me ask you: Yes, Deb Amos made the point that this comes at a moment when perhaps, given the events of the past few months, bin Laden is regarded by many in that part of the world as irrelevant.",

        "Bin Laden, even if you didn't necessarily with all of his tactics, during kind of the worst years of Abu Ghraib and Iraq, he represented somebody who was seeking that justice on your behalf.",
        "And then something happened.",
        "You know, a guy set himself on fire in Tunisia, a revolution happened, and all of the sudden people realized that they could do it for themselves.",
        "NPR foreign correspondent Kelly McEvers, thank you very much for your time today.",
        "Sure.",
        "Kelly McEvers joined us on the line from Beirut, and as she said, Deborah Amos, there is a new paradigm for change in the Arab world.",
        "Yet there are a lot of the regimes that Osama bin Laden would have loved to have overthrown, and principally again that in Saudi Arabia, but Jordan, too, that they are still in place, and change has not yet come.",
        "That is true.",
        "But what you feel when you're in the region is a change in the way that people see the way forward, and I was thinking about what Kelly said about, you know, was this an overnight thing, did the death by burning yourself in Tunisia change everything?",
        "And I would argue that this is a long-term change."
