        "We do not have a cure for Alzheimer's.",
        "There's a few drugs that are, you know, approved and being used as standard of care, but they don't do what we greatly would like to do.",
        "And we have heard of other genes already connected to Alzheimer's, correct?",
        "That's right.",
        "How does this set of new genes fit in?",

        "There's also a very rare form of the disease called early-onset, when people get it in their 30s and 40s.",
        "So there have been three genes that have been found for that.",
        "And they've been highly useful in terms of designing experiments to get at what causes Alzheimer's, but they don't apply to the more common form, which is late-onset.",
        "And in late-onset disease, there's been five genes known for over the last, really starting about 20 years ago.",
        "And our work that was just published last week adds another five.",
        "So we've kind of doubled the number of late-onset genes that contribute to late-onset Alzheimer's.",
        "And so these are basically, you look at all these Alzheimer's patients, and you find some commonality in them, in these genes.",
        "And some of these genes are involved in the transportation of fats in the body, are they not?",
        "That's right.",
        "So we look - we don't go into this with any ideas, with any hypotheses.",
        "So we call it unbiased or hypothesis-free research.",
        "We saw: What are - we ask the question: Are there any genes involved in Alzheimer's?",

        "We came up with five where the genetic variation in Alzheimer's - in patients - is a bit different than in elderly controls.",
        "And so we see these five genes.",
        "We have very good, solid evidence that they're all involved in your risk for Alzheimer's.",
        "And you're right.",
        "There's several of them that, along with what was known before, really point to cholesterol transport and lipid transport in the body.",
        "I would say at the moment, certainly, these genes, these proteins that genes make are in the blood and involved in cholesterol transport in the blood, but they're also in the brain.",
        "So at the moment, we're not sure whether is this something that happens in the blood that then affects the brain, or is this actually lipid metabolism in the brain that's being affected.",
        "And if you have these genes, how much does having them increase your likelihood of getting Alzheimer's disease?",
        "These are what we call small-effect genes.",
        "So each one, you know, if you think of - each one would increase your risk by a factor of about 1.2, not very much.",
        "The largest-effect gene is APOE-e, which, depending on what your genetic - your genotype is, can increase your risk four to 10 times.",
        "So that's a lot more substantial.",
        "These have a small effect.",
        "So the biggest payoff from our study is not particularly prediction.",
        "The biggest payoff is really that we're getting new clues, as you put it, into what causes Alzheimer's, new pathways to pursue.",
        "Is there any convergence of all these clues - pointing to something?",

        "That's an odd thing to say.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So, people with Alzheimer's have these abnormal plaques in the brain, and the first three genes all pointed to a-beta being a bad molecule to have and that you want to get rid of."
