        "And so where do you go from here?",
        "A number of things.",
        "So there were - our research paper had - really was a collection of about 15 different studies, and we all piled them together, and that was pretty much everybody that does Alzheimer's research across the U.S.",
        "And the other two - the other three consortia that were in the other paper, we've all joined forces now into an international collaboration.",
        "So we're going to now put all of our data together.",
        "So we have the opportunity to see additional genes.",
        "The next thing that also has to be done is the really - you know, the geneticists get some credit right now, and we found something.",
        "But the real hard work is saying: Okay, we know that this, you know, ABCI7 is a lipid-transport protein.",
        "We know something about how its normal function is.",
        "Now we have to figure out: How does it do this in Alzheimer's disease?",
        "How does it contribute to Alzheimer's?",
        "And for each of these genes, that's a significant effort that has to be done, but it - that's where the hard work is.",
        "Let's go to the phones.",
        "Mike(ph) in Tallahassee, hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Hi, congratulations on all the things that you found.",
        "I'm kind of curious, and this, I guess, has to do a little bit with the philosophy of science.",
        "How do you start out without a hypothesis?",
        "Doesn't that pretty much limit what you can find, or does it make it very difficult to discover new things?",
        "Shouldn't you have a hypothesis?",
        "I - you mentioned that you didn't have one when you started out.",
        "Well, I have to say we all tell graduate students you've got to have a hypothesis, which is a good idea.",
        "But we have been doing - having - doing genetics with a hypothesis, meaning, I think, such and such a gene is involved in Alzheimer's, and then you test it.",
        "And you say yes or no.",
        "And we have not been really good at guessing which gene is involved in Alzheimer's.",
        "So there is an underlying hypothesis, I guess, in that, yes, there are genes that contribute to risks, but we don't want to predict which one because we have the ability to sample all of them.",
        "So it's hypothesis-generating research.",
        "Sometimes hard to get past the doctoral committee..."

        "But you're pretty sure it's going to be a lot of genes, I mean, at least more than one, bang, this is what causes Alzheimer's.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that in other common diseases and diabetes and heart disease, it's very clear that as you increase your sample size, meaning even more patients and more controls, you see more genes, and I don't - you know, it's hard to predict when we will have them all, but there could be a hundred more Alzheimer's genes that we need to find.",
        "And do you take a tact - I know you said you don't have a hypothesis, but do you decide whether you're going to attack it from the fat side, like you found these genes having to do with fat transport, or do you take it from the plaque side, or do you take it from those other kinds of sides?",
        "How do you decide which way you want to attack it?",
        "Well, I would hope - I know funding is tight right now, but I would hope multiple different groups take multiple different tacks because, you know, we - if we only stick to one idea and the a-beta idea is the one we've been sticking to, and it's very sound - I don't want to just say that was a bad idea.",
        "But if we only stick to one track, if we can't figure out a drug to modify that, then we're - you know, you'd like to be having multiple tracks going on in parallel, rather than just sequential.",
        "Because there are always theories - I think there was a new theory just recently about we all get these plaques, but in people who get Alzheimer's, they can't clear a way the plaque-building material fast enough.",
        "Right.",
        "And the difficulty now is the a-beta, it looks like the plaques develop very early in the disease, even before you have any cognitive symptoms.",
        "And once they develop and set in motion a degenerative process, it may be too late to target plaque buildup and plaque disposal.",
        "You know, it may have started something that you can't reverse simply by getting rid of amyloids.",
        "So the difficulty now is that if you start early, then you would have to start something to prevent amyloid even before that, when people have no symptoms.",
        "So that would be preventative, and that would be great, but it's just so difficult to start at that point if you're trying a drug.",

        "You dropped a little nugget there that I want to pursue a little bit, and you said funding is tight.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "The - so we're funded by the National Institute on Aging, which is part of the National Institute on Health.",
        "And the budget has been going down, so other than the stimulus, economic stimulus, which is coming to an end here, the research money is going down.",
        "And NIH supplies most of the budget.",
        "There are private foundations that are very important, like the Alzheimer's Association has helped us established this international collaboration.",
        "But the bulk of the research money comes from NIH, and that's going down, rather than going up."

        "Thirty percent of the population has Alzheimer's.",
        "We have an aging population, meaning the most rapidly-growing segment of our population is over the age of 65.",
        "So by the year 2050, we'll have two to three times more people with Alzheimer's than we do today.",
        "So it's a massive health care problem that's looming, and, you know, of course, we're trying desperately to reduce health care costs.",
        "So, you know, if we can come up with a therapy that can delay Alzheimer's onset by five years or just can keep people intact enough so that they can live at home and have a higher quality of life, that will be - not only will it help people and reduce the human suffering, but it will also reduce health care costs.",
