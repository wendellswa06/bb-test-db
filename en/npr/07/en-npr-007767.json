        "And you know, we've heard people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton say that this could be the first 21st century civil rights movement.",
        "You know, along the lines of Selma; Little Rock; Oxford, Mississippi.",
        "I think that's hyperbole, Madeleine.",
        "You know, this an example really of people reaching back for a romantic moment trying to relive days of yore that has - really what this amounts to is an attempt by lots of young people, I think, who weren't involved with the civil rights movement, who can never say they marched with Dr. King, to recreate such a moment for themselves in this generation.",
        "And there's no harm in that.",
        "And in fact, there's good to it to the extent that they are active.",
        "But this moment really is about, in terms of civil rights, things like the high rate of black people killing black people in big cities, family breakdown.",
        "And any little incident in Jena just doesn't cut it in terms of comparison to the historic events that took place in Selma, Montgomery, Birmingham.",
        "Right.",
        "Where you're talking about big issues like voting rights.",
        "Well, how do you get people these days to galvanize around the issues that you mentioned - crime, education, keeping families together?",
        "Well, that's the challenge of this day in terms of an ongoing civil rights struggle.",
        "First, you have to remind people that it's not a matter of an episodic thing that just pops up.",
        "There's an ongoing civil rights movement in this country, and people who are concerned about high poverty rates, 25 percent in the black community, people who are concerned about that high black on black murder rate and terrible drug-related crimes in the black community, that's the hard work and its grassroots work that has to be done.",
        "But again, oftentimes people will ask me as someone who's written extensively about civil rights, they'll say, well, how do we get involved?",
        "And I'll say, you know, you have to pick something you're passionate about.",
        "It could be literacy, could be foster families.",
        "But that's the work of this day.",
        "And I think too often, because we hold Dr. King, Rosa Parks, people like that in such a high regard, there's this desire to go back in time, but it is not realistic and that's not the struggle of our day.",
        "We are not involved in a struggle over the back of a bus or over voting rights."

        "So you could say people will be disappointed to see something that is from the past, and also the fact that Senator Clinton did support the Iraq war, which was the big central bust- up(ph) between the Bush administration and Europe.",
        "On the other hand, Europe, in common with every other foreign block that has to deal with America, is at the most basic level flattered that a big star seems to be getting the job of dealing with foreigners.",
        "It would be insulting and worrying if someone rather obscure, or perhaps not that important, was given this job.",
        "But this sends a signal that foreigners are going to count for this new administration.",

        "There has been some tension between Europe and the U.S.",
        "over that issue.",

        "Well, that is the kind of - the big, million-dollar question for everyone, I guess, and probably in America, too, is will this be a Hillary Clinton foreign policy, or will she sincerely and accurately represent the foreign policy of her new president?",
        "Clearly, Europeans are slightly closer to some of the positions on certainly the Iraq war, but also on the need to have dialogue with Iran.",
        "When President Obama said that during the campaign, that resonated very well in Europe.",
        "So that's the kind of policy position that will go across well.",
        "I am inclined to think that the actual person who holds the job as secretary of state doesn't at the end affect the macro view that Europeans would have of American foreign policy.",
        "And the proof of that, in a way, is, Colin Powell was Europe's kind of secretary of state.",
        "He was our kind of guy.",
        "But at the end of the day, he had to deliver the foreign policy of the Bush administration, and the first-term Bush administration was as unpopular as it got.",

        "And the U.S.'s relationship with Russia has grown a bit tense, especially after the skirmish with Georgia.",

        "So people have mixed feelings about her, but they understand that the secretary of state doesn't make policy.",
        "The government makes policy.",

        "Well, the question here, Madeleine, is, what is your core conservative principle?",
