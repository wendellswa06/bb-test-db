        "That may be a problem because you've got people like Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, who have had a pent-up sense of mission, which is that they want to get their legislation through, and they feel they've got enough Democrats now to make it happen and put that legislation on the desk of a Democratic President.",
