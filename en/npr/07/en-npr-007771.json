        "But there are reports the FBI is now assisting with the investigation in Sri Lanka.",
        "Can you confirm that?",
        "That's right.",
        "We're working to support the government of Sri Lanka's investigation.",
        "We've brought all the resources we can to bear on it, including the FBI.",

        "Yes.",

        "And, of course, it's just heartbreaking that people were worshipping peacefully at Sunday services, that they were having an early Sunday morning breakfast.",
        "And this is the fate that befell them.",
        "These people are innocent.",
        "And I think, at this point, the government of Sri Lanka has declared a national day of mourning.",
        "And that's part of what we do need to focus on at this point - is making sure that we recognize the victims and support those who were injured, support the families that survived.",
        "This comes after a decade of peace in Sri Lanka after a long and violent civil war.",
        "What do these attacks portend for the country, do you think?",
        "That's right.",
        "This is a country that's engaged in reconciliation.",
        "I hope, as a result of everybody's efforts, that people can be resilient and look at the fact that these acts were not the acts of a whole community but of certain individuals.",

        "Normal People\"\" follows the relationship of two young students, Connell and Marianne, who share an intense affection for one another but cannot figure out just how to be together.",
        "Sally Rooney tells Rachel Martin that the character's relationship shapes their own identities.",
        "The opening phase of their relationship, when they're in secondary school, is, for various reasons, kept a secret.",
        "And even though that secrecy is in a way a little bit oppressive for both of them, I think it's also in a strange way kind of liberating because it means that their relationship is kept apart from the social world and kept protected from it, in a sense.",
        "And they find new ways to express themselves and to kind of carve out an identity or a sense of self just for one other person."

        "They don't really know themselves very well yet.",
        "And so, yeah, I think their intimacy is a really formative part of how they develop an identity in those years.",
        "They are each suffering in some way.",
        "Is that what continues to draw them to one another over time?",
        "Do they recognize that in each other?",
        "Yeah, I mean, it is certainly true that both of them suffer.",
        "But then, to what extent do they suffer more than others, you know?",
        "I mean, I think it's probably true that everyone around them is suffering too.",
        "And maybe they're not attuned to the suffering of other people as much as they are to their own.",
        "And maybe, at that age, for some reason they offer one another a window into each other's lives that, when they look around them at other people in their social lives, in their families, among their friends, they just don't seem to be able to see through other people in the same way that they can see through each other.",
        "So maybe it is that they can instinctively recognize that there is a commonality in the kind of suffering that they're experiencing and that they're just not able to recognize that commonality in other people, necessarily.",
        "I guess that's also what struck me, is that they don't seem that self-aware, which is kind of what it means to be an 18-year-old or a 20-year-old, that your own perception of your pain is all-encompassing and perhaps disproportionate to the kind of suffering or pain that other people have.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I definitely think there are moments in the book where their self-awareness fails hugely.",
        "And it may be, you know, because they are very young.",
        "I mean, they're almost children when we meet them.",
        "And then, when we leave them, they're 22.",
        "But it may also just be that that's what people are like - or, I suppose, that's what these people are like.",
        "I mean, I don't know, if we met Connell and Marianne down the road 20 years later, that they wouldn't necessarily still be trying to learn some of the same lessons.",
        "Like, I don't think that it's necessarily age-limited.",
        "It may just be individual-limited, in the sense that that's just the kind of people that they are, I think.",
        "I'd like to ask about two specific pivot points in the plot.",
        "Connell and Marianne grow up together in the same community, and they are affected by the social strata that puts them into various groups, locks them there.",
        "What happens when they go to college?",
        "They end up going to the same place, right?",
        "Right.",
        "So Marianne has kind of convinced Connell to apply for the same university that she's going to, which is the university in Dublin.",
        "And he does.",
        "Then their relationship, in the meantime, has completely fallen apart.",
        "So they're not even on speaking terms, but they both end up going to the same university.",
        "And of course, inevitably, because Dublin is small and because this college is small, they do run into one another.",
        "And when they do, they're meeting each other in a very different social context with, you know, having developed kind of different identities in the meantime.",
        "So Marianne, who was a social pariah in secondary school, has now become a little bit popular, almost celebrated, whereas Connell, who had so many things going for him in school, finds that the particular forms of masculinity - I suppose, specifically working-class masculinity - just isn't really available for exchange in this social environment.",
        "It's just not working for him.",
        "And he feels, like, very confused and puzzled as to why he can no longer trade on the same kinds of charisma that apparently were so effective when he was in school, and he does feel very lost.",
        "So the social positions that they were in seemed to have almost exchanged themselves completely."

        "And during that period, they're both suffering, I think, not simply or not even primarily because they're apart.",
        "But it does mean that the kinds of suffering that they encounter, they don't necessarily have the same coping mechanism they might have if they were together because they're so used to sort of having each other on hand to work through all the various crises they encounter, many of which are caused by one another.",
