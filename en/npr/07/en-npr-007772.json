        "They saw some evidence of a mass at a certain energy level.",
        "Well, what we were looking for, yes, is let me just say this: We had a range of Higgs masses that we think are possible.",
        "We don't know - if we don't know if the Higgs exists, but if it exists, it has to exist in a certain range of masses.",
        "And we use the units of the proton mass.",
        "So somewhere between roughly 114 and 600 times the proton mass was open, except for about 20 units around 160 that was ruled out by Ferme Lab in Chicago.",
        "So we started looking there.",
        "And depending where you're looking, the Higgs kind of manifests itself in different ways, by what it decays to.",
        "And so we looked for those kinds of events that looked like Higgs decays, and remarkably, in just one year, that whole 500 GEV range, that 500 times the proton mass range, we've narrowed it down to just 14, 13 or 14 units now.",
