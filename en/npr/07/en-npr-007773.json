        "And there were rumors this week that Governor David Paterson of New York was about to resign in the midst of a scandal we've never seen the likes of.",
        "Well, I hate rumors, and we should know better than to report on rumors, but it's become more than that.",
        "First of all, the New York Times is allegedly working on this horrific story about David Paterson, that either talks about sex or drugs or that he kidnapped the Lindbergh baby or whatever it is.",
        "But the thing is, it's just rumors.",
        "And of course, the New York Daily News and the New York Post is going with it - went with it on the front page.",
        "Rumors abound, Paterson may quit, he's under siege, blah, blah, blah.",
        "And then, rather than ignore it, Governor Paterson held a press conference to say these rumors are despicable - which they are, because they're just rumors - and I'm not resigning.",
        "The only way I'm going to go out is either by the election - ballot box or in a box itself, but I'm not leaving office any other way.",
        "And of course, once you dignify rumors by holding a press conference, as the Clintons did in \"\"60 Minutes,\"\" you know, 1992, it becomes a story, and so everybody jumps on it as it becomes a news story.",
        "And it becomes well, and we're still waiting there are various reports that story was going to appear on Monday, then again today.",
        "So far, nothing.",
        "And he demanded the weirdest thing is that Governor Paterson demanded the Times apologize - and apologize for what?",
        "For something it hasn't done.",
        "It hasn't done yet.",
        "So, you know, it's a very ugly situation in New York.",
        "Paterson has been treading on thin ice for the longest time.",
        "I don't know if anybody treads on thin ice.",
        "It's an expression I've just made up, but...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It just seems like he's in big trouble, and of course, waiting in the wings is Andrew Cuomo, the state attorney general, whom everybody expects will be the Democratic nominee for governor, including the White House because the White House has made it clear they don't want Paterson to run again because they don't feel he could win, and Cuomo of course is saying nothing about this, nor should he have to because everybody is doing his job for him."

        "And when I interviewed Congressman Ehlers, you could just see the pain in his face, the pain in his heart for what's happened to members of Congress.",
