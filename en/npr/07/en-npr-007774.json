        "Anyway, let's go.",
        "Quickly, we have to remember Jack Murtha, the powerful Democrat from Pennsylvania, who died this past week.",
        "Right, he died on Monday at the age of 77.",
        "He was perhaps, even when the Republicans held control of the House, Jack Murtha, a very, very powerful member of the Appropriations Committee, especially on defense spending.",
        "He made national headlines in 2005 when he, a long-time supporter of the war effort, said that this war in Iraq is a mistake, we should pull out the troops, and he just, you know, completely switched his views on a lot of things.",
        "It looks like there will be a special election for his seat on May 18.",
        "We'll have more on that later.",
        "Of course, also when we come back, we're going to focus on a couple of other developments, the fallout from the Illinois primary.",
        "Plus, Don Gonyea will join us to talk about last week's Tea Party convention, and more Ken Rudin, of course.",
        "...'Cause it's a lot - 'cause this stuff is not easy.",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",

        "It's Wednesday.",
        "Ken Rudin, our political junkie, joins us from his home in Maryland, where, thanks to the blizzard, he may be running out of milk and eggs - never runs out of political news, though.",
        "In just a couple of minutes, we're going to be focusing on the Tea Party convention.",
        "If you attended, if you watched it on TV, give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email talk@npr.org.",
        "But first to Illinois where, last week, voters went to the polls.",
        "They chose Republican and Democratic candidates for the Senate seat once held by President Obama now held by Roland Burris, and they voted on candidates for governor, too.",
        "And joining us now from his home in the well, home sort of, home away from home in the Tribune Tower in Chicago, is Rick Pearson, political correspondent for the Chicago Trib.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Mr.�RICK PEARSON (Political Correspondent, Chicago Tribune): Thanks, Neal.",
        "And it was home last night, I understand.",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Actually, it's been home for quite some time with the way we still have unresolved results when it comes to the Republican nominee for governor, and we've had quite some turmoil as the ticket on the Democratic side is still taking shape."

        "Well, why don't we deal with first things first: The Republican side still too close to call?",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Still within about 400 votes between the top two contenders.",
        "And now it looks like, as absentee ballots are still being counted, as well as voters who maintained they lived at their residence, but there's no proof of their registration, those have to be sorted through.",
        "So we're still looking at a couple of weeks away before we even move to the point of whether the second-place finisher is looking for a recount.",
        "In the meantime, the Democratic nominees for lieutenant governor, well, he won, but then he lost.",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Yes, he did.",
        "Scott Lee Cohen, who was a little-known pawnbroker who spent about two million in personal funds, was able to basically run a big advertising blitz that swamped a number of competitors in his first win for public office, but it didn't last very long.",
        "Well, he was found to have had a couple of skeletons in the closet.",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Well, he had some issues involving domestic battery involving an ex-girlfriend, who was convicted of prostitution.",
        "He had a divorce file in which his wife claimed that he was abusing anabolic steroids, which created a series of rage tendencies.",
        "And most interestingly enough, as he's spending this $2 million to win the campaign, the same day that he dropped $300,000 for political mailings, the ex-wife filed for $54,000 in back child support.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And so he was fairly gracious, though, in his withdrawal.",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Well, yes, and basically, Democratic leaders told him that if you think the attention you're getting now is bad, it's only going to get worse.",
        "And he said that due to the effects and pressure on his family, he agreed to withdraw.",
        "And Ken, we think of Illinois, at least in recent years, as a blue state, but maybe not."

        "Well, it had been a red state for the longest time, until there was Republican scandals.",
        "George Ryan comes to mind, the former governor - that gave us Rod Blagojevich in 2002.",
        "And now we have Rod Blagojevich's trial coming up on June 3.",
        "The last thing the Democrats want to be reminded of I think the best quote I saw was Scott Lee Cohen saying, talking about the ex-girlfriend who was a prostitute, he says: I thought she was a massage therapist.",
        "I mean, that's a line that's going to last in political lore forever.",
        "So on the Republican side, is there any betting at this point to which of the candidates is going to emerge?",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Well, right now, with the 400-vote difference and the fact technology has gotten so much better, it's not you know, it used to be, like, 5,000 votes would be an automatic recall.",
        "I mean, we're talking 400 votes.",
        "I think the loser in this would be apt to go for recount, but they still have to pay for it.",
        "But right now, ahead is Bill Brady, he's a state senator from Central Illinois, and basically he was able to get down-state support while five other candidates from the Chicago area carved up the vast population area.",
        "So this could be this could get ugly before it's over, too.",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Absolutely.",
        "So far, it's been very quiet, very gentile, but you know, when we start getting into the real nuts and bolts of vote-counting, thankfully no hanging chads, but it could get very ugly.",
        "Can I just add one thing quickly?",
        "The problem for the Republicans is that you'd think that they would be able to take advantage of the Pat Quinn narrow primary victory, the Scott Lee Cohen problems, the alleged problems about the Senate candidate Giannoulias, but they don't have a Republican nominee for governor who can take advantage of it.",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Right, there's no point person to be that Republican spokesman, much like, you know, that's kind of been an issue on the national level.",
        "Well, are the Democrats then taking advantage of this opportunity, trying to sprint out to a lead here?",
        "Mr.�PEARSON: Well, there really isn't much they can do because to fill the Scott Lee Cohen vacancy, they basically have to wait until March 5, when they know what the who the members of the Democratic State Central Committee, the governing board governing the congressional districts, their votes are certified by the state on March 5.",
        "After that, then we go into the process of they have to select who replaces Scott Lee Cohen on the ballot."

        "It was $549 to register for the three-day event, and again, the organizers say they weren't looking for massive crowds.",
        "This wasn't like the rally on the Mall, where they're looking for tens or hundreds of thousands of people to show up, but they had so many slots, they had 600 slots, and they tell us they sold them all at that $549 price tag.",
        "Separately, you had the Sarah Palin keynote speech at dinner Saturday night.",
        "If you had registered for the event, you got to go to that, but if you just wanted to come see former Governor Palin speak, that was a $349 ticket."

        "So this was a rather well-to-do Tea Party gathering, and as such, and in part because it was a convention and not a rally, it did not have, you know, a lot of the energy, a lot of the aggression that we have all come to associate with the Tea Party at those very loud town hall meetings and at, you know, any number of events they've held in small towns and on the Washington Mall in D.C.",
        "Was there much of an effort to establish organizations to build this as a structure?",
        "Yes and no. Everybody there spoke about how they, well, while they came to this convention, they weren't necessarily aligning themselves with Tea Party Nation.",
        "There are a lot of different Tea Party groups out there, some national, some not.",
        "Most people I talked to said they were going to go back to their community, and if they were involved in a group there, then that's the group they'll be affiliated with.",
        "They came to the convention to learn new skills, to learn organizing skills, to learn media skills, to learn how to defeat liberals, as one of the sessions covered.",
        "So it was not so much a big this is the new national Tea Party organization, but the group that organized this event, and again, this was a for-profit event, did set up a political action committee and a separate 501(c)(4) nonprofit entity to raise money and money that they say will be channeled into getting conservatives elected, Tea Party-friendly candidates elected.",
        "Ken?",
        "Well, I guess the big question that I have is: What's the long, lasting impact of this party?",
        "We saw, of course, in 1992, Ross Perot, and he got, you know, the 19 million votes, and he excited a lot of people, but there was no national Perot movement.",
        "There was a Reform Party that didn't seem to go anywhere.",
        "The question is whether these, the Tea Party people go home, and do they organize a third party, do they try to influence the Republican Party?",
        "What's the long-range impact of the party?",
        "And there is no clarity on that question after this convention.",
        "I talked to a lot of people about that, and some say they definitely want a third party.",
        "They want to see the Tea Party on the ballot.",
        "But others would just as quickly say hey, that just divides the vote, probably takes votes away from Republicans and makes it more likely for Democrats to win some of these close races.",
        "So they would say they want the Tea Party to be active, trying to make sure that Democrats and Republicans, Republicans and Democrats, nominate candidates to their liking."
