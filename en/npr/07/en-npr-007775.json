        "But that seemed to be the predominate view, that they can have an impact and that contested primaries are a really great thing and it'll keep the Republican Party mostly honest, in their view.",

        "Hi, I just want to make a statement that, you know, I feel like this whole idea of Tea Party has been kind of (unintelligible) and carjacked, really, because I wanted to vote for Ron Paul back in the last election, and I'm an independent - I did end up voting for Obama.",
        "But you know, I'm a constitutionalist, Im for fiscal conservatism, but this whole idea of the Tea Party has been kind of hijacked and it's now being used and moved forward by conservative Republicans and radicals and - that don't really follow the heart of what Ron Paul was about.",
        "Ron Paul, of course, at one time the libertarian presidential candidate, ran for the Republican nomination last time around, and of course did not get it.",
        "That was John McCain.",
        "But his name is - and libertarianism that he represents, Don Gonyea, often raised in connection with the Tea Party movement and, of course, his son Rand Paul.",
        "Right.",
        "And, yeah, Ron Paul was not at this event.",
        "There were some former Republican officeholders there, certainly Governor Palin, Tom Tancredo, the former congressman from Colorado who ran for president on, really, basically on an anti-immigration platform.",
        "But you did not see people sporting Ron Paul buttons or talking about Ron Paul as a way for this party to go forward at that three-day event down there in Nashville."

        "But what are they for?",
        "Did they figure that out down there in Nashville?",
        "They did not.",
        "What they say is they are for less government, a smaller government, a less intrusive government.",
        "They also say they are for, you know, a very strict interpretation of what the Constitution is.",

        "Incidentally, you know, we heard things like that about President Bush as well.",
        "So this is not a new thing to hear about a president, but it is absolutely true.",
        "I mean, predominantly when you talk to people, you know, the first thing out of their mouth would be the smaller government, you know, (unintelligible) Tea Party - T-E-A stands for taxed enough already.",
        "So they would talk about that but - and that's how they portray their movement.",
        "But when you get into these workshops, and they did let the press in to workshops - it was initially going to be a closed event and they let us in and they let us watch, you know, someone would stand up and say, I'm from Hawaii.",
        "And then they would reach into their pocket and they would hold up a piece of paper and they would say, this is what a real Hawaii birth certificate looks like.",
        "And of course they're raising the whole question that President Obama was born in Kenya or not born in the United States or somewhere.",
        "And the cheers that go up in the room at that moment are, you know, very spontaneous, very loud, very enthusiastic.",
        "So they certainly love those kind of topics as well.",

        "And Don, obviously everybody knew Sarah Palin was speaking there, but there were some other people addressing this convention as well, among them Tom Tancredo - was immigration a theme?",
        "Again, it was not an overt theme of the week, except when Tom Tancredo - he gave the opening night speech at the opening kind of reception that they had, the opening gathering.",
        "And, again, he was cheered when he called President Obama Barack Hussein Obama.",
        "And when he said that he had been elected, he called them - and I'm going to forget now - a committed ideologue socialist who was elected by people who can't even read the word vote in English or spell it.",
        "And again, thunderous applause at that point."
