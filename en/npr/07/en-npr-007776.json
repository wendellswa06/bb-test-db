        "And so where hoping that whereas this year in some sense we - each experiment had something like 350 trillion proton-proton collisions, next year we'll have something like four or five times that many.",
        "And so we should make more of these Higgs, and if there's something there, it will become statistically significant.",
        "So why not wait until it was statistically significant?",
        "Why come out with this tantalizing little hint?",
        "Is it something to tide us over the wintertime so we can wait for it to power up again in February?",
        "Well, it's actually the way we do things at some level.",
        "There's a - whenever the machine goes down - or actually more generally, about two times per year, we like to go through our data and understand it as well as we can and present it publicly.",
        "And so this is sort of a normal process.",
        "This is a little earlier than usual, it's normally in February or March, but because of the excitement over this search, it was of great interest for us to do this now.",
        "And the fact that we narrowed down this range that I told you about, that we've kind of begun to eliminate 490 units of the 500 units of this range, is a huge achievement, actually.",
        "You have to realize that for 30 or 40 years, we've been looking, and it's - you know, we were moving at a snail's pace.",
        "But this machine is so fantastic, it allowed us to really make great progress in just one year, and I think the community at large was very excited to see that we've made such progress.",
        "But it's possible you could never get past this stage of - you can continue to run and not come up with anything more statistically significant and not find the Higgs Boson?",
        "No, we will definitely come up with something more statistically significant.",
        "We're very confident of that.",
        "Now, the thing is that there's a possibility that we don't see it, it's just not there, and the theories are wrong, or at least the standard model version of the Higgs theory is wrong, and it has to be something else.",
        "That would be good, too.",
        "That would be good, too, because, you know, we - we're here as experimentalists.",
        "Our job is to really view nature.",
        "We're not making any prejudgments about it.",

        "That's right, that's right, and that's why we need these experiments.",

        "Well, we're tentatively targeting having additional results in the summer, probably in July, and we're hoping by that time to have maybe twice as much data as we have now.",
        "And then by the end of the year, and perhaps right at the end of the year or shortly thereafter, we'll have another doubling.",
        "So we'll go to four times the data that we have right now, roughly speaking, and at that point we are pretty confident that we'll be able to really focus in on this thing.",

        "But let me just add that there is a lot of interest in what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker have to say about what is going on right now in Iraq.",
        "And so, while John McCain maybe a fairly dominant part of this programming tomorrow morning because he is in that position to make the second statement and to ask questions and interject whenever he wants, Hillary Clinton is not going to show up at this hearing, at least as a questioner, until late in the morning, and she will be very restricted.",
        "And in the afternoon, Barack Obama's in an even more - an inferior position on the committee, so it's entirely possible that the news will win out.",
        "Well, Ron, the last time these two men, David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, were on Capitol Hill, there were some fireworks, some grilling by the Democrats.",

        "Does it mean we're going to have to stay at this higher troop level indefinitely for years and years?",
        "Now, turning to campaign news, a lot has been made over Hillary Clinton's chief strategist Mark Penn stepping down in the wake of his private sector work for the Columbian government.",
        "Is this going to have any effect on the Clinton campaign, on her strategy?",
        "I can't see how it would fail to have some effect.",
        "He has been her chief strategist, not just in this campaign for the last months or year, but really, at many critical points in her political career back over the last dozen years.",
        "He has been a pollster for her, a strategist for her, he has largely developed her message, and he is credited, rightly or wrongly, with developing the idea of her running as an incumbent.",
        "That was a strategy that made a certain amount of sense, certainly last year it looked like an inevitability campaign that would work.",
        "But when it started to break down, it quickly became a kind of albatross around her neck.",
        "So with Mark out of the way, there isn't a lot of time for a huge sea change, but there will probably be some subtle shifts, some changes in tone, and, perhaps, we may start to hear Hillary Clinton starting to act as though she's someone who is weighing her options down the road and realizes she may not get this nomination.",
        "Well, how unusual is it for a campaign staffer, a high profile campaign staffer, I mean, after all, he was making millions of dollars working for the Clinton campaign, to hold this other job and to actively work while he is working on the campaign?",
        "After all, David Axelrod, a consultant to Obama, also has a PR firm.",
        "He does, and he handles some clients such as AT&T and some cable companies and some others in Chicago.",
        "It tends to be more of a localized operation, whereas Burson-Marsteller, which Mark Penn was running, is an international concern.",
        "It's a global concern.",
        "It's one of the biggest.",
        "So he was a walking - a source of difficulty and embarrassment, but it never really made it to the front page until this Columbia incident where he was lobbying to pass a Columbian trade agreement which, incidentally, this very day President Bush is announcing he's going to send to Congress.",
        "He was lobbying to pass that trade agreement at the very same time that Hillary Clinton was in Pennsylvania saying she opposed it.",
        "So it finally hit the fan, and he had to go.",
