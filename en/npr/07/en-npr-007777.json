        "And also joining us, Linda Chavez is here with me in Studio 3A.",
        "She is a writer, a broadcaster and chair of the Center for Equal Opportunity, who wrote this: Affirmative action perpetuates race obsession that harms all Americans regardless of color.",
        "Thank you very much for joining us today, Linda.",
        "Thank you, John.",
        "So I would like to ask each of you to do a very brief mission statement for me.",
        "And that is to go back in time to the origins of affirmative action - back then, looking forward, to take one sentence - at most two - to state what the goal of affirmative action was when it was created.",
        "Let's start first with you, Linda.",
        "Well, first of all, you have to remember it was a half-century ago that affirmative action first began, and it began at a time in which discrimination, not just private discrimination but state-sponsored discrimination, was pervasive.",
        "The goal of affirmative action was not just to eliminate discrimination, but to try to cast a wider net, and to provide opportunities for those who had suffered past discrimination to be able to get the skills and training necessary to be able to compete on an equal footing.",
        "All right, and that's without talking about where we are today.",
        "Again, for you now, Boyce Watkins, the same exercise, to go back in time.",
        "What was the goal?",
        "What was the mission at the beginning?",
        "Well, I think the mission is interpreted in different ways by different people.",
        "But I would say that the goal of affirmative action was to make things right - to make America a country that is more consistent with its value systems; to try to make America into the country that it would have been had we not had a 400-year period in which one group was subjugated to the mercy of another.",
        "I think that the broader objective is not just to eliminate discrimination but to actually eliminate racial inequality - which is a product of discrimination, you see, because you can have racial inequality even when there are no racists in the building.",
        "When you look at American institutions, and you look at the divergent power structures, you see that there are many corporations, organizations, universities, etc., to this day, that haven't hired or promoted a person of color..."

        "All right, Boyce, I want to stop you because I don't want to get to this-day point quite yet.",
        "But I do want to get there.",
        "OK.",
        "And in fact, I want to give Linda a chance to go back and actually begin to address this day because the question that we want to put to you, and that you were getting to, was whether or not we are done; has the mission been carried out.",
        "And that's what we want to put to you, our listeners, as well.",
        "We want to ask you to think about that.",
        "Tell us whether in your view, affirmative action has achieved its aims.",
        "And you've heard it described now in two ways - one more narrowly, and one more broadly.",
        "And if it hasn't achieved its aims, what will it take for us to reach that point?",
        "Linda Chavez, has - as you outlined the goal of affirmative action, has it done what it was supposed to do?",
        "No, it hasn't because it got derailed, and it got derailed pretty early.",
        "It got derailed during the Nixon administration, when we went away from sort of race-neutral policies and towards providing, as I said, the kind of skills and training necessary to take those who had been victims of discrimination - and be able to give them the skills to be able to compete, and to do so in a non-discriminatory fashion.",
        "What happened is, there was a movement, really, to replace one kind of discrimination with another; and to try to - instead of taking race out of the equation, to make race the central point of the equation so that in order to achieve what Professor Watkins has described - to achieve that representation that he's talked about - there were preferences that were then given to people who had been members of groups that had been discriminated, although the individuals receiving those preferences may have suffered no discrimination in the past themselves.",
        "All right, Boyce Watkins, your crack at the present day.",
        "Has affirmative action come anywhere close to addressing what it was intended to address?",
        "I think the question answers itself.",
        "I think anybody who thinks that we can solve a 400-year pattern of systemic discrimination with 20 years of good behavior is absolutely delusional.",
        "I think that if you look at our society, if you look at the human rights abuses that have been documented by the United Nations, it's been made very clear, and it's known throughout the world, that the United States is still a two-tiered society.",
        "If you look at quality-of-life factors such as education, economic equality, mass incarceration, etc., you see that people of color still live a very different reality from people whose ancestors were not subject to discrimination."

        "They were not able to leave wealth to me.",
        "They were not able to give me power to inherit.",

        "And Linda, correct me if I'm getting this - correctly.",
        "I think your critique is, you don't necessarily disagree that that overhang is there, but what you are saying is that affirmative action as a tool has not actually worked.",
        "And I think Boyce Watkins is saying we need to have it work more.",
        "Well, that's right, and let me be clear about this.",
        "I am not saying that we have actually reached the Promised Land yet.",
        "We haven't.",
        "I mean, there is still discrimination.",
        "There's still prejudice in our society.",
        "We haven't totally eliminated it.",
        "But the way to get about solving that - there is, you know, as Boyce talks about, there is a skills gap in America.",
        "There is an education gap.",
        "There - it is an unfortunate fact that a lot of black and Latino - and by the way, poor white kids - go to schools that do not prepare them sufficiently to be able to succeed in the world.",
        "But granting preference on the basis of skin color, regardless of whether that individual child has suffered from the effects of that discrimination, makes no sense to me.",
        "Why is it you would prefer a black child who might be the son or daughter of - you know, a lawyer and a doctor, over a white child who may be the child of an out-of-work mine worker?",
        "To move to our topic, then, Linda Chavez, do you have a solution to the kind of problem that Boyce Watkins is staying is - still persists?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Which would be what?",
        "We do have to focus on education.",
        "We have to do more in trying to close that skills gap.",
        "But the way to do it is not to, you know, put it under the rug, to sweep it under the rug so that we don't have evidence of it.",
        "And unfortunately, what colleges and universities do when they have these dual admission standards - where they basically allow students in who have less qualifications, to get in based on skin color - is that they actually hide the evidence of this miseducation that's going on in so many of our school systems."

        "Boyce Watkins, in taking on your point that we're nowhere close to having affirmative action having concluded - having succeeded in meeting its goal, what would be the world in which it has completed its mission?",
        "What would that world look like?",
        "What are the goalposts here?",
        "Well, theoretically speaking, a world in which affirmative action has succeeded is a world that the United States - or it's a country that we would have had, had we not had 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow ...",
        "Right, but ...",
        "..and oppression of a group of people.",
        "So it's going to take a long time to try to create anything that looks like that world.",
        "I know that - it's easy to sort of talk about, you know, discrimination and to sort of say look, the elimination of discrimination is the objective of affirmative action.",
        "But the truth is that one of the biggest mistakes, I think, that we make when we talk about affirmative action is, we think that it all stops with discrimination - or the creation of equal opportunity.",
        "And actually, the real culprit is the actual inequality, which is a product of discrimination.",
        "So it's not a matter of pointing fingers at people and saying ha, you're a racist, that's - you're bad.",
        "It's a matter of saying no, you can have inequality when there is not a racist person anywhere in sight.",

        "But to come to my question, you're saying you don't - you're not really sure what that world would look like, except in the negative.",
        "It wouldn't look like the world that we have now, but - and you say it's a long time.",
        "So it's - you're - it's quite an open-ended thing, as you describe it, going forward.",
        "Well, I don't think it's entirely open-ended.",
        "I think that you can have deliberate measuring sticks.",
        "For example, if you're looking at a corporation and the percentage of managers of color, well, look at the population.",
        "Is that number anywhere near the population that is, you know, reflective of the community at large?",
