        "Our guests are Linda Chavez, who is chair of the Center for Equal Opportunity; and Boyce Watkins, founder of Your Black World Coalition.",
        "And Boyce Watkins at Syracuse University, just before the break, Linda Chavez was opining that your view, and your vision, for affirmative action relies on - I think she said a rather utopian outcome, where everyone is equal in all ways.",
        "And really, you needed a chance to respond to that.",
        "So here's your chance.",
        "I've never sought out a perfect, utopian society.",
        "But we can't settle for a vastly and undeniably imperfect society, either.",
        "We can't look at a society where there are remnants everywhere of this historical discrimination and just sort of say oh, well, we know we've been beating on you and battering you for 400 years, but now we're just not going to - we're not going to harm anyone anymore, and everyone should treat everyone the same.",
        "And if you somehow ask for some sort of - of any form of reparation for what's happened to your descendants, and what created the society we live in today, then somehow you're being a racist.",
        "You're being just as bad as we were when we did this thing to you.",
        "And so I think that to somehow say that we're going to eliminate 400 years of undeniable racial inequality by simply saying we're not going to allow for discrimination anymore, that's like me saying that the milk I spilled on the floor is going to clean itself up because I promise not to spill any more milk.",
        "But bottom line, Boyce...",
        "You have to deal...",
        "Bottom line, though - I'm sorry to interrupt because - I had heard you make that point before.",
        "I just want to get - bottom line, do you think that affirmative action, as a tool, is working?",
        "I think that it's working.",
        "I think that when we allow it to work, it does work.",
        "I was a product of affirmative action.",
        "I know lots of people who never would have gotten interviews, never would have gotten opportunities, had the organizations not been forced to consider people of color.",
        "There are successful coaches in the NFL who never would have gotten a chance had the organization not been forced - say, through the Rooney Rule and other sorts of mechanisms - to even take a look at that person.",
        "So I think that to say that this isn't working, or somehow it's reverse discrimination - I think that's a little bit silly.",
        "All right, we want to have our listeners join this conversation now, and Rick(ph) in Sacramento has been on hold for a little bit.",
        "Rick, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION."

        "Hi, thanks, I love the show.",
        "Sure, and what's your question?",
        "I was just going to comment, really.",
        "Like, here in Sacramento, where I live, you know, the majority - it's a very diverse city, and there's all different walks and backgrounds.",
        "But yet when you go to the university here in town, the majority of the student population are white - you know, Caucasian kids.",
        "And me being Hispanic, myself, you know, being subject to affirmative action, me getting into the school, when the reality of only, you know, a small percentage of the whole population of the school being Hispanic or black, and the rest of them being white - I feel that affirmative action still needs to take a course where the real results of affirmative actions aren't really going to take place until, you know, those numbers, you know, the next generation of kids come in, and the numbers are more equally diverse in comparison to the population.",
        "OK, so for you, we're done when the numbers in the schools are more balanced - more in balance with the larger...",
        "Well, yes, definitely, definitely.",
        "You can't show those numbers unless the population reflects the amount of kids actually going to that school or not.",
        "Well, actually, the voters of California got rid of racial preferences back in 1996, with an initiative that was on the ballot there.",
        "And guess what happened to college admissions in California after that?",
        "There are actually more Latino and more black students.",
        "And by the way, I'm very glad the listener brought in Latinos, because Boyce has talked about this as entirely a kind of black and white issue.",
        "In fact, Latinos are the largest minority now.",
        "And for many of those Latinos, there's not 400 years of discrimination in this country.",
        "Now, my family happens to have been here that long, but most Latino families have not.",
        "You're talking about many people who just arrived, or who have only been here a generation or at most, two generations.",
        "So this whole idea of doing something now to give people preference based on a history of discrimination in the United States doesn't equally apply to all the groups who are now its beneficiaries.",
        "And moreover, if you look at California, the new system, which is more race-neutral, has actually had better outcomes.",
        "More kids of Latino and black heritage are going to school, and more of them, by the way, are graduating because they're ending up in schools for which their qualifications actually make them able to compete."

        "Sometimes, you know, the blacks would get preferential treatment, or the Latinos or whatever - back then, we called them Hispanics.",
        "Because the - it was not just only an attempt to redress past ills, but to establish habits and a presence of minorities in the student body so that in the future, we could have those people grow up to have kids in a college-filled household, with college-minded priorities and sensibilities.",
        "So you're saying it worked?",
        "Russ, are you saying, then, that it worked?",
        "It did.",
        "Now, it needs to continue to work.",

        "No, he wouldn't have gotten elected if he'd been unable to string together a coherent sentence.",
        "There is a lot of work yet to do.",
        "And until we come up with something better - like California, or whatever - we still need some form of affirmative action, I think.",
        "So you lean more towards Boyce Watkins, then, in this discussion?",
        "Well, it's kind of half-and-half, because it needs major improvement.",
        "But I don't think that California's 1996 initiative would have had as positive a set of results if you hadn't had a foundation built by double A before that.",
        "If you want to address other things, how about a subculture that despises and ostracizes people who speak the English language coherently instead of innercity jargon?",
        "We have a lot of work to do everywhere.",
        "But I think double A currently is better than the alternative of no double A."

        "No, it's not a perfect tool.",
        "It's certainly not a perfect tool.",
        "But what I'm trying to figure out is which studies - why were - you know, we must be reading different studies because the studies that I've seen, like in diverse issues of higher education, tell me that the enrollment numbers for African-American students in California and Texas declined dramatically as a result of passing these bans on affirmative action.",
        "So I haven't seen - from all the scholars that I talk to on a regular basis, they haven't said anything good about the impact of banning affirmative action.",
        "And so I'm trying to figure out where these numbers Ms. Chavez is referencing are coming from.",
        "Well, you can Google it and in fact, there have been major news stories going back to the late 1990s, about the increase in the number of students.",
        "But it's more important than the number that get in the front door.",
        "It's also important how many get out the back door, and actually receive a degree.",
        "And one of the problems with programs that give preference to people who have lower grades, lower test scores, and may not be as able to compete in a very elite school like the University of California at Berkeley is that they may not graduate.",
        "And under the race-neutral programs that have been in effect since then, what we've seen is a much higher graduation rate of students who are actually getting their degree - because maybe they don't end up at Berkeley.",
        "Maybe they end up at University of California-Davis or Santa Barbara or even UCLA, although that's one of the top-tier.",
        "But Linda, Russ' point was that he went to school in an era where he felt the work that affirmative action was actually doing needed to be done.",
        "He said that base needed to be put down there.",
        "He's essentially saying the tool worked, and the tool worked effectively.",
        "And you have said it's a bad tool; it's an ineffective tool.",
        "Was it a better tool at one time?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The idea of affirmative action, as I said at the onset of the program, was to cast a wider net.",
        "And what Boyce was talking about, in terms of his job, was exactly that.",
        "You do want employers, you want colleges to go out and find students and employees who they might not otherwise have found.",
        "That's the first step.",
        "And the second step is if you find that there aren't enough qualified people in the pool, then you try to create programs to increase the likelihood that you're going to have people with the skills.",
        "All of that part of affirmative action is absolutely fine.",
        "And if we'd concentrated on that, I think we'd actually be farther ahead today than we are.",
        "What's not fine is when you give people preference - and particularly, when you give preference to people who may come from very privileged backgrounds themselves, and you discriminate against people who are quite disadvantaged.",
        "Asian-Americans, for example.",
        "I mean, the fact is, you know, people talk about all the white students in California.",
        "I don't know what campuses they've been on.",
        "I've spent a lot of time on campus.",
        "And this huge Asian population, many of these kids come from very poor backgrounds - first-generation or second-generation Americans.",
        "And yet, they are not given preference.",
        "They are actually, I believe, discriminated against on some campuses.",
        "And so this whole idea that we can make up for past discrimination by having a little bit of discrimination that maybe is going to have some sort of a positive impact, it just doesn't wash with me."
