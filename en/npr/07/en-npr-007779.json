        "I dealt with it when I was - when I benefited from affirmative action.",
        "But I'd rather have the job, and have people have an odd perception of me, than to never get the job in the first place, as my ancestors did - because I wasn't the first smart black guy to apply for a job at Syracuse University.",
        "I can also say that when you talk about these preferences and how it's discriminatory to somehow make up for past discrimination by casting a wider net across, you know, ethnicities, especially when you talk about African-Americans, who have - do have a unique experience in this country.",
        "I think it's interesting that we have this big problem with preferences in that context, but white kids were getting affirmative action long before the program was ever created.",
        "I see, in many cases, where there are legacies of individuals that are admitted to universities because their parents went to school here, or their parents had money to give to the school, or some other sort of benefit that comes from the fact that the campus, or that the institution, was built with social norms, systems, and an infrastructure that benefits white males over other people.",
        "For example, it's much easier to get mentorship from white males if you are a white male.",
        "So the bottom line is that if we don't start to honestly reflect on some of this, then we're never really going to make things right.",
        "And this idea that somehow helping minorities is taking something away from other people is incredibly problematic, because we didn't have a problem taking things away from minorities, but we certainly have a problem giving anything back.",

        "So I agree with both callers, to a certain extent.",
        "I believe the program is necessary, but I believe the focus, as it currently is directed, is kind of off.",
        "I think we need to get to kids younger so that they do become both - qualified applicants that don't need affirmative action to get to college.",
        "But the program needs to go further back.",
        "We need to find ways to counter the effects of institutionalized racism, but when these children are younger."

        "Yes.",
        "Which raises the question for me - is this - should affirmative action be focused on a class thing as opposed to a race thing?",
        "Well, I think there's a huge intersection of all of these now.",
        "I think a lot of times, we get focused on race.",
        "And I think very often, we have to look at, you know, other factors now.",
        "I think race is a thing, but we also have to look at income.",
        "And then you get into discussion of income versus wealth.",
        "We've had a lot of programs trying to focus on equalizing income, where the real problem may be intergenerational transfer of wealth, and not income.",
        "Because actually, intergenerational transfer of wealth has more of an effect on how far kids are going to go as far as education, whether they've - become professional or not.",
        "So we've gotten hung up on a lot of variables, whether it'd be race or income.",
        "And I do think we need to look at the intersectionality, that you have to look at all things.",

        "I think class has a lot to do with it.",

        "I think that class in America is - that is, ultimately, the driving force.",
        "I think that what's interesting is that historically, we designed a system where race becomes highly correlated with class, which is why you have to address the race problem in America if you want to move forward.",
        "I think that grabbing kids when they're young is certainly important; that's something that I do on a regular basis."

        "Why not?",
