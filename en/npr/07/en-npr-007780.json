        "A lot of House Democrats have just decided to run for other office or retire rather than wait around to advance up the ranks of leadership.",
        "Right.",
        "We should just point out, the younger generation of the House leadership on the Democratic side is, like, Steny Hoyer, who's - I can't remember how old he is; he is old - and people who've been around a really long time.",

        "Well, likeability is this funny thing because voters, when you ask them, well, do you care about likeability, they say no, but there are these sort of emotional connections voters get with candidates, and they seem to have a problem with Hillary Clinton.",
        "Having said that, there is some evidence that in some settings, when she actually gets a chance to present herself and not the caricature that has been put forward by her enemies or maybe some would say the media, she actually is able to convince people that she is likeable, or at least if not that, she would make a good president.",
        "Isn't there some irony here, John, that women - these are sort of the so-called soft issues, the issues that women are naturally considered better at, the likeability, the warmth, the congeniality, the sort of first lady personality.",
        "And Hillary Clinton has really done well on the stereotypical male attributes - strong foreign policy proposals, tough debater, that kind of thing.",
        "That's right.",
        "As one of her top aides said to me, it's kind of cool, she said, that Hillary wins all the guy categories.",
        "If you look at the polling, it's extraordinary.",
        "Democrats give her high marks, well above her opponents, on the questions of leadership, experience, skill in a crisis.",
        "And in other polls you see independents, and even all voters, giving her higher leadership marks than someone like John McCain.",
        "But then on the softer issues, yes, there is this question out there - the big question of the election will be whether voters really care and whether in a dangerous world, where there have been lots and lots of problems and will continue to be, whether voters really might more than in any other case before pay attention to those guy attributes, as Mrs. Clinton's staffer put it."
