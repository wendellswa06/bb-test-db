        "All right, let's talk to NPR's Julie McCarthy about all this.",

        "Hey, Julie.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "So have you seen these two leaders?",
        "Have they actually come out for a photo shoot or anything yet?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "There was an official welcome.",
        "And I've just come from that official welcome at the Malacanang Palace.",
        "And you know, it was full of pomp and ceremony.",
        "The anthems played, and then schoolchildren - hundreds of them just outside the gates - greeted Xi Jinping as his motorcade drove in.",
        "So it was short, and it was sweet.",
        "It was lovely.",
        "All right.",
        "So Steve outlined some of what is at stake in this meeting.",
        "But let's hear your take on this.",
        "What is the significance of these two leaders meeting right now?",
        "Well, for the Philippines, it's a historic time.",
        "This is the first time in 13 years that they will be throwing a state affair for a Chinese president.",
        "And arguably, it's very significant for - could be very significant for China because what this state visit helps solidify is Chinese rising influence in Southeast Asia, a region that was dominated, as Steve alluded to, by the United States not too long ago.",
        "Now - and all of that is taking place after a week where increasingly acrimonious U.S.-Chinese rivalry was on display and left leaders out here at an APEC summit ducking to get out of the way of an unusually nasty tone between the Americans and the Chinese.",
        "Now, President Trump was not here at these meetings, and that was interpreted by some as ceding to China this region.",
        "Certainly, the day here in Manila belongs to Xi Jinping, red carpets and all.",
        "So what does this mean for the ongoing, this long dispute about the South China Sea, where China has made these pretty expansive claims?",
        "And what are they offering?",
        "What could they get out of the Philippines?",
        "Well, you know, that's right.",
        "It is the flashpoint.",
        "It's one of the most sensitive flashpoints in Southeast Asia, and it's largely because of China's complete disregard for international law.",
        "They are occupying, after seizing, atolls and islands in the South China Sea that lie in Philippine waters.",
        "An international tribunal ruled in 2016 that China has no claim whatsoever to those waters, and it's in violation of them.",
        "What China is here to do is try to nail an agreement for jointly exploring oil and gas.",
        "It wants to legitimize what is seen as an illegitimate occupation here in the South China Sea.",
        "And Duterte would be an outlier if he agrees with it.",
        "No other country that claims waters in the same sea has signed any agreement to jointly explore with China for fear that it's going to lose its sovereign rights.",
        "All right, NPR's Julie McCarthy reporting for us this morning in Manila."

        "I mean, how often were people using Airbnb in the occupied West Bank?",
        "I mean, what's the reaction on the ground?",
