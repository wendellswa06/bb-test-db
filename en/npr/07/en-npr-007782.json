        "We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don't have.",
        "The United States right now has a trade deficit with the European Union of $151 billion.",
        "And the chancellor and I have discussed it today at length, and we're working on it.",
        "So, how does the EU see its strained relationship with the U.S.? The president says it's unfair.",
        "We'd like to hear your perspective.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Well, respectfully, I don't think we share that view because trade deficits and surpluses have many causes.",
        "Sometimes they can be caused by unfair trading conditions.",
        "That's certainly a common problem we have with China because we don't think that China plays entirely by the same rules as we do.",
        "But I think when it comes to the United States and Europe, we are both very open, very rules based, relatively low tariff-trading economies.",
        "And I don't think that American trade with Europe faces unfair obstacles.",
        "I think the source of the trade deficit is elsewhere.",
        "It lies in macroeconomic policy here in the United States.",
        "It lies in the consumer choices, the nature of what we import and export.",
        "And so, while we're more than willing and we understand that this is a problem for this administration, we're more than willing to sit down and see how we can address problems they have.",
        "But we also have some issues about exporting to the United States.",
        "So, I actually think the trading relationship is relatively balanced, but of course we value the relationship.",
        "And we would be willing to just sit down and discuss any problems that the U.S.",
        "side has on the understanding, of course, that we could also raise some problems we sometimes have.",
        "Well, Ambassador, we thank you for your time.",
        "We realize we've only just scratched the surface here.",
        "But before we let you go, you know, we've known that relations between the Trump administration and Europe have been strained over these issues that we've mentioned also, military spending by NATO allies, which the president also raised again yesterday and climate change.",
        "Do you think that the visits by the French and German leaders improve the working relationship at all?",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Yes, I think these kind of visits are hugely important.",
        "It was great to have the French president here for an official state visit celebrating the very long connections between France and the United States.",
        "The chancellor was here for a more businesslike shorter official visit.",
        "But again, another chance to develop personal relations because, at the end of the day, it's very important that these leaders understand each other, understand how they think.",
        "And I think these two visits will have done a lot to make this administration understand the European position and they will certainly take back to Europe a better understanding of the views of President Trump on many of these issues.",
        "This is a very positive development.",
        "That is David O'Sullivan.",
        "He is the European Union's ambassador to Washington.",
