        "Mr. ST. JOHN: I think there was a general feeling that things had started to slide in the wrong direction for the football team.",

        "I think Mike Shula was a coach who came from the NFL, which is an environment where you, you know, you're working with your peers essentially, the players, and you leave them alone to go do their own thing.",

        "Mr. ST. JOHN: There's no question that people in Alabama think of football as a sort of reflection of themselves.",
        "And in some ways they ask more of the football team than they would ever be willing to sort of commit in their own personal lives towards issues like discipline.",
        "They want the team to project an image of control, success, acumen on the field, and also a kind of charisma and panache.",

        "That's 1-800-989-TALK, and if you want more information about what we're talking about this hour, go to our website, www.sciencefriday.com, where you'll find links to our topic.",
        "So, I guess the first question, Martin Richards, is what kind of DNA were you sequencing?",
        "It wasn't the DNA from the nucleus of the cell, the whole genome which is what people usually think about when they think about inherited DNA.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "It was mitochondrial DNA, which is in the cytoplasm in the mitochondria, which are the energy units, or the batteries of the cell, where the respiration processes largely go on, and the important thing about mitochondrial DNA is that it's inherited down the maternal lines.",
        "So, you only get mitochondrial DNA from your mother.",
        "You don't get it from your father.",
        "So where the advantage of that - the disadvantages you're only learning about your maternal line of descent.",
        "But the advantage is that you get a clear picture of the maternal line of descent right away back through time, by comparing the mutational variation and the mitochondrial DNAs of different people.",
        "So this is - this whole notion of a mitochondrial Eve, that you could go back to the first woman by just figuring out what we're all descended from.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "So if you trace the variation back down the maternal line, right the way back to the common ancestor of all of the mitochondrial DNAs in the world, which is effectively the same as tracing the maternal geniality back through time, if you were to do that.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, by genealogical methods if you could go back two and a half - to 200,000 years, then you get back to the so-called mitochondrial Eve, who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago, you know.",
        "So you were able to get enough DNA from this mitochondrial - what remains of the mitochondrial cells in this guy's body, to get a - to complete sequence of the mitochondria?",
