        "So, this is just one wild, teenage party that got out of control.",
        "And then the prosecutor called me.",
        "I was about to go play basketball with my pickup basketball buddies, and I get a call from the prosecutor's office saying he's talked this over with the judge, and he knew I was a Frost scholar and a poet, and he thought that appropriate punishment for these kids, if you call it punishment, or reparations they could make for - to the community would be to come and study some poetry, Robert Frost specifically, with me.",
        "So, he asked if I'd meet them, you know, and in-court diversion and instruct them in the poetry of Mr. Frost.",

        "It doesn't.",
