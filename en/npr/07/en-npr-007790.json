        "Well, I really - at first, it just flashed in my head.",
        "I'm so used to be giving that kinds of fancy post-modern reading, but I realized these kids are at a very simple level here, and Frost is confronting one of the issues, that we have moral choices breaking in front of us at every moment.",

        "And I said, just be reflective about the choices you make.",
        "Think about them.",
        "And I said, what maturity and adulthood are about is somehow understanding the choices we made, coming to terms with them, maybe putting a spin on them, but also understanding that, until the second we're dead, we're making choices.",
        "That's what life is about.",
        "Let's get Jack on the line, Jack with us from Wake Forest in North Carolina.",
