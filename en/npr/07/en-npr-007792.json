        "And now for something that may sound like the beginning of a fairy tale.",
        "Deep inside a mountain on a remote island in the Svalbard archipelago, between continental Norway and the North Pole, there's a massive vault built into an icy mountain.",
        "It's a repository of seeds - hundreds of millions of seeds - everything from wheat and barley to the seeds of food crops most of us have never heard of, like prickly poppy and bastard cabbage.",
        "They're actually spare copies of seeds that are being stored away just in case diseases or pests wipe out our crops and we need to develop new ones.",
        "Cary Fowler is an adviser to the trust that manages this vault, and he's written a book about it called \"\"Seeds On Ice.\"\" He joins us from New York.",
        "Hi there, Cary.",
        "Hi, Allison.",
        "So I am so curious about this place.",
        "I mean, part of it is the allure of this remote location, close to the North Pole.",
        "What's it like to be at the Global Seed Vault?",
        "Can you describe it for me?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, when you step off the plane you know you're in a different place.",
        "The air is clean and wonderful, and you're just - a smile will come onto your face.",
        "It's an incredible landscape around there.",
        "And being in the seed vault itself is - it's an emotional experience.",
        "And it's a humbling experience because you're there amidst what is probably the largest collection of biodiversity in the world, certainly the largest collection of food crop biodiversity in the world.",
        "Now, I have read that there are seeds of 150,000 different types of wheat and rice, 15,000 different kinds of peanuts in the vault.",
        "I mean, who knew?",
        "Why do we need all these seeds?",
        "Well, there's no such thing as the best variety because obviously our agricultural crops are evolving and so are pest and diseases.",
        "So the diversity that we're holding in the seed vault is there to protect our natural resource in agriculture and to give us options for the future for plant breeding so that our crops can continue to evolve.",
        "And that's why we need as much of that diversity as we can gather and conserve.",
        "The more diversity we have, the more options we have for the future.",
        "I mentioned that there are lots of seeds of crops that we've never heard of - things like prickly poppy, bastard cabbage.",
        "What do you find to be some of the weirder things in the vault?",
        "Yeah, I've been working in this field for 35, 40 years, and there are things I'm saying what is that?",
        "You know, there's a rattlebox, zombie pea (ph), love-lies-bleeding - maybe I should know, but I really have no clue.",
        "But this is part of the fabric, the tapestry of agriculture in this world.",
        "So I gather that this vault works like a repository.",
        "Countries around the world store seeds there, and then if they want them back, they can request a withdraw.",
        "Has anyone ever made such a request to withdraw?"

        "Well, so far just once.",
        "And you're right, this works like a safety deposit box at the bank where a country or an institution will deposit a duplicate copy of the seeds that they're storing for their own purposes.",
        "And then, if something happens to their seed bank, then they have their duplicate copy and all is not lost.",
        "So the first time that we had to send seeds back was actually September last year.",
        "And what happened was that one of the major international collections of wheat, barley, lentils, chickpeas and a wonderful little crop called grass pea were being stored by this institute in a facility outside of Aleppo, Syria.",
        "And we all know what is happening in Aleppo these days and...",
        "Lots of violence there.",
        "Oh, it's terrible.",
        "So the scientists at this facility had to re-establish themselves, and they did that in two locations - one in Morocco and one in Lebanon.",
        "And so they requested a return of the seeds that they had stored.",
        "And we had worked, when Arab Spring first started, to get a safety duplicate copy of their collection up to Svalbard.",
        "And we succeeded in getting, I guess, the last batch of seeds out of Syria and into safety just a couple weeks before, really, all hell broke loose there.",
        "So are they using these seeds to grow out new crops, or do they just now have their seed bank restored?",
        "Well, they've taken a portion of the seeds that they deposited in this Svalbard.",
        "They took about 30,000 varieties.",
        "And they'll use that in their plant breeding programs.",
        "They'll reconstitute their entire seed bank.",
        "And they'll again multiply those seeds.",

        "Only five percent does.",
        "One out of every 20 containers get inspected.",
        "And the reality is that if you add to that security challenge, the foreign operation of ports, it just seems to me that you enhance the risk even greater.",
        "Isn't this contract already operated by a foreign company, a British company?",
        "It just happens that a company based in the United Arab Emirates is trying to acquire this British company.",
        "The difference is, is that the company that seeks to acquire the British company is owned by the government of Dubai, which is much different than a private company.",
        "When a government owns a corporate entity, it directs that corporate entity.",
        "And the reality is the United Arab Emirates has a troubling history.",
        "Two of the September 11th hijackers came from the United Arab Emirate.",
        "The 9/11 Commission Report cited that as being a financial base for al-Qaeda.",
        "And probably in the context of this issue that we are speaking about right now about port operations, one of the most troubling facts is that the United Arab Emirates was a transfer point for smuggled nuclear components sent by Pakistani scientists A.Q.",

        "So if they couldn't produce the security in their own country to stop the transiting of such nuclear components, why in God's name would we give them the operation of the ports?",

        "Well, if you understand terminal operations, and I have represented the Port of Elizabeth in Newark, which is the port of New York, for the last 13 years, in my previous role as a member of the House of Representatives it presided in my congressional district, you understand where a terminal operator, in fact, can have a significant impact on security.",
