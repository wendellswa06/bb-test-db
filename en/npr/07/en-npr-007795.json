        "Correct.",
        "And in fact, in my first piece I did a sidebar on the art of constructive compliments.",
        "And certainly bosses should be complimenting their employees, and there's ways to do it.",
        "You shouldn't just say oh, you're so wonderful.",
        "You should say your report was great for these reasons.",
        "You know, you had everybody riveted to what you had to say and, you know, people seemed to be changing their minds based on how your advice was sort of coming through.",
        "So there are ways to do it.",
        "And a lot a companies want to take the short route.",
        "You know, there's one company I wrote about - God bless them - maybe it's working for them, but they hired a celebration assistant who all day long fills helium balloons and passes them out to employees and throws confetti - I think it was 25 pounds of confetti a week - at the employees.",
        "Maybe, you know, maybe that's working for them, but maybe it also would work if they would set them down and say how do you think you're doing, let us tell you what we think you're doing.",
        "And that might be better than just this aimless stroking.",
        "Finally, this email from Samantha.",
        "I worked at a university and I as a young person, late twenties, felt like all the praising potluck celebration trinkets were really for the older person - 40-plus - they really seem to like it.",
        "I and my peers found it to be annoying and cheesy.",
        "There's somebody voting against that.",
        "Well, that's good.",
        "Well, you know, we're all human and we all love to be, you know, I hope I go home and my wife says - well, she's probably not listening - but I hope she says, oh, you were good on the radio there.",
        "So we all want it, obviously.",
        "But I didn't find that.",
        "The older generation, they want trinkets, too.",

        "Thirty-six years ago, tens of millions of Americans celebrated the first Earth Day at enormous rallies across the country.",
        "As a young man I broadcast that day from Union Square in New York City.",
        "I looked out onto a vast throng and saw such passion and purpose that I remember thinking, this fight is over.",
        "They've won.",
        "Within a few years, Congress passed critical legislation including the clean air, clean water, and endangered species acts, and the environmental movement had established itself as a major force in American politics.",
        "As we prepare for another Earth Day this coming weekend, the environmental movement finds itself on the defensive, while overwhelming majorities of Americans agree that the federal government ought to do more to protect an environment that equally large percentages describe as only fair or poor, much of the passion and purpose of the ‘70s has been lost.",
        "Some activists go beyond debates on political impotence and argue that environmentalism is better off dead.",
        "Today, in the city where Earth Day was first celebrated, we'll talk with thinkers, leaders, and critics about the future of Green Power.",
        "Today is also the 100th anniversary of the great San Francisco earthquake and fire.",
        "Within hours of that event, refugees were pouring in to the Presidio, which is just across the highway from where we are today.",
        "We'll be talking with a Park Ranger about the tent cities that became home to thousands of San Franciscans.",
        "But first, what's next for environmentalism?",
        "We want to hear from you, whether you're here in the audience in San Francisco or listening across the country.",
        "Are you part of the environmental movement?",

        "Welcome.",
        "Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.",
        "Good to be here, Neal.",
        "About a couple of years ago, you and your colleague, Michael Shellenberger, co-authored a paper provocatively titled, The Death of Environmentalism.",
        "Briefly, what did you have in mind?",
        "Well no, the connection between the federal government and the public.",
        "I mean, the fact is, that is not the only issue, frankly, on which Washington is paralyzed and unable to respond to what the public wants, environmental issues, energy policy, health care, pensions.",
        "Across the board, the federal government is simply paralyzed.",
        "And the American people are turning to cities and states and the private sectors to solve their problems because of that paralysis.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Yet Ted Nordhaus, if, well, you know, think globally, act locally.",
        "But on the other hand, there are some issues that really can't be resolved on the local level.",
        "Well, the basic thesis of the essay was that the great ecological challenges that we are faced with today, at a global level, profoundly challenge environmentalism both at a political level and at a conceptual level.",
        "And they do it for a couple of reasons.",
        "The first is that a affect born of the idea of protecting pristine natural places from human intrusion is ill-suited to dealing with the kinds of complex, human challenges that things like global warming, global habitat destruction, the destruction of the world's oceans, present us with.",
        "Where what we really need to do is create a dramatic transformation, to transform the global energy economy, to start coming up with a vision for places in the developing world, like Brazil, that can incorporate both economic development and preservation of the Amazon."

        "Mm hmm.",
        "So, the first problem is that.",
        "The second is that, that same ethic leads to a politics of limits rather than a politics of possibility.",
        "It tends to focus on limiting human activity and human behaviors rather than unleashing human possibility and human potential.",
        "And the third is that it places at the center of its politics a whole set of things that are outside of us, a thing called nature, or a thing called the environment, that we're supposed to protect, rather than placing human values, human aspirations, human dreams at the center of its politics.",
        "You put those three things together and you get a political movement that has really been unable to figure out what to do in the face of both these ecological challenges.",
        "And also a political environment that, as you point out, is vastly different than the one that the environmental movement really came of age in, in the early ‘70s.",
        "We're not in 1972 anymore.",
        "Well, let's bring another voice into the conversation.",
        "Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.",
        "Thank you also, very much, for joining us.",
        "It's great to be here this morning.",
        "Are you ready for post-environmentalism?",
        "Well, there is a patient on life support, but I think Michael and Ted have the wrong corpse, or quasi-corpse.",
        "What's on life support systems truly is the environmental policy process in Washington, D.C., and I would say more than the environmental policy process.",
        "We have a virtual reign of terror in federal agencies.",
        "We have federal science being shut down and censored.",
        "We have Congressional hearings being set up as kangaroo courts.",
        "The administration has instructed its agencies not even to answer letters of inquiry from members of Congress unless those inquiries are supported by the Congressional leadership.",
        "So, there's nothing happening in Washington.",
        "Michael's right.",
        "But remarkably since he, Ted's right, since he and Michael did their essay, if you look at what's happened in the states, the American people are demanding progress, and they're getting it.",
        "Idaho just banned coal-fired power plants.",
        "Eight states in the northeast have essentially created their own foreign policy, and joined Kyoto, even though the Bush administration won't even talk about it.",
        "Ten states, representing 40 percent of the North American auto market, have established their own clean car standards, which will dramatically reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses.",
        "And states as diverse as Illinois, Minnesota, and Georgia have ignored the bush administration to delay cleanup of mercury.",
        "The states are moving forward, the cities are moving forward.",
        "Washington indeed does seem to be brain-dead, but its not environmentalism that's dying.",
        "It's the federal policy process.",
        "And Ted's right, we've got to do something about that.",
        "Well Ted, in the past, when environmentalism had a distinctly identifiable enemy, it seemed to do pretty well.",
        "Well, I think that that depends on your perspective on it.",
        "I mean, I think in the past, you know, if you're referring to the James Watts reign of terror, to use Carl's language, you're correct.",
        "And in fact, the environmental movement still does very well in all sorts of ways, in terms of its membership, its resources.",
        "Its base gets quite mobilized in reaction to the kinds of policies that the Bush administration, for instance, is promoting.",
        "The challenge, though, is that when we look at the overall values of the American public and where they're going, you know, environmentalism comes of age in the early ‘70s, at the end of an extraordinary period of economic growth and prosperity.",
        "It's not accidental that the sort of great accomplishments at the national level of the environmental movement happened roughly between 1970 and 1975, at the end of what some describe as a sort of post-war liberal consensus in America, that with the oil shocks in the 1970s, profound changes that start happening in the economy and the culture really comes to an end.",
        "And what we've found at the federal level is that we have, you know, over the last 30 years, environmentalists have lost influence in all three branches of government.",
        "We still have some ability to advance policies at the state level, but at a federal level, we're confronted with a profound problem, as Carl is right, we need to do something about it.",
        "And I think what we're suggesting is that that is not simply a question of coming up with some new tactics or strategies.",
        "We need to look at why being an environmentalist, and the core agenda of the environmental movement, is not highly salient to enough Americans for them to essentially demand change, to not accept the kind of actions that the Bush administration and others are taking."

        "Well, quickly, my disagreement is, the premise is, it's not that our concerns are not salient to the American people.",
        "The concern about mercury poisoning was obviously salient to the voters of Idaho, who like the president a good deal more than they like the Sierra Club.",
        "That they demanded that their state legislature override their governor and ban coal-fired power plants.",
        "That's a dramatic change.",
        "Our concerns are very salient to the American people.",

        "I think it's different.",

        "And if you'd do that quickly.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Yeah, really quickly here.",
        "The second point is, I think at a federal level, rather than air, water, or soil legislation, it may be more beneficial for our government to enact more of a use tax, or a use cost, associated with any good, anything that we buy essentially there's an environmental cost associated with it.",
        "Well, I think there are sort of two challenges, and Carl is aware of this as I am, which is that you're obviously not going to address global warming simply through state action.",
        "But the question of salience is an important one, and you've got to be clear about what you mean by salience.",
        "Yes, if you can get, whether it's in a poll or a state initiative, enough people to simply focus on the question of do you want to do something about mercury, yes, people are with you.",
        "But, at another level, when it comes time to make decisions about who you're going to elect at a federal level or at a state level to office, these issues don't become important enough, or salient enough, for voters to say, you know what, we're not going to elect folks who aren't with us on these issues.",
        "And that's the salience problem we're faced with.",
        "Carl Pope, we just have a minute or so left in this segment, but I wanted to give you a chance to talk about, you know, what's changed in the last two years since Ted Nordhaus and his partner introduced this essay.",
        "Has there been a rethink?",
        "Or, you argued in an essay that you published, that indeed, many of their thoughts had already been incorporated into the movement.",
        "Well, I think what you're seeing is a reassembling of the natural environmental majority, which came together in the 1970s, as you said Neal.",
        "And was then, in the ‘80s and ‘90s, consciously splintered by an effort by the reactionary right to split off people like hunters and fishers, small town church goers, people in rural America, culturally, even thought they, in fact, share concerns about mercury, about grotesque factory feed lots, about global warming.",
        "What's happening at the state level now is that national environmental majority is being reassembled.",
        "The fact is, those Idaho state senators who voted to ban coal weren't elected to ban coal, but once elected they realized their public demanded it of them and they acted.",

        "The Congressional leadership in the Bush administration officially believe in state's rights, but the reality is any opportunity they can, if they see states exercising leadership in the public interest, they take that power away from the states.",

        "And some groups like the Sierra Club seem to feel that there's a conflict there.",
        "And our position is that, you know, hiking, preserving the land for passive recreational use is saving the land.",
