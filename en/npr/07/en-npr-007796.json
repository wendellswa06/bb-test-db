        "Obviously, this is a local issue in Colorado, but not dissimilar from other issues around the country.",
        "Well, I think the facts, and I don't know the facts, so I really can't comment, are terribly important.",
        "There are lands where, in fact, rock climbing and walking dogs is perfectly compatible with, for example, the wildlife resources.",
        "There are other kinds of places, and I don't know these locations in Boulder, where in fact, you have nesting species or very sensitive ecological circumstances where that would actually be damaging.",
        "So, I think you have to look at the facts and I'm sure the Sierra Club sometimes makes mistakes.",
        "We are a human organization made of human beings and I suspect no member of the Sierra Club, including me, agrees with every stand we take.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Ted Nordhaus though, a part of the problem that you identified in your paper was, in fact, that a lot of Americans viewed environmentalists in general, we're not talking specifically about the Sierra Club here, as too extreme.",
        "All right.",
        "So if you could comment on that, I'd really appreciate it.",
        "Okay, we just have a couple of minutes before we have to go to a break but Michael Gelobter, on the...",
        "I think that that's exactly right and I think it's important to understand that the Posse Comitatus Act, you know, the long-standing federal law that restricts using the Army as a police force, doesn't--it's no barrier to that sort of--the help that the caller is talking about.",
        "It does not stand in the way of providing logistical support and assistance to civilian authorities.",
        "Well, I think that the problem that the caller raises, or points out, is typical of the problems.",
        "And for a group like the Sierra Club, in Carl's defense, it's a highly democratic organization which has great strengths.",
        "It also has some weaknesses.",
        "One of which is that it becomes an umbrella under which all sorts of agendas, from immigration to historic preservation, to hikers who want to keep mountain bikers or dogs off the trails that they like, use, and use to sort of invoke ecological concern as a sort of thinly veiled cover for particular uses of land or other resources that they want to privilege for things that they consider to be higher priorities.",
        "And what you end up with is tremendous confusion about what environmentalists, what environmentalism is, who environmentalists are, and what we think is really important.",

        "And I offer, as an example of a corporation that I'm frequently critical of, which is Wal-Mart.",
        "Wal-Mart has clearly decided that they don't want to be trapped by high oil prices, and they're making a whole series on investments to reduce the consumption of oil by their entire business processes, because they know oil's going to get to be expensive.",
        "And individuals, towns, churches, companies, each one can look at its energy use and can start saying, what investments can I make this year that will pay off whether or not the price of oil goes off because there are lots.",

        "Imagine 100 years from now, another city that was struck just a few months ago, New Orleans, and what does the politics have to look like to take it back to the kind of vitality that we have here in San Francisco today?",
        "It's an environmental movement that ensures that young people who are from New Orleans are touring Venice and Amsterdam so they can come back and tell the Army Corp of Engineers how to make their city as safe as those cities that have survived for hundreds of years.",
        "It's an environmental movement and a broader movement that restores the Mississippi to its natural course to protect the Gulf Coast.",
        "It's also an environmental movement that ensures that a city like New Orleans, just like San Francisco, is rebuilt by local people, people from that place who are being unionized, maybe being paid a wage that's living, a living wage.",
        "It's a movement that helps people to vote, to ensure that there's not masses and franchise and that maybe we double the turnout in '04.",
        "So the movement really has to change to really encompass a movement that's about, not just the environment, but about what happened in New Orleans.",
        "If we erase the lines between the environment, between social justice, between communities and the environment to show that the world is really of one and we have to act in lots of ways together to build a movement and to build better cities and a better country.",
        "Yet another comparison though, is after the great legislative victories of the ‘60s, after the Civil Rights movement, some of the same things happened as happened with environmentalism.",
        "There was atomization, there was fractionalization, there was feuding, if you will.",

        "We also have to be a community that cares about the future, about each other, about future generations.",

        "I work with teenagers and I often see their eyes sort of glaze over when it comes to the word environmentalism and environmental issues.",

        "So I'm wondering what concrete themes, or perhaps erasing the lines that you were talking about, Michael, how to jazz it up and kind of make it more relevant for, you know, the kids like that came with me today and that are out there.",
        "We're the host to something called the Climate Justice Corps, which is training this year's 700 young people and really in the campaign we call Katrina No More, which is aimed at training a wide range of Americans to work on these issues.",
        "I mean, the fact is, unfortunate as it is, we're going to be fighting the oil companies 50 years from now.",
        "It's going to take a long time to break what President Bush calls the oil addiction, and we need to start thinking about that next generation, so they can get engaged in efficiency, get engaged in political activism, they can get engaged in caring for places like New Orleans, spending part of the summer there, spending places in California that are vulnerable, working on the vulnerabilities here.",
        "So the Climate Justice Corps is one place where lots of youth activist groups, the C.R.",
        "Club has student groups, there're high school groups.",

        "As you look at the environmentalist movement today, do you think it corresponds to the desires of most Americans?",
        "I think if we take a look at the last 20, 30 years in the U.S., the environmental movement has achieved significant progress in terms of improvements in clear air, clean water, and a focus on things that clearly need to be addressed.",
        "The thing I would suggest to the environmental movement is that they pay more attention to cost benefit analysis.",
        "We need to address, continue to address in the U.S., a variety of environmental challenges, but we have to think of balancing the costs of moving in one direction against what that will do to our ability to fund other social needs.",
        "So for example, the reason that the Senate in 1997 voted not to support the Kyoto Protocol was because they had seen economic models from a variety of sources, macroeconomic models, that suggested or showed that the cost of reducing emissions to seven percent below 1990 levels to the U.S.",
        "would be anywhere from four percent less annual G.D.P.",
        "in 2010, to you know, one or two percent depending on who's model.",

        "The kind of use fee you're talking about is exactly right.",
