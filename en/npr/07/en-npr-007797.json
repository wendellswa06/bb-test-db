        "Well, I think Mr. Pombo's going to have a very interesting race this year.",
        "He is facing a Republican primary challenge from Pete McCloskey, who was the Congressman from Santa Clara who actually created Earth Day, and also challenged President Nixon over the war in Vietnam.",
        "What's happened politically really has been that the reasonable mainstream environmental voice has been driven out of the Republican party and combined with mal-apportionment and gerrymandering that has given reactionaries a disproportionate voice in Congress.",
        "I think as you look at the run up to this fall's election, with somebody like Pombo who's never faced a serious challenge, even in the general election, now facing a serious challenge both in the general election and in his primary, we're discovering in the district that almost none of his voters understand, for example, that Mr. Pombo is trying to sell off national parks.",

        "And even in the Clinton years when you had an administration that was much more amenable to the kinds of solutions that environmentalists advocate, there was an underlying values environment that was constraining the ability to enact those kind of solutions.",
        "It has empowered the Bush administration.",
        "Even had John Kerry got himself elected in 2004, it would have constrained what Kerry was able to do.",
        "And frankly, even if we get rid of a few of the more extreme anti-environmental voices in Congress, I think that underlying values environment, one which is profoundly different than the one in which the environmental movement came of age, is going to continue to constrain our ability to take the kinds of actions we think need to be taken.",

        "If you look at polls of the American public, environmental issues rate, rank fairly far down, behind terrorism, behind education, crime, and other issues.",
        "But I think what's happening, at least in Washington, is that there is a desire to balance the need to improve the environment with a desire to promote strong economic growth that will enable the U.S.",

        "The market would provide those solutions.",
        "So, I don't think it's appropriate to say that it's a battle of one lobbyist against another.",
        "It's a question of finding a middle ground, a way of preserving economic growth, and gradually improving on many environmental fronts.",
        "And I think the proposal, the plans that the administration has put in place are moving us in a positive direction, including the Asia-Pacific partnership, which was signed by China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the U.S.",
        "last July.",
        "The focus of the Asia-Pacific partnership is to promote development and cleaner energy use.",
        "And if we can make major reductions in the amount of energy per dollar of output in China, India, and the other developing countries, we'll make a huge contribution to reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "So, of course, somebody's going to build one.",
        "We ought to get the subsidies out of the system.",
        "We ought to make people pay for what they take from our common resources.",

        "Well, I think that both the low salience of environmental issues compared to other issues, and the kind of false debate that we see going on here between conservatives and environmentalists, are both consequences of the conceptual limitations of environmentalism itself.",
        "It's what happens when you get yourself into this kind of politics of limits.",
        "First of all, the kinds of proposals you get into end up focusing on limiting activity rather than promoting the kinds of human activities that you want to promote, economically and otherwise.",
        "And secondly, you get into, sort of, talking about things that are pretty far from the center of people's world views, whether it's terrorism, healthcare, the economy, any number of things.",
        "What we have proposed, and have sort of said that is what we need to do, is to sort of get these kinds of concerns, and get our proposals out of this environmental ghetto, and move them into a place which is much more sort of centrally located in people's lives and world views.",
        "And when you do that, you avoid both this false economic debate, and all the salience problems that you get trapped in, in sort of trying, insisting on talking to the public about environmental issues.",
        "Okay, Michael Gelobter, we'll give you the last word here.",
        "I mean, I think the answer of the question, corporate versus environmental lobbyists, the answer is no, it's about people power.",

        "Speaking to reporters today, the president called for a robust discussion of the issue.",
        "Currently, there are legal restrictions on what the military can do in such cases.",
        "They can provide humanitarian services, but the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act forbids the military from taking on any policing duties on US soil.",

        "Well, the president hasn't put forward any specific proposals; although I'm told that there may be some in the works at the White House.",
        "Right now, it seems like he's sort of just floating the idea, putting it out there, saying this is something that he'd like to see Congress discuss and he'd like to see the country discuss.",
        "I think he's quite aware that this would--when you're looking at potentially altering a law from, you know, post-Civil War era, this is something that is a pretty significant change for the country.",
        "And he may just be sort of preparing people to think about these issues in a different way before they come up with a real proposal.",
        "Before we go on, let's talk about that law, that post-Civil War Posse Comitatus Act, and tell us a little bit about the context in which that act became law.",
        "I probably--I don't know a whole lot about the history of it, but I do know that it was a post-Civil War sort of effort to try to reduce the sort of impact or direct influence that the military could have on civilian law-making and sort of keeping of the peace.",
        "It was seen that the Defense Department was going to be active in doing those kinds of things beyond our borders, but not necessarily in the event of sort of local law-making, law enforcement kinds of issues."
