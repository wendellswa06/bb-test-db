        "As I understand it, I think it came, in part, out of concern of the former confederate states that the federal government would be interfering too much in their lives...",
        "Yes.",
        "They didn't...",
        "...part of the history there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So what--it--what are the restrictions exactly?",
        "Well, the key one is really just that the military cannot come in without the invitation, for example, of a state's governor and, in addition, when they are invited in, they cannot take part in law enforcement activities.",
        "The National Guard, which is actually a state actor, can participate in law enforcement activities, but the active military--the Army, etc.--cannot.",
        "So what exactly happened and what went wrong specifically in the aftermath of Katrina that's got people thinking about this again?",
        "Well, what went wrong was that they lacked a lot of coordination and communications, and I think that a lot of people point to the time when the active military, the 82nd Airborne, and some of the others finally arrived on the scene at the end of the week, I think it was Friday, and Katrina hit on a Monday, as being the real turning point in the rescue effort.",
        "And I think that that raised a lot of questions about, well, why didn't these people arrive sooner if all of the--if the storm was overwhelming all of the other resources that already existed on the ground?",
        "Now this is not the first time that this idea has come up after a hurricane, before we even get to 9/11.",
        "It came up after Hurricane Andrew, as well.",
        "It did.",
        "It did, in 1992.",
        "Again, you had one of those situations where it wasn't until the 82nd Airborne arrived on the scene that people felt like things were brought under control a little bit, and the 82nd Airborne is a very elite Army unit that is capable of responding anywhere in the world within 18 hours, and so obviously, one would assume that they could respond anywhere in the US within that or perhaps a shorter time frame."

        "And then, of course, the events of 9/11--also after 9/11, the terrorist attacks, there were also calls for changes in this act as well.",
        "Yes, there were, because I think that there was a sense that in the event of an attack on US soil, that you might really need the kind of resources that only the military can bring to bear and, in fact, after 9/11, the military did launch the Northern Command, which is based in Colorado Springs.",
        "In fact, that's where the president visited this weekend, and that was a post-9/11 creation that started to bring to carve out a little bit more of a domestic role for the military, but the military has been kind of hesitant about taking on too much of a role.",
        "All right.",
        "Given that the president is calling for a discussion and that there have been--this issue has been sort of brewing in Congress since 9/11, where is it at now?",
        "What's going to happen now, would you say, in terms of congressional action, let's say?",

        "The same thing happened to his now 91-year-old brother, Dr. Philip Lee, who helped implement Medicare as Assistant Secretary of Health and Scientific Affairs under President Johnson.",
        "In terms of congressional action, I think Senator Warner has sent a letter to the Defense Department sort of looking for some guidance and clarification.",
        "I think that very much, it's still in a discussion phase.",
        "I would not be surprised, like I mentioned, if we eventually, you know, maybe with the next couple months or so, saw a proposal coming out of the White House or even, you know, started to see bills coming out of Congress, but I think at the same time, when you're looking at changing laws that have been really ingrained not only in our statute, but in our culture for hundreds of years, it probably does require a little bit of public discussion beforehand, which is what we're watching happen now.",
        "But right now, I don't think the Defense Department even really knows quite what the president has in mind.",
        "And the Defense Department--what is their reaction to all this?",
        "So far, their response is pretty quiet.",
        "I think that they're just looking for information in terms of what it is that the president really wants to see happen.",
        "In the past, with Hurricane Andrew, they were somewhat reluctant to take on a larger role.",
        "At the time, the military was looking at launching something called total force planning, which was actually going to incorporate the National Guard into more of a war-fighting sort of posture, and at the time back in the early '90s, there was some fear at the Pentagon that by having a greater domestic role, that that might cut against their flexibility to deploy forces overseas, and we may well have that concern now certainly with a need for forces overseas in Iraq and elsewhere.",
        "We're talking about the role of the military in natural disasters--in the case of natural disasters or perhaps terrorist attack.",

        "Well, I think one of the things people have to remember is the military is what you use when all else fails, and I think some of the lessons that will be learned in studying the response to Hurricane Katrina is that we've established an incredibly complicated national response plan, and in the process, we weakened the Federal Emergency Management Agency, parceling out a lot of its best people, dividing its jurisdictions, moving its emphasis away from looking at disasters in terms of mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, and basically under Secretary Chertoff's reorganization in July, FEMA's fundamentally response agency, which isn't really the best idea going.",
        "I also think that there's problems with regard to the people in the past who have been appointed to run FEMA, both in the '80s and the early '90s, and at the present time, and we need people who are well-qualified disaster managers.",
        "I think that Director Paulison is a good appointee at this time to run FEMA, but I'm not quite certain that other people were quite up to the job, at least on the scale that Katrina confronted the country.",
        "I also think that FEMA was very good in the '90s in establishing excellent relations with state and local governments.",
        "A part of what's happened is that with FEMA being weakened in Homeland Security, some of those ties have been diminished and also, at the same time, state and local governments are trying to morph themselves into many departments of homeland security in order to take advantage of Homeland Security funding and types of jurisdiction that they're entrusted with after 9/11, and I...",
        "So you seem to be arguing that FEMA should be strengthened before you leap to thinking that it's a military role that's needed...",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "...a large military role that's needed?",
        "Exactly.",
        "It--and as a matter of fact, I think the military already has all the authority it needs, including the active military to deal with disasters domestically.",
        "The key issue is that they're supposed to be--in a supplemental capacity, they're supposed to be on-hand to help, under certain limited circumstances, and these circumstances can be determined by governors, in the case of the National Guard, and clearly the active military with regard to the president.",
        "The president has national emergency powers that he can bring to bear to deploy the military and to take on extraordinary emergency powers.",
        "But the president's emergency powers are limited by Congress.",
        "He's limited to a year or the period in which he designates the emergency powers necessary, and he has the power...",
        "Maybe you could explain to us exactly what is triggered when the president declares a disaster area, for instance.",
        "Well, when the president declares--one of the things that has happened that's very positive is that presidents--since President Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush, was in office, presidents have issued declarations to mobilize for disasters before they occur; whereas up until the first Bush administration, there was a major reluctance to mobilize ahead of time until you got requests from the governor for a disaster declaration, and people realized that that was really not the best way to deal with particular life-threatening emergencies where federal assets could be used, including the military, to engage in life, safety and facilitate evacuations and do any number of other things.",
        "And so what I think is happening is that the key concern now is to first figure out, you know, how much of the National Guard is available to deal with natural disasters.",
        "And it's divided, obviously, between serving its duties and...",
        "Professor Sylves...",

        "OK.",

        "Sure.",
        "Well, I believe so.",
        "I think that the National Guard's an important asset available to governors to deal with disasters.",
        "I think one of the concerns in the present circumstances is when the National Guard can be federalized by the president, and a key issue with regard to Katrina is whether disasters of the scale of Katrina now pose a national security concern to the point at which the president should federalize disasters on that scale in order to expedite use of both the National Guard and the active military, particularly the active military to deal with these things.",
        "That raises issues as to what kind of scale you have.",
        "How big is big?",
        "Will this be abused at the point that even routine disasters end up being federalized?",
        "Big issues that surround this also is how much--who pays the bill?",
        "The Pentagon is going to be concerned about being reimbursed under current policy.",
        "When the Pentagon, the active military responds to a domestic disaster, they are reimbursed by the federal or state governments in some way for what they do.",
        "One other point I just wanted to make briefly is that one of the concerns about bringing the active military in too quickly is that it might induce some degree of complacency on the part of local first responders, who are really the key linchpin that makes all of this work.",
        "And if you see responder after responder saying, `Well, I couldn't do anything.",
        "I was waiting for the cavalry to arrive,' this will be counterproductive to federal response to dealing with disasters--federal, state and local response to dealing with disasters in the United States.",
        "So I think in any consideration about reassigning authority and using the active military inside the United States, one has to walk very carefully through a number of constitutional issues, intergovernmental issues between the president and the governors, and who's going to pay the bill on these things, as well as when the authority, the military, particularly the active military, needs to stop.",

        "And my concern is, as our Representative Foley has mentioned, the National Guard is being deployed to fight a front-line war, and that's not what they were designed for.",
        "They were designed to be just what the name implies, a National Guard force available for local and state security.",
        "So your sense is that if we weren't fighting the war in Iraq, there would be enough National Guard?",
        "Well, if we had a regular Army that was capable of fighting the war in Iraq, the National Guard would have been available in the case of Katrina.",
        "Just about twice as many Louisiana National Guard members would have been there, and, you know, they live there.",
        "They know their way around.",
        "The regular Army doesn't live there, and they should be coordinating with the first responders, because that's where they live, and if they see themselves getting overwhelmed, then it's certainly in their purview to get in touch with the governor and ask for federal help.",
        "I mean, it was great that the Navy was available to come in and lend the assistance that they can because, you know, in that case, they were really the ones that could do it.",
        "Glen, good comments.",
        "I'd like to hear our guest respond, so thanks so much for calling in.",
        "Thank you.",
        "With those comments, I think that, you know, those are sentiments that I've been hearing expressed, also concern that we're really stretched too thin militarily, and then in the course of that, Glen also raised another interesting point, which is that the National Guard would have sort of a local sensitivity that the military might not have.",
        "I wonder if you could just address those ideas, Professor Sylves.",
        "Yes.",
        "I would be happy to do that.",
        "I think Glen names a number of really excellent points.",
        "Clearly, National Guards have been mortgaged to do a great number of things, perhaps things that people who signed up didn't expect they would necessarily have to do.",
        "As a result, the National Guard is kind of drawn thin across the country.",
        "But I want to say that in the response to domestic disasters, the National Guard is usually up to the job, and it's also the case that governors can share their National Guard units across the border.",
        "There's an elaborate system to allow that to take place.",
        "So whenever gaps there may be in terms of Guard numbers within a specific state can often be made up fairly quickly by Guard representatives or units from other states.",
        "In the same sense, Glen also makes the good point about the active military being deployed in civilian contexts.",
        "Well, another aspect of this is the active military is already committed to do a great number of things, and be it--for people to walk around and assume that there are just huge numbers of active military people waiting to be called up to deal with civilian disasters is sort of a misunderstanding.",
        "These people already have jobs that involve a great amount of effort and work and resources and pulling them off what they're doing to deal with domestic disaster circumstances is not a costless thing.",
        "I mean, it does have implications and the concern is we don't want to compromise our national security in an international context to deal with domestic concerns that might be better addressed by other authorities, whether it be National Guard, whether it be other civilian agencies.",
