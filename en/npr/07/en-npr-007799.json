        "Rick Sylves is a political science professor at the University of Delaware.",
        "He joined us by phone from his office in Newark, Delaware.",
        "And, Siobhan Gorman, I just wanted to turn to you again.",
        "We were talking with you and with Professor Sylves about the fact that perhaps after 9/11, there may be a--we heard some proposals to change the Posse Comitatus Act, and I'm wondering if you have any sense of what the public sentiment--if the public sentiment may have changed since 9/11, that people might be more willing to see a larger role for the military.",
        "Do you have any sense of that?",
        "They called me a socialist more often than a communist, but occasionally they referred to me as a communist.",
        "From what I've been able to gauge, it does seem that the public apprehension about sort of the military involvement in our day-to-day lives has definitely diminished since 9/11.",
        "What we don't have a good sense of is what sort of role the public does want the military to play in our lives.",
        "But it certainly does seem, looking after Katrina and possibly even sort of a general change after 9/11, that it does help Americans feel a little bit more secure to feel that the military is on the case as well.",
        "It brings a certain amount of comfort or emotional support, even if what the active military is offering by way of skills or equipment isn't really all that different from what the National Guard is offering.",
        "We're talking about the role of the military in times of domestic crises, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks.",
        "If you'd like to join our discussion, give us a call at 1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "And many people do have concerns about the potential new role of the military on the home front.",
        "And they come from both sides of the political fence.",
        "We turn now to Gene Healy, a senior editor at the Cato Institute.",
        "And he is also with me here in Studio 3A.",
        "Thanks for being here.",
        "Thanks for having me on.",
        "What concerns would you have about this idea of increasing the role of the military or allowing the military to play a larger role in times of natural disaster or domestic crises?",
        "Well, in the American legal tradition, we've always had a principle that the military is supposed to be a last resort and not a first responder, and I would want to see people who want to change this principle to meet--I think should have to meet a pretty high burden of proof.",
        "You don't want the 82nd Airborne on the streets of an American city enforcing order, unless you absolutely have to have that happen.",
        "That's where the law currently draws the line, as a last resort now...",
        "What are the dangers of that, in your mind?"

        "Well, there are a couple of dangers.",
        "As someone once put it, the military is trained to vaporize, not Mirandize.",
        "You know, soldiers are trained to be warriors, not peace officers, and that is the way they should be trained.",
        "But you can run into trouble when you mix these functions up.",
        "Another way you can run into trouble is by undermining military readiness.",
        "Because the policing function and the war-fighting function are so different, you can run into a situation where the military is stretched too thin, and the General Accounting Office actually recently looked at some of the domestic homeland security missions that the military had been tasked with since 9/11 and said that, you know, this was actually undermining combat readiness.",
        "So I think there are a number of reasons why you wouldn't want to change this basic principle.",
        "And what about the relationship between the federal government and state governments and how that--what are the concerns there?",
        "Well, the preference under the law now is that you would have a request from a state governor before you put the military into an active policing situation, and that can be overridden.",
        "I mean, one of the interesting things about this debate is if the idea is that we need to have federal authority that allows the military to be put in an active duty policing situation, even over the objections of the state governor, that authority already exists.",
        "It's just that the president has to think twice before he wants to invoke that authority.",
        "Right.",
        "I don't think we want to make that any easier.",
        "And I think federalism and the rule of law matter.",
        "Is there something that could be called in a little bit short of that?",
        "I mean, could the role of the National Guard be changed, for instance, so that it could be more effective?",
        "Well, I think one thing we should certainly look at before we start revising the principle that--of, you know, caution about using standing armies to keep the peace, one thing we really should look at is not treating the National Guard as if it's no different than the Army Reserve.",
        "There were, for example, 3,700 members of Louisiana's 256th Mechanized Infantry Brigade in Iraq with some equipment that could have been very useful for disaster relief.",
        "And I think before we start talking about sweeping changes in American law, we should think about, you know, what is the core mission of the National Guard?",
        "And it seems to me that disaster relief and, when necessary, dealing with civil disturbances is something that the National Guard, under the command of the state governors, is well-equipped to do.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take a call from Ken, and he's calling from Mississippi, I believe.",

        "But I agree with the last caller about the role of the military, especially the 82nd Airborne, is not to deal with this type of thing.",
        "I think the only branch of the service that really--we really need here is the combat engineers.",
        "We have a local base in Gulfport, the Seabees, the 133rd Seabees, and they're equipped with everything that we actually need.",
        "They can actually come in--and we have several bridges that are out--they could build combat bridges in a couple of days so that we could have traffic going back and forth across the bridges.",

        "All right.",

        "One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine.",
        "Oh, just one other point on that.",
        "I think that what Ken was pointing out was an important issue, also, in terms of being more--the state officials being more specific about what it is that they really need from, quote, unquote \"\"the federal government\"\" or, quote, unquote \"\"the military.\"\" I mean, it was my understanding that even, you know, in the day before Rita, there were lots of requests, both from Louisiana and from Texas, saying, `We want federal troops,' and the Defense Department was scratching its head.",
        "It was saying, `Well, what skills do you need?",
        "What do you need us to do so that we can send the right people to you?",
        "Because these folks are just not all interchangeable necessarily.",
        "But just one other question, because after Katrina there was a breakdown of security in New Orleans.",
        "I mean, that--and that's part of where I think some of these questions are coming from, that we all witnessed that and that was where perhaps some of this idea that, well, maybe we need the military to go in there when that happened, and it can happen--it could happen again.",
        "I think there were breakdowns all up and down the chain, from the municipal officials to--from local police force, state officials to federal officials.",
        "I think clearly one thing that has to happen after the Katrina disaster is that people at all of those levels start thinking about what they can do better with the massive authority that they already have.",
        "What I don't think is the answer--the answer is ultimately for them to think about how to do a better job.",
        "I don't think the answer, though, is what seems to be suggested as a militarized federal war on hurricanes.",
        "I don't think we need to fundamentally change American law to deal with this problem.",

        "Well, it's always a good time to repair to first principles and to think about fundamental questions like that, but I do--it does concern me because we've seen a lot of this after 9/11 as well.",
        "There's this notion that the military should be all things for all missions.",
        "There was a notion after 9/11, Secretary of Transportation Norm Mineta actually suggested having Delta Force operatives on domestic American flights, you know, when they really ought--should be hunting al-Qaeda abroad.",
        "I think there is a tendency to believe that because the military is so good at the job that it does, that it should be tasked much more broadly with any problem that arises in American society, and so if the robust debate we're going to have is about that, well, I hope cooler heads prevail.",

        "What is it that the military does better than anyone when it comes to disasters, like Katrina, for instance?",
        "Well, it sounds like it's very much different, fighting a war and doing the kinds of things that need to get done after a disaster, domestic disaster like Katrina, but the capabilities that the military has are such that they--many of them are useful in situations like this, and while the military would prefer to be out there closing with the enemy by means of fire and maneuver to kill or capture them, they can perform the kinds of things that are required in a disaster like Katrina.",

        "There'd be a strict chain of command so that there's no question about whose responsibility is whose and whose authority is whose.",
        "I think if a disaster were contained wholly within one state, there would be very little question about whether or not you would use the military unless it was such a catastrophic disaster that you couldn't do without the capability that even the National Guard could provide.",
        "I think what many people are talking about here is a repetition of a disaster in which many states are involved and the kinds of fragmented delivery of services that you're suggesting would be impossible to do without some sort of centralized command, and the argument is that the military has not only the capability, but is organized to deliver it because it does have a centralized command."
