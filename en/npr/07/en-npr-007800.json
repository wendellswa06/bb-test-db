        "She really didn't have any idea where she was gonna get any more.",
        "And while I understand from a practical aspect it makes sense for the 82nd to be able to deploy because of the speed at which they can do it.",
        "I mean, I hesitate to rush to make more changes when our response in that manner after 9/11 seems to have contributed to our inability to respond properly in this case.",
        "Now I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.",
        "You were in the Convention Center in New Orleans?",
        "Is that what you're saying?",
        "I was.",
        "I was, on Wednesday.",
        "OK.",
        "OK.",
        "And, you know, on Monday previous I'd actually been out in the Quarter and I was out clearing the street so a police officer could drive through and I had a chance to ask them what was going on, what the situation was.",
        "They obviously didn't know.",
        "And she looked weary, I would assume from having been up for, you know, two or three days previous to the storm preparing, and then not having any relief for two or three days after the fact.",
        "So I know why people want responders like, say, the 82nd Airborne to be able to deploy quickly, but I would hate for them to rush to make those changes before we fully understand what mechanisms within this new organization of power that we have contributed to the failure.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, let me see if the colonel can respond to those concerns, and thanks for your call, Max."

        "Sure.",

        "As far as having a coordinating headquarters, the military already has one established, the Northern Command.",
        "It's merely a question of giving them proper responsibility and assets and authority to get it done, and if there were a multistate catastrophe and it was decided that only a military response, an active-duty military response would be adequate to the task, then the system would be in place in order to do it.",
        "But there's no doubt about the fact that it should not be done willy-nilly, and I think that what many people are correctly concerned about is that because we have--we will have the capability--in fact, we do have the capability to provide active-duty military for civilian disasters, that we would just go ahead and do it as the first thing that we would do and, of course...",
        "Now you just said we do have the capability.",
        "That was one of my questions.",
        "I mean, isn't the military being stretched pretty thin right now?",
        "Well, it is, and I tell you, you have--there are two things about this.",
        "First it is, and we have the strange circumstance in which you got about half the people who are in Iraq, for example, are National Guard and Reserve troops, so then you would have active-duty people back in the States from which the National Guard comes.",
        "Right.",
        "And the second issue is that you--and the reason why you--one reason why you need to be very, very careful about providing active-duty military is that we do have a relatively small active-duty military, and as a result, the response needs to be for circumstances in which there is no other answer, and because we do have a wide variety of responsibilities worldwide and we can't pull troops away from there, from those places very, very easily.",
        "For example, your last caller suggested the 82nd Airborne Division.",
        "The 82nd Airborne Division keeps an immediate ready force that can be deployed instantaneously with--about a battalion's worth, between 750 and a thousand troops--immediately.",
        "But you see, if they're deployed to go to a domestic natural disaster, that means they cannot be deployed to go someplace else, and so we have to be very sparing--this asset needs to be sparingly applied.",
        "All right.",
        "Having said all that, I think the far bigger problem intellectually is not whether or not we actually have the assets, because if there was a catastrophe, we would provide the assets in some fashion.",
        "More significantly, the real question is what's the structure gonna be and what is the mechanism by which these forces would be dispatched?",
        "All right.",
        "And that's the toughest part, and that's--I think that's what's gonna engender the most debate."
