        "I think it's explained by the fact that this was grossly mischaracterized by advocates who opposed the bill and also, quite frankly, some very sloppy reporting for the first several days.",

        "He did.",
        "He loved playing air guitar, and he was so poor growing up he actually didn't have a guitar, and he played air guitar for about two years before he was lucky enough to finally get a guitar.",
        "So there's some small irony in all of us playing air guitar listening to him.",
        "We're just sort of following in his footsteps.",
        "You draw a wonderful picture in your book: Jimi Hendrix, a lonely superstar near the end of his life, as it turned out, going in the middle of the night on a tour of his old hometown in Seattle, Washington, with--just picked up a fan who'd stopped by to get an autograph, and said, `Hey, you got a car?,' and drove him around the town, and ends up looking through the window, putting his hands over his eyes and looking into the window of the house that he grew up in, where he played that air guitar on a broom in his little room.",
        "You know, what was fascinating was that Jimi came back to Seattle only four times after he was famous, but every time it was almost as if he were, you know, reliving the entire life story again by going back and visiting the high school that he had dropped out of and, as you tell there, visiting the house that he once lived in.",
        "The irony is that house is still a matter of a debate right now on whether that should be saved by the city or whether it should be torn down.",
        "Interesting, though--obviously, the question of a memorial to Jimi Hendrix--that house--he was never very happy in that house.",
        "Well, and I don't know that he was really very happy in his life, which is one of the sad things about superstardom.",
        "We want to imagine everyone that was famous and a rock star in the '60s as having a great life.",
        "And Jimi lived life to its fullest, but there was a lot of tragedy in his life that he had to overcome.",

        "Well, that's what he said privately to his family and to other people.",
        "His mother died when he was 15 years old, and he thought of her after that point as kind of this ethereal presence in his life.",
        "And he's got a beautiful, beautiful song called \"\"Angel\"\" that is just, I think, one of the most beautiful things he ever did, and very clearly it's a love song to his lost mother, in my opinion, at least as a critic.",
        "One of the things--obviously, a very strange relationship with his father and questions, interestingly, of paternity.",
        "I guess Jimi and his brother, Leon--they were the only ones where questions of their father--who was their father didn't come up.",
        "Well, actually, no, it did come up in both of their instances.",
        "And then Leon was involved in a massive court case that was just determined last year in Seattle, where his paternity was a major issue.",
        "And you had a family here that--Al and Lucille Hendrix had at least two kids together, and if you want to believe the court records, as many as six kids together.",
        "And, you know, in researching this biography, I found a number of brothers and sisters of Jimi that no one had really known about.",
        "There are four other kids that Al and Lucille had that they gave up for adoption, gave away to the state.",
        "And those people really have never been talked to before, and their story's not been told.",

        "Most ended up joining the Army.",
        "And though Jimi grew up in Seattle, which--in the Northwest, we like to think of ourselves as more progressive.",
        "There still were many, many barriers to African-Americans economically and housing wise, and so he joined the Army, like a lot of other young men at the time.",
        "And then he got in the Army and kind of fell out of love with it and decided he needed to get out, which is one of the funniest stories in the book--how superstud Jimi Hendrix had to pretend, essentially, to be the Corporal Klinger of the 101st Airborne and pretend he was gay to get out of the service.",
        "He always told people he'd broken an ankle or something, but you found the real story.",
        "I found the actual Army medical records, which are funny beyond belief to read, where Jimi would go in to the psychiatrist every week and say, `I'm in love with my bunkmate,' and he would complain of all these other problems because his homosexuality had caused him to lose weight, he said.",
        "And Jimi never told that story--admitted it to anyone, ever, later in his life, but it truly was how he got out of the service.",
        "And, of course, he wasn't the only one to use that ruse.",
        "After he did get out--he's been playing guitar then for a while.",
        "And he comes under the influence of a mentor there--interesting expression that he uses in terms of Jimi Hendrix, the idea that he needed to acquire a little mud."
