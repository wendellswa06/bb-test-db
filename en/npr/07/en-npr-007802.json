        "Yes, good morning--well, it's morning where I am.",
        "Yeah.",
        "OK.",
        "And it's a little bit of a stretch for me to see Jimi looking like Bob, but I'll work on it.",
        "One of the things that I often say to young guitar players around here is that if you don't know the blues, you can't rock.",
        "And every time I hear Jimi, I hear the blues all in what he does.",
        "And I was wondering if you could comment--and you began talking a little bit about B.B.",
        "King, but I was wondering if you could comment on Jimi and his relationship with Buddy Guy.",
        "Well, all those major guitar players--Buddy Guy and B.B.",
        "King and Albert King--Jimi, when he was sort of coming up, he would go see those guys, and he would ask them for, you know, hints, for licks.",
        "And one of the more hilarious stories in the book is that they didn't feel threatened by him.",
        "So Jimi played with Buddy, I think, on a couple of occasions in clubs, and he clearly was an influence.",
        "And I think Buddy Guy is one of the only people playing today who, I think, really follows that legacy.",
        "You know, Buddy Guy was recently on a sort of Hendrix tribute tour, and just blew everybody away by playing acoustic guitar, which was one of Jimi's favorite instruments, actually.",
        "I don't think you need electricity to play the blues.",
        "And Buddy Guy continues in that wonderful Delta tradition, and his playing is just extraordinary to this day.",
        "Phil, thank you.",
        "The blues predates electricity.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Oh, there's no question about that.",

        "All right.",
        "Say--yeah, listen, I'd like to talk about, you know, what Hendrix will be remembered for.",
        "I'm a musician and a music teacher, too, and I think his main thing was his tone.",
        "He was a sound innovator.",
        "But I think he got a lot of what he did from two people--since you're a biographer, correct me if I'm wrong--Ike Turner and Sonny Sharrock."

        "Yeah, I think that some of that's true.",
        "I mean, I think Jimi was influenced by so many people.",
        "But one story that I was able to confirm in this book that hadn't really been confirmed before is that Jimi did very briefly play with Ike and Tina Turner.",
        "Tina Turner denies that, and I think that part of it is that no one knew Jimi and Jimi Hendrix at the time.",
        "But Ike does confirm that Jimi was in that band for a while.",
        "And he was--you know...",
        "A lot of people didn't know...",
        "...kind of like a sponge.",
        "He just sucked up influences from everyone that he saw, yet he was able, I think, to put a unique twist on it.",
        "I do think one other important thing, though, beyond music is one reason to remember Jimi, and that simply is the issue of race.",
        "Jimi was really one of the very first African-American artists to have a large following of white fans.",
        "And for that fact alone, he was quite revolutionary, and I think that, you know, in our modern, mixed-ethnicity society today, we kind of forget how revolutionary that was, to have a black man playing to such huge audiences of white fans.",
        "And Jimi himself...",
        "Yet...",
        "...commented in his diary on that, what a strange irony that was, that he had found that audience.",
        "Yet he did not, when he lived, have a big black audience and, in fact, always wanted to go up and be a big hit in Harlem.",
        "He did.",
        "And one of the--again, a hilarious story in the book is how, just two weeks after Woodstock--you know, Woodstock is the show we identify as Jimi's--pretty much his greatest moment, and maybe the highlight of the entire '60s on a musical spectrum.",
        "But two weeks later, Jimi played for free in Harlem to about a few thousand African-American fans at a street festival, and he was booed.",
        "And that was something that he was tormented by.",
        "He really wanted a larger African-American audience and found that, you know, black radio stations would not play his records, and that was frustrating to him.",
        "Hm.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Walt.",
        "I--all right.",
        "All right.",

        "What--there've been a lot of Hendrix biographies.",
        "What's different about yours?",
        "Good question.",
        "Well, I approached this biography and all the work I do as--I'm not so much writing a biography of a musician, but as--an important cultural figure.",
        "And I try--I talk a little bit, obviously, about what Jimi plays and what his musical accomplishments are, but I don't think you can understand his work unless you understand his life.",
        "So I try to give equal weight to every year of his life, and many of the other books that have been written--you know, Jimi's first 18 years, which was the first two-thirds of his life, might take up two or three pages.",
        "In my book, it's half of my book, and certainly, I'm as concerned with the making of the man as I am the making of the guitar.",
        "And I don't think you can understand the depth of that blues guitar solo that we heard on \"\"Little Wing\"\" unless you understand Jimi's mother, his family, his entire family's history, the fact that he was born from a family that included slaves and Native Americans.",
        "And there is a long tradition there that you must understand, I think, before you can really understand the artistry.",
        "Thanks, Walt.",
        "So that's my approach.",
