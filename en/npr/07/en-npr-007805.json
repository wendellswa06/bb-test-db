        "Still, it's an open question how hard the Tea Party will actually work for Romney.",
        "That will depend on one thing, says New Jersey Tea Party member Bill Miller.",
        "At this point, the only thing he can possibly do is who he picks for VP, who's going to be his people that he's going work with going forward.",
        "Miller says a solid Tea Party conservative on the ticket would generate some real enthusiasm to go along with what is right now the promise of Tea Party votes.",
        "Don Gonyea, NPR News, Philadelphia.",
        "As Romney works to consolidate support in his party, he has a shot at a kind of candidate's honeymoon now, facing less Republican opposition, a fresh look from the media and anticipation about his vice presidential choice.",
        "Romney enters that period trailing President Obama in the polls, but within striking range.",
        "Real Clear Politics, which compiles an average of public opinion polls, finds the president leading by about three points: 47-44 percent.",
        "Here's the downside for Romney: He is emerging from the fiercely contested primary season to find close to half of Americans hold an unfavorable view of him.",
        "Healthcare costs are important to consider when planning for retirement.",
        "This weekend, those costs will go up for military retirees.",
        "It's a modest increase but premiums for this group haven't gone up since the mid-'90s.",
        "The Defense Department announced this week the premium for retirees with a family plan will be $520 a year - up from $460.",
        "Active military members do not pay for healthcare.",
        "The military health program called TRICARE has been around for decades, and it may be under scrutiny as lawmakers work to cut spending.",
        "The cost of TRICARE in 2001 was $19 billion.",

        "In a few minutes, we'll hear from some of those people who are enduring the chill and rare March snow to get into the court tomorrow.",
        "Meanwhile, today, inside the Supreme Court, the justices threw a curveball on another high-profile issue, affirmative action.",
        "For more on that, NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg joins us now.",
        "And.",
        "Nina, what's the curveball?",
        "Well, as you may recall, Audie, the court last fall heard arguments in a case testing the constitutionality of affirmative action in admissions at the University of Texas.",
        "Now, just 10 years ago, the court upheld affirmative action programs in higher education in an opinion written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.",
        "But ever since O'Connor retired and was replaced by the more conservative Justice Samuel Alito, the court has been on an apparent march to get rid of all race-conscious programs.",
        "And after oral arguments in the Texas case, the only real question seemed to be whether the court would rule broadly or narrowly to get rid of the Texas program."

        "Well, today, before resolving the Texas case, the court accepted for review another affirmative action case for next term.",
        "This one testing whether voters, by referendum, can bar affirmative action programs in higher education.",
        "So why is this considered a curveball?",
        "Because it really does seem to jump the gun even before there's a ruling in the pending affirmative action case.",
        "And that's not something the court usually does.",
        "So what are people making of this?",
        "Well, I really don't think it's entirely clear.",
        "You could infer from this that if the court were, for example, going to bar affirmative action programs, why would they need to be jumping the gun with this case?",
        "So perhaps the court is going to rule narrowly in the Texas case and therefore has taken this case.",
        "I do think it's fair to say that it's further evidence of the conservative justices' overt hostility to race-conscious programs.",
        "So, tell us a little bit more about this new case that the court's accepting.",
        "Meadow says this raises all kinds of possibilities, like someday maybe being able to identify a murder suspect by reading the microbial cloud he or she left behind at the scene of a crime.",
        "Technically, Eddie Compass's new job title is executive director of security.",

        "Other than a successful 2012 re-election campaign, President Obama has very little to show for the past four years.",
        "Will he want the final two years of his presidency to continue in that vein, or would he like to burnish his legacy and finish strong?",
        "The president has invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House tomorrow to talk about the way forward.",
        "He even joked about having a drink with McConnell, saying he'd enjoy having some bourbon with the Kentucky senator.",
        "Even as he tries to bridge the divide with congressional Republicans, though, Obama still plans to use his executive powers in the coming weeks to change the immigration system potentially protecting some immigrants in the country illegally from deportation.",

        "And despite pressure from some conservatives to draw a harder line against the president, McConnell promised no more government shutdowns or threats of default on the federal debt.",
        "In the past, those tactics backfired on Republicans.",
        "Jason Grumet, who heads the Bipartisan Policy Center, says when you practice all-or-nothing politics, you tend to wind up with nothing.",

        "People compromise because they have to.",
        "And it's simply the only way in a divided country to get things done.",
        "And while the American public is still deeply divided in many respects, Galston, the former Clinton adviser, says there is a growing consensus around the need to get things done.",
        "People are sick and tired of what they've been seeing in Washington.",
        "They want something different.",

        "The appeals court said that Michigan's anti-affirmative action referendum was much like this and could not stand.",
        "But, in fact, a majority of the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court right now seems not to like these kinds of programs.",
        "So I think the appeals court decision is likely to fall and the ban on affirmative action in Michigan is likely to go into effect, which of course is a little bit ironic since it was the University of Michigan Law School program that the Supreme Court upheld just 10 years ago."
