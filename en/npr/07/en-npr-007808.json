        "Rob Knight studies the microbiome at the University of California, San Diego.",
        "What's exciting about this is, in addition to showing that we leave microbes behind on surfaces we touch, this also shows that we release our personal microbes into the air of the spaces we inhabit.",
        "The research could also explain how we get our microbes in the first place.",
        "We know that if you live with people, and even if you just work with people, your microbial community has come to resemble theirs.",
        "And in the past, we mostly thought that that was due to touch.",
        "It may be just that you're releasing microbes into the air and some of those microbes are colonizing the people you're with.",
        "Knight thinks we've just begun to understand what our microbes could tell us.",
        "We're finding out that our microbes have a tremendous amount of data in them, right?",
        "And if you think about that as a data recording device that we're just beginning to read out now, your microbes may contain a tremendous amount of information about where you've been, who you've been in contact with and so forth."
