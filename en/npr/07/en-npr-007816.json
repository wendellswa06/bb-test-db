        "Actually, as the obesity epidemic has come on, part of what's happened is not only has everyone been getting a little bit heavier or fatter, if you want to say that, but the heaviest kids have been getting disproportionately fatter.",
        "What is different this time is that we're seeing the lack of a plateau in that group.",
        "And why that particular group?",
        "What is it about those boys six to 19?",
        "Well, we don't know exactly, and we don't know why.",
        "It could be that they just haven't reached that plateau yet that girls reached earlier.",

        "Okay.",
        "So, if you take, let's say, a 12-year-old boy that's about five feet tall, an absolutely ideal weight for a boy that height at that age would around 91 pounds - so relatively skinny, if you think about it.",
        "A kid who was overweight would be more like in the 120 range.",
        "And so a kid that's at the 97th percentile - beyond obese, really - would weigh around 133 pounds.",
        "Are there long-term health risks for a six to 19-year-old who is already 40 pounds overweight at that age?"

        "And to be clear, he's not being fired as FEMA head.",
        "No, he's not, not for the moment, anyway.",
        "Now we mentioned the controversy over his resume.",
        "Tell us more about that.",
        "Well, this morning there have been several disclosures.",
        "Time magazine on its Web site had a story basically saying that the previous jobs he held on his resume seemed to have some holes in them.",
        "One of them, he claimed that--and this is on the FEMA Web site; he claimed that he served as an assistant city manager with emergency services oversight.",
        "Well, the reason that's important is it's the closest he's got to a background in emergency recovery and rescue.",
        "And Time found apparently, according to some people that they interviewed, that really the job he had was really closer to--and this was in Edmond, Oklahoma--was really closer to an intern.",

        "And so why was he appointed head of FEMA?",

        "He was the deputy to Joe Allbaugh, who had the job before him, and Allbaugh said, well, he worked there and he was sort of the natural person to step into the job.",
        "Others have said that it had more to do with the fact that he was Allbaugh's roommate in college.",

        "Administration officials said basically when he said that, he meant just in the very narrow window of time, and it wasn't a blanket statement.",
        "The president is, though, very loyal.",
        "There are lots of people that the press has declared kind of ready to be kicked out of their jobs, and the president has kept them.",
        "And so we're not sure where there will end up with Michael Brown, but he has been an extremely loyal president.",
        "And don't all administrations, to a certain degree, appoint people to these positions on the basis of--somewhat on the basis of their political connections?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The previous administrations, of course, have done this, and they basically do an equation where they weigh a person's actual qualifications with their political qualifications.",
        "I think the argument here made by the president's critics will be that they changed the role of FEMA under the Bush administration and therefore put a more political person at the head of it than a previous administration would have.",
