        "Well, let's begin with the one we played a tape off at the beginning of the broadcast, the rumor that Barack Obama is a Muslim.",
        "And interestingly, you know, is that been able to be tracked down?",
        "I don't know that we've ever found the ultimate source of it because it's now become so pervasive in so many different places.",
        "Primarily - and this is, I think, going to be one of the really important stories about the 2008 campaign - it's being spread by chain e-mails that are a real new form of communication, where, you know, in the old days a rumor would be passed over the back fence or at the bar or at the coffee shop by one person whispering into somebody else's ear.",
        "And now, thanks to e-mail, they can be spread instantly to millions of people, and there's little opportunity to check them out.",
        "And they keep reverberating.",
        "Even if somebody comes out and say, no, that isn't true, the denial does not get attached to that e-mail, which continues to pound around the Internet.",
        "No, it doesn't, and the denial does not get attached.",
        "And I think this is a really important aspect of this - the way that we get these e-mails, they come from our friend, Bob, you know, and it shows up in our inboxes a message from Bob.",
        "And even though we know consciously that it's something that he's just passing along, I think it has some more credibility.",
        "I know Bob.",
        "Bob's a nice guy.",
        "He wouldn't pass along something that wasn't true.",
        "And so, these things get spread and spread and spread, and as a result, you know, we had - there was a poll a couple of weeks ago.",
        "The number of Americans who believe Obama is a Muslim has gone up.",
        "Despite all the things that we've written on Politifact.com and that other news organizations have done, the numbers gone up.",
        "It was 8 percent back in November.",
        "The latest poll, it's up to 13 percent of the people, wrongly believe that Obama is a Muslim.",
        "And is there any way - you put the facts out on your Web site, lots of newspapers do too, broadcast outlets.",
        "Everybody tries to correct the record.",
        "Is there any way to put a stop to rumors?",
        "Well, I don't think we can, and I think that's just human nature.",
        "I think that information is power, and we want to pass on information that we have.",
        "And most of the time, it's true and a lot of time it's not.",
        "What's different this time is that it has spread so fast that the filters that might correct wrong information in the past aren't able to correct it quickly enough now.",
        "And so, you have these misconceptions that spread rapidly before someone independent can get in and check it out and say, nah, that's just not true.",
        "Hmm.",
        "The lead story on your Web site right now is about a chain e-mail about taxes.",

        "I, you know, I wouldn't call this a rumor, but these are the kind of things that we feel we need to check in this new climate.",
        "And so we've put a lot of emphasis when we do things for Politifact on checking these chain e-mails.",
        "We have our own e-mail account that we set up just so that our readers can send us ones like these.",
        "The one you're referring to has to do with something that looks very believable.",
        "It's an e-mail that shows what the tax rates would be for various kinds of taxes: income tax, the capital gains tax, under Clinton, under Obama and under McCain.",
        "And you'll look at it and it looks very authoritative.",
        "And so, I think many people who've gotten this e-mail probably think, oh, okay, so this is a serious analysis of what their tax plans would do.",
        "Well, we checked it out and found that the numbers are largely wrong, and that they make some assumptions that are inaccurate, that are incorrect and then draw conclusions that are just false.",
        "And so we use - on Politifact, we use a truth-o-meter to rate these things, and we gave one of the claims a false and the other two a barely true, which is our second lowest rating.",
        "So it's really a reader-beware situation with all these chain e-mails.",
        "Although they often have a germ of truth, they're largely wrong.",
        "And yet, you know, as those poll numbers indicate, people believe them.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And in your experience, do you think that most of these rumors start as intentional disinformation, to go back and use a Cold War word?",
        "We found - we've traced a few back to the origin.",
        "I did one where I looked at a claim that was made that Senator Clinton refused to meet with Gold Star mothers, the mothers of soldiers killed in combat, and actually traced it back to the original incident, where two women from the Gold Star mothers group went to Senator Clinton's office, and she wasn't there and they weren't able to meet with her.",
        "There was a germ of truth to that.",
        "That became an article on a conservative Web site, and I think the author of that believed he was writing a column rather than a news story.",
        "But he believed he was accurately recounting what happened.",
        "He stated some things that weren't true.",
        "That got exaggerated in chain e-mails that were written by other unidentified people.",
        "And before you know it, you just have a complete falsehood.",
        "Hillary Clinton refused to meet with the Gold Star mothers.",
        "Well, that's not true.",
        "So, I don't think it's part of a grand strategy, but I think that a germ of truth, a modest distortion gets exaggerated in the telling, you know?",
        "Whereas that old story of, you know, you whisper in 10 people's ear and the story is distorted by the end, the same thing happens with e-mail that by the time you finally get that e-mail, the truth has been twisted and exaggerated many times.",
        "We're talking with Bill Adair, the editor of Politifact.com, about rumors - why we believe them, why we continue to believe them even after they've been debunked?",
