        "Right.",
        "It's a pretty big problem if you're trying to confront a rumor.",
        "And this is something that you were talking about, the rumor concerning Obama being a Muslim.",

        "In stump speeches, he started mentioning it.",
        "There was an e-mail campaign that the campaign put out about that rumor.",
        "And one of the risks they faced was, you know, in repeating it to debunk it, they might actually increase its prominence.",

        "And perhaps, that's one of the reasons why."
