        "Is the grain of truth important that Barack Obama's middle name is Hussein?",
        "His father was a Muslim.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a pretty dubious kernel of truth, but it - because, you know, lots of people have names like - well, actually, I don't think that people name their children Adolf any longer…",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "…without (unintelligible) association with Hitler.",
        "But often, there is an underlying truth.",
        "Barack Obama did have, by many standards, an unconventional religious upbringing because of living in Indonesia, living in Hawaii, a mother who very much liked to take him around to different churches and see different cultures.",
        "That's a little bit unorthodox for some people.",

        "I inquired.",
        "It's apparently about a chain e-mail, passing a song supposedly written by a dying, young girl.",
        "It turns out not to be true.",
        "Anyway, friends kind of snapped because I was sick of receiving it, so I copied it and pasted the debunk from Snopes.com to every single person in the e-mail history.",
        "Several people were actually angry with me.",
        "I guess they'd rather believe the lie.",
        "And Farhad Manjoo, that's fascinating.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it turns out this happens often.",
        "You see this often where people will pass on this Snopes thing, and people will get upset because they really wanted those ideas that they saw on the e-mail to be true.",
        "I mean, the reason they passed it on was because they felt it was important, and they felt it was important because, as your other guest says, it resonates with things they, you know, already believe in.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is one of the kind of hallmarks of our age that we are now - because there are so many more sources of information out there, we're more likely to see information that kind of accords with what we already think.",
        "But we can also find other people online, groups and, you know, social networks and things like this who actually believe these things.",
        "And so, if someone passes you some debunking information, you're not readily going to accept that.",
        "I mean, one of the things we see often is that in these chain e-mails, if Snopes, for example, debunks something - the Obama Muslim e-mail has had this - the little - people might start incorporating the Snopes debunk in the chain e-mails.",
        "So now, some versions of the Obama e-mails say, I checked this out on Snopes and it turns out it's true.",
        "This is a way to sort of dissuade people from actually checking it out."

        "Patricia Turner, what do you think?",
        "They're really in a difficult position because I agree with the evidence and have found it in my own research that the repetition actually will increase the number of people who believe.",
        "But there - we've got to have faith in those members of our population, who, when they're given a clear-cut explanation and evidence will accept it.",
        "So, you know, if Barack Obama were to have to left this alone, the whole journalistic community would be saying, you know, aha, look, he won't deny it.",
        "So then, he's in trouble for not denying it."

        "And some experts have praised Obama for the way he handled this.",
        "Specifically, he went on a Christian broadcasting network a few months ago and addressed this head on, and that was - that got good marks because he was speaking to the audience sort of most likely to believe these things and most likely to be dissuaded - to consider them damaging.",
        "And so he went right to sort of the preferred group, and he did confront them head on and stated the facts, repeated the facts rather then repeating the rumor.",
