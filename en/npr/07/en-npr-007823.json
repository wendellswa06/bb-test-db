        "This was a favorite of Henry Clay and the Whig Party.",
        "And Henry Clay had hoped to make the Bank of the United States an issue in the 1832 presidential election, in which he was opposing Andrew Jackson.",
        "And so he arranged that when Andrew Jackson vetoed the Bank of the United States, that this would be something, he hoped that this would be something that would cause Jackson's down fall.",
        "In fact, it didn't.",
        "In 1832, Jackson was reelected.",
        "Thereupon Jackson decided to take on the Bank of the United States, which Jackson considered to be unconstitutional, which is why he vetoed the renewal.",
        "This is sort of predecessor of the Federal Reserve System.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so in order to weaken the Bank of the United States, Jackson removed the federal government's deposits from the bank.",
        "The federal government was the largest customer depositor of the Bank of the United States.",
        "Clay seized on this to declare it unconstitutional.",
        "He believed that the president could not withdraw the deposits on his own authority, that he needed to consult and get the agreement with Congress.",
        "Jackson didn't think that was necessary.",
        "He only thought was that as president this was one of his presidential prerogatives.",
        "So Clay arranged for the Senate, which was at this point in the hands of anti-Jacksonians, the emerging Whig Party, to censure President Jackson.",
        "And he managed to get the bill passed.",
        "This outraged Jackson, and in fact, it rallied the Democrats around Jackson in a way that they hadn't been able to.",
        "It looked as though the Whigs, the anti-Jackson party, was probably going to win in the Congressional elections of 1834 and perhaps carry the White House in 1836.",
        "But in large part, because of the censure resolution which rallied the Democrats around Jackson, which gave them an opportunity to campaign in 1834 and again in 1836 on the issue of Andrew Jackson, despite the fact that he wasn't on the ballot, and it allowed the Democrats to win in 1836 against all expectations.",
        "There are so many seeming parallels here.",

        "Well, that's exactly what happens.",
        "The trouble, from a tactical standpoint on the Democratic side, you know, you don't want to give the Republicans something to rally around.",
        "You don't want this to get personal, because it's relatively difficult to defend the president on the issue of the wiretaps.",
        "That's fairly nebulous and it's complicated and it's a constitutional question.",
        "But if the Republicans can make it, or more precisely, if the Democrats insist on making this a referendum on George Bush, it's a lot easier for the Republicans to rally around Bush then to rally around the issue of wiretaps.",
        "And, indeed, the president, the way he answered that question in his news conference today, chose to overlook the fact that even Russell Feingold, I don't think, is saying we shouldn't be doing this.",
        "He's saying we shouldn't be doing it illegally."

        "Right.",
        "And that's the whole problem with these censure measures.",
        "It comes down to a judgment as to whether the president had the authorization to do it.",
        "And that's a legal question.",
        "It's a question that the constitutional lawyers can argue about.",
        "When it gets into the political arena, things get oversimplified.",
        "Now, from the standpoint of Feingold and the Democrats, certainly they want to focus the attention on what they see to be as Bush's weakness, at a time when he's at a record low in the public opinion polls.",
        "The trouble is, though, that if they get the folks again on Bush, as Bush, the Republicans can simply say about Bush, well, you know, he did this, he's done this to defend the country against terrorists.",

        "It's a classic turnaround on this issue.",
        "Yet, some people are outraged, outraged, by the idea that the president feels authorized without mentioning it to Congress to, in apparent, to flout the law, as they see it, and wiretap Americans.",
        "Well, the fact is its one of those cases when there is an interesting parallel between President Bush and Andrew Jackson, because Andrew Jackson provoked outrage in all sorts of people.",
        "He was, it was an odd situation that he was at the same time the most popular figure in America during the early 19th century, in the middle of the 19th century, but he was also in certain corners the most unpopular.",
        "Certain individual have the capacity to polarize the electorate.",
        "Andrew Jackson certainly did it, and George Bush seems to be doing it.",
        "Interesting there.",
        "At one point I think you quote Andrew Jackson as telling his Vice President, Martin Van Buren, They tried to destroy me with this.",
        "Instead, I will use it to destroy the Bank of the United States.",
        "By court I mean the Palace of Coudenberg, which is where the infanta Isabella lives.",
        "And he decides that he wants to do this.",
        "He feels that there may be possibilities for him there that he can't find in his small town.",
        "He has some reservations.",
        "He's a little nervous about leaving home, but this is his chance to see the world.",
        "Oh, well, the bank of the United States became this hot button issue.",
        "And for about three or four years during the 1830's, it was one that defined how a person stood on the issue of democracy, on business, on presidential authority, and just about everything.",
        "And this, now, it's hard to recapture what a controversial issue the Bank of the United States was.",
        "We've lived with the Federal Reserve System for nearly 100 years and it's worked pretty well.",
        "But the Bank of the United States was this issue that galvanized opinion on both sides.",
        "Either you thought that the Bank was exactly what this country needed to get on the right track and to allow business to grow and investments to be secure, or you thought that the Bank was an illegitimate usurpation of power, a handing-over of power that should have been in the Democratic arena to the private sector, to the fat-cat bankers who were lining their pockets at the expense of the public.",
        "And so, it was not this sort of dry, dusty issue, the way we see it from all this distance away.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "In fact, it's a historical curiosity that the consistently most devisive, controversial issue of American politics during the 19th century was one that has disappeared entirely.",
        "And it was the money question.",
        "Who's going to control the money supply of the United States?",
        "That's what the Bank of the United States issue was all about.",
        "But in 1913, when the Federal Reserve System was created, that entire controversial issue just disappeared.",
        "Interestingly too, that, as you say, this was an issue that was developed around the emerging Whig party that did become a force later in American presidential politics.",
        "And in fact, well, the Whig party is the one party in American history that emerged, really, over a single issue, and the issue was Andrew Jackson.",
        "This group took about six or eight years to coalesce.",
        "But the thing that held the Whigs together was their opposition to Andrew Jackson.",
        "And it should be said, their opposition to the things that Jackson stood for, in particular, widespread democracy.",
        "When Jackson became President in the 1820's, the notion that ordinary people, the ordinary people of America should run the country, was still arguable.",
        "And Jackson's opponents took issue with it, and that's in part what the Bank of the United States was about.",
        "The people who ran the bank were members of the political and economic elite, and they thought they ought to be running the Bank of the United States and they ought to be running the country.",
        "Jackson differed, he certainly believed they should not be running the country, and he went beyond that to say, well, they shouldn't even be running the monetary policy of the country."
