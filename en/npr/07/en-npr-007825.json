        "The Russians and Assad have had some notable victories against ISIS, particularly really in the city of Palmyra.",
        "And from there, if that is their chosen strategy, they could move to the city of Deir ez-Zor, which is partly ISIS-held, or they could move on to Raqqah.",
        "But recently in recent weeks, the focus of their fighting has been against opposition forces.",
        "And Alice, just last month, you were in Northern Syria where these U.S.",
        "special forces troops are headed.",
        "What did the Syrians that you met there tell you about how they've been operating?",
        "Well, it was very interesting to hear Tom saying that the focus of these new forces that are coming in will be to recruit Arabs to work alongside the Kurds that are fighting against ISIS as they move into Arab areas because at the moment, the special forces have had quite a limited presence.",
        "Although I think it's been very useful in terms of training and helping, calling in airstrikes during the actual courses, the battle.",
        "But it was interesting to talk to particularly people on the Arab side there about the meetings that they had been having with American officials.",
        "They wouldn't go into a lot of detail, but they felt and certainly they hoped that the Americans were building up a relationship with them that would continue for some time as they fight against ISIS in that area.",
        "I mean, Tom, let's step back for a second here.",
        "We've got American special forces on the ground, Kurdish fighters, Arab fighters, ISIS.",
        "We've got Al-Nusra, the Syrian regime all in this battle.",
        "How close is this conflict at all to any kind of resolution?",
        "It's nowhere near coming to any kind of resolution.",
        "And again, if the Syrian forces are pushing toward Aleppo, if the Russian artillery's moving up there - there've been some strikes in marketplace - if the special operators are going to be moving into the eastern part of the country, you're going to see a lot more fighting in the coming weeks, a lot more bloodshed and always civilian casualties.",
        "And you're going to see more people start heading for the exits up into the north, up into Turkey again.",
        "So yeah, this is going to go on and probably get a lot more bloody.",
        "That's NPR's Tom Bowman and Alice Fordham.",
        "Thanks to both of you.",

        "You're welcome.",

        "The CEO of Tribune Publishing, Jack Griffin, calls the split from what's now the Tribune Media Company an untethering from other kinds of media.",
        "He says it will allow his company of newspapers and digital properties to do one thing it hasn't been able to do for a long time.",
        "Pursue our own destiny in a very straightforward and clear way.",
        "I was struck by that, too.",
        "I mean, that Mitt Romney did mention the fact that he was governor of Massachusetts, but only to mention that he had appointed a lot of women.",
        "No mention of the Olympics at all.",
        "It did seem a pretty glaring omission.",
        "What's happened to the notion that you might trumpet your achievements as governor of a state, David Brooks?",
        "I think people have a sense he was a competent governor.",
        "I think people have a sense he was a competent Olympic leader.",
        "But they don't have a sense that he's a decent guy.",
        "If you ask on likeability, and by some polls he has a 23 point deficit against Barack Obama.",
        "If he was even in likeability, he'd be winning this election pretty easily.",
        "And so that's what they went after.",
        "I was stunned for the past - the first three days of the convention, they really did almost nothing really to give us any anecdotes.",
        "And finally on Thursday night they had two Mormon families, both of whom suffered tragic losses of their children, and they talked about Romney's ministering to them.",
        "Why those people haven't been in ads for the past months, why they haven't had dozens more - and you hear cases of other - many other examples where he's done similar ministering, heartbreaking cases where he really went out of his way to be a community builder - why that is not out there is the case of grossest campaign malpractice.",
        "And they let this image of him as this stiff inhumane corporate cog linger out there month after month and then they finally bring out these families and they do it on the night where it's bound to be overshadowed by his speech.",
        "It's mystifying to me.",
        "The main thrust, though, was that he deserves to be president because he was a successful businessman, a successful CEO.",
        "Does that pitch sell if you want to be president and commander in chief, E.J.?",
        "I don't think there's been as pro-business a Republican convention since the gilded age.",
        "I mean, any mention of the private sector was cheered through the rafters - to the rafters.",
        "And I think that this may be the Republican Party talking to itself.",
        "What they're trying to argue is Obama is anti-business, which I think the facts suggest otherwise, and that he doesn't believe in opportunity, he only believes in government.",
        "The whole premise of the three days, about you didn't build this, was built on a grammar mistake, as Glenn Kessler of the Washington Post put it.",
        "And so I think they're going to overplay the businessman.",
        "I mean, that is his main calling card but the Obama campaign showed that you can make that a vulnerability and I don't think people want a businessman as president.",
        "They want a president, a leader, as president.",
        "You know, it's interesting because there was somewhat - one other thing that was missing from this convention.",
        "Not just George W.",
        "Bush himself, but virtually no mention of his name, much less his administration.",
        "There was, in a speech from Jeb Bush last night, a mention.",
        "He did go off script and added this.",

        "Almost as an apology - total elimination from collective memory of the Republican Party, David Brooks.",
        "It would've been great if he would have said I love my brother and he was a great president, but he didn't add that phrase.",
        "He really should have.",
        "You know, the party's conflicted about President Bush.",
        "They like him, but they think he was too much spending.",
        "He got away from the notion of fiscal discipline.",
        "That's not entirely fair, but that is the perception because of the prescription drug benefit and all the rest.",
        "And I think they do think he - there was too much compassionate conservatism under George W.",
        "Bush and not enough business.",
        "And if you have a long economic slowdown caused in part because the business community is extremely nervous, they're sitting on these hoards of cash, they don't have the confidence to invest because of volatility, I do think the business experience, a sensitivity to what will make people invest is a reasonably good preparation.",
        "It's not the same as making business decisions, but as you've seen over the past six years, Romney has become much less of a business thinker, much more of a political thinker.",
        "He started this campaign with 59 economic proposals, which is just what a corporate guy would do.",
        "Now he's really focused on the key things - tax reform, Medicare, entitlement reform.",
        "So I think he's evolved in a much more political direction, in the way that a president has to think, not the way a CEO has to think.",

        "The Republicans know that.",
        "A word that I don't think I heard mentioned through the entire convention is the word Iraq, and indeed it was so striking that foreign policy was almost missing.",
        "Even Condoleezza Rice, who gave what I thought was one of the very best speeches at that convention, didn't talk about it.",
        "And so - that was one of the most striking things about this convention.",
        "The last two Republican conventions were all about national security and foreign policy.",
        "Hardly a mention, except for Condoleezza Rice and John McCain in their speeches, which, you know, Condoleezza Rice's was in primetime, McCain's wasn't.",
        "David Brooks, you had a lot of fun earlier this week in a column that you titled \"\"The Real Romney.\"\" You called it the definitive biography, a unique look into his bironic soul.",
        "And here are a few takeaway points from your biography.",
        "Romney, you said, uttered his first words at 14 months, and they were - I like to fire people.",
        "Later, he bought a mood ring, but it remained permanently transparent.",
        "And you called him a passionately devoted family man who streamlined his wife's pregnancies down to six months each."
