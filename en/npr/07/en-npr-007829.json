        "And the rovers underbelly, what Callas calls the belly pan, is perilously close to some rocks.",
        "And perhaps worst of all, every time theyve tried to move the rover, it sunk a little deeper.",
        "Sinking much further would be disastrous.",
        "Because if you put the belly pan of the rover on the ground, thats pretty much game over in terms of trying to get the rover out, because then you would be bearing the weight of the rover on the belly pan and not on the wheels, where you need the traction.",
        "So after months of working on the problem, on Monday, the team will send the rover instructions to try backing out the way it came in.",
        "Managers sound hopeful, but not optimistic.",
        "Cornells Jim Bell says even if the rescue plan fails, there is still science that Spirit can do.",
        "In addition to taking pictures, its robotic arm still works.",
        "So Bells says it can do things like",
        "analysis of these salty deposits that the rover is stuck in.",
        "I mean, its a great place to get stuck if you have to be stuck somewhere."
