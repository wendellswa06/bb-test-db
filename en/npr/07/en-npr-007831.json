        "But they were really influenced by the media and kind of MTV and hip-hop and looking to gangster culture and hip-hop culture for inspiration.",

        "And with the rise of reality TV and the rise of social media, everybody can be a celebrity, and fame has currency.",
        "And so in a lot of my interviews, when you ask kids what they want to be when they grow up, they say rich and famous.",
        "A theme that seems to emerge a lot, too, in your work is that people will pay money and want to acquire money to look like and have the trappings of having money.",

        "So that is just kind of the best example of it never being enough.",
        "There's kind of a theme of addiction and the addiction of consumerism.",

        "This is wealth pursued and taken away, people who reached up and discovered they reached too far.",
        "From Chuck, a GM worker who is in foreclosure and lost his job when the GM factory left town, to Jenny, who was a real estate agent, very successful in the crash, bought a house, built a pool and then lost it to foreclosure and had to turn to phone sex because it was the only job she could do at home where she wouldn't take her truck out and fear having her truck be repossessed.",
        "Wow.",
        "This is an empty home where the child's trophies were all left in the garage.",

        "And Greenfield says now, decades after she started taking these pictures, projecting wealth is more important than ever.",
        "I think the backdrop of these 25 years is that we've never had more inequality, and we've never had less social mobility.",
        "So in a way, fictitious social mobility, bling and presentation, has replaced real social mobility."

        "Some states had more.",
        "Some states had less.",
        "Precisely.",
        "Gould and Klor used this variation to study how the backlash affected the assimilation of Muslim immigrants across the country.",
        "And they track assimilation using a series of different measures.",
        "Most importantly, they look at how all these rates changed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in states that had a big backlash against Muslims compared to states where the backlash was muted.",
        "Here's Gould.",
        "We find that in states which had a bigger backlash against the Muslim community, we find lower rates of assimilation, meaning they become much more likely to marry within their community, a lower likelihood of speaking English well and speaking English at home and lower rates of female labor force participation.",
        "OK, this is disturbing, Shankar, because terrorism experts will warn that unassimilated groups in your society are more vulnerable to extremist recruitment or terror recruitment.",
        "You're saying terror attacks make people less assimilated, which means it's a self-reinforcing pattern."

        "It potentially is a self-reinforcing pattern, Steve.",

        "They're thinking carefully not just about their targets but about the consequences of these attacks.",
        "And terrorism turns out to be a very effective way to drive people apart and produce this very predictable response.",
        "Here's Gould again.",
        "The people perpetrating these attacks may actually be trying to instigate a backlash against the Muslim community in order to slow or halt their assimilation process.",
        "He says, may.",
        "Is there evidence that this is what terror groups explicitly want?",
        "I think there is some language that terror groups such as ISIS and al-Qaida have used in the past that express their dissatisfaction with Muslims living in the West, in the secular West.",
        "Now, at the same time, I don't think we have hard evidence that the groups are planning their attacks in order to reduce the assimilation of Muslims in the West.",

        "Terrorism is a form of theater.",
        "It always has an audience in mind.",
        "And what's clear, I think, from Gould's research, is that one of the potential audiences of terror attacks are Muslim immigrants living in the West because if you look at the pattern of what happens after the attack, it squares very well with the long-term strategic goals of these groups.",
        "You know, sometimes after terror attacks, we've had public officials say, don't do the work of the terrorists.",
