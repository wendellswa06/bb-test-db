        "That's right.",

        "You look at that and it looks great, it's encouraging.",
        "Maybe there's a slowing, which would be a very, very good thing.",
        "And Shaman says his model shows something similar.",
        "But...",
        "I wouldn't be jumping for joy though, OK.",

        "For instance, treatment centers are also reporting they have some empty beds, which is kind of surprising.",
        "Usually they have to turn away patients.",
        "So those empty beds could be a good sign.",

        "Why?",
        "Well, there were many signals, intelligence information that there would be cells, extremist cells that would attack her, that would seek to kill her.",
        "She also had information that people around Musharraf wanted to kill her.",
        "In fact, she sent a letter to Musharraf saying that three individuals, a former head of the ISI, the intelligent service of Pakistan, Hamid Gul, the head of the intelligence bureau Ijaz Shah and someone else, a head of the provincial government of Punjab, were plotting against her.",
        "So she felt that there was a high risk going back, but nevertheless, she felt that she had no other choice, that this was her destiny.",
        "And there was an attempt on her life almost as soon as she gets there.",
        "And then sure enough, two months later in December of 2007 is when the assassination occurred.",
        "She's at a rally.",
        "There are gunshots and explosions.",
        "There's a lot of confusion.",
        "How did she die?",
        "Well, she's in this park in the city of Rawalpindi near Islamabad, and she's quite happy about the results of the rally.",
        "And she's going away from this park, and despite the protection that she was to be afforded by the police, the police are nowhere to be found.",
        "And there's a huge number of people around her vehicle.",
        "And an individual fires and then blows himself up, a suicide bomber, and kills 38 people, including Benazir Bhutto.",
        "Many stories around this, I began to discover in this investigation, including that there was a backup car that was bulletproof that was nowhere to be found."

        "What was your take away from the piece?",
