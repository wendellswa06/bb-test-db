        "I think all we can see this is as a modest step towards trying to bring some clarity to the housing situation, and at least something on the right side rather than the wrong side of the balance for institutional accountability.",

        "And again, in so doing, what they're trying to do is stop films that are kind of sort of broadly liked but not really loved by anyone and ensuring that those films don't find their way onto the list.",
        "Well, if you look at the Best Picture nominees from the past two years, when it was expanded to 10, can you look at those and say immediately, you know, there are a couple on here that just really shouldn't have made the cut?",
