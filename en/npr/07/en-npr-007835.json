        "If it's a girl main character, especially, they're sassy and spunky, and she's the opposite.",
        "She's this very quiet girl who just wants to do good, please the teachers.",
        "And that's worked pretty well for her through kindergarten through fourth grade, but now that she's in fifth grade, her friends are now calling her a goody-goody and things like that.",

        "He's - right.",
        "But lately she doesn't - she's not sure why, but he's been kind of acting like a jerk.",
        "And we find out that he's basically been bullied this year, and the bully is the third main character.",
        "That's Chad Hilligas.",
        "And right next to the school is a pretty scary woods, and that's where they encounter this mysterious mud.",
        "Right, yeah.",
        "Chad threatens to beat Marshall up after school.",
        "So when Marshall and Tamaya walk home, he leads her on this shortcut through the woods, and they proceed to get lost.",

        "And I want to not give away too much again, but the fuzzy mud is, I guess, the source of the mystery and terror, I guess, that takes place."

        "That's right.",

        "Did he do it for the campaign contributions?",
        "Did he do it to help out his son who worked for MBNA?",
        "Or did he do it for a very large and important constituent?",
        "The answer from the Biden campaign is that he believed in this position and it makes perfect sense for him to support his constituent.",
        "And the notion of helping his son and doing it for the money is not such a good idea.",
        "But what this raises the issue of, I think, is whether he is as much an outsider to the Washington ways as the Obama campaign is trying to portray the Obama-Biden ticket.",

        "And if you're wondering, isn't that what planes do anyway, well, here's the difference.",
        "The new approach brings airplanes down in an angled, steady drop, as if moving down a ski slope or a ramp.",
        "Traditional landings use a more gradual, stair-step approach.",
        "UPS planes are testing this new technique at several airports, and it's also being used in Los Angeles at LAX and at London's Heathrow Airport.",
        "Alex Kingsbury wrote about continuous descent for the upcoming issue of U.S.",
        "News and World Report.",
        "One way to think about this is sort of like an Easy Pass system at the toll booth.",
        "Basically, with the current toll system, you know, you have sort of cars stopped along the way as they move through the toll, and each pays and they go through.",
        "With continuous descent, it's a bit more like the Easy Pass.",
        "They just sort of gradually keep going and maintain their speed as they come right down and go through.",
        "So not to extend the analogy too far, but it basically keeps everything moving along, so it reduces some of the congestion in the skies and hopefully makes everything flow a little bit more smoothly.",
        "Would passengers actually feel the difference if you're inside one of those planes?",
        "Well, I've talked to some people who've ridden on this, and the answer is no, not really.",
        "I mean, your ears are still going to pop.",
        "But what you will notice is as the planes go down these gradual steps that you were talking about, the engines have to fire up and they push forward again, and it sort feels like a mini takeoff, if you will.",
        "With this it doesn't happen.",
        "The plane essentially stays in idle mode or in neutral as it coasts right down into the runway.",
        "So it's a much more gradual and continuous descent.",
        "And as it coasts, how much fuel and how much money is saved using this process?",
        "Well, it depends on the plane, obviously, but UPS has found that for their flights landing in Louisville, which is where they're testing this new system, they save about 50 gallons of jet fuel per landing.",
        "Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but the price of jet fuel is about $4 a gallon, and they're saving about $200 per flight.",
        "And it saves a lot.",
        "It also saves a lot of carbon dioxide, about 1,300 pounds per flight."
