        "Butler and her fiance are likely to earn good salaries in their respective medical fields, but their combined - mostly federal - debt load by the time they finish school later this year: at least $350,000.",
        "We're definitely planning to live minimally, you know, not take lots of vacations or live in a fancy apartment and delay buying a house, which is unfortunate.",
        "So, what's part of the solution to all this?",
        "Tracy and her fiance are heartened about a relatively new federal income-based repayment program.",
        "It ties the loan repayment amount to how much you earn and family size.",
        "And, after 20 years, if they still owe money, the remainder is forgiven.",
        "Lauren Asher with the Institute for College Access and Success pushed for that plan.",
        "She says while it doesn't solve the problem of rising cost and debt, income-based repayment is a big step forward.",
        "That's a light at the end of a tunnel.",
        "The forgiveness in the income-driven plans is the assurance that your payments will not last forever.",
        "They won't follow you to the grave.",
        "Now, few can predict their income five years down the line, let alone 20.",
        "But Tracy Butler says the program offers solace that the debt burden might be manageable, and may allow her and her fiance to start saving for kids, a mortgage or retirement a lot sooner.",

        "Last year, Michele Roberts made history when she became the first woman to head up a major North American sports union, the National Basketball Players Association.",
        "At the time, the union was fractured by scandal.",
        "It's been up to Roberts to repair the damage and represent the interests of players going forward.",
        "When the NBA playoffs - with the NBA playoffs starting this week, we thought it was a good time to check in with her.",
        "She joined us earlier from New York, and I asked her what her connection was to basketball.",
        "Simply that of a fan.",
        "I have two older brothers who both played basketball, and when we grew up - when I grew up, we had one television.",
        "And they dictated the terms of watching, and that - we watched a lot of Knick basketball.",
        "And so, you know, for me, when you watched basketball, you love basketball.",

        "Well, you know, it's not to say that every player comes from the inner city or comes from a poor background, but a good number of them do.",
        "And those were the players that I initially began to connect with.",
        "I viewed them as the kids that could have been from my neighborhood - they came from neighborhoods like mine - that were fortunate enough to make it.",
        "And, you know, I had a sense of how much of a struggle it was for them.",
        "And I found myself loving the players as much as I love the game.",
        "Now, the previous CEO, Billy Hunter, was ousted in 2013.",
        "The players voted him out after an independent audit accused him of mismanagement and nepotism.",

        "Tell us what you saw there.",
        "I mean, what were - what kind of shop was being run, and how do you want to change it?",
        "I had to reestablish credibility.",
        "The good news was that there was a level of enthusiasm among my players for taking the union forward.",
        "There are players that are understandably remaining skeptical, and they should.",
        "And I realize that I have to earn their respect.",
        "How do you know?",
        "Like, how are you getting that sense?",
        "Well, I actually have, believe it or not, met with every team and just about every single player.",
        "And my players are not shy at all.",
        "They are really quite clear.",
        "There have been a number that have said, you know, look, we were really damaged by what Hunter did, and I, for one, am skeptical.",
        "And you're going to have to demonstrate to me that you're going to put the interest of this union before any others.",
        "And that's a welcome - a welcome challenge.",
        "Going back to the last contract negotiations in 2011, it's been noted that the players' cut of basketball-related income was cut from 57 percent to 50 percent.",
        "And at the time, owners claimed that they were losing money.",
        "And, of course, now there's this new television deal that pays the league 2.7 billion - with a B - dollars a year.",
        "And meanwhile, you know, we've had the Clippers recently were sold in LA for $2 billion.",
        "How does all of this change the atmosphere for the next set of contract negotiations?",
        "We don't have - and I don't expect to hear the owners this time around - suggest that any changes - drastic changes in either BRI or otherwise are necessitated because of a lack of money.",
        "That, as I say, dog won't hunt.",
        "And I don't think they're going to make those arguments any longer.",
        "So I'd like to think, therefore, we don't have to do things like lock each other out or strike.",
        "One thing that's interesting though is that fans, it seems at times, are pro-owner when it comes to labor disputes, especially when those disputes turn into work stoppages or take away the games that they love to watch - right?",
        "- if there are lockouts.",
        "And that - the narrative usually turns into, like, hey, the players should take a deal.",
        "They get paid a ton of money.",
        "And how do you counter that 'cause the numbers that do get thrown around, especially for the marquee players, are enormous.",
        "What's amazing is that the numbers that are thrown around don't include the billions of dollars that the owners make.",
        "And once there is a fair discussion of the enormity of the money that's being made by the owners, I think and I believe that fans will be less willing to suggest that it's the players that are being greedy."
