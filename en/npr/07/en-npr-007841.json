        "Well, this study is concerning, because although it purports to have about a 10 percent lower risk for type O blood versus the other types of blood, the data are very soft.",
        "There are significant issues here.",
        "You know, these studies, which they looked into these large patient cohorts of almost 89,000 patients cumulatively, they were - this was not the purpose of the study.",
        "So they were basically dredging the data, and this is the same type of problem we ran into with hormone replacement therapy and Vitamin E, and it's why a classic paper back in 2005 by John Ioannidis was why most published research findings are false.",
        "And I actually think that's what this is.",
        "So they did find a correlation there.",
        "Is there another explanation?",
        "Well, it's about a 10 percent effect of the, you know, so-called or putative protective effect of blood type O.",
        "So small.",
        "Very small effect.",
        "And they actually go back and look at the six other studies, cumulatively, and only half of them had any level of significance but very small effect.",
        "Beyond that, there's a problem of why.",
        "There's no real mechanism.",
        "There's no real science behind this.",
        "And so you have very weak effect, which is inconsistent, that is many studies showed no significant effect.",
        "And then you have basically this data dredging affair, where they had to look at a very large number of patients to find - eke out this tiny effect.",
        "What should people really be thinking about in terms of the drivers of heart disease?",
        "Well, you know, the things that we know so well, like obesity and diabetes and smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and sedentary - lack of exercise, those are the biggies.",
        "They're not going to go away.",
        "They are so much more overshadowing this tiny and questionable effect of blood group.",
        "And of course if there was a blood group effect, which is quite questionable, as you already pointed out, we don't have a whole lot of control about that, but we do about much of our lifestyle."

        "Well, you know, it really is kind of a multiple hit phenomena.",

        "When we looked at the common variations in people's DNA, we found some markers, which - a couple of which are pretty important but not anything overriding, that is, you know, a 20, 30 percent risk if you have one of these alleles.",
        "But now with a lot more sequencing, with it become so high throughput, so inexpensive, the hunt is on for the low frequency or more rare variants, which cumulatively will probably explain a large part of the risk, that is, at least, the genomic risk for heart disease.",
