        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And that is because, you know, you can't change your genes, and that's probably not going to happen in any way for quite a long time, but you can work on all the other risk factors, and control if it's high blood pressure or diabetes, certainly smoking and being overweight.",
        "So it's really this very important interdependency of one's DNA and all these other conditions and lifestyle.",

        "And they identify an ideal target that could potentially be used for a heart disease vaccine.",
        "Now, that's been talked about for some time, but the right target to make the vaccine against had not really been isolated.",
        "And so this looks promising.",
        "Now, that's many years off, but that would be extraordinary.",
        "That would be a great way to take people who are at risk for heart disease and get them vaccinated young in life so they never really had to worry about it."

        "Describe how you think Netanyahu has changed from the day he was first elected prime minister in 1996.",
        "I think he's gone through several phases, at least on the issue that is so central to any Israeli prime minister - the Palestinian issue.",
        "He started as a real hard-liner.",
        "He dragged his feet on implementing the Oslo Accords they inherited from Prime Minister Rabin and worked on with the Clinton administration.",

        "He gave a very important speech in 2009, where he, for the first time, endorsed a two-state solution.",
        "But also, he told us privately that he really understood, in a new way, the strategic imperative for Israel of separating from the Palestinians, which would have to be in some form of two states.",
        "And we tried two rounds of negotiations.",
        "They both failed.",
        "And I think after the failure, he somewhat reverted back to his roots and fell into the embrace of his base.",
        "He concluded there was no Palestinian partner, but he also decided that was going to be his last attempt at trying to achieve a two-state solution.",
        "Has Netanyahu grown more and more right-wing?",
        "Because Israel has grown more and more right-wing.",
        "When he came back into office in 2009, he sought a coalition that had balance in it that placed him almost in the middle of the coalition with parties to his right and parties to his left.",
        "And that allowed him to sort of play the forces back and forth against each other.",
        "And he was the little linchpin, and he could curve - move forward.",
        "He had two consecutive governments like that from the 2009 election and the 2013 election.",
        "Starting with the 2015 election, the coalition math didn't offer that possibility to him.",
        "And his most recent government - the one that's outgoing now - was much more to the right.",
        "In fact, he may have been one of the most left-wing members of his government.",
        "And that very much looks like it will be the case in the new government that he's likely to form.",
        "So as any politician has done, he's adjusted.",
        "He's followed where the winds have gone, and he has governed from a more right-wing perspective.",
        "He doesn't have the left-wing balancer.",
        "And the indication of that came in this final weekend...",
        "Right.",
        "...Of the campaign when he, for the first time in his career, said that he would be open to annexation of parts of the West Bank.",
        "He's always resisted that, always knowing that that could pull Israel down a path of irreversible permanent control of Palestinians.",
        "Nevertheless, that's what many of his own supporters in other parties in the coalition and even in his Likud party are looking for.",
        "And he viewed that as a necessary commitment in the closing phase of the campaign.",
        "They're going to try to hold him to it once they take office in a few weeks' time.",
        "How would you say Netanyahu has changed Israel in the past decade?",

        "He has changed Israel by heavily promoting Israel's high tech sector with research and development funds and helping open markets in new countries all over the world.",

        "But Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, several of the other Gulf states see Israel under Netanyahu as a partner - a partner in confronting their common enemy, which is Iran, and a partner in trying to convince the United States under President Trump to take a very hard line.",
        "But those relationships may be set up for a test now if he does indeed proceed with annexation moves in the West Bank.",

        "But no one is going in that direction, Robert.",
        "And, in fact, the process, this very complicated intergovernmental process around the bank for international settlements and the so-called barter committee will probably end up saying the banks should have capital between 10 and 12 percent capital ratio."
