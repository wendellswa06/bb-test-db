        "The chances of a recovery are based on the assumption that fishermen will actually keep to the quotas that have been negotiated.",
        "Joseph Powers at Louisiana State University is a science adviser to the tuna commission.",
        "And he says the new quota looks okay at least on paper.",
        "If, in fact, that were perfectly implemented, then yes, you would start to begin the long recovery process.",
        "But the fisheries, particularly around Europe, have a dreadful track record in implementing tuna quotas.",
        "Susan Lieberman at the Pew Environment Group says some European nations do a very poor job of enforcing the quotas.",
        "And theres a lot of illegal fishing going on, again, particularly in the Mediterranean.",
        "She says fishermen sometimes catch twice as many fish as they are allowed to under the formal quotas.",
        "So even though the tuna commission has finally paid attention to its scientists on Eastern bluefin tuna, Lieberman is still very discouraged.",
        "I would say its not really so much a turning point, as a baby step in the right direction.",
        "I dont know if the bluefin tuna has enough time for all the little, tiny steps, but its better than nothing.",
        "Lieberman says the commission probably went as far as it did because conservation groups, including hers, are trying to get bluefin tuna protected as an endangered species under a treaty called CITES.",
        "The government of Monaco has made that a formal proposal.",
        "Commissioners hoped they could forestall that action if they took serious enough steps at this meeting.",
        "The U.S.",
        "government strongly supports Monacos efforts to ban bluefin tuna trade.",
        "But today, NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco was a bit noncommittal about what exactly that means.",
        "Because the meetings have just concluded.",
        "We havent had time to consult within the U.S.",
        "government and to decide exactly what our next steps are.",
        "Were going to be doing that very soon.",
        "That next crucial meeting for the bluefin tuna is slated for March.",

        "All there was, in fact, was time.",
        "In a long interview with Colombia's Caracol Radio, Gonzales said that Colombian policemen and soldiers held by the rebels were chained, day and night - when they bathe, when they use the bathroom, when they marched.",
