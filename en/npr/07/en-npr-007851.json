        "You mentioned the civil suit.",
        "This is a civil case you're pursuing, charging that White House officials and others conspired to retaliate against you.",
        "What new evidence do you think you might be able to introduce in that case should it come to trial?",
        "Well, I think the important thing for us is to be able to get discovery.",
        "That way we can begin to ask these people some rather pointed questions about their involvement, and that will hopefully unleash more facts about senior officials' involvement in this matter.",
        "If President Bush were to pardon Lewis Libby, how would you feel about that?",
        "Well, I think that our system of justice requires that justice be served, and I would hope that the president, because this is something where he has distinct conflict of interest - this is, after all, an assistant to the president who has been convicted - that he would refuse himself and stay out of this matter.",
        "In other words, not issue a pardon?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Ambassador Wilson, thanks very much.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "That's Ambassador Joseph Wilson, the husband of Valerie Plame Wilson.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, Lewis Libby was acquitted of one count today.",
        "It was the charge that he lied to the FBI about his conversations with former Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper.",
        "Cooper is now Washington editor for Portfolio magazine, and he joins us from his office in Washington.",
        "Thanks for being with us."

        "Thanks, Melissa.",
        "Were you surprised that that count was the only one leading to acquittal.",
        "I guess I'm a little surprised that was just why - you know, I don't think it would be a four-one split in count, but it makes a certain amount of sense.",
        "You testified first before the grand jury and then at the trial under subpoena.",
        "What do you think the lessons of this case are for reporters, for confidential sources?",
        "Well, you know, Melissa, saying don't quote me on this or let me tell you something off the record is a way of life in Washington.",
        "It's a way of life for a lot of reporters around the country covering other things.",
        "But it's a good reminder that that agreement between reporter and source really has no basis on law, only in honor.",
        "I wonder what you see as the broader lesson of this whole experience.",
        "And we have now this conviction on perjury and obstruction of justice, but nothing about the leak itself, which is how this whole thing started out, as a leak investigation.",
        "Well, Melissa, it's not the first time we've seen things like this.",
        "You know, Al Capone got convicted on tax charges.",
        "So these things can wander far off field.",
        "I don't think in any way that it diminishes the embarrassment to the administration.",
        "You know, part of Lewis Libby's defense was that he was being made the fall guy for the administration, for something far larger than his own actions.",
        "What do you make of that argument in the end?",
        "I think it was curious to a lot of people why some other people weren't charged on the case.",
        "I mean, Ari Fleischer's statements to the grand jury seem to have been false.",
        "So why wasn't he charged?",
        "I think that people have raised that question.",
        "But, you know, the defense came out of the gates with a very strong charge that Libby had been set up to protect other people in the White House.",
        "And then they presented no evidence that there was an effort to set up Libby.",
        "I think if he'd presented some evidence on that front, he might have gotten traction.",
        "Matthew Cooper was one of the many reporters who testified at the Lewis Libby trial.",
        "He's now Washington editor for Portfolio magazine.",
        "Thanks for being with us."

        "One of the things that would get him attention is that he worked for over a decade to pull off a special feat, the triple, which is a somersault done three times.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "What Alfredo would do, he would take a few swings out in the trapeze 50 feet in the air, then release his hands from the bar and throw three backwards somersaults, tuck his body into a ball, propelling himself forward at 60 miles an hour through space.",
        "And then he would dock with his brother, Lalo, who was the catcher.",
        "The triple was this almost mystical feat in the circus.",
        "It probably took more lives than any of the other stunts in the circus.",
        "Alfredo's father tried to dissuade him from pursuing the triple, but he carried it on and spent 10 years doing it."

        "When she got to probably around 20 of these, Leitzel took a fatal plunge.",
