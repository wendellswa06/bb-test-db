        "Sure.",
        "Crystelle is a woman from West Philadelphia who grows up in a community where there is a lot of love, a strong sense of family where residents work very hard.",
        "However, she's growing up in the ‘80s and ‘90s, which was often referred to as the crack era, that time when young black men were being shot and killed by each other at alarming rates.",
        "And her senior year in high school, the boy who grew up across the street from her in West Philadelphia, Jimmy, is shot and killed after a party.",
        "And this is a guy who was like her first kiss, first love, and she is haunted by Jimmy; his ghost literally haunts her.",
        "And I think she is also figuratively haunted by the memories of that night and what happened shortly after the night of his murder.",
        "So when the novel opens she's an adult, she's in her twenties, she's living in New York, but these hauntings have become more sensual.",
        "She is starting to smell him now, and the line that demarcates her world and his world is starting to blur.",
        "The novel is set over a long weekend where she returns to West Philadelphia to in some ways exorcise him to try to come to terms with his loss.",
        "You know, there have been so many books - Beloved comes to mind - that deal with that liminal space between life and death.",
        "What brought you in that direction?",
        "I'll tell you, I was sitting on a stoop in Washington D.C.",
        "It was 1988 or 1989.",
        "And as I was sitting there there were two young women who were walking past me, and one was talking to the other and she said to her girlfriend, I'm just going to go on and have his baby before he gets locked up or shot up or something.",
        "And her voice guided me to this story.",
        "Thank you."

        "NPR's Brenda Wilson reports.",
        "A great deal has been written about African-American men in particular who do not necessarily think of themselves as gay, men who may be involved in sexual relations with both men and women, men on the down-low or the DL.",
        "The CDC's Dr. Ron Wolitski surveyed more than 400 men in cities across the country to try to get a sense of who they are.",
        "He says the term itself can be misleading.",
        "The DL phenomenon is clearly not limited to the black community.",
        "And many men who consider themselves to be on the DL do not have a primary female sex partner.",
        "Some men who think of themselves as being on the DL identify as gay.",
        "This means that our HIV prevention efforts should focus on reducing specific behaviors of both men and women and men who have both male and female partners rather than on labels like the down-low, which may mean very different things to different people.",
        "And while many believe that the down-low has contributed to a high rate of HIV among women in the African-American community, Dr. Ron Valdiserri of the CDC says it's important to remember who is most at risk.",
        "Certainly HIV-AIDS is a serious health problem for African-American women.",
        "No one is denying that.",
        "But when we look at the numbers among African-American males who are infected with HIV, the majority are infected through same-sex contact.",
        "For those who doubt the data showing nearly half of the African-American men who frequent gay bars and nightclubs are infected with HIV, Valdiserri says there's every reason to think it is a reliable estimate.",
        "This wasn't just a one-site convenient sample of someone showing up at a bar and saying to these guys, `Would you like to participate in this study?",
        "There were multiple venues, and furthermore, there was work done a few years back that had similar results.",
        "So I would say that there's a great deal for concern among African-American MSM.",
        "Among white gays, a major factor contributing to a resurgence of HIV is the use of methamphetamine.",
        "It started on the West Coast in the 1980s but is now being widely used in New York, Chicago and Florida, where up to 17 percent of gay men report using the drug.",
        "Dr. Grant Colfax of the Department of Health in San Francisco says to put that into perspective, you have to understand that meth use among gays is three to four times higher than it is in the general population.",
        "We will not be able to effectively address the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men until we get the methamphetamine epidemic under control in this population.",
        "And surveys show increasing use of the drug among African-Americans as well.",
        "Sometimes, however, men assume they are behaving responsibly.",
        "Brown University's Dr. Ken Mayer surveyed more than a hundred gay clients at his Boston clinic who had been HIV-positive for about 10 years.",
        "Mayer says they opted for oral sex or not to penetrate their partners and believed that if their viral load was undetectable they would not transmit the virus."

        "So these findings suggest that many HIV-infected men are using information about viral load and about their partner's serostatus, and they're adopting different sexual practices in an effort to protect their partners from infection.",
