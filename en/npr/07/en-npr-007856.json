        "Now those are important words coming from heads of state.",
        "It means they can't deal with him as a government anymore.",
        "And it would certainly suggest that the end game is that he has to go.",
        "We do believe that a final result of any negotiations would have to be the decision by Colonel Gadhafi to leave.",

        "At some point, realistically, do ground troops have to be deployed?",
        "Well, if the people around Gadhafi do not defect, do not abandon him, and the commanders of this operation - the heads of state behind the coalition that's leading it - if they decide that it has to go ahead until Gadhafi's out of power, I think the only way that you could ensure that is by ground forces taking on his troops.",
        "Those would not necessarily be U.S.",
        "or foreign forces.",
        "In fact, they could be this rebel movement that is out there.",
