        "That's because a man associated with its production is a Coptic Christian based in California.",
        "And on Tuesday, Egyptian authorities issued arrest warrants for seven Copts believed to be living outside Egypt on charges linked to the video.",
        "But Merrit Kennedy reports that Egypt's Coptic Christians have yet to feel a broader backlash against them.",

        "His execution, everything, it just wasn't funny, there was no moment where you listen to him and you even cracked a smirk.",
        "But as far as the tech community specifically, I mean, it's the same everywhere.",
        "There's an underlying racism culture that we all have whether you're black, white or whatever creed or race, that we all have subconsciously at least.",
        "And I think he was tone deaf.",

        "Nobody has done it.",
        "Nobody has actually looked at the fact that in the '60s and '70s people want to reconnect with Africa, and they gave themselves African names, and eventually it evolved to a point where we actually have our own naming system, where suffix like La - or excuse me, prefixes like La or suffix like Kwesha or Keesha are actually create names that are unique to the African-American community.",
