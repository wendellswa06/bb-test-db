        "Also, women's rights was part and parcel of the game, too.",

        "That's correct.",
        "The last time he started a game was in the playoffs in his high school in 1999.",

        "So, if Bill Belichick thinks that you're good enough to lead a team, the team should have confidence in him, and the fans should have confidence in Matt Cassel if Bill Belichick deems you worthy to start as his quarterback.",

        "At the same time, I don't know if they have the all-around talent to upstage the Patriots, for instance.",
        "And speaking of Brett, I think Aaron Rodgers performed better than Brett Favre did in week one because he had a lot more pressure on him up in Green Bay replacing Brett Favre than Brett did leading the Jets to a victory over the woeful Miami Dolphins.",
        "Miami Dolphins.",
        "That doesn't even count.",

        "So, some of it is hyperbole, some of it's a maturation process.",
        "Well, the flipside of that, if you go down into Atlanta, their new quarterback, who was a very high draft pick, Ryan, they did pretty well, and people have thoughts now that the Atlanta Falcons may be on the rebound, Greg?",
        "Let's remember that Matt Ryan, you know, actually a rookie quarterback out of Boston College, they played against the Detroit Lions.",
        "And when you have a running back - a team that runs for 300 yards in a game, it makes any quarterback look good.",
        "So, that - but the Atlanta Falcons, you know, they'll be an interesting team to watch, but they're still a rebuilding team.",
