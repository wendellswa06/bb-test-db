        "Tyrone, there was one criticism of the show that came from a somewhat different angle, which is that, although black women were portrayed as having X, Y and Z issues, it was like, but at least they're better off than black men.",
        "And one refrain I heard from several black women was why do we have to always be put against our successes is the black men's failings?",
        "Did you get any sense that this was something that was not necessarily just in this series, but it's a discussion in and among the community around gender?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",

        "And it's not a good thing for us to, you know, like wish for the black woman obviously to, like, scale back her efforts.",
        "And no one should be surprised, given that - I mean, it was the lack of the man in the household to begin with that gave this women the traits that they ultimately took and push towards success with, you know.",
        "So I think what we should do is we - if we can take something positive from this, we should find a way for black men to kind of like put our efforts on par with the efforts of black women and it goes back to education, it goes back to effort, it goes back to many, many things in this far too complex a discussion for us to be, you know, to be able to have in a half-hour segment or, like I said, in the weeklong series, you know.",

        "And it's an interesting thing because - I mean, just the existence of certain monikers in society - black quarterback, black athlete, black coach, black film, anything.",
        "The thing - the reason that these things still exist is because race is still so important in America, in American society.",

        "Africans talked politics, Americans - black Americans talk race.",
        "Is there a sense with which we have become, we're kind of conflating politics and race and so we talked about everything through a racial lens, even when it is, it's not that it's irrelevant, but that's just perhaps not the best way to go about it?",
        "I think race is so important in this country because I don't think we've ever really had an honest dialogue about it, even going back to the NBC thing just for a moment.",
