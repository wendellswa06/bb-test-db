        "Yes.",
        "Like I said, I tried to do more - now, a more positive blog, but, yes, race is still a factor because I'm starting to post stories about how did the stories about - positive stories about African-Americans, and mainly is to calm back all the negative news that we've been receiving lately.",
        "I do the blogs or news.",
        "And one of my commenter says, once America stop caring about race, then black bloggers can stop focusing on it.",
        "It's still a part - and I agree with the other panelist who said that we have not dealt adequately with the spirit and essence of racism in this country.",
        "And until we have an honest dialogue and put it on that table, it's not going to heal itself.",
        "We see - what the new sense that incident and, you know, what's going on with the disparity and sentencing and charging of crimes and we see that we still have a long way to go.",

        "There was an article that talked about why people don't read Bob Herbert who writes op-eds for the New York Times, as much as they might read Maureen Dowd.",
        "And the analysis basically said, well, people don't want to be bombed out all the time.",
        "They don't want to hear about serious issues.",
        "They don't want to hear about racial injustice.",
        "What do you do to support yourself when you say, okay, well, I am going to blog about these things and I realize perhaps I'm not going to get as wide of an audience because I'm bringing up things that make people uncomfortable.",
        "Do you make peace with that or how do you deal with it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You kind of have to.",

        "And, I mean, while we do have a civic responsibility as bloggers and as people to address other things besides race, you know, quote, unquote, \"\"black issues,\"\" we still can't forget that, you know, the reason why we need voices and how important it is that we speak to these issues no matter how uncomfortable they might get.",
        "A lot of places, from Alaska to Brooklyn, are experimenting with individual microgrids.",

        "There has been such a growth in this kind of self-expression on the Internet.",
        "And now, as we're entering the political season, do you think that there's going to be some kind of a critical mass about talking about issues from an African-American perspective in politics through blogs?",
        "And also - I realized it's a lot to throw out at one time.",
        "What do you think blogs can do and what can't they do in terms of advancing a discussion?",
        "Well, blogs will definitely impact the presidential race.",
        "It's really the only place where black issues are being brought to the front - forefront, to that at least be put on the table whether or not the candidates respond in a way.",
        "But we're at least sending a message to - especially through blogs like What About Our Daughters, people are tuning in, they're listening, they're reading.",
        "I think one of the bloggers - (unintelligible) was even quoted during that series last week with an e-mail that she sent to NBC.",
        "So I think it's going to play a crucial role and I would encourage each candidate to really get out there and if you think that the black women's vote is important, then get out there and read these blogs and find out how we feel.",
        "And I think it's going to be very crucial to this election.",
        "Nashieqa, do you ever think that there's a situation where this whole concept of digital divide also applies within the African-American community where you have a lot of black bloggers now, but you also have people who still lack Internet access or who don't have the pathways to find this kind of information.",
        "What could be done about that?",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, I think that's kind of tough.",
        "Because I - I'm really thankful for the proliferation of black blogs.",
