        "We didn't really know where they came from.",
        "We just knew that they looked different front other meteorites.",
        "In the - in 1976, we had the Viking landers, and the Viking landers had instruments onboard that could measure the composition of the Martian atmosphere, and they did that quite well.",
        "And in the early 1980s, this one meteorite was investigated and found to contain trapped gas inside of it.",
        "When that gas was analyzed, it was shown to be a match to what the Viking landers found in the Martian atmosphere.",

        "There's no other planet or object or moon that has quite the same composition of atmosphere.",

        "Some of them are even, you know, more subtle than what you see just by slicing it open and looking at the texture.",
