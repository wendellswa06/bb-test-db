        "You'd been back in your apartment momentarily, but you were living outdoors, in a tent, because it didn't seem safe to go back inside.",
        "That's right, that's right.",

        "So we have come back inside.",
        "The government of Mianyang today said it was safe for people to go into their apartments, as long as they were on the first or second floor, and there was no damage in the building.",
        "So we came back in today.",
        "OK, so there has been an official announcement.",
        "They've kind of cleared things and said, we think it's OK now.",

        "And they were just feeding whoever was back in that area, for free.",
        "And we went back again yesterday, and they had potatoes.",
        "So yesterday we ate potatoes and rice.",
        "And today, we went downtown, to our favorite rice noodle restaurant, and they were open, serving their rice noodles.",
        "And so we talked with them, and we ate there today.",
        "So, so far we've had plenty of food, and the fruit sellers have still been selling their fruit.",

        "And in the park, we heard, 100,000 people camping in the park.",
        "And it looked like it when we went down there.",
        "And we have heard on the news 18,000 in Mianyang were killed, and another 20,000 missing.",
        "But that includes the whole county around Mianyang, the countryside and everywhere.",
        "We see the things on TV, on TV it looks just horrible.",

        "No.",

        "They were pulled out of the rubble, and they were brought here to our school.",

        "And tomorrow, we will start working with the children.",
