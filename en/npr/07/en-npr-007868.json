        "Thank you so much.",
        "I wonder, how did you prepare to play this character?",
        "Let's see.",
        "Well, I spent some time with some female cops over at the LAPD, female detectives.",
        "I spent some time in the robbery-homicide unit, which was the specialized - which is the specialized division that we represent over - at that time, it was Parker Center in Los Angeles.",
        "I went on some drive-alongs.",
        "I read up on CIA agents.",
        "I spent a lot of time talking to the creator, James Duff, who had sort of built this character on his sisters and his mother, which is interesting, even though the character really mostly resembles him.",
        "And, yeah, it was a fun journey.",
        "As you started this voyage on TNT, you've been involved in lots of, well, interrogations.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "This has been something that has been obviously in the news.",
        "Almost your entire run has been a nonstop series of revelations about what people are asked, what they're allowed to ask and how they're allowed to ask it.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Well, you know, if you talk to cops who interrogate, they often say that they lie.",
        "I mean, it's not against the law for cops to lie in order to get to the truth.",
        "And there was actually a wonderful scene where my husband at the time played by Jon Tenney, Fritz Howard, said to me at one point, you know, you have to - you can't keep lying, and she said - and she says, oh, for heaven's sakes, Fritzy, if we all stop lying to each other, how can we ever get to the truth?",

        "Unfortunately, our union is in such a state that we really get very little, if anything, for syndication.",
        "So, you know, that's a whole another - excuse me - issue.",

        "I'm a fellow actor, and I was actually curious about wanting to talk - wanting you to talk about your process to acting from a film versus a television series, of being able to keep your character up for 100 episodes, but five, six days a week, on top of all that.",
        "So I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the process of going from Kyra Sedgwick to your character on \"\"The Closer.",

        "Unless, of course, you're on the \"\"Bourne Ultimatum\"\" or something like that.",

        "It was - one of whom was the old man who owns the store, and also the little boy - completely innocent, as well his twin brother and two other people.",

        "I don't think that she will be capable of doing it any differently.",
