        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it was interesting that your study found that access to pools or even indeed the cost of - sometimes negligible cost - of swimming lessons, that didn't seem to be that much of a factor.",

        "We were able to get deep down into what was the real issue, and yet there is financial issues, obviously, but many, you know, more racially-underrepresented groups indicated that they didn't understand that they could get free or low-cost lessons from different nonprofit groups like the YMCAs, as well as they, you know, just wanted to save their money for other, what they thought were more prioritized kind of issues like Tae Kwon Do or basketball lessons.",
