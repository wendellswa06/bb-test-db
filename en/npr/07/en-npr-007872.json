        "Well, negligence is a problem.",
        "For example, whenever we're at a pool that's lifeguarded, you tend to have a false sense of security, and it depends on the training of the lifeguards, whether they're certified or not, how cognizant they are of their surroundings, whether their undivided attention is watching the people in the pool.",
