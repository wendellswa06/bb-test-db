        "It's interesting.",
        "Carol Irwin, I think you found the greatest predictor for those who can't swim to be those whose parents can't swim.",
        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "What we did is we had a continuum scale on where people self-reported their swim ability, and then we also asked parents, too, what their swim ability was.",
        "And obviously, the higher swimming ability that parents had matched then with the higher swimming ability for children and vice versa.",

        "Terrific.",
        "Your caller has assumed that if you can stand up, and you get your head above water, you can't drown, and that just is not true.",
        "If the pool is not maintained properly, the bottom can be quite slippery, and particularly if you're near where it starts to drop off, you can slip, become submerged, and if you're unable to right yourself and get your head above water, you certainly can drown from that.",
        "I've seen several situations where the pools were so filthy that they couldn't see somebody on the bottom of the pool until someone went in and actually surveyed the entire bottom, and it took 20, 30, 40 minutes to get them out.",
        "And if they had seen the pool, if the pool was clear and they could have seen them immediately, they could have saved that individual.",
        "Another group that you need to be cognizant of, and this occurs primarily in young teenagers and young male adults, is what we call shallow-water blackout, people going underwater and seeing how long can they hold their breath.",
        "They first hyperventilate to blow their carbon dioxide down so they don't have the urge to breathe, and then they submerged and sit on the bottom or swim underwater for a longer period of time because they can do it.",
        "Keep in mind that during that time, the amount of oxygen in your blood goes down, and you will lose consciousness due to cerebral hypoxia, start to breathe underwater and die.",
        "As a matter of fact, I reviewed a case like that just this morning, where someone was trying to train for the Navy SEAL program by themselves and see how long they could hold their breath, and they were pulled out dead.",
        "So you've got to be very careful.",
        "I do totally agree on both parts, but neither one actually has anything to do with swimming.",
        "Am I correct?"
