        "Essentially, the trick is to relax, hold the arms to the ankles in a kind of fetal position and allow the head to come up and breathe when needed.",
        "Is that a practical technique?",
        "I think we just heard from Dr. Modell probably not.",

        "Not only does this significantly help avoid fear of the water and the panic response, but it will teach children basic water safety and survival skills such as identifying safe places to swim and floating.",

        "And what I want to kind of draw kind of everybody's look into closer is kind of the setting up the scene beforehand.",
        "And as you're scanning, I really like and want my patrons to know that they need to look out for things that could happen before it could even happen because as a lifeguard, one of your main jobs is kind of to look out for everything in a preventative way.",

        "So people obviously thought somebody was to blame.",

        "Those are all important.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",

        "And you mention the drains.",
        "I know of several people that actually were sucked into a drain by their arm and held underwater until they died.",
        "There's no excuse for having a suction drain in a pool without a cover on it that would prevent anybody being trapped.",
        "People take shortcuts in maintaining pools, and that is to be condemned, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Of the cases that you've studied, would you think that what percentage would think were - these were preventable deaths?",
        "Well, it's hard to put a percentage because it's a skewed series.",
        "The only ones in the series are people who died and then ended up in court, not the ones that were saved because the lifeguards or someone else did the proper things.",
        "So the numbers don't mean that much, other than even a single individual who is sucked into a drainage port is one too many, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "There is no reason for that."

        "Now we travel around the world to many locations that have water- and ocean-based activities, and although he has a basic ability to swim, I've tried to urge him to get formal lessons so he'll be truly safe and be able to enjoy all the options that the pool and the ocean offer.",
        "However, he says he's too embarrassed to take lessons as an adult because he thinks it's something someone should learn as a kid, and he would feel extremely uncomfortable, even with private lessons in a public pool.",

        "I used to be a lifeguard in WSI as well, and I taught one adult class, and it was hard work.",

        "It's because he is an adult.",
        "I would also tell him it's much better to be alive and embarrassed than it is to be dead and not embarrassed.",
        "Carol Irwin, it was - we mentioned earlier in your study that people said access to a pool was not really the reason they did not necessarily learn to swim or teach their children how to swim.",
        "Nevertheless, they did say your survey did find that African-Americans, as a rule, had - and minorities, as a rule - had less access to swimming pools.",
        "They did say that they had less access, but specifically, more they were worried about the safety issues around the pool.",
        "Not so much the pool itself but actually getting to the pool.",
        "And they were worried about other, you know, unsafe issues like crime and certain people being around the pool.",
        "But once they got to the pool, it was fine."
