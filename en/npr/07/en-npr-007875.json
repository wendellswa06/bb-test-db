        "And, thankfully, you know, I haven't had to go in after too many adults, but it is, I think, very much about, as you were saying earlier, the proper equipment and the proper training are really - it's a preventative measure rather than a reactive measure is how lifeguards should work, I believe.",

        "It was based on some studies that were done in France that were perhaps misinterpreted.",
        "But about five years ago, Dr. Lunetta and I - he's the professor and chairman of Department of Forensic Science, University of Helsinki - published a paper in (unintelligible) medical literature and a book chapter, and looked at - he had, I think 1,700 cases in his file of people who died from drowning.",
        "And we found that in over 98 percent of the time, you could clearly demonstrate that water was aspirated.",
        "If you don't find any evidence of aspiration of water in someone that was thought to have drowned, I believe that they probably died of another cause such as a sudden cardiac arrhythmia resulting in cardiac arrest before they could aspirate water.",
        "So dry drowning is, you think, a myth.",
        "Let me just say that I don't think anyone has ever proven it exists.",
        "And as a matter of fact, at the world congress on drowning in Amsterdam in 2002, in the final recommendations, it was recommended that the term be drop and not use."
