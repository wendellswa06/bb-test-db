        "When asked today if he stands by his warning, Putin began with a lecture of about the universal nature of democracy.",

        "Putin today said Russia has an unspecified plan of action over Kosovo's expected declaration of independence next week although Moscow has already indicated it won't take punitive measures.",
        "Putin said Russia doesn't want a new Cold War, saying Moscow wants friendly relations with all countries.",
        "Company President Peter Wold says he had to invest in more expensive equipment when federal regulations went into place.",
        "But he says it's worth it if it keeps valuable gas from leaking.",
        "Exactly.",
        "That was all the sort of things that he said that has given many people the idea that he is either racist or ethnically insensitive.",
        "And I think the president needs to combat that and do it in a way that draws attention.",
        "And that's what a speech on Cinco de Mayo would do.",
        "Now, it's interesting that you proposed that he take advantage of the Cinco de Mayo holiday to do this because the president has spoken out on Cinco de Mayo before.",

        "That is a vast majority of Mexican-Americans.",
        "And I think he needs to talk and address to the country exactly what he's trying to do and expressly say that Mexican-Americans, who are also American workers, are people who are going to benefit from his program.",
        "You want the president to transcend his past remarks, as you put it, but you don't feel that he needs to apologize for anything.",
        "Are you saying that just because you don't think he'll ever apologize for anything?",
        "I think what the president needs to do is make a positive case for what he's trying to do.",
