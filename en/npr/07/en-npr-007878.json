        "If we can create that deterrent now early in the year and reduce those numbers of cross-border interdictions as well as, you know, mitigating even one death, we can make some benefit here.",
        "Stepped-up prosecutions have cut the number of people crossing in Texas and cut border violence in Yuma.",
        "But those places have less than one-tenth the crossings in the Tucson sector.",
