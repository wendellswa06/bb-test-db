        "If we get that sort of message out there over the next three and a half, the next four days, I am confident that we will keep control of the United States Senate, and I believe we have a good shot at keeping control of the House of Representatives.",
        "And what do you say to voters who say what are you going to do about Iraq?",
        "How are you going to change what's going on there?",
        "We need to call upon the Muslim - the moderate Muslim nations, like Jordan and like Saudi Arabia, and I would include Egypt in there - to take an increasing position, increasing prominence in affecting what goes on by the religious entities in Iraq.",
        "Iraq has to stand up, their government has to stand up over the next month, two months, three months, in the near future, and disarm the militias.",
        "They have to pass economic reform to allow distribution of the oil royalties so that we can get down and clean up the streets and guarantee security there throughout Iraq.",

        "It's subtle.",
        "Yes, there are I spoke to an officer there in Times Square and he said that right now, there are two officers per block instead of the regular one, but it's not the kind of thing that you would - really sticks out.",

        "That's right.",

        "Many of them are actually Vietnam veterans.",

        "And so, one of them went over - I met with one of them, and he his name is Duane Jackson(ph), and he just thought it was strange that this car was running.",
        "He looked inside, and he saw the keys were still in there, thought it was odd.",
        "And just right around then, the officer, the mounted officer, he happened to come around.",
        "I think he had been alerted by the other vendor by the name of Lance Horton.",
        "And he came by, they started checking it out, and pretty soon, smoke started coming out of the back.",
        "And that's when he and a few other officers started clearing the area.",
        "I think even one of the vendors who I spoke to, he said even then, he didn't quite think it was anything unusual so much as just something was going wrong with the car.",
        "But then soon enough, they had the bomb squad out there.",
        "They had the robots who were, I guess, probing into this vehicle, shattering the windows and investigating, and they find the contents in the back of this vehicle.",
        "It's a Nissan Pathfinder, and it's got this whole array of wires, clocks, three tanks of propane, a couple of tanks of gasoline and then a gun locker, which they would later discover contained eight bags of fertilizer.",
        "As it turns out, the fertilizer was not explosive.",
        "It kind of makes you scratch your head and wonder exactly what this person was like in terms of how much they knew what they were doing or not, but nonetheless, with all the other contents of the car, the police say it could've been a pretty dangerous situation.",
        "It could've killed people.",
        "The explosion couldve ripped open the car.",

        "But the police are not really kind of showing their hand at this moment on that.",
        "They have tracked down the owner of the car, who they do not believe, so far, theyve not described him as a suspect.",

        "It was a dark shirt.",
        "He was taking it off this is outside and revealing another shirt underneath, and they don't refer to him as a suspect, however.",
        "They called him a person of interest because they don't have any reason to believe yet that he was definitely somebody who parked that car, but they just they refer to it as furtive movements.",
        "So they're kind of, I guess, describing it somewhat subjectively.",
        "They think that he's definitely somebody they want to talk to, and they're trying to make it sound a little nicer and a little more welcoming.",
        "They mayor's been trying to bring him on in.",
        "But so far, no word on whether they've actually met this person or not.",
        "And Arun, what's your sense as a New Yorker of whether, you know, what the street vendors noticed and their quick reaction and the amount of policemen paying attention and even the tourist training his video camera?",
        "Is this sort of the heightened citizen vigilance in a post-9/11 New York, or is this just the usual hustle bustle of Times Square?",
        "Well, I think, you know, the thing with post-9/11 is it's very easy for a lot of people it has been, what, eight and a half, almost nine years now.",
        "And so I - my sense is it's not really sort of a permanent state of awareness so much as, yes, you do have a lot of people who happen to be recording things in the area, and when police put the call out, then immediately people started submitting their videotape.",
        "And I'm sure other people are submitting, you know, information they have.",
        "So that's, I guess, part of the new media reality we live in now.",

        "They really know every block and sort of the rhythms of the street.",
        "A lot of them are military veterans, as I said.",
        "So they have a certain awareness.",
        "At least one gentleman spoke to, he really thinks that that's part of their, I guess the asset that they bring to the street.",
        "They're sort of the extended security apparatus of New York City, even if the police don't actually necessarily, you know, look at them in that way.",
        "But you know, this is really the basic, raw street intelligence that makes a difference, I think, in a lot of these situations, it looks like, in recent history, where it really comes down to some person on the street who sees something a little unusual.",
        "Even the police officers, they're kind of rotated in and out of the area as policy.",
        "And so, it's really these vendors, I think, who are, you know, I guess perhaps the best assets in the area."

        "It seemed kind of juvenile and thrown together compared with the, you know, extremely organized terrorist attacks we see internationally and obviously 9/11.",

        "Brian, thanks for your call.",
        "Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not in a position to really say to what extent I mean, I definitely think the word that's been thrown around by Mayor Bloomberg here in New York, as well as others, is amateurish.",
        "Of course, that should be, I suppose, taken with a grain of salt considering that they are also describing that it couldve been very dangerous.",
        "And that I think Police Commissioner Ray Kelly here of the NYPD said that, you know, it was a workable bomb.",
