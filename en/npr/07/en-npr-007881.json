        "This week between Christmas and the New Year is a time of high alert for those involved in counterterrorism.",
        "The fear is that as the number of travelers swells, so do the opportunities for terrorists to strike.",
        "In Britain, Home Secretary John Reid has warned it's highly likely that terrorists will attempt an attack over the holidays.",
        "This past weekend, a British newspaper, The Observer, added to the holiday jitters with a report that the Channel Tunnel is being targeted.",
        "Still, as the year draws to a close, travelers and leaders can take solace in the fact that so far, 2006 has not brought a single terror attack of note in the West.",
        "That is in sharp contrast to last year, when suicide bombers attacked London, and 2004, when almost 200 people died in the Madrid train bombings.",
        "NPR's Mary Louise Kelly has been examining the possible explanations for the lull in terror attacks and what it may signal for the coming year.",
        "You could call 2006 the year of the thwarted attack.",
        "The most serious attempt appears to have been the Heathrow plot, which reportedly involved using liquid explosives to blow up planes leaving London.",
        "British officials, including Paul Stephenson of London's Metropolitan Police, said the casualties could have been in the thousands.",
        "We are comforted that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and to commit, quite frankly, mass murder.",
        "Attacks were also apparently averted in Germany, where bombs placed in suitcases on trains near Cologne failed to explode, and in France, where dozens of suspected members of an Algerian-based network were arrested.",
        "French authorities cited links to three terror plots, including an alleged plan to blow up Orly Airport.",
        "Here in the U.S., security officials were also busy trumpeting foiled attacks.",
        "In June the FBI announced the arrest in Miami of seven homegrown terrorists.",
        "According to the indictment, the men hoped to bomb the Sears Tower in Chicago.",
        "Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez warned left unchecked, these homegrown terrorists may prove to be as dangerous as groups like al-Qaida.",
        "They hoped for their attacks to be, quote, \"\"just as good or greater than 9/11.",
        "But hope and ability are different things.",
        "Even the FBI admitted the Miami plot was, quote, \"\"more aspirational than operational.\"\" Still, it appears to be as close as authorities came this year to uncovering anything resembling an active terrorist cell inside the U.S.",
        "Some terrorism experts, including John Brennan, say that's cause for guarded optimism."

        "He lists international intelligence cooperation and increased security measures among the reasons why this year passed peacefully in the West.",
        "And Brennan also argues that perhaps al-Qaida and its offshoots are not as great a threat as widely assumed.",
        "I don't think the terrorists are as plentiful or as powerful as some people would suggest.",
        "They are very dangerous and it only takes one cell to do tremendous damage or cause significant loss of life.",
        "But I think sometimes the terrorist threat is overstated, giving one the impression that terrorists are everywhere to be found.",
        "That's not the case.",
        "Ohio State University Professor John Mueller not only agrees, he's written a book promoting this idea.",
        "The title, \"\"Overblown,\"\" pretty much sums up Mueller's argument that the terrorist threat has been massively exaggerated.",
        "Osama bin Laden is constantly talking about doing things in various places, not only the United States, but also Italy and Australia, for example, and nothing has happened there either.",
        "If al-Qaida was so dedicated, numerous, devoted, diabolical and so forth as the common image has it, you'd think they'd be able to do something by now.",
        "But Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University says you can read this year's news or lack thereof two ways.",
        "He does believe better intelligence is helping derail attacks.",
        "And, he says, plain old luck has played a role.",
        "But Hoffman also calls this summer's Heathrow plot, with its links to al-Qaida, fundamentally disturbing because of the intended target, commercial airliners.",
        "For the past two or three years we've believed that a degraded, diminished al-Qaida was incapable of attacking hardened targets.",
        "We, I think, embraced the mantra that they were only capable of going after softer, more accessible targets like hotels or tourist destinations or subways.",
        "But here we have a very serious plot against one of the most hardened targets of terrorism since 9/11.",
        "Hoffman argues the Heathrow plot is evidence that al-Qaida remains undeterred in its ambitions and he agrees with recent assessments from U.S.",
        "intelligence officials who say the tribal areas along the Afghan/Pakistan border have given al-Qaida and its supporters a place to rebuild after being routed by U.S.-led forces in 2001.",
        "In public, Liane, the administration will still say it opposes an immediate cease-fire because the conditions for a more durable peace do not yet exist.",
        "And they're surely right about those conditions.",
        "The problem, of course, is that the conditions do not seem to be getting any closer and the air strikes are not knocking Hezbollah out of the fight and they're not knocking the fight out of Hezbollah."

        "As of today, no. I mean, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert just said, before his cabinet meeting today, that Israel still rejects a cease-fire.",
        "But when President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair were together in Washington Friday, they talked of having a proposal for the U.N.",
        "this week, and that will almost surely require Israel - well, if not to agree to a cease-fire, at least to be willing to talk about one, as a prerequisite for the negotiations that would lead to a multinational peacekeeping force in Southern Lebanon.",

        "The House has begun its time away, which it calls, of course, not a vacation but a district work period.",
        "And the Senate, which has been stung by criticism that it doesn't work the same kind of long schedule as the House, is sticking around for one more week to deal with a big list of issues, including an extraordinary baby that the House left on the doorstep when they went home very early Saturday morning and they passed a version of a pension system overhaul.",
        "It's been in negotiation for a year, to try to eliminate the possibility of people losing their pensions in their private companies.",
        "And they also passed a minimum wage increase, the first in a decade, up from 5.15 an hour to 7.25 an hour, over three years.",

        "Yes, and I lived to see the day.",
        "This has been anathema to them since they came to power.",
        "And I - they believe - it's their view that it kills jobs in the United States and helps overseas competitors and reduces profits for American business.",
        "So why did the Republicans vote for it?",
        "Well, that, of course, is a good question.",
        "They did because they saw a chance to do something that they cared even more about, which is to produce a permanent, very deep cut in the estate tax.",
        "They paired the two together, they pushed them through.",
        "And they figured that if in the Senate it doesn't pass, then they can say that the Democrats refused to take a minimum wage increase if the cost of it was a break for people who have very large estates that they're passing on to their heirs.",
        "That gives them a chance to neutralize an issue they were afraid the Democrats were going to use against them in the fall campaigns.",
        "And, Ron, in about the minute we have left, of course, the minimum wage and so forth you've just been mentioning, but are there other big issues on the Senate's plate before they go off?"

        "There were negotiations, as I say, that went on for a full year, and essentially the House leaders walked away from those negotiations at the end, took the parts of the bill that they were ready to take to their members in the House, and then told the Senate, like it or lump it, that's what you've got to take.",
        "Beyond that, they might try to take up the nomination of John Bolton, our - serving as a recess appointment - ambassador to the United Nations.",
