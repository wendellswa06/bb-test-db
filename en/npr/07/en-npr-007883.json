        "Well, I think that is the biggest problem under the faith-based initiative.",

        "The problem is the government hasn't said clearly enough that grantees can't use government funds for things like marriage counseling with religious content or substance abuse treatment with religious content.",

        "So there is pretty clear precedent here is what you're saying?",
        "Oh sure.",
        "This is the first case challenging a specific program on marriage, but there have been lawsuits on sexual abstinence education, on substance abuse treatment, on mentoring for children of prisoners and they all come out the same way.",
        "If the government funds religious content and activities, the activity is likely to be found to be an impermissible government expenditure.",
        "Let me try to come at the application of the separation of church and state here from a skeptical angle.",
        "Sure.",
        "Why should the application of the New Testament to marriage counseling violate a national principle of ours when another group that might apply, say, Reikian therapy and suggest that the organ box is a good technique for saving a marriage something that might be regarded as just as wacky an idea as an atheist might regard the Christian method.",
        "Why would that be a legit grant?",
        "Well, I think the short answer is history.",
        "We have a much longer history of problems when religious organizations take control of government or when government thinks that its job is to impose a particular faith than we do with other kinds of ideologies.",

        "Yeah, I guess that's one thing I wanted to add, that we're talking about the Compassion Capital Fund, but that's almost accidental in this circumstance.",
        "Because the main focus on Americans United was on marriage, and this lawsuit is likely to have some impact on the Compassion Capital Fund.",
        "But it's likely to have as much or more impact on grants under the Healthy Marriage Initiative to faith-based organizations.",

        "As EPA administrator, you would be in a position to serve as plaintiff, defendant, judge and jury on these ongoing eight lawsuits, and that would be wrong.",
        "Now, Markey tried getting Pruitt to say that he would recuse himself from those lawsuits if they came up while he was the administrator, but Pruitt said he'd follow the recommendations of his ethics committee.",
        "Scott Pruitt's critics say he is against the very mission of the EPA, that he'd probably prefer there be no federal EPA.",
        "What does he see as the role of the EPA?",
        "Well, so Scott Pruitt does not want to abolish the EPA.",
        "He says he believes that it has an important role in protecting the environment and the public's health, especially in issues across state lines.",
        "But it's his belief that the EPA has hurt states' economies and industry by overstepping its bounds.",

        "What's driving it?",
        "Well, a couple of things.",
        "One is that these monthly numbers are subject to adjustment, and you really need to average the months.",
        "If you do that, job growth looks like it's on a pretty steady trend.",

        "Now we see 150,000 in January.",
        "Together, that's about a - 200,000 jobs a month, which is the long-term trend.",
        "Now, one other reason is that January was a bit weaker, and it appears the economy slowed in the final months of last year to under 1 percent annual growth rate.",
        "That lower job growth in January may be reflecting that employers pulled back a bit on hiring workers because of a slow down in the economy."
