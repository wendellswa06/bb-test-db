        "All right.",

        "Oh, yeah.",
        "...that is not electronic because the most important thing is keeping things mellow and having your kids subdued while you can deal with all the other things you have to deal with.",
        "So what sort of entertainment do you have?",
        "Blocks, puzzles, crayons, things that you normally have, but make sure it's not electronic if the power goes out, that you can still have a good time with your kids.",
        "And aside from all their other things, if they're happy and smiling, it makes everything else easier to deal with.",
        "Well, you know, Todd, that brings up a point because we're often told make sure you check your disaster kit every once in a while.",
        "Make sure the food hasn't expired and that sort of thing.",
        "But you should also check and make sure your kids haven't aged out of the blocks, right?",
        "I mean, imagine your next disaster is when your kids are 15 and it's crayons in there.",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All that all comes back to just - that's normal, taking care of your kids, I think.",
        "But if you're going to stay at home in a disaster, you've probably got a lot of the things that you need anyway as far as, you know, flashlights and things like that.",

        "And, actually, I should say that the Red Cross differentiates between what you should keep in your house, in case you're staying home, and what you should have for your evacuation.",
        "For instance, you can't carry gallons and gallons of water with you if you're evacuating, but you could store gallons of water in your home.",
        "And the Red Cross recommendation, actually, is one gallon per person, per day, a two weeks' supply for home.",
        "And for food, a three-day supply for evacuation and a two-week supply for home.",
        "And, of course, non-perishable and easy-to-prepare food is the best.",

        "Also, a hand pump water filter - like used in backpacking - amateur radio, multi-purpose soap.",
        "And he says that, you know, he's got the practical stuff that's on everybody's list as well.",
        "In addition to the usual, I include a complete set of spare keys - house, cars, safe, et cetera - spare identification, even at extra cost to the DMV.",
        "Another good idea is proof of home/car ownership.",
        "It's so important to be able to prove where you live, i.e., that you are a resident of an affected neighborhood.",
        "Birth certificate copies are not a bad idea too.",
        "Emily in Farmington Hills, Michigan, says: We have stockpiled food, hygiene, medication, first aid, paper and plastic products, fuels and self-sufficiency supplies.",
        "We would be able to quarantine for months at home or set up a hotel room or campsite quickly and efficiently.",
        "We have also taken first aid and disaster preparedness courses and have a few disaster preparedness supplies in order to be helpful in a community crisis.",

        "We also keep - and it's a tiny bit expensive, but we keep and get rid off when it's too old, Cipro, in case we have bad guys after us.",
        "And also, we keep a card of places to meet if we are actually not at home when something happens and we need to get in touch with each other.",
        "Also - and I just want to say this - I remember when I was a child in San Francisco, during the Alaskan earthquake, it was amazing that half of the city turned out at the ocean beach in order to watch the tsunami that was supposed to be coming in.",
