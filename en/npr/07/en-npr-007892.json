        "That was something expected out of the Truman administration, to prevent another Pearl Harbor, but nobody in the government had that kind of capability at the time.",

        "A key moment before the war had come in January 1950, when Secretary of State Dean Acheson, in a speech, defined what he called the defensive perimeter that the United States was committed to protecting.",

        "Given the fact that Korea was not high on our list of priorities, it wasn't given the kind of attention at the very top level that could have resolved the bureaucratic conflicts that existed.",
