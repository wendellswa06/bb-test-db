        "After enormous controversy erupted, Cosby and his friend Dr. Alvin Poussaint spent much of the next three years in a series of town hall meetings across the country.",
        "And now, they've written a book called \"\"Come on People: On the Path from Victims to Victors.",

        "Parents need to take more responsibility for their kids, their kids need to take more responsibility for their actions, and that the way for African-Americans to get ahead is to study hard and work hard, stay out of debt, eat better, and, as they put it, to back off the rap and reinforce standard English.",

        "And, Bill Cosby, I wanted to ask you, this book is really the product of all these meetings which you describe as callouts.",
        "Describe what happened?",
        "Well - pardon me - we were called by people from different cities who agreed that work needed to be done in the communities, and we agreed - I agreed that I would come in.",
        "However, we had to have certain things on the stage - whether it was a church or a community college or whatever - and there had to be clear examples of people who had had, at points in their lives, hit rock bottom.",
        "They were victims and then they decided that they would begin to pay attention to things around them, that they would begin to clean up whatever it was they were doing that was not good for them, and seek help, and then stay on the path to victory.",
        "And, Dr. Poussaint, let me follow up and ask you.",
        "In the course of all of these meetings, I wonder what it is you've learned?",
        "Well, we've learned that people have choices to make and they can take the high road or they could take the low road.",
        "The low road - they get engaged in a lot of self-destructive behavior and tear up the community -violence, crime, drugs - just kind of destroy their family.",
        "And we found that there were a lot of people at these callouts who did hit rock bottom, but made choices, decided to change their ways, with - had self-revelations about what they could do and what was possible.",
        "And the other important thing was that there were people in the community - foster parents, other relatives - who frequently played a very key role in helping these young people and old people move on another path where they were successful going back to school to get a GED, taking job training programs, getting a job, and that the community coming together was key to people making it.",

        "I talked to University of Chicago sports economist Allen Sanderson.",
        "He said Nike is one of the few shoe company still willing to take a chance on an individual player, and it recognizes that fame can be fleeting.",
        "In some ways this is probably as good as it's going to get for LeBron James and Nike, and they ought to capitalize on that.",
        "You know, why do I say that?",
        "Well, I suspect they will lose in the Finals, and may lose badly.",
        "Now, one thing we have to remember here is that James is only 22.",
        "I think, though, this is a kid with a long future ahead of him."
