        "And if, you know, for people who want to take that bootstrap approach, don't we have a kind of a responsibility to make sure they have somewhere to go when they decided to, you know, work on the education?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Dr. Poussaint.",
        "No. Where do you see that they don't have some place to go?",
        "Well, I'm in San Francisco and I recently heard that down in the Peninsula, where you have parents who can afford to make very substantial contributions to their kids' school - the funding that those schools have in the arts and sciences programs and the athletic programs and so forth are way, way disproportionate to - in the areas around here, where the parents don't have the resources to make those contributions.",
        "I see.",
        "So now - well, that's a clearer question, I think, than the one you were asking.",
        "My apologies.",
        "You said something about where to go.",
        "Go ahead, Alvin.",
        "Well, I think there's a serious problem in schools in urban areas and poor areas that, you know, schools are frequently supported with property tax some more and affluent neighborhoods get better schools, and a lot of the schools in the cities where there is a high dropout rate over 50 percent among black males that the schools are not good schools.",
        "And I think that community and the politicians and the parents have to do all that they can to make those schools better.",
        "But they only can do it if they're activist about it, if they're involved, if they care about education, and even to stay on their kids about getting his much education out of those schools as possible, and become participants in the entire process.",
        "But then, also, work on the policy and political issues that stand in the way of these schools being improved with better teachers, better administration, better facilities.",
        "Is there somewhere that people can contribute to try and close that gap?",
        "This of time of year, I think, probably a lot of people would appreciate it if they knew their contributions will be well spent."
