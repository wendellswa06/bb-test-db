        "This is Weekend Edition from NPR News.",
        "I'm Liane Hansen.",
        "A summit in Washington tomorrow will focus on how to make voting easier this election season for members of the military and other Americans overseas.",
        "First, we want to talk about the military.",
        "Bob Carey is a captain in the Navy Reserves.",
        "He's also a senior fellow at the National Defense Committee which works to protect voting rights for members of the military.",
        "In 2004 Carey got notice that he would be sent to the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain just three weeks before the presidential election.",
        "Carey says he wanted to vote, but at that point it was too late to request and receive an absentee ballot.",
        "Real quick, first, although I am a captain in the Navy Reserves, none of my - none of what I'm saying here today is necessarily the opinion of the Department of Defense or the Department of Navy, although I believe it should be.",
        "What happened to me is that, you know, we all sign on in the reserves to know that we may very well get called up on a moment's notice.",
        "The problem is is that our voting system that the military has devised in order to be able to support military voters doesn't support that type of rapid movement.",
        "And so, I was living in New York City at that time and it wasn't possible for me to be able to get the absentee ballot shipped to me and then get it back before the election, because I was having a number of intermediate duty stations before going overseas, and it just wasn't going to happen.",
        "And then when I got back - when I was coming back a year later, I got extended on my mobilization by about a month and a half, and this was just before the 2005 mayoral election in New York City.",
        "And again, it was too late.",
        "By the time I found out, it was too late for me to be able to receive a postal mail version of the absentee ballot in order to be able to get it back in time.",
        "And it started to get me to think, you know, aren't there electronic versions - alternatives to this that we might be able to look at?",
        "And that's how I became involved in this issue.",
        "So, Americans living in the United States, if they requested an absentee ballot three weeks before an election, they could have voted?",
        "Those are things that we have not known in the past.",
        "Beyond that, we also have a president who's got a more aggressive tenor than other presidents in the past.",
        "I've read about the science.",
        "I've read about the decline of cognitive skills.",
        "But it's the need to go some place, to go home, even when you are home, that I think drove me to write this story.",
        "Go home even when you are home, often a home you don't necessarily recognize as home.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's a recurring motif in these stories, is someone will be home.",
        "They'll be at the home where they've lived for decades, maybe.",
        "And they'll insist that they really want to go home.",
        "And they may pack their bags.",
        "They may stand at the front door.",
        "They may throw a tantrum.",
        "And where is it exactly they want to go?",
        "I'm not so sure.",
        "And do they have answers?",
        "Most of them are found, but are there answers that we understand?"

        "This is, of course, one of the oldest stories that we know about.",
        "The \"\"Odyssey\"\" is a story of wandering.",
        "Right, and \"\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\" And I mentioned Steinbeck in my story because the picaresque tale, the wandering lost soul, the pilgrim, it plays to something deep within us.",
        "And I assume that when things begin to change in our heads and we revert to certain childish ways, or we revert to ways that we haven't acted for years, that maybe we are reverting to something even deeper than we know.",
        "There was a lovely line in your piece about when our lives turn to thin broth.",
        "Well, it is a little like that.",
        "And I've been around people who are near death and people who are in the last days of life.",
        "And, you know, it's just something that - they're there, but they're not there-there.",
        "It's too often the case, there are now - what?",
        "Four million people who are believed to have Alzheimer's disease.",
        "And this is one of those ailments that is just burgeoning with the growing population growth of people who are going to be in their 70s and 80s.",
        "One of the - George Mason University says - you know, well, now, there are, you know, there are 4 or 5 million people with Alzheimer's.",
        "They think it's going to go to 20 million soon, or in the near future."

        "One day, he didn't come back.",
