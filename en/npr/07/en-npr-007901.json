        "No idea.",

        "Incredible.",
        "Well, as somebody pointed out to me, it's important that people get exercise in order to keep the mind nimble and agile.",
        "And so walking is a good thing.",
        "And there is good walking, but then there's also walking that can get dangerous very fast.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "There's also, as Cliff points out, there are behavioral aspects of Alzheimer's where people do get angry for little or no reason whatsoever, and it's very difficult to deal with.",
        "And those frustrations of not being there, not having the command of the faculties that you used to take for granted, which can make anybody incredibly frustrated and incredibly angry.",
        "I have a friend…",
        "(unintelligible) you should know - you guys should know that this is a huge problem and nursing homes cannot deal with this.",
        "And it's become so bad that patients are routinely, every day, are thrown off, thrown out of these nursing homes to hospitals, and the hospitals can't deal with them.",
        "The hospitals are rejecting them.",
        "And so you end up in this no man's land, you know, this in-between place where you're thrown into an emergency room in the middle of the night because your dad has wandered and there's nothing you can do.",
        "So you have to go through this whole system of getting the drugs, being medicated, and then the medication becomes too much.",
        "And that overwhelms the person and there are - it is like hell on earth, I have to tell you.",

        "Well, it's - I wish I could explain it, but it is something that happens at dusk, where patients get restless.",
        "And it brings out other behaviors, too, not just wandering, but it is believed that that time of day - maybe it's because in the past, the time of day, the routine changes a little bit as we get towards supper time.",
        "And that change creates a certain restlessness.",
        "And that is when some people disappear.",

        "Yes.",
