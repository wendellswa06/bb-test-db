        "Mr.",
        "Bush has clearly learned the lesson of how much political harm a premature pardon can do.",
        "Days after coming into office in 1974, President Ford gave a blanket pardon to Richard Nixon, and that may have cost Ford his own election in 1976.",
        "Another president, Bill Clinton, waited until hours before leaving office to pardon the fugitive financier Marc Rich.",
        "So what are the prospects for Lewis Libby facing a likely prison sentence of one and a half to three years on his conviction for perjury and obstruction of justice?",
        "The legal process in a case like this can take a long time, especially when the defendant, free on bail, has every interest in dragging it out.",
        "So first the motion for a new trial.",
        "That will probably be denied.",
        "Then an appeal to a three-member panel of a court of appeals.",
        "That could be stretched out by applying for a hearing on bunc(ph); that is, all 12 members of the court.",
        "And it could conceivably end up in the Supreme Court.",
        "There's a chance that the legal process could take us up to and even past the 2008 election.",
        "Mr. Bush has no direct stake in that election, but a pardon before the vote could well have an impact on the fortunes of other Republicans.",
        "And so when President Bush says I am pretty much going to stay out of it, he could had added until Election Day anyway, with a silent prayer that Libby's legal team is still arguing in the courts by then.",
        "Then Mr. Bush can issue his pardon before the inaugural without facing the worst consequences.",
        "This is Daniel Schorr.",
        "The head covering some Muslim women wear called a hijab often leads to heated debates.",
        "In her new song, \"\"Hijabi,\"\" artist Mona Haydar, who chooses to wear one, talks about some of the misconceptions.",
        "Noor Wazwaz spoke to her for NPR's Code Switch.",
        "Mona Haydar is a Syrian-American artist from Flint, Mich.",

        "(Rapping) I still wrap my hijab, wrap my hijab, wrap my hijab, wrap, wrap my hijab.",
        "Earlier this month, she released her debut song and its music video.",
        "In just a couple of days, it went viral.",

        "Would I describe myself as a feminist?",
        "Yeah, I mean, I would in light of the fact that we live in a patriarchal misogynistic world.",

        "That might be why her video has received more than 1 million views.",
        "But for Haydar, she doesn't really think what she did was that big of a deal.",
        "The idea that a Muslim woman should be in the headlines for doing something, I actually kind of find it leeway offensive because it's so unexpected that a Muslim woman should be doing something remarkable or something cool or exciting.",

        "But we do have a bill out of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.",
        "And they say that coverage is determined to be unaffordable if the premium paid by the individual is greater than 12.5 percent of the individual's adjusted gross income.",

        "Okay, this is the hardest thing in the entire debate, and I'm going to take a shot at trying to explain it.",
        "There are two different things that we're talking about.",
        "There are cost reductions in the short run, and there are cost reductions in the long run.",
        "And then there are costs to the federal government, and there are costs to the system as a whole.",
        "So, you've got - kind of - four moving parts here.",
        "Now, over the short term, if you add 47 million Americans to the rolls of the insured, you're going to add costs to the system, and you're particularly going to add cost to the federal government - about $100 billion a year, says the Congressional Budget Office.",
        "Now, the Congressional Budget Office doesn't look at cost to the system.",
        "They really look at cost to the federal government.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And they say that over 10 years, in order to offset those costs, you're going to have to come up with real, hard savings.",
        "You're going to have to cut other programs or you're going to have to raise taxes.",
        "So those are the short-term costs."
