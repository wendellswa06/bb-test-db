        "The hope is that over the long term, more than 10 years, which is not what the Congressional Budget Office looks at, there will be ways to change the system -to change the incentives, to change how the system is structured, how doctors provide care, how insurers do things - that will perhaps save money both for the federal government and for the system as a whole.",

        "Extension of health coverage by whatever plan to all Americans will reduce unwarranted costs tremendously by eliminating the delays in diagnosis and the lack of preventive care that exists now, and by reducing congestion in emergency rooms.",
        "How a great a cost offset will these savings produce?",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, that is certainly the hope.",
        "You know, a lot of this - a lot lawmakers are very frustrated with the Congressional Budget Office because they are saying that a lot of preventive care really won't have much of a payoff in terms of cost saving.",
        "There's a lot of things that can be done in the health-care system that will certainly make people's lives better and make people's health better, but won't necessarily save money.",
        "It's not a reason not to do it, but it's a bit of a frustration to these lawmakers because it won't necessarily save money.",
        "It's not a reason not to do it, but it's a bit of a frustration to these lawmakers because it won't necessarily show up in the bottom line.",
        "Here's a question from listener Eric Fluger(ph) of Jersey City, who writes: As private carriers tend to try to cherry-pick their customers, is the public option likely to become a dumping ground for supposedly undesirable patients?",
        "If so, what are the cost implications?",
        "This is an easy one.",
        "The answer is no because cherry-picking won't be allowed anymore either in the public option or in the private option.",
        "The deal that the insurers are trying to make is that they say they will no longer be selective in who they insure and don't insure as long as everybody is required to be covered.",

        "Cho is the only teacher here using the pouches.",
