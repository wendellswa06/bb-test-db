        "for duties and tariffs.",
        "That's Joe Hinrichs.",
        "He's president of Ford of the Americas, and he's explaining why Mexico is attractive to Ford.",

        "And since then, Ford has halted a plant that was in the initial stages of being built.",
        "Now, that's a move that Hinrichs and Ford's other leadership insist was not prompted by President-elect Trump.",
        "We're the fifth-largest manufacturer in Mexico, the first in the U.S.",

        "for all the right reasons.",
        "We're committed to the market here.",

        "Small cars right now, particularly passenger cars, are in relatively low demand.",
        "OK, that's in the U.S., not so in Mexico.",

        "The mandate was put together by Congress.",
        "It was originally done in 2005, and then they boosted it to even higher levels at the end of 2007, saying that you have to blend a certain amount of ethanol in your fuel, in your oil, on a regular basis, and it sort of happens little bit by little bit over time.",
        "What this has meant is that people have been willing to build more and more ethanol plants around the country, and there's been a higher demand for corn.",
        "Price of corn has gone up.",
        "People who raise corn have done pretty well.",

        "He's saying it's charging - that because the price of corn has gone up, it's costing more for the livestock industry in his state - chicken growers, cattle growers, hog growers - to feed their animals, and so therefore it's costing much, much more for food industry overall.",
        "Because the demand for feed corn has been increased enormously by the use of it for ethanol.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Well, as this question - it's gone to the EPA to decide, and I gather today was the decision day, July 24th."

        "Well, give us a rough idea of who's on which side here - people who think we should maintain the mandate and keep putting as much ethanol in the gasoline as we possibly can.",
        "Okay, that would be the farmers, because they're growing the corn, and they're getting more money for it.",
        "It's the auto industry, because they're putting out cars that take not just a little bit of ethanol, but also some of them will take as much as 85 percent ethanol in the blend.",
        "So they're getting credit for that under the fuel efficiency program the federal government has in place.",

        "It would be the food industry.",
        "The Grocery Manufacturer's Association has been going crazy because food is costing more and they're blaming that on corn prices, corn prices brought up by ethanol use.",
        "And also, interestingly enough, the environmental community has been against the larger mandate because they say not all ethanol that's produced is environmentally friendly.",
        "It really depends on how you make the electricity that is used to make the ethanol.",
        "It's kind of complicated, but what it is basically is if you have a dirty, coal-fired power plant that's being used to make the ethanol, then it doesn't do any good for the environment.",
        "It sounds like an incredible brawl involving all sorts of hugely powerful Washington lobbies, but does it really - is the final say really with the EPA, or can the Congress overrule whatever the administration does about this?",
        "For the time being it's with the EPA because there is this allowance in the bill to do a waiver.",
        "Just because they might grant the waiver to Texas doesn't mean that they would give it to all the other states.",
        "No one else has asked for it at this point, only Texas.",
        "But it brings this question up, and it's a political hot potato that Congress will take on if not this year, then certainly next."
