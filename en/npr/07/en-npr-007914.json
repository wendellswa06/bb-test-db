        "Now, that then makes us all question why.",

        "So more infections took place than were anticipated compared to placebo.",

        "And this caused a major exercise in navel-scratching, head scratching over the past six months.",
        "It's been very tough to try to work this out, and there's still a lot of ongoing studies that will hopefully point to the reason for this very unexpected result.",
        "And it's important that we find out, because the next planned trial is broadly similar trial conducted by the NIH of a similar but not identical adenovirus vector with an addition of a DNA boost, and there's now major debates going on about whether that should take place, whether and if so, in what format.",
