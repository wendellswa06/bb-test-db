        "Well, you'd have to design the immunogen in different ways, because the two arms of the immune system stimulate it by different types of antigens.",
        "So it's difficult to make one type of vaccine that simultaneously does everything you want, and it may be better to go in and work with two half vaccines, as it were, and combine them, but so far, we're not succeeding in either arm...",

        "And one also stimulates various different cells which will kill by direct contact.",
        "So the antibody that's made is often referred to as the \"\"humeral arm\"\" of the immune system, which actually goes back to the Hippocratic for humerus, believe it or not, and cell-mediated immunity refers to the cells that actually define the infected cells that John mentioned.",
