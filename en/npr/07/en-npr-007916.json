        "Well, again, people who are exposed have been and are sought for research studies.",
        "I mean, there are a number of cohorts in the States which do study those reasons and cohorts abroad.",
        "I don't know of any studies that are going on in your part of the world, but they surely exist because it is important to find out.",
        "There's a website from the NIH, clinicaltrials.gov, and if you go to that website, there's a comprehensive list of clinical trials going on or relatively comprehensive list.",
        "Like John, I'm not aware of the study of what are called highly-exposed but persistently-seronegative individuals in your particular area, but you might be able to find something on that website.",
        "Mm hm.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "So the fact that we have effective treatments for people who are infected with HIV, maybe not cheap enough to be able to afford - the whole world can afford to - politically as economically speaking, is vaccination where the attention is now being most paid to?",
        "Well, there's no question that we need the vaccine if we're going to essentially beat the epidemic.",
        "I mean, the only way to essentially beat it is to prevent new infections taking place.",
        "And the vaccine is the most promising or certainly the most appealing way of doing this.",
        "It's also extraordinarily difficult.",
        "So it's not going to be achieved for (unintelligible), but it's not time to give up and go home.",
        "It's - the benefits are so great that we need to continue to work on this, despite some claims in the press that it's time to give up on the vaccines.",
        "It's certainly not, in my opinion.",
        "I couldn't agree with John more.",
        "I mean I think we need to have both a long-term and a short-term strategy, and this is the worse epidemic that hit mankind, a possible exception of the plague.",
        "Twenty-five million people have died already, and the reality of it, despite the utility of the drugs, as John said, the only way to end the epidemic just tentatively would be a vaccine, but it's likely a long way off.",
        "So it would seem to me that we need to have a long-term strategy to, as John mentioned earlier, return to basics.",
        "As my mentor, Ralph Steinman, likes to say, learn the rules of immunity.",
        "Learn how we make a good immune response both from T-cells and antibody, and then apply those rules to make a vaccine.",
        "But while we're doing that in our laboratories and in our small clinical trials units, there's an epidemic ranging, and we have to address that epidemic with the tools we have.",
        "And let's talk about some of those tools.",
        "One of the more interesting, promising prevention strategies turned out to be male circumcision.",
        "Is that an effective tool?",
        "Yes, it is an effective tool and it's a rather - again, the reason we do clinical trials and we do experiments is because we don't know the answer.",
        "But yes, there have been now, I believe, three clinical trials in Africa that have demonstrated clearly that male circumcision is protective, but only partially-protective.",
        "And this is part of the great challenge with which we're grappling, that male circumcision reduces the rate of infection of men, depending on the trial, about 60 percent.",
        "So it's not a 90 or 100 percent one we would hope for.",
        "But in Botswana or Swaziland, where, you know, a huge number of people are infected in the nine Sub-Saharan African countries with the highest rates of infection, 12 percent of the adult population are infected.",
        "And in the most affected countries, it's even higher, like closer to 30 or 40.",
        "So if we're looking at reducing that by 60 percent, you're saving, you know, tens or hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives.",
        "But it's not completely effective.",
        "So you have to use that and combine it still with education, with voluntary counseling and testing, with condom use, and those are very hard things to do.",
        "A vaccine, in its ideal form, you give once and you go home, and the person's protected for life.",
        "You know and that's sort of the Holy Grail to which we all aspire.",
        "But as John said, it's a long way off."

        "But although you say that the Rwandan Hutu militiamen are not a threat to the Tutsi population, I'm not sure that I can agree with that either.",
        "So how you rule out - you know, imagine asking adult men to be circumcised in resource-poor areas where, you know, even dental work isn't done.",
        "And that's a huge logistical, medical, social, political issue and then those men are only partially protected.",
        "So one has to be very careful with the communications and the education message so people understand that, and that they still need to use condoms.",
        "And one of the other most effective tools is to reduce the number of partners.",
        "So in epidemiologic and social prevention studies conducted by people who do work very unlike with John or I do, it's been shown that that's also one of the most effective tools.",
        "So to educate people in that regard is, you know, tremendously sensitive, very difficult, but you know, yet tremendously important in what we have to offer today.",
        "John, you want to chime in?",
        "Yes, and it's important not to forget that it's not uniquely an African or Asian epidemic...",
        "No.",
        "Far, far from it.",
        "Exactly.",
        "In the States, the areas of the community that most would benefit from increased education and increased uptake of antiretroviral drugs are the African-American communities, and there the rates of taking up drugs or the rates of preventing mother-to-child transmission and so forth are much lower than in the rest of America.",
        "And that's one of the issues here that we need to address.",
        "It's a distrust of establishment medicine that goes back to many years of distrust of physicians by the African-American community.",
        "And one of the reasons, in the HIV/AIDS, area is what Pastor Wright raised when embarrassed Barack Obama recently, the notion that, you know, HIV is a creation of the U.S.",
        "government to kill black people, and that, unfortunately, has become a more and more pervasive view, because of the views of Pastor Wright and so on."

        "What we call the hidden factor of HIV infection where there are no symptoms or very little symptoms for young people, who are new to sexual maturity, who are in great numbers, who could go for years without being aware that they are infected.",
        "We need to drive the testing forward and drive the testing procedures forward, so there's privacy maintained, so we can overcome this disease while research can find a way to create a vaccine.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "What you say is very important, and you remind me, early in the epidemic, the Holy Grail was a test.",
        "That was the first great accomplishment, before we even dreamed of therapy or vaccine, was a simple diagnostic test.",
        "And to this day, you know, testing is a tremendously important part of any prevention strategy, and there has been, you know, quite a number of leaps forward in terms of testing.",
        "There is now the OraQuick test, which doesn't require blood.",
        "It can be done from sort of a scraping inside the mouth.",
        "And I believe there's a campaign by the CDC to increase the amount of testing and destigmatize you know getting tested as well, of course, as being diagnosed as positive.",
        "But you know, those are hard things to do and I...",
        "No amount of available tests will encourage somebody who doesn't want to be tested.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And you know, again, you get into the realm of behavior and values, and these are very sensitive areas.",
        "I mean, one of the great challenges of this virus is that it's associated with behaviors that in some ways are stigmatized.",
        "And it's made it more difficult to treat and to prevent for the very reason that you mention.",
        "John, any last words?",
        "No, Sarah is right.",
        "I mean, testing is another success story.",
        "The tests are 99.8-percent accurate, and anyone who feels that they are at risk of HIV infection should be tested and learn whether or not they need to modify their behavior or go on to antiretroviral therapy.",
        "And it's best done in physicians' offices but there are tests that can be purchased from (unintelligible) and other quick tests but still best done in the care of a licensed physician."
