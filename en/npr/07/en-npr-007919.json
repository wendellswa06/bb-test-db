        "But it was the best thing that ever happened to me.",
        "I have been able to bring both sides of my life together to be much less reserved, more flexible and outgoing.",

        "Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett won Tuesday's Democratic primary, and so Governor Walker will be fighting to keep his job against the same opponent he beat in 2010.",
        "NPR's David Schaper reports.",
        "Wisconsin has had 15 months of political warfare in the wake of Republican Governor Scott Walker's law stripping public employees of most of their collective bargaining rights.",
        "For the first time Tuesday, the sharply divided Wisconsin electorate got to let Walker know how they feel.",
        "And even laryngitis couldn't stop Cindy Lancelle of the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay.",
        "I'm so happy to vote for Walker, and it's just a shame that our state has spent so much money on this incredible, ridiculous recall.",
        "It's such a waste of money.",

        "Well, in my opinion, I think he's been worse than divisive.",
        "They're getting more and more involved, dragged into this conflict, because they have said that their mandate is to support the duly elected government of Congo in Kinshasa, the capital.",
        "And, of course, that means the government's army, so they are helping with logistics, they're helping with helicopters, and they helped to transport reinforcements - troop reinforcements to Eastern Congo.",
        "And it seized the very soldiers who are fighting against the dissident force of Laurent Nkunda.",
        "But Nkunda has accused the United Nations of being a party to the conflict and has warned it that it must stop aiding the government.",
        "The United Nations turns around and says, that is our mandate; you must disarm; we will continue to support the government.",
        "But they're not taking an active role in combat?",
        "Well, in the past week or so, they almost have.",
        "They're - at least they're up in their helicopters overlooking where the government forces were fighting Nkunda forces.",
        "And now, because the army, which had actually made military gains in the past 10 days or so until we're told the soldiers started celebrating and drinking and losing the strategic towns, villages and hillsides that they had taken from the rebels, it seems that it's now down to U.N.",
        "peacekeepers to protect civilians and to actually protect some towns and villages.",
        "So the peacekeepers are getting drawn into this conflict, and that always means trouble.",
        "And you mentioned the drinking by some of the government troops, but drinking is hardly the only concern of forces on both sides here.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And let me just say here, as you said, in your introduction that there is fighting between these two rival camps, but it's the civilians who are being caught in the crossfires again and again and again.",
        "When I was in Congo - and that was just as this latest outbreak of fighting began, you saw women, children, toddlers, old men, old women running whenever there was gunfire, running when every - looked as if the conflict would break out again.",
        "And, you know, fleeing these positions where they were caught with bundles on their head going to huge displaced people's camps where water is a problem, where health is a problem, where sanitation is a problem, where tens of thousands of people are hoping for refuge, but where there are even problems in the camps when armed groups from all sides come and try and recruit young men and women to make them fight their battle, so it's an appalling situation.",
        "It's a pitiful situation especially for the ordinary man and woman in North Kivu.",
        "You've mentioned the Tutsis and Hutu groups from Rwanda.",
        "Is this - how much of this is a spillover from the Tutsi-Hutu conflict in Rwanda where everybody remembers the genocide there in the '90s?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's a continuing problem that started before the genocide and that continues long after, because you have the Rwandan government - Tutsi-dominated - which managed to drive out these Hutu militia men who cross the border into then Zaire of the late Mobuto Sese Seko's era as dictator and who have stayed.",
        "So now, they have made roots.",
        "I mean, they are imparted there, they've got families, they've married into Congolese life, and, as I say, they are a proxy militia fighting with the Congolese army.",
        "So this has become a huge problem that even the United States has now got involved in.",
        "It sent a special envoy, Tim Shortly, to the area to try and talk both with the government and with the Rwandans and with Laurent Nkunda."

        "I think it would be - it's an unsophisticated understanding of, one, societal relationships to continue to use those categories, especially when you have a current administration in Rwanda that is trying to develop of what is a highly problematic, ethnicized society influenced by eugenics of what later took an extreme form in Nazi Europe and saying, okay, let us build a society, a national of - a national citizenship and not on ethnic bias.",
        "So to draw the comparison between General Laurent Nkunda, who self-declared himself as a Tutsi leader, in contrast to President Kagame, who has not declared himself as such, but rather as a leader of Rwanda and sees all odds up on Rwanda, I think it's highly problematic, and furthers the international community's misunderstanding of ethnic issues in the Great Lakes region.",

        "And the fact is that he is worried about the conflict right at his border, which is, really, the gates of Goma where I was, leads directly into Rwanda, so you cannot not talk about ethnic groups because the problem seen in the eyes of Laurent Nkunda and the government in Rwanda is the Hutu Interahamwe, former genocide-linked fighters, who are just right across the border.",

        "So we can say, yes, President Paul Kagame is the president of Rwanda and you cannot, and as you say, you cannot speak with - of him and not recognize his ethnicity.",
        "But in saying that, we misunderstand the fundamental problem of Rwanda, Burundi, and that part of the Congo's history the way in which ethnicity was is, in a sense, a false category.",
