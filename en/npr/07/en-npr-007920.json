        "Well, I think it's important because it shows a problem that exists in many other places in the world today.",
        "But in a way, it's at its most extreme form in Congo today.",
        "Indeed, the four million people who've died there in the last 10 years - the greatest number of war-related deaths anywhere in the world since the end of World War II.",
        "And I think the problem that it shows is that the international community, as a whole, has not come up with a way of dealing with the situation where you have the combination of things that they have now in Congo, which is, incidentally, very similar to what was there hundred years ago - vast natural wealth and a lot of greedy outsiders who want it, no rule of law, no real functioning central government, and a lot of weaponry floating around.",
        "Those three things together are a recipe for enormous trouble.",
        "And what we're seeing now is a new face of that trouble, but it's basically been those three things that have been causing these deaths over the last eight or nine years now.",
        "I wanted to ask you - and I wanted to ask Ofeibea Quist-Arcton as well to join in this point - and that is this all seemed to have been resolved by the Lusaka Peace Agreement four years ago.",
        "What happened or what didn't happen?",
        "Well, my answer would be that, yes, there was a peace agreement, the various parties to the war, the different factions in it, who were basically Congolese warlords who are struggling to get a piece of that huge natural wealth - gold, uranium, coltan, this mineral that's used in computer chips and cell phones, timber, much, much more - they did sign an agreement.",
        "They did form a coalition government, but that coalition government really does not govern effectively vast areas of the country especially in the northeast where Ofeibea has just come from, where so much of the natural wealth is concentrated.",
        "And when you have that much wealth there for the taking, no government controlling the area, then you see these warlords who are trying to get a share of the loot for themselves, one thing, I think, the peace treaty did accomplish was that the armies of the various surrounding states who had been actually fighting in the Congo in the earlier phase of the war tended, for the most part, to withdraw over their own boundaries, but they still have alliances with the different warlords.",
        "And the United Nations force that's there, even though it is the largest such force in the world, is not large enough to really have an effect on this nor is it charged with the mission of governing the territory, which would be, indeed, very, very hard to do.",
        "Ofeibea?",
        "And exactly what Adam says.",
        "This is country that is hugely difficult to govern.",
        "I mean, Kinshasha is as far away from Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu in the east as, you know, Nairobi or Kampala in the neighboring countries.",
        "So for central government and for President Kabila, although eastern Congo was, in fact, his biggest and most popular constituency -during the elections last year, for him to think that he can control the whole country is almost a joke.",
        "But the fact of pillaging and plundering Congo's wealth is not just something that's put at the door of Rwanda.",
        "Uganda, Zimbabwe, neighboring countries, faraway countries, including the United States, everybody is set to want to be in Congo for that reason.",
        "Thanks very much for the call and Kamba, we are terribly sorry you lost your son and other members of your family.",
        "Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party darling - are you surprised?"

        "And, as Adam said, it's not only outsiders who are after Congo's wealth.",
        "It's insiders as well.",
        "So you have a government that was formed of former warlords, including President Kabila himself, and others.",
        "And trying now to put on civilian clothes and behave like elected civilian leaders, yes, they're trying to do it, but when there are whole sways of the country that you don't have full control over, you have these marauding militia groups from across the border, from inside the country, and everybody ultimately wanting to get rich quickly and the civilians suffering.",
        "I mean, Congo is a huge country, difficult to govern at the best of times, but with all that wealth, people call it a geological scandal, everybody is going to be trying to get a piece of the pie.",
        "If Congo was poor and huge, this wouldn't be happening.",

        "And I think one thing - an important issue in here that has just been skirted on is continuing marauding(ph) involvement in backing the - this General Nkunda and the Tutsi force in eastern Congo.",
        "He was once a soldier in the Rwandan armed Forces.",
        "And, certainly, we saw lots of evidence in the time that I was there.",
        "Even after the official Rwandan pullout from eastern Congo, continuing involvement with militias in eastern Congo, and continuing aspiration to control resources and control the territory.",
        "And even at one point, some movement (unintelligible) giving eastern Congo to split off from the rest of Congo and be a separate state that Rwanda could control.",
        "So that aspect hasn't been touched on so much, but I'm sure this General Nkunda could not continue to fight on without substantial support from Rwanda.",
        "Ofeibea, is that an accurate description?",
        "Oh, I think so, absolutely.",
        "And one of the reasons why the Congolese army decided to go on a major offensive was to try and cut off the supply lines between Rwanda and General Nkunda's forces.",
        "Although Rwanda has publicly denied that it supports him, I don't think anyone is in any doubt at all.",
        "Thanks very much for that point, Allan.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And I wanted to ask Adam Hochschild to what degree is what we've seen -I guess in the years since the overthrow of Mobutu - to what degree is this an echo of colonialism?",
        "You know, I think there are a lot of echoes to it because if we roll the clock back about a hundred and twenty years and look at the vast carnage that took place in this huge area at that time, it had a lot of the same ingredients - vast natural wealth, outsiders who wanted it, no functioning central government, and lots of arms.",
        "At that point, they hadn't discovered the gold, the uranium, the other minerals people are after today, and the natural wealth from the Congo that Europeans wanted was ivory and rubber.",
        "The territory was taken over by King Leopold II of Belgium.",
        "It was his private, personally owned colony for 23 years before it became a Belgium colony.",
        "And first, he veraciously went after ivory, and if anyone has read Joseph Conrad's \"\"Heart of Darkness,\"\" you know the picture of the quest for ivory that so dominates that book."

        "Then they discovered that the Congo was enormously rich in wild rubber, and gathering wild rubber is difficult to do because it's scattered throughout the rainforest.",
        "Leopold created a private army - 19,000 officers and men, black conscript soldiers under white officers.",
        "They sent them into village after village, held the women of the village hostage in order to make the men of the village go out into the rainforest for days and eventually weeks out of each month and gather wild rubber.",
        "A lot of the women hostages starved.",
        "A lot of these men, forced laborers were, in effect, worked to death.",
        "A hundreds of thousands of people fled just as they're fleeing today, in those days to avoid being made into part of this forced labor economy, and then when a population is greatly weakened by famine, by flight as refugees, disease takes a terrible toll among people who, Otherwise, would have survived.",
        "And that, too, is something that is happening today.",

        "It's not something that's set up for the welfare of its citizens.",

        "We had over 13 rebellions.",
        "And most of them has - the army it summed in 20 army, you know?",
        "We've lost four million people in Congo since this thing started.",

        "Why is Nkunda fighting?",
        "Nkunda is fighting for only one reason.",
        "It's not - because the one that army will occupy The Congo for seven years, they were unable to disarm the Hutus, but all the while, Nkunda(ph) was stealing our resources, stealing the minerals, and that's why they came to Congo for, and they used the Hutus as pretext to cut and steal our minerals.",
        "And Nkunda is there not to disarm because Nkunda knows there's never been any evidence of those Hutu militias attacking the Tutsis inside Congo intent of killing them.",
        "What Nkunda is doing is stealing Congolese minerals, give them to Rwanda and sell them to the West; that's all that is happening.",
        "Why have the West not be able to ask the Gwandan government to try to include the Hutus or try to democratize or include the Hutus without - because the Hutus make up over 80 percent of the Rwandan population?",
        "Let's see if we can get an answer to your question, Kamba.",
        "Ofeibea?",
        "Well, that's very much the opinion of the people in Goma where I stayed around that area.",
        "There was a real hatred and hostility of the Tutsi community because they do feel that Nkunda is in this business, more to make money than to protect his Tutsi community."

        "And they're saying that because of the breakdown in law and order and the fact that impunity reigns in this part of Congo, that even civilian men have, more and more, decided that they're free to rape, to pillage, and to sexually abuse women and children, so the conflict in eastern Congo has got to be resolved soon.",
        "Otherwise, the fact of the breakdown of law means that the whole society risks being broken down, not just civilians in displaced people's camps, but not even safe once they seek refuge.",
        "So these are the sorts of issues that the government is going to have to deal with, along with the military issues.",
        "And everybody says there's military solution to the conflicts in eastern Congo.",
        "It has to be resolved around the table and that everybody involved in the conflict - those from outside, those from within must sit at the table and must put the people first.",
        "And let me ask you, Adam Hochschild, well, not too many years ago, a lot of this went on and four million people died and the world did not seem to notice much.",
        "Do you think that's going to change now?",
        "You know, I wish I could say it was going to change, but I'm not too optimistic.",
        "And the source of my pessimism has to do with how much wealth is there for the taking.",

        "I'd love to see that U.N.",
        "force be larger and with a stronger mandate to especially to protect the civilian population and especially, as Ofeibea said, to protect some of these women who are being raped in enormous, appalling numbers.",
        "I also think there's some other things that could be done.",
        "These conflicts are fueled, in part, by the fact that outside powers, including the United States, have been quite profligate in sending arms to Africa over the last decade or so, pouring them into the surrounding countries without really many conditions on how they are to be used."
