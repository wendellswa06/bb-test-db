        "Are there any areas where Chinese takeovers could be a problem?",
        "You could certainly imagine that in high-tech fields where intellectual property is the crucial element of a corporation, not the pigs themselves in the way that define bacon and pork and all the rest is processed, that there could be reasons for more careful concern.",
        "And there's - a range of Chinese companies with very close ties to the government or the military, for example, the electronics firms, Huawei, have come in for close inspection.",

        "One would be finding out what's going on in North Korea and see if the Chinese can do anything about that.",
        "Another is trying to calm the very troubled seas, literally seas between China and Japan.",
