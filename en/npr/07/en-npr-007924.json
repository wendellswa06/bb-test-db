        "The Cowboys' season ended in excruciating fashion two weeks ago, when they muffed the snap on a chip shot field goal that would have won them the game.",

        "Did this decision come as a surprise?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, the people who know Bill Parcells didn't just call it a surprise.",
        "They called it a shock.",
        "And at this point, you know, there's just a lot of speculation about why this happened.",
        "As you said, he went right back to work.",
        "We don't know what he was doing at work, if he was just miserable as always or plotting his fifth season with the Cowboys.",
        "But today the surprise announcement came.",
        "And, you know, like most NFL head coaches, Bill Parcells is extremely guarded in what he says publicly.",
        "So there was no cheerful press conference where he said Terrell Owens drove me out of the game or that playoff loss you mentioned ripped my heart out or Jerry Jones - the Cowboys' owner - won't give me more money.",
        "He just issued a statement saying Dallas is a great city.",
        "And I'm hopeful that the Cowboys are able to go forward from here.",
        "He said I'm in good health, and I feel lucky to have been able to coach in the NFL.",
        "And you mentioned Terrell Owens, one of the better players in the football league.",
        "Also one of the more distracting players in football.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, that - Bill Parcells, I believe, began the job with white hair.",
        "But had he not, his hair would have turned white just with one year under Terrell Owens, known as T.O.",
        "- you know, the shenanigans that he goes through.",
        "He's always seeking the limelight, and usually always gets it.",
        "And it's enough - you know, Bill Parcells is a great coach.",
        "And he hates it when one player is featured like that.",
        "But everyone, you know, loves the soap opera sagas with Terrell Owens and the ranting and raving on the side lines.",
        "And one year of that, who knows if that was enough to drive him out?",
        "As you mentioned, no question Bill Parcells is a great coach.",
        "But he had a mediocre record win four years with the Cowboys, and did not win so much as a single playoff game."

        "No coach in history in the league has shown such a knack for taking reclamation projects and turning them into winners.",
        "So he comes to the Cowboys.",
        "They had had three straight seasons of five wins and 11 losses.",

        "And in Dallas, that doesn't wash.",
        "A record of 34 wins and 32 losses, including the two playoff losses, that's not what the expectations were in Dallas.",
        "Any - I guess nobody's going to know until they get a chance to actually talk to Bill Parcells.",
        "But he's retired before.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's something we should definitely say.",
        "Most recently, when he left the New York Jets in 1999, he said something along the lines of I have coached my last game in football.",

        "and its allies for inflicting maximum harm on the Iranian economy.",
        "This was the entirely predictable outcome of the Trump administration's maximum pressure strategy.",
        "And the attacks clearly demonstrate that the strategy of bombing and blockading the Yemenis and starving the Iranians into submission is more likely to backfire than to bring the intended policy results.",
        "And so what advice would you give to each side here?"

        "So the solution is not to further escalate tensions but to capitalize on the initiative that President Macron of France has put on the table to de-escalate tensions between Tehran and Washington.",
