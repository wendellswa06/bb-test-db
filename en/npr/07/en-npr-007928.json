        "There are many instances when I travel to Cuba that I do not go visit my family.",
        "And I do that purposefully because they don't understand this idea that perhaps, you know, Elizabeth wants to engage with Cuba and with Cubans on a very different level outside of that exile Cuba narrative.",
        "I think we've had 50 years of that and that conversation needs to change.",
        "And there was one other voice in the room - a Cuban-American artist, Leyden Rodriguez-Casanova.",

        "He plans to show his own work at an exhibition of Cuban-American artists in Havana soon.",

        "Leyden told us how his parents escaped Cuba with him as a boy on the Mariel Boat Lift in 1980.",
        "For my parents, difficulties were just day-to-day - the ability to find food, just a constant daily exchange and trade and bartering system of how to find milk.",
        "And from my side of the family, they're still going back there on a regular basis, taking a lot of basic supplies to family members.",
        "It seems to be very much a class divide there, as it is here in terms of poverty versus affluence.",
        "The stories that my family's bringing back are working class people that are having a really tough time there.",
        "And it's interesting how, you know, at least the ideology of the revolution was sort to do away with that.",
        "Candelario, can I just ask you one question about what Leyden just said?",
        "His parents, 34 years ago, struggled to find milk.",
        "Is that the reality for some families in Cuba still today?",
        "No.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "This is funny because I have a few friends that had told me the same thing.",
        "And I promised them you can find everything that you want.",
        "It's true that sometimes when you want to buy any special thing, for sure it's difficult to find it.",
        "But the rest - milk or meat or whatever is there every day.",
        "If you have the money to buy it.",

        "I'm just talking about possibility.",
        "Right, but I don't think you can divorce the question from the broader, socio-political environment which is that most people who make $20 a month cannot go and buy milk.",
        "Yes, it's in the market.",
        "But if that bottle of milk is $5, that's one-fifth of your salary.",
        "I agree.",

        "Yeah, could be.",
        "Not just from Germany - the United States but from abroad, yes.",
        "Artists will often tell you that you can see different things in the same image, and maybe the same can be said for Cuba.",
        "These three seem to interpret what's happening on the island differently, but they acknowledge the same reality.",
        "While there's been progress, the portrait of Cuba remains largely unchanged.",
        "People are struggling to find their place in a society where there's quality public education and healthcare but where the price of a bottle of milk can trigger a debate about the future.",
        "In Cuba, people adapt to the situation they have and they try to survive, I mean, in a way using a lot of jokes.",
        "That's why the reason I always said that Cuba is the best place to be a child and then to be an old man.",
        "But in the middle you have to move.",
        "That's the voice of Cuban artist Candelario.",
        "We also heard from a Cuban-American artist Leyden Rodriguez-Casanova and Miami art curator Elizabeth Cerejido."
