        "It actually came several appearances after that.",
        "So we can't really say, you know, that he has addressed those issues just - or they should listen to that speech, because that comes after.",
        "In addition to that, I think what's interesting about Barack Obama and his platform, he is advocating stuff for gays, he's advocating stuff for Jews, but the question that these young men are asking, and what the black community has been asking for some time on talk radio, is, you know, it's great that we're going to have this upstanding guy who loves his wife, who loves his kids, but what about us?",
        "What about our issues?",

        "I don't want to dwell on it, but let me just say from a historical standpoint, Tom Bradley ran for the governor of California back in the '80s, and it was a tight race, very similar to this.",
        "What happened to him was, there was an assumption that the black community would come out in force to support him, which it did not do, in part because there was a sense that he had pandered to the other side, so to speak, to a larger extent than was necessary, and it cost him the election.",
        "So there is a danger, is there not, for Barack Obama, a very fine line that he has to walk?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Absolutely, I think there is a danger.",
        "I think that what he has to do, though, is he has to pander just like he's pandered to the gay vote - he has to pander just like he's pandered to the Jewish vote - and he's got to pander for the black vote.",
        "And what he's got to do is he's got to address and speak to the issues that black people in this country are concerned about.",

        "I disagree.",

        "Last week in rural Mississippi, Senator Obama told a crowd that the GOP would try to scare voters by questioning his, quote, \"\"funny name,\"\" and by pointing out that he doesn't, quote, \"\"look like those other presidents on those dollar bills.\"\" The McCain campaign lashed out very quickly, saying, quote, \"\"Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck.\"\" And just today, former President Bill Clinton made a similar claim that - he repeated a claim, actually, that he made back in April, after he faced criticism for remarks about Senator Obama's South Carolina primary win.",

        "It's rearing its ugly head again.",
        "One of the things - you were talking about the election out in California - one of the things we saw is that we saw that white people did not support - where they said in public they were going to support Bradley, and they didn't support him.",
        "So, this is nothing new.",
        "This is just the same old politics as we've always seen in America.",
        "That's one of the reasons why Tavis Smiley says he doesn't think that Barack Obama is electable.",
        "I'm not sure whether I agree with that, just because he's black.",
        "I think we've come a long way, but have we come far enough?",
        "That's the question.",
        "Is his - it's no doubt historic for him to be the presumptive nominee at this point, but the question is whether he can get elected.",
        "So, I think that Bill Clinton's comments are interesting.",
        "Bill Clinton even said, I believe, in that interview that he would have said more if he were allowed to.",
        "He regrets that he didn't.",
        "But you know, it's just one of those things that - yeah, it's a third rail.",
        "That's the reason why Barack Obama likes to talk about being black, but he doesn't like to talk about issues that affect black people, from what I've observed so far.",
        "Is this going to derail him?",
        "Could this derail him, Anthony?",
        "So yeah - and I mean, I believe the hype was overhyped, but it's better to be overprepared than underprepared, like Katrina.",
        "You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore.",
        "It probably won't derail him.",
        "I mean, whoever decides to play the race card will be burned by it.",
        "I think a lot of American voters are very skittish and tired of the kinds of racial rhetoric that maligned campaigns like this.",
        "It was a nasty campaign between Clinton and Obama in the primary, and I think what could happen is this could actually derail us from speaking about the kinds of issues that we need to be talking about.",
        "And as the campaign turns more nasty, more personal, we're going to get distracted by the kinds of issues that we need to address, and we'll still be in the kinds of messes that we find ourselves in today."
