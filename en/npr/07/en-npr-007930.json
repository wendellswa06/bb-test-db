        "Interesting point that you are making.",
        "And to follow up with that, last Friday, an article in the Wall Street Journal raised the provocative question that Obama's slender physique may hurt him with an overweight electorate.",
        "Headline of that story was \"\"Too Fit to be President,\"\" article saying 66 percent of the voting-age population is overweight, 32 percent obese.",
        "Do you think - I'm going to follow with you, Anthony, and come back to you, Rob - do you think that it's easier for Americans to connect with a, quote/unquote, \"\"fleshier\"\" candidate?",
        "Well, I think that the important distinction here is that Obama appears to be an elitist.",
        "And really, I mean, if he goes to Iowa and talks about Whole Foods, it's important for Americans to look at their president and ask the question, is this a regular guy like me?",
        "Does he eat hot dogs on the 4th of July?",
        "Does he order pizza when he doesn't feel like cooking?",
        "Does he eat Krispy Kreme doughnuts?",
        "Is he a regular guy like myself?",
        "And the fact that, you know, that the Democrats aren't going to have any sort of Southern fried food at the convention, the fact that he's sort of the green candidate, for example, is raising some questions with a lot of people regarding whether or not Obama can connect to the average American person - which, by the way, is the person that supported Hillary Clinton.",
        "This is the voter who's in the Midwest, in these key states.",
        "So Rob, it's not just about race, then, is it?",
        "It's about all these other things also.",
        "Here's one of those issues that don't really matter.",
        "And I think that that's - it's interesting not to lose perspective, and I think we are with this one.",
        "I saw the Wall Street Journal piece, which was horribly written.",
        "There was a blog item that was cited, and then there was someone who said that they had professed to be a Hillary Clinton supporter from before.",
        "There were two people quoted in that story.",
        "We had it on our Web site.",
        "One of the things that I think that's interesting about that is, one, I think people will actually be more attracted to him because he doesn't look like them.",
        "He's kind of like the ideal person.",
        "He looks the part.",
        "He looks thin.",
        "He looks like he works out.",
        "The guy's a phenomenal basketball player.",
        "I think he couldn't be more American and more like what people aspire to be.",
        "That's the reason why they connect with Barack Obama.",
        "And I think what's the danger of the Wall Street Journal article - blows us off the point that he is making a connection with normal people and their children.",
        "Well, believe or not, we have one topic that actually has nothing to do with Barack Obama, and we're going to talk about that in about the two minutes that we have left.",
        "It's this.",
        "Friday - on Friday, the judge hearing the case for five of the remaining Jena Six defendants was removed from the case.",
        "He had called the defendants troublemakers and a violent bunch.",
        "A state district judge said Judge J.P.",
        "Mauffray Jr. could not be impartial in the case.",
        "When you heard about this, Anthony, what was your reaction?",
        "My first reaction was actually one of celebration.",
        "I was glad they removed him because a judge's job is to ensure that the facts in the case match the charges, and a biased judge will allow bad evidence.",
        "They won't sustain good objections on cross examination.",
        "They won't allow the defense to represent their clients well to the jury.",
        "And the judge controls the information in the room that the jury's going to use to deliberate.",
        "And if a judge has a biased disposition toward the defendants, he needs to be removed because he won't be able to adjudicate the case in a fair manner.",
        "Anthony, I have - Rob, I'm sorry.",
        "I have about 30 seconds left for you to answer this.",
        "And the question is, do you think now that this will make the playing field level enough to satisfy the people who are following this case?",
        "Well, I hope so.",
        "You know, we talked about, a minute ago, issues that were not important for this election.",
        "I think, you know, race is a 400-year-old issue in this country, and that's the reason why this story is important.",
        "I think that this is an important move, and the district attorney who is fighting for the judge's reinstatement should be fired."
