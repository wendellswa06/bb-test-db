        "Yeah.",
        "There are close to 175 measures on the ballot this year.",
        "What makes ballot measures interesting is that voters get to weigh in on just about every topic that candidates have been debating for months now.",
        "OK.",
        "Some of these are rather in the weeds, as amendments go.",
        "Some of them touch on hot-button issues, including a number that involve gay marriage.",
        "What's being decided?",
        "There are four states voting on gay marriage.",
        "They are Maine, Maryland, Washington and Minnesota.",
        "And three of those - Maine, Maryland and Washington - the vote actually would allow gay marriage if it passes, whereas Minnesota's voting on a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage.",
        "Maine is a particularly interesting state because voters there in 2009 repealed gay marriage.",
        "The legislature had put it into law and voters overturned it at the ballot.",
        "And so there's been a lot of discussion of whether public sentiment on gay marriage has changed.",
        "And Maine is a place where you sort of have this comparison from just three years ago, where you'll really be able to see whether voters have changed their mind.",
        "OK.",
        "What about other issues?",
        "I know medical marijuana gets put on a lot of these ballot issues.",
        "What about 2012?",
        "2012 is a little bit different.",
        "Medial marijuana had a lot of success at the polls over the years, and now three states - Colorado, Oregon and Washington - are sort of talking about going a step further.",
        "They have measures that would legalize recreational marijuana use or general marijuana possession.",
        "And there's...",
        "And just decriminalize marijuana altogether?",
        "Is that what these measures would do?",
        "Well, I think the fact that we're talking about it today suggests that there's, you know, still some mixed feelings about it.",
        "But the reason that we've done this is that, going back about 20 years or so, Mount Vernon did a self-study in a variety of topics and basically asked our visitors, you know, what they would like to know more about.",
        "And they told us a lot of things.",
        "One of them was that they were interested in learning more about slave life at Mount Vernon.",
        "So this comes from actual research on people who came.",
        "Maybe tell me a little bit about the people who you see as your audience or people you reached out to to come to a place like Mount Vernon.",
        "Well, Mount Vernon is the single most-visited historic site in the country.",
        "We get more than a million visitors a year.",
        "And so that's - you know, we've got one of the broadest audiences that you can possibly have.",

        "What else do you have going on in terms of outreach, lectures or docent programs, anything like that?",
        "Well, I mentioned that, you know, it was 20 years ago that Mount Vernon just really realized that we needed to talk more about this topic and since then, the cabin is really kind of the last thing among a variety of programs that we have developed.",
        "Back in 1962, actually, Mount Vernon was one of the first sites to set up a slave quarter here up near the mansion, where we interpret the daily lives of the house servants who lived in that area.",
        "And so this cabin is kind of a logical culmination of having that building because it tells the story of the daily lives of the field hands.",
        "We have tours.",

        "You're not, however, doing reenactments with people dressed as slaves.",
        "I bring that up because some places have, and it's been incredibly divisive in some cases.",
        "Some people say, oh, this is great.",
        "This is what's needed to bring things out into a really dramatic context.",

        "Other people say, well, this is soft peddling.",
        "It wasn't even this easy for people who were enslaved.",
        "How do you address the issue of whether or not there should be any kind of reenactment-style approach to this?",
        "Well, you're absolutely right.",
        "That's the kind of thing that really brings out, you know, a lot of emotions, rightfully so I'm asking, you know, one of our African-American interpreters to take on the role of an enslaved worker, you know, that's something that a lot of them, I think, respond to, you know, with a lot of ambivalence.",
        "And so - and certainly, on the part of visitors, I think you're absolutely right.",
        "There are some folks who feel that that's really the logical culmination of this and that if you don't do that, you are kind of, you know, pulling back from the hard reality.",
        "But it's a difficult thing and I'm - we're not saying that we're never going to do that.",
        "And we certainly do have several black interpreters on our staff who are willing to talk about slavery.",
        "What we've not done so far and I don't know if we will in the future is to ask them to really do a living history impersonation of an enslaved worker."
