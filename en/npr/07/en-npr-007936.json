        "Yes, they're real.",

        "At the time in this picture, he's 13 years old.",
        "So he's got a tattoo on his chest, so he pulls his chest and he says, `I want you to photograph this tattoo.",

        "Take all the ammo out.",

        "I would suggest you don't ever reload them, but, you know.'",
        "So he goes and he sits down, and I finish photographing the tattoos.",
        "I don't know exactly what he's doing, but I do know this, as I--when I first started photographing the guys, a lot of them get into what I call `the television version of themselves.",
        "And I often ask myself how long does it take for the television version of a particular character to wear off?",
        "The answer is about 35 minutes.",
        "So I turned around and there he was, sucking his thumb staring down at this guns, his heats.",
        "So I took the picture.",
        "And I only took that picture once, and I turned around and finished photographing the tattoos, which was unusual for me because I would have thought I would have taken a bunch of those so I'd have some to choose from, but I knew I had it.",

        "That was the first reading he went to, you know?",
