        "And what was it like where you live?",
        "Well, we had a number of trees down, and all kinds of rain and wind and - but my real - I was also in St. Croix in 1989 for Hurricane Hugo - on our boat - and we got off our boat and we went into a house, which was blown apart by the storm.",
        "But two weeks before that was Hurricane Dean, which missed us.",
        "And then so many people did nothing in preparation for Hugo, because they'd already gone through that for Dean and they said oh, it's just more hype.",
        "Preparing and not having the storm hit, or not having it hit as badly, is not a problem.",
        "And I don't understand why people make that out to be a problem.",
        "And the other thing is that there's so much time spent interviewing people that stay in dangerous places - like out on Ocracoke Island this year - when they should move.",
        "And then they make these people, who are putting themselves and rescuers and other people in harm's way, out to be like some macho men and women and heroes, and all that.",
        "And it's absolutely ludicrous.",
        "If there's a dangerous storm coming, prepare.",
        "And it's not hype.",
        "I mean, yes, there's this - some nonsense involved in all of this.",
        "But the reality is, weather can be extremely dangerous.",
        "I don't believe she did, which was just quite strange.",
        "I didn't know where they got the information from.",
        "It was very confusing for us.",

        "He called Irene - to call Irene - he called Irene hurricane hype and worried about - that people would not listen to warnings next time.",
        "As I complete this, he wrote, there's another tropical depression out in the Atlantic, and a couple more on the way in the very near future.",
        "Suppose one of these takes a similar path, except that it improbably threads the needle of the mid-Atlantic bight, and makes landfall immediately to the west of New York City as a Category 3 storm.",
        "How many people will the hyping of Irene have killed?",
        "That's how hurricane hype, followed by hurricane insanity, leads to hurricane death.",

        "I'm - I live in Florida now, but I'm from California so I've experienced both big earthquakes and hurricanes firsthand.",
        "Hurricanes are extremely difficult to predict the path and the intensity of, but I personally found the East Coast reaction to a relatively small earthquake to be pretty hilarious.",
        "My sister, who lives in San Francisco, called it a foot massager.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "I mean, I was talking to my son who lives in California, and we were saying gee, we don't even - you know, Californians don't even blink for that.",
        "On the other hand, news is when something is unusual.",
        "It's been a hundred years since anything like that happened on the East Coast.",
        "And I thought that that was fine, that it - the fact that it was unusual.",
        "It was just the - like, two-day coverage going back and I thought - the part that I found the most hilarious was when two news stations were reporting that there would not be a tsunami - which, of course, there can't be a tsunami since the epicenter wasn't out at sea.",
        "All right, Linda.",

        "If you've ever been through these kinds of weather events - if you've ever had trees fall over because the ground was so saturated with rain, if you've ever had five and half feet of muddy water in your basement, if you spent one or two or three days without power, if you've ever listened with dread to each gust of wind and waiting for something to crash through the window or a roof - you are thrilled when the weather doesn't live up to the prediction.",
        "This time, the Delaware River across the road from house crested at just 24.6 feet, although 31 feet was predicted.",
        "At 31 feet, I would have had 10- or 12-foot swatch of mud across my lawn and drive.",
        "Give me the overhyped storm anytime."

        "By contrast, only a handful of fatalities appear to be linked to people killed in their homes.",
