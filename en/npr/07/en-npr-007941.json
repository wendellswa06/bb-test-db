        "America's better poised to lead and succeed in the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.",
        "But polls suggest most Americans aren't sold on the recovery, and that's dragging the president's economic approval ratings down to about 40 percent.",
        "Why the disconnect?",
        "Maybe because while the economy is growing again, most people's paychecks are not.",
        "Basically, they haven't seen an expansion.",
        "Their incomes have shrunk.",
        "Pavlina Tcherneva is an economist at Bard College who studies the way pretax income growth has been divided during the past 10 business cycles.",
        "Back in the 1950s, income gains during good times were widely shared, with 90 percent of the workers collecting 80 percent of the extra income.",
        "But with each passing decade, those at the top of the income scale were grabbing a bigger and bigger share, until by the expansion of the 1980s, the bottom 90 percent of workers got just 20 percent of the gain.",
        "It sort of debunks that myth that a rising tide lifts all boats.",
        "About 30 percent of people who met all the appropriate clinical criteria did not have Alzheimer's disease.",
        "But Gutmann says that has to be weighed against another important principle.",
        "Now, no Democratic senators lost their seats on Tuesday.",
        "Mary Landrieu in Louisiana was the one who had the toughest race, and she was re-elected.",
        "But there will be two who are leaving the Senate, Joe Biden and Barack Obama.",
        "What happens to their seats?",
        "Well, both those seats will be filled by the Democratic governors of Illinois and Delaware.",
        "It's not clear who Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich will choose to replace Obama.",
        "But because the president-elect was the only African-American in the Senate, Blagojevich is expected to choose a black person to be his successor there.",
        "And among the names being mentioned are Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., Congressman Danny Davis, and Illinois State Senate Leader Emil Jones, Jr."

        "As for Biden's successor, it's long been assumed that his son, Bo, who's Delaware's attorney general, was being groomed to take over that seat.",
        "But Bo Biden's been deployed to Iraq as an Army National Guard reservist until late next year.",
        "So outgoing Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner could appoint a caretaker successor until a special election is held two years from now, or that decision might be made by Delaware's Governor-elect Jack Markell, who's sworn in the same day that Joe Biden takes his oath of office as vice president.",
        "And just briefly, on the other side of the Hill, in the House, the Democrats expanded their majority.",
        "Do we know yet by how many seats?",
        "Well, the Democrats have a net pickup so far of 19 seats, expanding their majority to 254.",
        "And another half-dozen House races are still up in the air.",

        "NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from the Iraqi capital.",
        "Police say the bomb was apparently planted in a parked car near the market.",
        "It blew up just before 6 p.m. as people shopped for their evening meal.",
        "The bombing was the most lethal Baghdad has seen in more than three months.",
        "Judging by the length of time it took for police and rescue teams to sort through the human remains and arrive at a casualty count, it was also extraordinarily destructive."

        "The bombing came on the same day that Iraq's parliament announced plans to move outside the heavily fortified Green Zone and back into the old Iraqi parliament building, which is near the center of the city.",
        "The announcement was seen as an expression of confidence in Baghdad's improved security.",
        "Huriya, where the attack took place, was a mixed Sunni and Shiite neighborhood but had seen a lot of secular violence over the past two years, and many Sunni families have been driven out.",
        "Even though Baghdad is in the midst of a fairly severe dust storm, there have been a lot of people on the streets.",
        "Markets have been particularly crowded, in part because improved security has made shoppers more confident.",
        "People also have to shop frequently because it's impossible to keep food fresh in the hot weather without electricity for refrigeration.",
        "Better security has led to a big increase in the number of cars on the street, to the extent the traffic jams have once again become common in downtown Baghdad.",
        "Even though Iraqi soldiers and police and American patrols have been out in force, it's still difficult to examine every car or truck, and that provides opportunities for attacks such as this one.",

        "We contacted Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz just after he took a trip to China.",
        "The stores that we've opened in China are larger in size than the dwellings in which people live, so our stores have taken on a life of their own in terms of an extension of people's home and office.",
        "About 80 percent of our customers in the US take our coffee to go, and over 80 percent of the Chinese customers have our coffee in the store and stay very long, enjoying the environment, and we're happy with that.",
        "When you say that a lot of your stores are bigger than a lot of people's houses, it just underlines that this is a place with very modest living standards.",
        "How do you get people that are making $100 a week to spend $5 on a drink?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, there--you know, the customers that are coming in the Starbucks are making more than that.",
        "But let me put it in perspective for you that I think is interesting.",
        "I'm told that over 300 million Chinese people every day are using a cell phone, and when you think about the fact that they have leapfrogged traditional technology, and many of those people never had access to a telephone at home, it demonstrates the adoption that they have to new technology and Western-type opportunities.",
