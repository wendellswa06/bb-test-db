        "Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging says defining Alzheimer's by plaques and tangles also solves another big problem for researchers.",
        "There is a stage of the disease where there are no symptoms, and we need to have some sort of a marker.",
        "What scientists call a biomarker.",
        "And now there are a range of biomarkers for plaques and tangles.",
        "They are detected through special brain scans and tests of spinal fluid.",
        "Masliah says that means scientists can now do experiments that would have been impossible relying on symptoms alone.",
        "One could, let's say, start preventive treatment five years before the onset of the symptoms based on the presence of the biomarkers.",
        "Scientists outlined the new approach in several papers in the journal Alzheimer's And Dementia.",
        "But proponents say the new definition is intended for researchers, not doctors and their patients.",
        "That's because current biomarker tests are expensive, often difficult to perform.",
        "And, even if they find something, there's still no way to stop the underlying disease.",
        "Maria Carrillo is the Alzheimer's Association's chief scientific officer.",
        "It's a research framework meant to be tested, a tool for researchers, not for the doctor's office.",
        "But she says a few doctors who specialize in Alzheimer's are already beginning to use tests for plaques and tangles.",
        "Some of those physicians actually are able to incorporate some biomarkers to actually make a more precise diagnosis.",
        "That can help in some special cases.",
        "And Carillo hopes that when drugs to prevent Alzheimer's finally arrive, biomarker tests can show who should get them.",
