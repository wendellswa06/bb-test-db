        "Well, let me clarify this.",
        "When we talk about Islam, we talk about Islam as a reference for life; as a reference to guiding our steps in economy and politics, and the ethical conduct in general in the political practice.",

        "Democracy has been hard to come by.",
        "You're absolutely right and we believe that that happened because we were far from Islam.",
        "And if we go back to the real values of Islam, the will of the people is the basis actually for governance.",

        "What we don't like to see is one side putting its agenda and enforcing it on the other.",
        "The billion-dollar you're talking about is really related to the military aid, and that took place actually following the peace treaty with Israel.",
        "And as long as the treaty is maintained, I don't see a reason why this aid should not continue.",
        "And you would intend to see that the treaty is maintained?",
