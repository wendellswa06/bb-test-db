        "For an unknown reason, the brown tree snake on Guam very readily consumes dead prey - things that it hasn't killed itself.",
        "And once researchers discovered this, we were able to combine the attractiveness of the dead mouse with a very effective but very low-risk toxicant, acetaminophen, which is a very common over-the-counter painkiller and fever reducer for people.",
        "Now, the idea here is that the acetaminophen - essentially Tylenol, to use the brand name - that's toxic to the tree snakes, and the tree snakes would eat dead mice, if they came upon them.",
        "So, the idea is to somehow make the mice the delivery vehicle of the acetaminophen."
