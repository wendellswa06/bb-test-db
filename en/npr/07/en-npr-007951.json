        "When you say The Israel Lobby went to work, what specifically did they do, as far as you can tell, to move U.S.",
        "policy?",
        "Well what happened was, AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, put significant pressure on senators and congressmen, and got them to approach the White House, and to tell President Bush, in no uncertain terms, that it was not possible for him to try to face down Ariel Sharon.",
        "And as a result, what happened was, that Bush backed down.",
        "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee is one of many, many, many lobbying organizations in Washington.",
        "What would give them the influence to move the opinions of senators, members of Congress, even the White House?",
        "Professor STEPHEN M.",
        "WALT (Academic Dean, John F.",
        "Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University): This is Steve Walt.",
        "AIPAC is extremely well organized and well funded.",
        "It's very good at channeling campaign contributions to candidates who are supportive of Israel, and against anyone that they think might be unsupportive of Israel.",
        "They also spend a lot of time up on the Hill.",
        "They help congressmen prepare talking points and things like that.",
        "Other organizations that are part of this broad coalition, write op-eds, challenge anyone who is critical of Israel so that Israel is perceived in a very favorable light.",
        "This is, again, the standard tactics that most interest groups employ, but they are particularly effective at it.",
        "You argue also, that The Israel Lobby was at least one factor in the U.S.",
        "decision to go to war in Iraq.",
        "Why do you think that?",
        "It's quite clear that from about early 1998, forward, there was one group that was pushing very hard for war; and that was the neo-conservatives.",
        "And the neo-conservatives are closely identified with Israel, and have been pushing American policy for a long time to support Israeli objectives.",
        "Which, of course, they believe are consistent with American objectives.",
        "But there is an abundance of evidence that it was those forces, specifically the neo-conservatives and the leaders of The Israel Lobby, who were pushing for that war.",
        "And it is that evidence that led us to make the argument that they were a necessary, but not sufficient cause for the conflict.",
        "Which gets into one of the complexities here.",
        "You're acknowledging that The Israel Lobby, at most, was one of the factors here.",
        "Our argument is that it was a major driving force.",
        "And if you took that major driving force away, in all likelihood, you would not have had a war.",
        "Stephen Walt, as you examined the history of what you describe as The Israel Lobby, did you find an example where they did not get what they wanted?"

        "But the key goal is to make sure that nothing interferes with broad American support with the very high level of American economic aid -roughly $3 billion a year - that goes to Israel - the most to any country.",
        "So no matter what Israel does, whether it continues building settlements; whether it spies on the United States; whether it sells our military technology to other countries; no matter what Israel does, one of The Lobby's main goals is to make sure that nothing interferes with broad American support.",
        "Gentlemen, can we get to the underlying issue beneath all of this debate?",
        "Is it in the U.S.",
        "national interest to provide support to Israel?",
        "I think it's very important to distinguish between support for Israel's existence, and a willingness to defend Israel if its survival were ever in danger.",
        "I think that is in American interest, and it's one that John and I both support.",
        "It's a separate question whether the United States should be providing unconditional backing for Israel, and for all of Israel's policies.",
        "Most notably, the continued occupation and control over the Palestinians, and the refusal to negotiate a long-term peace settlement with the Palestinians.",
        "That's something that the United States pays a large price for, in terms of our image in the Middle East, and our image elsewhere in the world.",

        "O'Neill has a new book now called \"\"The Growth Map.\"\" It looks again at the BRICs a decade on, and he says their success has surpassed even his predictions.",

        "O'NEILL: Well, at the time when I created the acronym 10 years ago, Brazil was regarded as the most controversial.",
        "One of my favorite BRIC anecdotes was on a trip to Brazil soon afterwards.",
        "One of the key people inviting me to this event whispered in my ear as I was going to the podium to speak: We all know that the only reason the B is in the acronym is because without it there would be no BRIC, which reflected a widespread mood that Brazil didn't really deserve to be there.",
        "But in fact, as you say, all four have done better than I thought, but Brazil especially, actually.",
        "You could already see some tiny signs of it.",

        "O'NEILL: Well, because I think Brazil's done it as a democracy and against the background of a pretty chaotic three decades or so of economic life before.",
        "And most importantly, he kept in place the best class of Western economic stability policies but (unintelligible) also had it accepted by lower income groups and through that process spread wealth significantly to those less well-off.",
        "And compared with the other BRIC countries, there's evidence that in Brazil income differentials actually narrowed.",
        "So remarkably successful.",
        "Let's turn to China, which, you know, is so much talked about, had so much impact in the world, if only because of its size it would.",
        "There are key challenges for China, which you point out.",
        "There are people talking about doomsday scenarios in a way that China has an unsustainable debt, what happens when there's a slowdown in economic growth.",
        "What do you feel about those concerns?",
        "O'NEILL: Well, for as long as I've been closely following China, which is now about 21 years, many of these things have been suggested before, but I think the first part of answering this question is to say that you cannot look at China through just a purely Western-orientated lens.",
        "It's a very different society and whilst it is a Communist Party leadership, one-party state, it's almost more like a Chamber of Commerce than a political party.",
        "One of the things that I've found to really respect about the Chinese leadership is that they worry about a lot of the so-called major problems that they face as much as us foreign observers and investors.",
        "And I generally find from my career that countries where the policymakers worry is usually a better place in terms of investing.",
        "You want to be really worried about places where they don't worry.",
        "And certainly one problem, though, that China doesn't have is population and population growth.",
        "That sort of growth is a key part of your analysis of BRIC economies.",

        "It's got a shrinking population.",
        "What else is there about Russia that might be concerning?",
        "O'NEILL: Well, just on the demographics with Russia, halfway through the first decade of BRICs, when I used to talk to people about it, male life expectancy was less than 60, which is astonishing at this day and age around the world.",
        "But most of the signs I get today is it's crept up by three or four years, which is obviously a very important positive.",
        "But you know, there's a lot Russia has to do to deal with that problem.",
        "Beyond that, I'd say the other two major problems that Russia has, one is far too excessive dependency on oil and gas, and then secondly the whole rule of law, especially as it relates to doing business, as many people talk about frequently, is highly questionable.",
        "It may be too soon to have worked this one out, but how do you think the demonstrations of quite prosperous middle-class people in Russia who benefitted from the decisions in the Kremlin about the economy in recent years and the oil, how do you think that might affect how this economy goes?",
        "O'NEILL: Yes.",
        "It's a fascinating thing and I haven't worked it out 'cause it is so recent.",
        "But I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and I have been talking to quite a few Russian experts and Moscow-based friends of mine.",
        "And just as you can't look at China through a Western lens, you have to be really careful, perhaps even more so, when it comes to Russia.",
        "I think one has to distinguish between general angst about the apparent election results and popularity of Putin.",
        "What is really interesting is despite this huge protest, Putin himself appears to be rather popular.",
        "Does the debt crisis in Europe and the - sounds like a very real possibility of a recession - does that change your outlook at all for the BRICs?",
        "The Margaret Esherick house in Philadelphia's upscale Chestnut Hill suburb has a lot going for it.",
        "It was created by one of the giants of 20th century architecture, Louis Kahn, and it's one of the few Kahn house designs ever built.",
