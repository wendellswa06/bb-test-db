        "Well, I don't think it was a surprise to anybody that Judge Kavanaugh was angry and emotional, but his comments were very partisan, and he made statements that weren't supported by any facts that - at least, that he was able to cite.",
        "So what did you make of that?",
        "I understood that he believed in order to keep his nomination live, he had one key person to please, and that was the president of the United States.",

        "But, that said, some of his comments were so over-the-top.",
        "The comment about the Clintons, while no doubt a result of 20 years of simmering rage over how Kavanaugh thinks he was mistreated in perception of him writing the Starr Report, there's something to be said for appearing to have judicial temperament even in a political setting like your confirmation hearing.",
