        "We use NASA and NOAA satellite data to look for the specific habitats that certain fish have in terms of the water temperature and color.",
        "So for argument's sake, if a particular species like sailfish like a temperature off of Palm Beach, and that temperature and color is not off of Palm Beach but it's further north off of Cape Canaveral, then we direct the fishermen to fish off Cape Canaveral and vice versa.",
        "If the habitat normally is Canaveral but further south, then we would direct fishermen further south."
