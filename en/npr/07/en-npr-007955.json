        "Each judge said that there was not any kind of a determination made before arraignment that these individuals were unlawful enemy combatants, and that's a requirement that Congress set in law last fall in the Military Commission Act."

        "So, these military commissions have been set up.",

        "That's exactly correct, Rebecca.",
        "The government was relying on a system of Combatant Status Review Tribunals that were set up in the summer of 2004, really to determine whether we could continue to detain these people at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "The finding in that tribunal was only that they were enemy combatants whether they'll be lawful or unlawful.",
        "Congress said that the only jurisdiction for a military commission is over an unlawful enemy combatant.",

        "There is a lawful enemy combatant, Rebecca.",
        "But under the Geneva Convention, lawful enemy combatants can only be prosecuted by courts martial - the same type of courts we use for our own military servicemen.",
        "And again, Congress was the one that set the law and said only alien unlawful enemy combatants can be prosecuted by military commission, which Congress set up.",
        "And how do you think this happened?",
        "That the law Congress passed says unlawful enemy combatants and the tribunals designated just enemy combatants?",
        "Well, the tribunals that were established in 2004 were principally for the purpose of determining whether we could continue to detain these people at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "It was not looked at as being the threshold for prosecution by military commission.",
        "I don't want to sound like I like blood and I like to kill, but we don't have any other choice.",
        "I think Israel must invade Gaza.",
        "Unfortunately.",
        "I wish we would live in peace territory, but it's not like that.",
        "When Congress, last October, set that as a requirement that they had to be shown to be alien unlawful enemy combatants, I'm afraid nobody looked at the systems putting them together and recognized that there was a missing piece or a disconnect.",
        "So again, this is not something that should be surprising.",
        "It is a little unusual that no one caught it before a judge had to make these rulings yesterday.",
        "And what about politically, how significant a setback do you think this is?"

        "Now, these two cases, we're going to have to go back and fix the system, once again, obviously, is not what the administration wanted to have happened.",

        "They were professionals.",
        "I think they made good rulings and the fact that these military lawyers are following the law is something that, I think, history will record is a good part of this whole system.",
        "And in terms of fixing the system, sort of, among the options of Congress going back and revising the law, these two specific cases being appealed within the military commission's framework, or all of these detainees being brought back up in front of these tribunals and being re-designated unlawful enemy combatants, which do you think is most likely to happen or is it sort of all of the above, or some fourth option?",
        "I don't think we're going to see Congress going back and changing the law, Rebecca.",
        "I think it's more probable that Secretary of Defense Gates will very quickly adjust the Combatant Status Review Tribunal system for these two individuals.",
