        "So the Tribune created an interactive community project on its Web site called Not Just a Number.",
        "The online homicide map includes photographs of the victims, and it allowed friends, family, neighbors or even strangers to exchange stories, music or anything else in a file attached to the photo.",
        "But last year, families of some of the victims complained about the photos.",
        "Many of the victims' pictures on the homicide map were mugshots, and families said those shots criminalized their loved ones.",
        "In response, the mugshots were removed for a time.",
        "But this year, the paper decided to continue using the mugshots.",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Why did you decide to go back to using the mugshots?",
        "Well, as we started gathering all the photographs for this year's map, we, of course, decided to - as we had in the past - put out a call, requesting family members to provide photographs that they may want for the map.",
        "We also used another source, which was the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
        "But once we got all these pieces together, about a third of the map was without images.",
        "So we had a debate amongst ourselves about, well, what's more important?",
        "Do you show the faces?",
        "Do you just list the person's name and where they were killed and the date?",
        "And I ultimately decided that it was more important to show the face, rather just the number.",
        "You know, the whole spirit of Not Just a Number was that very point, that these people are not just numbers.",
        "And although they're listed numerically on the map, they're not just numbers and we need to see their faces, even if those mugshots come from the police department.",
        "And just to be clear, you use the mugshots only if the families don't provide a personal photo.",
        "Correct."

        "Was there a debate within the newsroom about journalistic integrity?",
        "Because if you had the option of using mugshots, in some of these cases, it might suggest that the victim was caught up in a lifestyle that may have contributed to their death.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, there was debate.",
        "And there certainly was debate last year, when we initially, the first time Not Just a Number kicked off, and the folks who were really leading the charge were going around talking to families and hearing, you know, finally getting the feedback that people didn't like these mugshots.",
        "You know, there was debate that time about, you know, the old school journalists were like, well, you use what you got.",
        "And these other folks were like, well, no. We're going to betray the people who let us into their homes and told us their stories if we use these mugshots.",
        "So that debate, of course, continued this year, because Not Just a Number, we're continuing to add to it, continuing to build on that legacy.",

        "And also sort of capturing in a different way the data so that you could see the correlations between, you know, where people killed, what they were killed by, you know, who they were, what their demographics were so that we can begin to sort really shape a picture of what the crime issue is, and then maybe better report on it and better illuminate the problem.",

        "So this is a portabella, and this is an eggplant, and it's a salmon patty, and it's a veggie burger on a whole-grain bun, and we even went to the length of having the biochemists look at the active ingredients of the raw garlic in the condiment after being in a refrigerator for one, two and three days.",
        "Just to be certain that the active ingredients hadn't lost their punch.",
        "Gardner says some of the volunteers who were not eating the sandwiches were instead asked to take a garlic supplement every day, while others were asked to swallow a placebo pill.",

        "We were so disappointed because nothing happened.",

        "He really thought fresh garlic would lower bad cholesterol, but since it doesn't, he says he'll move on and maybe check to see if there are some antibacterial benefits or perhaps an anti-inflammatory effect that helps the body.",
