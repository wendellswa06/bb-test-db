        "So, what station do you usually catch our show on there in Signal Mountain?",

        "What is it exactly?",
        "Well, specifically, and I thought a lot about this because, of course, I've heard other people on the show who are far worse off than I am.",
        "But I was laid off about eight months ago and in that time period have had a grand total of two interviews, and I'm a pretty qualified guy with a good resume.",
        "And I see my success in my life as being a good father and a good husband.",
        "I had a - my father and mother raised me in a world of opportunity, and when I wrote that email, I was thinking about what I might have to subtract from my children's lives as I went forward.",
        "I had been raised to believe that I had this support, this background, and I could see this fading away, and that's how I measured myself as a person.",
        "And so, by all those measures, I was setting myself up to fail.",
        "You were a former manager.",
        "You were working for AT&T.",
        "You had a management position there.",
        "You used to be a singer and songwriter.",
        "This was some time ago.",
        "A little bit of success there, but you got out of music to find something more reliable.",

        "You've got two kids.",
        "You've got a home.",

        "Just what is it that you're trying to pay for that's getting hard?",
        "Well, it would be everything, honestly.",
        "When you start to look at - our health insurance costs are the equivalent of a mortgage.",
        "We had our children late in life, and so we're in our late 40s and early 50s.",
        "And so, our health insurance costs are significantly higher, just the mere - I think it's interesting when the - there's a lot of talk about the middle class and a lot of talk about who the middle class is.",
        "But I think, realistically, a lot of people are spending a lot more money to be the middle class than is really acknowledged.",
        "And when we cut everything back and take a good hard look at it, those real costs eat away at your savings and the potential for having a retirement account or college account or things like that.",
        "Now, we have - we're not there yet, but if you look at it, and you do the math, it's a very, very slippery, fast slope down.",
        "You see things getting narrower and narrower and narrower.",
        "Sure do."

        "Well, it's, you know, it's a virtual unemployment line now.",
        "Almost everything's done online, which also, I may point out, for people who are not really comfortable with computers and fluent on the Internet, makes it doubly likely that people who don't have a shot at the moment are not going to get a shot.",
        "And you don't really get to present yourself the way you got to present yourself when I was first looking for jobs, when I was, you know, 11, 12, and 13 in the early '70s.",

        "Well, I generally go to bed and wake up about a hour later, and it has accelerated the longer it's been since I've had what I would consider a steady paycheck.",
        "You've listened to these interviews that we've done earlier with people also in difficult circumstances, more difficult than the circumstances you find yourself in?",
        "Seriously, yes, much more difficult.",

        "But it is possible to grow a minibrain that models autism and watch how it develops.",
        "Farahany, who studies the legal and ethical implications of emerging technologies, says the potential of minibrains is mind-boggling.",
        "But she says so are some of the questions raised by creating these brain-like structures, which scientists prefer to call organoids.",
        "Is it possible that an organoid far off in the future could develop something that looks like consciousness or any kind of sentience, the ability to feel something like pain or experience anything?",
        "Farahany and 16 other prominent scientists, ethicists and philosophers summarized their thoughts in a commentary in the journal Nature.",
        "Farahany says one of their concerns involves the practice of transplanting human brain tissue into animals.",
        "How comfortable are we with certain kinds of hybrids that we're creating, and does that change the way we regard those animals or the kinds of protections that should be afforded to them?",
        "In other words, do we really want to create a mouse with exceptional mental abilities?",
        "And if we do, should it be treated like a typical lab mouse or more like a chimp?",
        "The commentary's authors don't try to answer those questions, and Farahany says there's no need to yet.",
        "She says that's because minibrains and related technologies are still in the very early stages.",
        "Right now they're pretty good proxies for being able to study how certain kinds of human neurons interact with each other and develop and grow over time.",
        "But they are still far away from what an actual human brain would look like.",
        "But the field is moving quickly.",
        "Just this month, the team at the Salk Institute in La Jolla showed that a human minibrain transplanted into a mouse brain developed functioning blood vessels.",
        "So Farahany says scientists and the rest of society need to start developing guidelines now.",
        "This is really the time to get out ahead of these ethical issues before it becomes deeply problematic, you know, to be able to proceed without having addressed them.",
        "She says minibrain research has so much potential to help people.",
        "It would be tragic to have it derailed by an ethical crisis.",
