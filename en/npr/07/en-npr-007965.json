        "Yes, we have medical investigators who go to the scenes of death, who assess the scene, look and see what the relationship is of the body to these - its surroundings, look for evidence of medications that could be either under-taken or over-taken, and look for evidence that might suggest the death is something other than a natural death or if it is clearly an unnatural death safeguard that evidence that's related to the body.",
        "What is it, do you think, that most of us don't understand about what you do?",
        "Well, I think there's confusion in this country because there's confusion about systems, whether or not we have competency in training at the level of, say, the scene of death and then the levels of competency at the level of the examination of the body and then at the level of certification, which is the documentation of the cause and manner of death.",
        "Determining the cause and manner of death is the major mission of both coroners and medical examiners.",
        "In each state, and sometimes even within a state, in the different counties, there are different types of systems, and that I think leads to confusion as to who does what.",
        "John Kades, I assume Los Angeles County being so populous and large, that seems to be one big system there.",
        "Yes, it is a big system.",
        "And as you deal with - do the other neighboring counties do it the same way?",
        "Is it standard in the state of California?",
        "Well, it's done a little differently as you go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.",
        "And in the state of California, you have 58 counties.",
        "And the vast majority of those counties are sheriff coroner counties, where the sheriff is also the coroner for that county, and that's because that county boards of supervisors decided once upon a time that the coroner would also be the sheriff.",
        "Six of the counties in California are coroner counties, like Los Angeles.",
        "And the system when you look at it, the question is it a coroner county or a sheriff coroner county or a medical examiner county, what you're saying is, well, who is the ultimate shot-caller at the end of the day to say what the cause and manner of death is.",
        "Do you want that to be a medical examiner who is a doctor?",
        "Do you want that to be a coroner?",
        "Or do you want that to be the sheriff for that county?",
        "So obviously they all have different training and different specialties."

        "Well, the training and specialties are pretty uniform and across the board.",
        "The duties, the responsibilities, the job description is pretty much the same.",
        "We're all responsible for investigating the cause and manner of any sudden, unexpected or unnatural death.",
        "But as you go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it's handled a little differently, but the laws of the state of California apply equally to all jurisdictions, and there's actually more similarity as you go across the United States from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.",
        "Dr.",
        "Fierro, would you agree?",
        "Were there standards in - was it a standard system in Virginia?",
        "Well, there's a standard system in Virginia because it's a statewide system.",
        "But I think the differences are the qualifications of the people who are making the decision on the cause of death.",
        "And the question then becomes: What are the competencies that are required to make a medical determination of a cause of death, cause of death being the disease, the injury or poison that has accounted for the death of the person?",
        "And that requires specific medical training.",
        "That may or may not be present depending on the jurisdiction where the death occurred.",
        "The higher the level of training you have to make medical determinations, to sort out medical mysteries, to carry out examinations that will reveal those medical causes of death, generally the better off you are.",
        "Ultimately, as previously said, there is somebody who is responsible for actually preparing a document called the certificate of death that assigns the cause of death and the manner of death.",
        "And I think what you want is you want the highest level of competency making a medical decision.",
        "When you say poison, I assume that would include drug overdoses and drug combinations?",
        "It would include any substance, which if ingested or inhaled or received say through the skin could account for a bad effect upon the body that would actually poison.",
        "So it could be a drug.",
        "It could be a street drug.",
        "It could be an environmental toxin.",
        "It could be a prescription.",
        "And that is, I've read, has become an increasing problem.",
        "It is because there are - especially with the analgesics, the painkillers, they seem to be rising in their incidence of causing death.",
        "We've had in Virginia large numbers of death due to some opioids that previously were not on the market, say, 20 years ago.",
        "And these are prescription medications.",
        "People overdose on them accidentally, and they also of course overdose on them when they specifically to overdose.",
        "And they seem to make their way to the street so that people overdose on them in a drug abuse setting."

        "And one of the main things that I run into in my practice is that people don't really understand the difference between what is a coroner and what is a medical examiner.",
        "And in general, a coroner is a person who needs to be 18 or 21 years old and have a GED, and in many jurisdictions they don't require any specialized training at all for a person to be a coroner.",
        "So that person is elected, and they may be more beholden to the electorate than they may be to the decedent.",
        "I've run into problems where the child of a prominent family in a given jurisdiction turns up deceased under suspicious circumstances, and the coroner, because of that family's political prominence, decides not to order an autopsy and decides not to investigate that death.",
        "A medical examiner, on the other hand - and again, this is very generally speaking, and it depends from jurisdiction to jurisdiction - but a medical examiner is a person who goes to four years of college, has a Bachelor's degree, goes to four years of medical school, and then does at leave five years of extra training after that in order to become a forensic pathologist.",
        "So the distinction is very large between a coroner and a medical examiner, and about 50 percent of the population of the United States is served by coroners and about 50 percent by medical examiners.",
        "Let me ask you, Adele, after all of that training, why did you decide to go into - become a medical examiner, forensic pathologist, and work for public money?",
        "You know, it's funny that you ask me that.",

        "I started out training as a general surgeon and actually did a general surgery residency and a trauma surgery fellowship before I decided to go into pathology and forensic pathology.",
        "It's a really fascinating field to be in.",
        "You're right, the pay is not nearly as good as being a private practice or a hospital pathologist, but it's absolutely fascinating and very satisfying to be able to give families and law enforcement some answers into what caused the death or injuries of their loved ones.",
