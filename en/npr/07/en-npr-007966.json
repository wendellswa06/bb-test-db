        "Our issue is what happened to this person.",
        "Why are they dead?",
        "And there's a public health aspect to this too, because we need to know why people die if we're going to properly allocate our resources for prevention, our resources for intervention and our resources for, say, crime-solving too, in the civil and in the criminal courts.",
        "So knowing why people died is the major issue here.",
        "Adele, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Here's an email that we have from Kelly(ph) in Fort Myers: If I understood you correctly, if one is not an MD, how in the world can he or she determine the cause of death?",
        "Does that not put the accused at risk in a trial?",
        "And John Kades, you point out you're the eyes and ears for the pathologist.",
        "That's correct.",
        "In Los Angeles County, the deputy coroners, who act as the investigators, do so under the direction of our chief medical examiner, Dr. Lakshmanan, who is also the coroner for the county of Los Angeles.",
        "By California state law, a coroner does not have to be a doctor, but here in Los Angeles he just happens to be.",
        "So when I sign a death certificate, or one of my investigators signs a death certificate, it's because a board-certified forensic pathologist, a deputy medical examiner, has, you know, has taken a look at the case and provided all that information based on the totality of the circumstances and the evidence we've gathered, and that's how we close a case.",
        "I think that's a real question: How can somebody without a serious medical credential decide how somebody died?",
        "I mean, if you consider that death is the ultimate disease, and you wouldn't dream of going to the coroner to figure out what's wrong with you when you're alive, why ever would you go to someone who has no medical credential to figure out why you died?",
        "Here's an email from Pascal(ph) in St. Peters, Missouri: Can there be a conflict of interest when the cause of death is not adjudicated by a separate medical unit that is distinct from the sheriff's office?",
        "John Kades, is there - does there need to be, should there be independence?",
        "Generally speaking, there is independence, even in a coroner system or a sheriff coroner county.",
        "When a death occurs, you know, all the information is considered.",
        "Many sheriff coroner counties, if they have a death under their jurisdiction that might have been, say, at the hands of one of their deputies, or maybe it was an in-custody death where that sheriff, who is also the coroner, is responsible for the jails, they will seek the independent opinion from a medical examiner or a pathologist who may be from another jurisdiction or provides services to that county, or they may, you know, ship that body for an autopsy to the next jurisdiction over."

        "Either the cause of death is not clear - often this is clear with skeletons.",
        "With a skeleton you may not be able to determine a cause of death because there's no tissue left to show any injury.",
        "Or we couldn't sort out the manner of death - was the death an accident or was it a suicide - about one percent of the time.",

        "Very frustrating.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And John Kades, the same question to you.",
        "Yeah, there are cases that do get closed from time to time that are left as undetermined or unknown.",
        "Similarly, cases where we may know medically what a person died from, say, a gunshot wound, and we have an overabundance of evidence and information that says, yes, this person died from a gunshot wound - but what was their manner of death?",
        "Can we conclusively say that they died at the hands of another, closing the case as a homicide, or was this a self-inflicted wound or an accidental discharge of a firearm?"

        "And even with the best, you know, investigative techniques and application of science and investigation, sometimes we just cannot speak intelligently about the manner of death.",
        "So we'll close the case as cause of death gunshot wound, manner of death undetermined, and - because we don't have enough information to hang our hat on one or the other.",
        "But when we leave a case as undetermined, that still leaves the door open for a future investigation, future prosecution.",
        "If more information comes forward, more witnesses come forward, then at least we've got - the door is open for a determination or an amendment to the death certificate.",
        "So if the coroner or the medical examiner says we don't know what this person died from or what the manner of death is, that leaves the burden on the law enforcement agency investigating that case, that it's still an open case.",

        "And, Dr. Fierro, one thing we do see on all those TV shows is those zippy new machines.",
        "How much has technology changed the business?",
        "Well, technology for the forensic pathologist has not changed as much as it has for the forensic scientist.",
        "But we still are having new developments I'd say on a yearly basis that are helping us do our job better.",
        "The idea of being able to make a molecular diagnosis is helping us with sorting out the various forms of heart disease that resulted in sudden death.",
        "We could - we'd be able to establish medically that perhaps the heart was large, but not be able to ascertain with certainty what in this specific large heart caused the death.",
        "All right, so he has, Trey Gowdy, has, as chairman of the committee, has sent letters now to the White House as we just heard, also to the FBI trying to square these two very different versions of the Rob Porter timeline we've been hearing about.",
        "What questions, Congressman, do you want answers to?",
        "Give me your top one or two questions.",
        "But now we know that there are some diseases only manifest at the - only identifiable at the molecular level.",
        "So great roads are being made in there.",
        "We also are aware of - more aware and are able better to develop, say, the chemical bases of some deaths that we previously were not able to do.",
        "For example, in infants, some of the metabolic errors that results in sudden death of infants are now known to us that were not known to us, say, 20 years ago.",
        "So we've made advances in that way.",
        "The use of particular stains, biological stains on the tissue to help us to identify various markers has also helped.",
        "So as medicine progresses in general, the tools available to the forensic pathologist improved too.",
        "As in - one of the health care issues, of course, is the number of tests and procedures that are now available to doctors who sometimes order them, at least we hear, to avoid the perception that they ignored them, that they were leaving themselves liable, the remote chance that one test or one procedure might come up with something, driving up costs.",
        "Is that the same case in - for medical examiners?",
        "I think the cost of an autopsy has increased over the years as we've availed ourselves of modern technologies.",
        "As we have availed ourselves of, say, more a complete toxicology, that increases cost.",
        "As we avail ourselves of molecular testing, that's still very expensive.",
        "And so that has increased cost.",
        "The - in order to recruit and retrain - retain forensic pathologists, salaries have had to improve, so that increases costs.",
        "But in the main, this increase in cost has been more than matched by improved - improvements in quality.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And unfortunately we just do not have the resources to always, you know, do a full-court press on every death that occurs.",
        "We do the best we can with the information we have and try and provide some closure to the families and give them that diagnosis because when a coroner closes out a case, or a medical examiner closes out a case, they are expressing an informed medical opinion.",
