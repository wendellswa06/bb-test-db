        "I mean he understands what's going on in the world at a nuanced level that no other candidate on the stage does.",
        "The problem is Americans very rarely vote for the most qualified person on any issue to be president.",
        "We vote for the people that we actually trust to do the things that they say they're going to do.",
        "Well, I think you put it very well earlier.",
        "What did you know, and when did you know it?",
        "And who knew what?",
        "So did the White House counsel know that there were serious issues and allegations raised about Rob Porter that prevented him from getting a security clearance?",
        "The lack of intellectual curiosity by General Kelly, the chief of staff in the White House, about Rob Porter and this case is very troubling.",
        "You know, I used to work on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
        "We all needed security clearances.",
        "And if there was some impediment to that, you weren't going to be hired.",
        "So how can someone...",
        "Let me stay with the - forgive me, but I want to get to this security clearance question before I let you go.",
        "In the moments we have left, you have called for new legislation, new congressional oversight.",
        "What specifically can Congress do to fix what you see as a broken security process?",
        "Well, I think, frankly, we can codify the time period in which somebody has in the White House to get that interim security clearance to a full security clearance.",
        "We can shorten the review period and have a hammer fall that if you don't pass muster, you've got to leave.",
        "How many months?",
        "I mean, what's reasonable to you?",
        "Well, I mean, obviously a topic of discussion.",
        "But I think indefinite security clearance - interim security clearance, is just not acceptable.",
        "And I'm very troubled by people who have trouble getting a clearance having access to very highly classified material.",
        "Congressman, thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Democratic Congressman Gerry Connolly of Virginia.",
        "He's a member of that House Oversight Committee, which has just launched an investigation into the vetting and employment of Rob Porter at the White House."

        "Hi, Steve.",
        "What'd it all look like as the president arrived?",
        "Well, the president and his entourage were escorting in a very slow procession by an honor guard of Vatican nobles through several marble-lined grand rooms of the Apostolic Palace.",
        "Trump and the first lady appeared visibly impressed by the frescoed walls and ceiling, Swiss guards in their colorful Renaissance uniforms who were standing guard as they passed.",
        "At one point, the president and first lady were asked to enter a very small elevator.",

        "The president was beaming, but the pope had a somber expression.",
        "Trump said, a very great honor, but Francis did not reply.",
        "There was none of the usual chitchat that occurs usually while photographers are snapping away.",
        "It seemed the pope did not want to speak while the media was present.",
        "But then, when the meeting ended a half hour later - which is the normal length for these meetings - and the rest of the entourage entered the library, Francis appeared much more relaxed, and he smiled a lot, especially at the first lady.",
        "And of course we have to read a little bit or try to read what we can into the expressions in what they say or don't say.",
        "We don't want to overread it, but these are two leaders who've had big differences.",
        "What have their main differences been?"

        "Well, their first, let's say, exchange at a distance came early in 2016 during the campaign.",
        "After visiting Mexico, where he celebrated mass right at the border with the United States, Francis was asked by reporters what he thought about candidate Trump's proposal to build a wall between the U.S.",
        "and Mexico.",
        "You know, it's well-known Francis is an advocate of refugees and migrants.",
        "And without mentioning Trump by name, he said building walls instead of bridges is not Christian.",
        "This is not the gospel.",

        "Oh, no, not at all.",
        "They don't share the same views on economic systems.",

        "He's also strongly opposed to arms trading, and Trump just came back from Saudia Arabia where he signed a big billion-dollar - many billion-dollar deal with Saudi Arabia for arms.",
        "They don't agree on a lot of things.",
        "Globalization - they both see it harmful, but the pope says the harm is done mostly to the developing world while Trump says it's mostly to the United States.",
        "And perhaps the issue, of course, that they're most at odds on is climate change.",
        "In fact, today, at the end of their encounter, Francis gave the president his writings, including his very powerful encyclical on climate change, a topic on which Trump has a very different opinion.",
        "The pope described it as on the care of our common home.",

        "He said proselytizing is not my style, not in religion or politics.",
        "The fact that it took place at all - it was not originally on Trump's schedule - I think that's probably the most important thing, a meeting between the two men who probably have the loudest megaphones on the world stage.",

        "It is tough to have a nuanced argument in campaigns especially because campaigns are about differences in trying to find a person that you agree with and the person that you trust to handle the thing you should think are important as a voter.",
