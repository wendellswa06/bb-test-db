        "Why is the meeting house set up this way?",
        "The meeting house is set up this way because of the nature essentially of that quiet, contemplative worship.",
        "They like to face one another.",
        "Back home in Britain, the Quakers were a radical sect that rejected the elaborate rituals and hierarchy of the Anglican Church.",

        "It is said that Mr. Penn's activities in recruiting all over Europe are going to bring more and more people here eventually.",
        "There isn't much physical evidence left of what Philadelphia looked like in the early 18th century.",
        "That's according to historian Daniel Richter who directs the McNeal Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "He took me on a walking tour that started in a modern park where William Penn's original vision for the city is laid out under our feet in concrete and stone.",
        "Essentially Penn didn't like cities.",
        "And he imagined not so much a city as a kind of rural town in which every lot would be at least a half an acre in size, which would have left plenty of green space in between these broad thoroughfares."

        "So already by 1708, even though there were probably only 3,500, 4,000 people living in Philadelphia at that point, it was a very densely-packed place with everybody huddled up against the river where all the business was and where all the people lived in anything but a green country town.",

        "Nothing goes unnoticed.",
        "And when things happen in the streets, when people put up an effigy and burn it, when they start marching around, when they start breaking people's windows who failed to sign on a non-importation agreement, this isn't something you read about in the Philadelphia Inquirer the next day, this is something you see right outside your window.",
        "Today if you come to Independence Hall, the building is surrounded by a lot of open space.",

        "Walk right up there and look right in those windows, which would not have been closed since there was no air conditioning in the 18th century, and literally see in here what's going on inside.",
        "So inside Independence Hall there's a very famous painting of the signers of the Constitution.",
        "And you can't help but notice that they're all white men.",
        "But if you'd walked around the streets outside of Independence Hall that day in the 1780s, what would the city have looked like?",
        "Ah, it would have been an extraordinary melting pot of languages and peoples and religions, particularly if we're talking about the period of the Constitution.",
        "Slavery had officially been abolished in Pennsylvania in 1780.",
        "There was a thriving free African-American community here, and shops and other enterprises run by African-Americans would have been part of the scene.",
        "You would have heard the German language everywhere.",
        "You would have heard a whole variety of accents of English and would have certainly not got a sense that those elite people with their silk stockings and their powdered wigs were at all representative of the City of Philadelphia as a whole."
