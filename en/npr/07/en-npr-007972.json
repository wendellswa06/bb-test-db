        "And by that, of course, he means Appalachia, a region that stretches from Alabama to Pennsylvania, even parts of New York.",
        "Along with Jamie Ross, Ross Spears is the filmmaker behind the documentary series, \"\"Appalachia: A History of Mountains and People.\"\" The series airs on PBS this winter, they're joined by our other guest, Ronald Eller, associate professor in the History department at the University of Kentucky and author of, \"\"Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since 1945.",
        "We want to hear from Appalachians today, wherever they may be living now.",

        "How do you connect to the history of these regions, how do the mountains shaped you?",

        "But I used to live down in Jonesborough, Tennessee.",
        "And we moved down there from a small town in New Jersey with just my wife and my kids.",
        "And it shapes you the mountains - that Appalachian mountains really shaped you in - for me, personally, it shaped me as a ball because it's got all the good cooking.",

        "And I wanted to ask you - Ronald Eller, there's a word that you used in that clip of tape that we played before, and where do you use a couple of other times in the film that Jamie Ross and Ross Spears make.",
        "And the - the word is hillbilly and you don't use it disparagingly or even affectionately.",
        "You just used it to describe people from your home.",
        "Folk from the mountains tend generally to be very proud of our culture, of our community.",
        "And like a lot of other minority populations, we sometimes make fun of the derogatory kinds of words that are used and applied to us.",
        "And so - and for us, hillbilly is often, something that's taken with a great deal of pride if in fact, it means someone who is, in fact, close to the land, someone who has a strong sense of family and a strong sense of religion, and a strong identity with one's neighbors and one's kin.",
        "So it's not a negative term in that sense.",
        "Now, if someone outside of the region applies it to us, it takes on a very different kind of meaning so - and we respond appropriately.",
        "Let's get - we'll not go there.",

        "And I've noticed especially, with the young people playing this music, they've taken that mantel, the term hillbilly, and consider it a wonderful thing to be.",
        "That's badge of honor.",
        "A badge of honor.",
        "It's kind of like a - I think in the 60s and 70s when black people were, you know, the whole black power movement.",
        "But my question to you is, how do you consider Appalachians or mountain people different from Southerners, in general rural, Southerners in general?",
        "Oh, that's an excellent question.",
        "Well, our whole film series is about how land shapes people, and how people shape the land.",
        "And of course, what we have here in Appalachia is an incredibly unique landscape.",
        "It is not unique just in the contours, or the fact that they're some of the oldest mountains in the world.",
        "They're some of the richest mountains in the world and I think that was something Ron was talking about, somebody talked about earlier.",
        "Today, we were discussing this that we - in the film, one thing we tried to show - and I think that comes out real clear - is that mountain people have this real sense of locality and attachment to local place.",
        "I think Southerners are more to thinking of themselves as a group as Southerners because they were created politically by a - in a political event.",
        "Now, Barbara King Sowers(ph) says we had a flag about the Appalachia, as you know is that the Salamander would be on it.",
        "But then you have to have a state of Appalachia, which might not be a bad idea because as you know we're in the backyards of everybody else states right now except for West Virginia.",
        "But I think that I really do think that - I really do think the mountains are the defining characteristic and they're what make people different.",
        "And also, the biodiversity here, there are more species of trees in one acres of forest in this part of world than there are in all of Europe.",
        "And we grow up amongst that, the people folks here do.",
        "And I think that we just come to - somehow, it gets into our bones not just the shape the hills but the rich texture of the life around us.",
        "And I don't think that's true and hardly any other place on the planet.",
        "This is one of the world's great temperate forest that we have lived - that we live amongst.",

        "The scientist, Iya(ph) Wilson, who's in the film uses the term biophilia, the love of living things, literally.",
        "And I think that people in Appalachia are really infected with that.",

        "For instance, for me, I'm fourth generation tobacco farmer, but our family sold out during the government buyout in the early 2000s, when the government got anti-smoking.",
        "So I've had to look for new things, you know, life other than, you know, raising tobacco and new jobs, new houses, I've moved to the city and that kind of thing.",
        "And it was a lot different thing, you know, going down to the little one room church that 20 people is a good attendance day on Sunday, and you know, everybody raising tobacco in the valley.",
        "And one of the things adjusting on the outside that I have to do is I've ran into a lot of stereotypes, like your other guest have been talking about.",
        "For instance, this summer, I worked here at public radio, I had an internship, and I had to cover up my southern accent.",
        "Rick told me that I had to do that if I was going to be on the radio, that it didn't sound pleasing to the ear, that - unless you are well-known, you had - so I learned how to do that, and that's one of the things, you know, adjusting on to the outside.",
        "I just thought that was interesting, I'd tell you all.",
        "Yeah, Charlie, you see, the idea is to get behind the camera then you don't have to change accent.",

        "And Appalachia is a land of small farmers, has traditionally been a land for small farmers.",
        "I'm hoping, you know, like Barbara King Sowers is that with the current hot price of gasoline which also hurts farmers, I'm hoping that there's going to be a world for you, guys.",
        "You know, with local food and local products, because we're not going to be able to pay to get our tomatoes shipped from California.",
        "So anyway...",
        "I was going to ask Ronald Eller to weigh in on this - how this move away specifically from small farms and tobacco which was such a big part in various part of the - of Appalachia.",
        "I think Charlie has really hit upon something that confronts large numbers of folks from the mountains.",
        "And that is the fact that you end up living in two worlds.",
        "You will never give up or completely abandon your Appalachianess to use that phrase.",
        "That's always going to be there with you and most of us from the mountains have learned to become bicultural, to understand what it takes to function in the larger world.",
        "But hopefully, that doesn't mean that we can't lose our attachments to people and our attachments to each other and our knowledge of what's really important in life.",
        "And if the Appalachian experience should tell us as a nation anything, it should tell us that getting bigger and better and growing and changing is sometimes good, but it comes at a pretty heavy cost to who we are as individuals and as people.",
        "And in many ways, the nation has created this image of Appalachia as the other America, this place that's so different.",
        "But I'm convinced that Appalachia is not the other America.",
        "It's in fact much of the same kinds of struggles that we as a nation have gone through.",
        "We have faced very intensely here in the mountains, and we've learned to be bicultural as many other Americans.",

        "And frankly, I think public radio had a lot to do with it, and I know you guys won't give yourself kudos, but if you'll listen to public radio on West Virginia, they actually embrace folk music, and they make people feel like just because they may not know where their ancestors came from doesn't mean they weren't great ancestors from England or Irish or what have you.",

        "But it does continue, but it's not the defining experience.",

        "Economically, we still lag behind, I think, in per capita income and a large part of that is due - Oh how to say this - not so much as - for years, this was blamed on culture, that the Appalachian people just weren't enterprising enough, but it's interesting where our strongest pockets of poverty are or also, where our extractive industries have gained root.",
        "There's no other way for people to earn a living.",
