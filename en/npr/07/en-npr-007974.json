        "And the police hadn't really faced that kind of challenge in quite a long while, and at times in Seattle they were at a loss, and the message to other departments around the country was we better have a plan to deal with this kind of protest in the future.",
        "Well, the former chief of police in Seattle will join us in a few minutes.",
        "But the reaction in many departments was to - well, some call it the paramilitary approach.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that some departments reacted with real fear to what had happened and fell back on, you know, their basic orientation, which is, you know, we need tools for control, and I think moved away from what some of Chief Ramsey talked about, which was the need to open up lines of communication, which is something that I think has been lacking at times in the last couple of months.",
        "Were you surprised to hear him say that they begin each shift with a reading of the First Amendment?",
        "I was surprised about that, but you know, I think while, you know, training is a good thing, I don't think what we're seeing here is a real problem of training because these decisions about whether or not to evict these encampments and the kinds of tactics to use in evicting them are not being made by individual officers who are at roll calls.",
        "These are decisions being made by local mayors and police chiefs, and you know, what we've seen in New York is some of the acts of violence that have specifically been committed by very high-ranking supervisors.",
        "So you're talking about the pepper spray incident?",
        "Well, there was the pepper spray incident.",
        "There was another supervisor who punched a young man in the face.",
        "There was another incident of a supervisor sort of wildly swinging his baton, injured some reporters and others.",
        "So it's more than one incident, but all the incidents of serious accusations of violence here in New York have been committed by high-ranking supervisors.",
        "And the tactics include a massive show of force, serried ranks of officers in blue with riot shields and visors and batons and all kinds of - and protective padding too, and all kinds of non-lethal uses - equipment like, well, rubber bullets and gas and beanbags, that sort of thing.",
        "Well, we don't actually use the word non-lethal.",
        "We use the word less lethal, because in fact deaths do occur in the use of these materials from time to time.",
        "And it's true that I think departments have become much more reliant on this technology in part because of resources coming from the federal government and kind of a diversion of some resources that were associated with the war on terror and the buildup of these SWAT teams, which have become so omnipresent even in small-town police departments."

        "Well, in fact, in New York there's not much use of this less lethal weaponry.",
        "They tend to rely on their very large numbers of officers and supplemented by some motor scooters and some mounted officers.",
        "But in some ways their ability to marshal such large numbers of officers has reduced the need for these less-lethal weaponry that has been a source of a lot of this conflict.",

        "The Battle in Seattle in 1999 proved to be one of the major turning points in police crowd control tactics.",
        "Tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on a downtown intersection in Seattle to protest the World Trade Organization conference.",
        "City police turned to more forceful tactics.",

        "Yeah, yeah, there was an issue in - well, early on, what we went to, like, with the Bicentennial, is we would just organize, you know, like violent attacks - well not really violent attacks, but we were told that (unintelligible)...",
        "I'm sorry, Tom, are you okay?",
        "Yeah, yeah, that the issues - well, we were told by the FBI that the protestors were going to come with guns, and we were really concerned about that and prepared for quite some time.",
        "It turned out that in '76, it ended up being a peaceful demonstration.",
        "So we didn't really have to do anything.",

        "But, you know, we were really concerned about armed conflict at the time.",
        "And then in the '90s, we turned to a different tactic.",
        "We started to get a lot more informants and infiltrators into the organizations, and then we knew what really was going on.",
        "And that's been really, really successful as a tactic, to infiltrate.",
        "And you can see how successful that was in places like, you know, the Republican National Conventions in both New York City and Minneapolis, where we even got people to - you know, we were able to encourage people to do things like, you know, do acts of violence, which then would make it possible for us to come in and sweep the streets and bring in large amounts of SWAT team tactical police.",
        "It was really effective.",
        "Alex Vitale, it's not just in Philadelphia, and he mentioned those conventions, some - essentially preemptive actions.",
        "Well, preemption has become the name of the game, having intelligence and preemption.",
        "I mean, I think we - there are obviously some significant questions that have to be asked about some of these preemptive tactics, the use of informants and agents, provocateurs, which has been documented fairly well in some instances.",
        "But I think part of the bigger problem on police intelligence is that is often inaccurate, that sometimes the police think that they're going to be dealing with violent demonstrators when they're really going to be dealing with disruptive demonstrators.",
        "And that's I think been one of the key dilemmas during this whole Occupation movement, is that there's been a kind of confusion of defiance with a real threat to public safety.",
        "And the fact that people don't want permits and are really trying to push the limits of the First Amendment does not make them a kind of violent threat, and yet many of the police tactics really could only be justified in the presence of significant violence.",
