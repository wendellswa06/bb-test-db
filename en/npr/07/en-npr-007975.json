        "We put to rest through very rigorous intelligence ordinances back in the '60s, to a small degree, and certainly in the '70s, the tactic of infiltrating activists, political activists, civil rights, anti-war, those involving campus unrest, in favor of a more open and more direct approach, negotiating with demonstration leaders to the extent that such leaders are identifiable and generally working to collaborate on both the tactics and the policing of those tactics, to the extent that that's possible.",
        "And, of course, what can completely ruin that strategy is sending an undercover cop into a, you know, a nucleus of protestors and then, in some cases, engaging themselves in very provocative behavior.",
        "Alex Vitale, that may - our caller may or may not have been who he said he was, but nevertheless, I think some incidents of that are pretty clearly documented.",
        "And indeed, it is standard tactic some places for undercover cops to identify individuals who they think might be problems and snatch squads to go in and get them.",
        "Well, that's absolutely true.",
        "And I - and also, since 9/11, there has been some rolling back of these intelligence guidelines.",
        "The New York City police, in particular, went to court to ask to be let out of their past agreements limiting their surveillance and infiltration of groups.",
        "Now, they claim this was primarily to go after terrorism suspects, but we now know that this has included enhanced surveillance of some political operations.",

        "You don't fight a war without propaganda.",
        "The people on the receiving end of that law enforcement campaign against illicit drug use, for example, and sales has helped to create a mentality that is very unhealthy for the country, very unhealthy for the community-police relationship.",
        "And actually, it helps to compromise public health and safety.",
        "Add to the mix the intensification of Homeland Security efforts that, as Alex has accurately pointed out, has led to the creation of SWAT units - used principally for drug raids these days - all the way across the country, including some of the very smallest departments.",
