        "But when a disproportionate percentage of those people ended up being African-American, the judge said he'd call them back in and order their employers to continue paying them if they were selected.",

        "In my 28 years of experience, black jurors are generally more suspicious of law enforcement than white jurors.",

        "And when you can buy fertility in a bag, you don't need to rotate your crops anymore, you don't need animals on your farm anymore, you could move to a complete monoculture, and it was a real boon for a plant like corn, which of course is a greedy plant.",
