        "Let's talk about corn, because that is an incredible story you tell about the rise of corn from a simple grass into the cobs that we have today, which it never started out, and how it was all made possible by this fertilizer.",
        "Well, you know, one of the most astounding things I learned in doing this research and I was doing these kind of food detective stories about how we eat, was learning that all that fast food, all that supermarket food, if you trace it back to its origins - because all our food begins with a plant growing somewhere under the sun - I kept ending up back in the exact same place, which is to say a cornfield in Iowa.",
        "It's the corn that feeds the steer that turns into the hamburger.",
        "It's the corn that sweetens the drink that we, you know...",

        "And then you go through all of this, and then at the end you say, indeed, the supermarket itself, the wallboard, the joint compound, the linoleum, the fiberglass, the adhesives, which the building itself has been built, is in no small measure a manifestation of corn.",
        "Well, that was an astounding thing.",
        "I mean, we are the people of corn.",

        "Right.",
        "And most of the carbon that most of us are made from, unless you grow up perhaps on organic food, came from corn plants originally.",
        "And in fact, working with a biologist on campus, we did some experiments, and if you take a little clip of your hair or fingernail and run it through a mass spectrometer, corn has a very distinctive signature.",
        "It has more Carbon 13 than most plant carbons.",
        "And that identity, that signature is preserved all the way through the process, even in the soda, even in the burger you ate for lunch.",
        "And as it turns out, if you put a - if you look at us Americans under the machine and then you look at Mexicans, the supposed corn people, he said, we look like corn chips on legs.",
        "And another experiment that I did was running a McDonald's meal through his machine, and I was astounded.",
        "I mean, the soda is 100 percent corn.",

        "It's all the corn syrup.",

        "On the other hand, it doesn't work without the subsidy system.",
        "It's a set of political choices that has led to this overproduction of corn.",
        "And we could make other choices, and we do have this farm bill every seven years, and there's one coming up next year, and for the first time, at least in my memory, I think there's an opportunity for change.",
        "I think there really is this sense that we need a farm bill that thinks in terms of public health.",
        "Could we have a farm bill that instead of subsidizing high fructose corn syrup subsidized fruits and vegetables?",
        "Yeah, we could if we - you know, if people paid attention and didn't let the farm bill debate degenerate into a debate between, you know, the senator from Nebraska and the senator from Iowa.",
        "All of us have a dog in this fight.",
        "What about another feed stock or grain like soybeans, things like that?",
        "Well, soybean is very much part of the story, and you're absolutely right, because soy is the - basically corn and soy take turns in these fields, the legume and the grass.",
        "And soy is another food that can be tricked up into all sorts of products.",
        "Basically, a farmer growing corn and soybean is growing animal feed.",
        "That's where most of it's going, and the soy becomes the protein source for the animal and the corn becomes the energy source.",
        "So they're really in lockstep.",
        "You've got to deal with both commodities at the same time.",
        "What would you suggest?",
        "Let's talk about solutions then.",
        "Well, I think in a way the first and best solution is to put animals back on farms, get them off of feed lots.",
        "You know, we've industrial - we've urbanized all the livestock in this country, concentrating them on these - in these cities of filth, and like all primitive cities, they're subject to epidemics.",
        "So therefore we need antibiotics.",
        "How did the - why did the animals leave the farms to go to these cities?",
        "Well, basically because corn got so cheap that a farmer could not grow corn as cheaply as a feedlot operator could buy it on the market because it sold for much less than the cost of production.",
        "So there was no economic incentive to keep the animals on the farm, and as soon as you move the animals into the feedlots, you have what - Wendell Barry's great phrase is we took a solution, which is having animals and crops on farms so that the animals provide fertility and the crops provide food for the animals; we took the solution and then neatly divided it into two problems, which is to say a pollution problem on the feedlot and a fertility problem on the farms that we have to remedy with all this fossil fuel fertilizer."

        "So I think we have to turn back the clock on that move, and if the price of corn were higher, and it could be that if we changed our agricultural policies, it would make sense to keep the animals around.",
        "And if you keep the animals around, you no longer have that monoculture of corn and soybeans, because then you need some pastures for your animals, and then you have a source of fertility on the farm and suddenly you have a system that is closer to the way an ecosystem works.",
        "And I met farmers who are doing this, and I think the happiest thing I learned in the course of doing this book, which goes way beyond the food system to our whole understanding of the human relationship to nature, is I went to this farm called Polyphase Farm in Virginia - in Swope, Virginia - and it's a very subtle, complicated farm where six different animals are grown at a very careful rotation, such as the waste of one becomes the food of another and they keep taking turns in these pastures.",
        "And basically, to give you a very quick illustration of what he does, the cattle are intensively grazed, they're moved every day.",
        "Then he waits three days and he brings in something called the Chicken Mobile, which is a portable henhouse.",
        "And the chickens fan out and what they do is they eat the grubs, the larva in the manure, which is their favorite source of protein.",
        "And in the process of digging those grubs out, they spread the manure around the farm.",
        "And they also - the reason he waits three days to move them in is so the grubs can grow large and fat.",
        "Juicy.",
        "Really juicy.",
        "But if he waited five days, they'd hatch.",
        "See, he'd have a fly problem.",
        "So he's actually growing larva to feed his chickens.",
        "And because they eat the larva, there's no fly problem, so he doesn't need chemicals to keep the flies off of his cows.",
        "They also - the chickens copiously fertilize this pasture with their manure.",
        "At the end of the year - and then the pigs come in and there's a whole kind of rotation of other animals - but at the end of the year, this pasture has more topsoil than it did at the beginning of the year, more fertility and more biodiversity in the soil.",
        "At the same time we have taken off this immense amount of food of chickens and eggs and pork and beef.",
        "You know, we usually think that for us to get what we want from nature, nature is diminished.",
        "It's a zero sum game, and we subtract.",
        "Well, what this shows you is that there really is a free lunch in nature and - because if you're getting all this food and you're actually improving the land at the same time, that's a whole new paradigm to think about your relationship to nature, and it's the most hopeful thing I've seen in the whole environmental area for a long time.",

        "This farm produces - it's on only 500 acres, just a hundred of which are open, the rest is forest - supports two white-collar salaries and the salaries of two helpers as well.",
        "He's one of the most successful farmers in the country.",
        "I understand from the time you spent with this farmers who are on their truck as plowing fields of corn all day, that they're very happy about it either.",
        "They feel trapped in the system.",
        "They are looking for alternatives.",

        "But they don't see an alternative.",
