        "I mentioned it a little bit differently.",
        "First, where did it come from and why does it come from all these place?",
        "Well, today all of us are eating food from farther and farther away.",
        "It's partly a result of the fact that we've become very good at shipping stuff all around the planet.",
        "And not just food but computers and sneakers and lumber and steel.",
        "We have excellent transportation technology that's evolved from steamships to railroads to now refrigerated 18 wheelers and...",
        "Right.",
        "...refrigerated cargo planes.",
        "And we're in search of food that is raised most cheapest wherever it is on the planet.",

        "Right.",
        "The irony of the whole sort of center of the country, the Corn Belt, is that most of that corn and soybeans goes elsewhere, and those very productive agricultural counties end up importing most of their food.",
        "The folks at Iowa State University at the Leopold Center looked at a typical meal consumed in Iowa - some beef, some string beans, some carrots, some potatoes, berries for a pie, wheat for bread - and what they found is that most of those ingredients came from between 1,000 and 2,000 miles away, from as far away as Chile and mostly from California, even though Iowa is perfectly capable of raising all of those ingredients for the vast majority of the year.",
        "And most importantly, what they found is that long-distance meal consumed 17 times as much energy in transportation as that same meal raised within 50 miles of the university itself.",
        "So not only is it gobbling up a tremendous amount of money, but it's actually taking dollars out of the state, dollars that could be going to Iowa farmers.",
        "And why isn't it grown there then?",
        "If you can do it, why not do it?",
        "Well, it gets back to this sort of economic calculus that defines global trade, that defines trade anywhere at this point.",
        "And that is, if a store in Iowa can find a sack of potatoes grown slightly cheaper than it would cost them to grow it in Iowa, they get it from wherever they can.",
        "And because fuel is relatively inexpensive or a relatively small part of that cost, we're willing to ship those potatoes from as far away as China.",
        "And we don't really attach a lot of value right now to the fact that those potatoes might have been grown locally, which might mean that they're fresher and tastier.",
        "It also means that we're not causing all this pollution and congestion as a result of the energy use.",
        "And also means that we're keeping money in our local economy.",
        "Dr.",
        "Wilkins, you write about fossil fuel consuming a huge portion of our food costs.",
        "Well, it certainly does.",
        "Our food system is very fossil fuel-dependent and very heavily uses of fossil fuels.",
        "It's estimated that about 20 percent of our fossil fuel use is used in the entire food system, from production to getting food on our table.",
        "You wrote an article in the Times-Union, the local newspaper in Albany, New York, saying food policies fail to spur good health.",
        "And you talk about something that sort of flies below the radar screen of most Americans, most politicians.",
        "And that is the legislation that sets up the farm bill.",
        "What goes on in the farm bill affects just about all kinds of things that we eat.",
        "Talk about what your concerns are.",
        "Well - and this gets back to our concentration of supporting very few commodities, as opposed to supporting diversity and variety, which we promote in the dietary guidelines.",
        "So our dietary guidelines are very sound in what they're promoting in terms of eating a variety of fruits and vegetables and eating whole grains and, you know, a variety of different kinds of foods."

        "Yet our production system that we support with policy is very narrow in what it supports.",
        "And the Economic Research Service of the USDA has estimated that we would need to put in six million acres more in crop production to supply the kinds of foods, if people shifted to the dietary guidelines, and produce far fewer acres of corn and far fewer acres, about 10 million fewer acres of soybeans.",
        "So we're producing foods that are then converted to being available as commodities to the food industry that then finds multiple uses for them.",
        "We have, you know - walk into a supermarket today and see nearly 40,000 items in the supermarket.",
        "Gives a really great impression of a lot of choice.",
        "But when you start really looking at the ingredients in a lot of the packaged foods and the highly processed foods that we have in the supermarket, you'll start seeing the same ingredients all over the place.",
        "And high fructose corn syrup, which didn't exist before 1970, is now pervasive throughout our food system...",
        "1-800...",
        "...as is a lot of added fat from soybeans.",
        "Do you think that part of - speaking of that - do you think that part of the obesity epidemic with kids that we're seeing now comes because we're not eating more directly from the far?",
        "We're eating too many processed foods?",
        "The concern about obesity is the one of the things that's causing people to rebel against this food system.",
        "Eating local is probably the easiest way to cut out a lot of those highly processed junk foods.",
        "Because you are depending on more raw wholesome ingredients that you're cooking yourself.",
        "It's also a very good way to avoid all sorts of preservatives and fumigants that are used on foods that have to endure a long shelf life and long-distance transportation.",

        "But you look at institutional food service - cafeterias in schools, colleges, hospitals, prisons - they're much bigger buyers.",
        "And so when they make a decision to buy local and buy direct from farmers, it makes a huge impact on the local economy.",
        "And there are several examples.",

        "In fact, there was a defunct diner in his town and he wanted to start a diner there.",
        "But he would serve all the typical diner foods.",
        "But instead of getting all of his ingredients from some big distributor that shows up once a week in an 18-wheeler truck and drops it all off, he wanted to get everything from within 50 miles.",
        "So the beef for the burgers and the wheat for the hamburger buns and the berries and the fruit for the pancakes, and the milk for the milkshakes and the eggs from the omelets all come from farms and food makers within 50 miles.",
        "And the business is thriving, partly because people are intrigued by this idea.",
        "It serves very good food.",
        "In the winter, you don't get a tomato on your burger, you get a slice of pickled beet on your burger, which some people, I guess, prefer.",
        "And there has been a plan to franchise the idea.",
        "Not only in Vermont, but into Boston.",
        "And the business is experiencing some growing pains like this farm in Illinois, because it's trying to redefine the model.",
        "But it's a very good example of how eating local is beginning to grow beyond the culinary fringe.",
        "Supermarkets are beginning to do similar things.",
