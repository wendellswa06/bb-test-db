        "And they bare a label that designates that.",
        "A lot of their seafood, a lot of their meat, a lot of their vegetables come from there.",
        "And they make a very big effort to educate their customers about that fact.",
        "And what they found is it draws customers into stores.",
        "Sometimes people are willing to pay more for it.",
        "But it also helps educate people about what's in season in their area.",
        "I've heard about some of these being food co-ops, where people put money in the front and they get the harvest later.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And there's also a movement to buy a sort of food subscription where you might become a member of a farm.",
        "It's referred to a CSA, Community Supported Agriculture, in the sense that you pay upfront at the beginning of the season to become a member and in exchange, every week or so you get a box of produce, which is able to feed your family.",
        "You share in the risk of this farmer who's trying to make a go at something new, and if the farmer has a very abundant crop of something, you also share in that.",
        "But again, this is all - these are all just really good examples of Americans becoming fed up with anonymous food, wanting to know where their food is coming from, who is growing it, what impact it's having on their landscape, and having some direct control over that.",
        "Talking about food this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News with Brian Halweil, author of \"\"Eat Here: Reclaiming Homegrown Pleasures in a Global Supermarket\"\"; and Jennifer Wilkins, a Kellogg Food and Society Policy Fellow and senior extension associate in the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca.",
        "Jennifer, being a Kellogg Food and Society Policy Fellow, how do the big food companies, the processed food companies, view these things?",
        "Do they view the movement back to local as a threat or something they want to get in on?",
        "Well, I think that they maybe are starting to pay attention.",
        "It's still a fairly small part of the market.",
        "But I think that they are starting to look at this as maybe something that they can take advantage of and maybe build into their profile.",
        "And we're starting to learn that Wal-Mart, for example, might be wanting to buy more local.",
        "They have bought local in New York.",
        "They, in fact, have featured local apples and other New York State-grown products.",
        "And I think that this is a very good opportunity.",
        "It is definitely an opportunity for local growers.",
        "I think that with this opportunity, of course, will come challenges.",
        "And it presents a chance for states, local areas to maybe develop an organized way of approaching that so that farmers can definitely reap some benefit in making sure that they get the cost of production in while they're doing business with a big entity like that.",
        "Brian, if we all wanted to eat locally, buy locally, are there enough farmers and farms out there for us to find?",
        "And if there were to be a switch, could we make the switch?"

        "I think there's no doubt that we could make the switch.",
        "We've lost a lot of farms in this country.",
        "The number of farms has gone from close to around 10 million at the beginning of the - in 1900 - to under two million today.",
        "It's a little-known fact that there are now more people incarcerated in the United States than there are full-time farmers, and that's a good example of what's happened to our food system.",
        "There will definitely be more people flocking back to the land to start up farms, to start up small-scale food businesses, as this movement grows and as there's more demand.",
        "But the reality is - as Wal-Mart gets interested, as big food distributors get interested, as big health-care companies like Kaiser Permanente get interested - it becomes easier for people to do this.",
        "It's not just sort of diehard parents who want to shop seasonally and can and store food year-round for their families.",
        "We'll be able to eat locally by going to our local restaurant or by going to our local supermarket.",
        "But people are not going to give up the convenience of having their off-season fruits and vegetables in the wintertime, for example.",
        "They may not right now, but there are - that convenience also comes with some problems.",
        "I mean, 80 percent of the tomatoes in this country are ripened artificially after they're harvested.",
        "That is, they're harvested green so they can be shipped long distances, and when they get close to where they're going to be sold, they're exposed to ethylene gas to ripen them up.",
        "Now, that compromises flavor in a major way.",
        "Right.",
        "You can't say but.",
        "The Third Reich was in total.",
        "The criminal character of the racial state influenced the total everyday life and nearly each family.",
        "And to say there was something good - maybe with the exception of the weather, maybe there was sometimes was good weather, but nothing was good.",
        "Anyone who's raised their own tomatoes or shopped at a farm stand knows what a tomato's supposed to taste like.",
        "So that convenience of getting that tomato in the middle of the winter, or a strawberry, comes with a cost to flavor.",
        "It comes with a cost to your local farmer, who is dependant on selling those tomatoes and strawberries to you during tomato season.",
        "There's sort of an excitement involved in waiting for that season to come around.",
        "And a great flavor.",
        "Dr. Wilkins, what about terrorism?",
        "You know, if having our food supply so concentrated in the hands of few companies - is that dangerous for us?",
        "Well, any time you have one large target that if hit has a big consequence, that's probably more dangerous than having a more distributed system.",
        "And this would be true of the food system.",
        "So if you have many smaller entities, a more dispersed production and processing and distribution system, it's less of a target.",
        "That just seems logical.",
        "So it would be more secure.",
        "And it's great - I have this poster on my office door at work.",
        "It was produced by the New York State Farm Bureau, and it has a big banner at the top.",
        "It has Homeland Security on it.",
        "And then slogan at the bottom is: Eat Local, It Matters.",
        "So that big farm-representative agency is really noticing this."

        "It could very easily begin to affect millions of people all around the country.",
        "In contrast, and it's not to say that local farms are immune to these sorts of problems, but the problem is likely to be much more localized and able to be controlled, and a lot of food-safety problems are a result of how long food is kept after it's been harvested.",

        "Our food bill for a family of four was running about 189 a week, and we're now at 329 a week for local and organic.",
        "So I don't know how many families can afford that, but that's a significant - you know, that's a significant jump in costs.",
        "Right, yeah.",
        "And we're in San Diego, which I think is probably, given all the farms we have around here, I would think we're probably as good off in this regard as anybody, so you know...",
        "I think it's a real concern, and sometimes shopping that way will be more expensive.",
        "It's not always going to be.",
        "Shopping in season is often a lot cheaper than shopping out of season.",
        "When local tomatoes are in, they're going to be a lot cheaper than in the middle of the winter.",
        "Part of that cost difference could be the organic food, as opposed to the local food.",
        "Right now, we're in a situation where the sort of mark-up or organic food in this country is still considerably higher than conventional foods.",

        "We're willing to pay three bucks for a bag of potato chips, which has barely a potato in it, and three dollars will buy you a lot of raw potatoes.",
        "Of course that does come with the need to cook them and be creative in your kitchen.",
        "But I think there are ways to eat locally and to seek out organic food and still keep the budget in mind.",
        "Dr. Wilkins?",
        "Well, yes, and I think that this is a good place to talk about schools again, because we are now - school is starting and there's a lot of attention being paid on the food that is served in schools in terms of addressing childhood obesity.",
        "And if you look at the cost that food service directors have to work with to provide a lunch, it's about $2.33, and about half of that goes to labor and equipment and other expenses of the food service operation, so you're getting down to about $1.50 that might be available for food.",
        "So in terms of our national policy and our state policy in terms of reimbursements for those meals, we need to start looking at how much we're really providing to the schools and what we're expecting them to be able to serve.",
        "If we want them to serve fresh fruits and vegetables, perhaps organic, perhaps locally grown, then we need to realize that that's more valuable, and it's worth spending more money on.",
        "And that cost that - the price that we pay for a given food item, whether it's local or organic, it doesn't necessarily give us a sense of all that goes into that food.",
        "I mean, think of buying a meal at McDonald's, which is inexpensive, but it's not particularly healthy.",
        "So buying something that's raised locally or buying something that's raised organically, even if it's more expensive, that's money that's staying in your local economy.",
