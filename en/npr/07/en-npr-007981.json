        "That would allow her to stress her strengths and stay away from the war controversy as much as she can.",

        "He's been against the war.",
        "He's been out in the media quite a bit lately, and he's got a new movie out.",
        "Yes.",

        "No. He does not want to do that.",

        "And finally, Ron, the mid-term elections.",
        "Is it possible, the unpopularity of the war could be enough by November, to cost the Republicans control of Congress?",
        "It does not appear that that would be the case in the Senate, possibly the House.",
        "There is a big wave of sentiment in Washington and in national politics right now, to say that the house is in doubt - increasingly in doubt -this November.",
        "I would personally say, that the conservative base of the party, the Republican Party, would have to stay home - or numbers of them would have to stay home -out of disillusionment, before that could actually happen.",
        "But it's a real possibility, that significant proportions of that conservative base are reaching the point now, where they want to punish the leaders of their party and might stay home this November.",
        "Senior Washington editor Ron Elving.",
        "Thank you, Ron.",

        "If we could turn back the clock 65 billion years ago, what would we see?",
        "Well, wouldn't we like to save some of those dinosaurs that were dying out around then and other species that were perishing during that mass extinction?",
        "And if you're still dreaming of dinos, my next guest might say, wake up, because the amphibians now need you.",
        "New research published in the Journal of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests the rapid frog die-offs and other species declines we are witnessing now could be harbingers of a sixth mass extinction that could be happening, and it would be a grim picture.",
        "Well, my next guest says there are actions we can take to cut our losses, and joining me now to talk about it is Dr. Paul Ehrlich, president of the Center for Conservation Biology, also professor of population studies at Stanford, and author of the new book, \"\"The Dominant Animal: Human Evolution and the Environment.\"\" Welcome back to Science Friday.",
        "It's nice to be back, Ira.",

        "A grim business as usual forecast and a hopeful portfolio of partial solutions.",
        "A grim business as usual.",
        "Well, we are in the middle of the sixth-grade extinction.",
        "Many people are confused to think that the only problem is loss of species, but, of course, everybody who understands that the other organisms of the planet are the working parts of our life support systems, also understands that the loss of populations, that is, the reduction in the ranges of species is equally or in some cases more important.",
        "A good example is the honeybees we have over here came originally from Italy.",
        "If you had one population of honey bees around Rome that was going to be there forever, you would not have lost any species diversity, but of course, if all the honeybees were going from North America, we would lose billions of dollars and lot of wonderful food that we depend on, because they pollinate our crops.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think people are definitely still in on this fight.",
        "But they're really frustrated, and they're tired.",
