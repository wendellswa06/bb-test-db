        "The third largest in actual numbers of people, but of course, when you factor in our huge levels of consumption, we're way behind beyond China and India in our impact on the planet.",

        "And no later than stepping out of the plane, grabbing your bags, probably like 10 seconds into it, we could hear a mortar attack, first encounter within five seconds of being in Iraq.",
        "So, yes I'm extremely concerned about China.",
        "But you know, It's hard for an American to talk about what China should be doing when we're doing the opposite.",
        "And we set a terrible example for the world.",
        "In this like it's very hard to criticize politicians for not getting on top of these problems when still many of our colleagues in science are still sticking to their experiments and not worrying about the world coming to an end.",
        "Though yet, you still want to keep a hopeful attitude about this.",
        "Yes because there's so many things we could do.",
        "And one of the reasons to be hopeful is the reasons we don't fully understand.",
        "Societies can change extremely rapidly in their behavior and attitude.",

        "Well, there had been a consensus that penguins originated in the very southern high latitude region.",

        "You know, we previously thought that only close relatives of living species of penguins - and living species reached these equatorial regions during a much cooler Earth, an Earth with ice caps and overall much, much cooler than it was when these new species lived about 36 and 42 million years ago.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So these species that you discovered are able - were able to live in a warmer climate?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And what we find is that in fact is striking, with our new data and data published last year, is that penguins really flourished early in our history in these much warmer conditions.",
        "These are conditions where equatorial regions and polar regions were much closer in temperature.",
        "And we have, you know, the five evidence, you know, of five species in these new deposits from Peru, and then also a considerable diversity in the poles at that time.",
        "So they were doing quite well in this much earlier period in Earth's history.",
