        "Oh, I hope no one gets that message, you know?",

        "So we don't - we are no way implying that the living species that may be cold adapted won't be quite negatively impacted.",

        "It's a very good question.",
        "You know, as you remarked in the beginning of the conversation that it appears to be an aberrant thing in penguins that being, you know, breathing on ice.",
        "These adaptations to extremely cold conditions may be a very recent and comparatively, you know, aberrant thing for penguins.",
        "As to why, we can only speculate.",
        "You know, I don't think our evidence doesn't support that penguins, en mass, you know, that the whole diversity moved to low latitudes and then moved back to high latitudes, but that basically, there was some kind of incentive -perhaps abundant food resources or something - that drove multiple invasions of low latitudes at least twice early in their history and then once more recently.",

        "Well, this form - and this is Icadyptes.",
        "This is a new species that's 36 million years old.",
        "And we did an estimate based on, you know, proportions of its bones compared to the largest known fossil giant penguins, which are from high latitude regions.",
        "And it kind of came in about the third largest yet known globally.",
        "And so it's around, you know, 4 foot 11.",
        "And if you saw it on a Peruvian shoreline or on a dark street corner, you would recognize it as a penguin, you know, for its kind of a rigid, paddle-like wings and the stance.",
        "But it has this very striking skull, the first glimpse at the skull of a giant penguin, and it's quite narrow and it's really quite well built, you know?",
        "It's a strong, pointed, narrow beak.",
        "And, you know, at first glance, it really looks very spear-like.",
