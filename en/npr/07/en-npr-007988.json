        "Talk more about the controversy and this new report.",
        "What are the findings that indicate that wood pellets are not necessarily as environmentally sound as it's been described to all of us?",
        "Well, biomass - just to explain a little bit - is any kind of vegetative matter, biological matter, that's used to make energy.",
        "The thing is about biomass is you can release carbon dioxide when you burn it, but eventually you can absorb carbon dioxide back because you grow new crops and they use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
        "The problem is time scales.",
        "If you're cutting down a tree to use it for fuel, it's going to take a very long time to re-grow that tree.",
        "It can be decades.",
        "And so this study is highlighting the fact that for the short-term or medium-term, we're not going to get that carbon back.",
        "It's actually going to be released in the atmosphere even to a greater extent in some cases then if you were burning coal to start with.",
        "What's the argument from the wood pellet companies?",
        "The wood pellet company looks at this as a long-term proposition, and the Europeans do too.",
        "So yes, it's, you know, you burn wood, it releases carbon dioxide.",
        "But eventually, all these trees that we're planting are going to absorb that carbon dioxide right back.",
        "They're acknowledging there's a gap, you know, many years before you recoup all that carbon dioxide, but they think in the long term it's environmentally sound and it's certainly better than fossil fuels.",
        "We talked about the long-term, but what about the short-term in deforestation?",
        "I mean, what concerns are being expressed here in the U.S.?",
        "There's a whole separate issue that has to do with the impact on forests themselves, and it really has to do with where the logging is going on.",
        "In East North Carolina, where I was looking around, a lot of the logging is taking place in wetlands and on bottom lands, along rivers - in places that are fairly environmentally sensitive anyway, and they do impact species that live there, and these happen to be very productive habitats for wildlife.",
        "Most land in the Southeast is privately owned.",
        "About 90 percent of the forested land in the states of the South are in private hands and there aren't many regulations that dictate certain land uses for forest or dictate replanting at a certain rate.",
        "So it's really between the logging company and the landowners how they're going to reforest and replant and what kinds of rules they're going to abide by.",
        "The EU had adopted the policy of favoring biomass fuels essentially in order to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Is this undermining that effort?",
        "It's a tricky problem for the Europeans and this is particularly true for the British, and they happen to be very big customers of wood pellets.",
        "There's a mandate in many of these countries to reduce the use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, and these wood pellets have become a very good option for them because they can burn these wood pellets right in their power plants.",
        "And there aren't many other good options.",
        "You can put in solar power, you can put in wind power, but those are very slow-growing industries and in the meantime there's a big demand for electricity that has to be filled.",
        "Well, Jeff Buckley for me is one of the greatest singers I've ever heard.",
        "And the reason why is he has an amazing range, amazing emotional power in his voice.",
        "And the music he put around it also just had this passion and this soul to it and this spirit to it that very few artists have, and he passed at a very young age.",
        "And so we don't…",
        "He drowned."
