        "When we arrived at the Gambian River at a little town called Barra, we were almost seven hours late for the last crossing.",
        "So we had a choice to make: We could all get into canoes and paddle across the river--the crocodile is the mascot of Gambia--or we could stay at separate residences or we could stay at the Barra Hotel.",
        "This was the first and last night I stayed in the Barra Hotel.",
        "As we soon found out, it was indeed a brothel.",
        "There was no other experience like that in all of my time in Gambia.",
        "In fact, I was told that this is the only brothel in all of Gambia.",
        "But I did decide to keep that story from my parents until I got safely home.'",

        "Hi.",
        "OK, here is my nightmare story that's funny in retrospect.",
        "I was living in New York and I had to fly out to Portland, Oregon for a job interview.",
        "And I flew after work that day.",
        "I didn't feel like wearing my suit that I'd been wearing at work, so I had thrown my suit into my luggage and was traveling in jeans.",
        "And I arrived out in Portland after, you know, leaving New York around 5 PM.",
        "And it was the last flight into Portland and my luggage wasn't there.",
        "And so I asked where--they had found my luggage.",
        "It was in Salt Lake City.",
        "They couldn't get it in that night because I had flown in on the last flight.",
        "And the next flight in that could get my luggage to me was 10 AM, but my job interview was at 9 AM.",
        "So I was crying all the way to my hotel in the cab, thinking, `Why have I bothered doing this?",
        "This is my nightmare.",
        "I was taken into my hotel crying and the nice, nice woman at the hotel reception asked me what was wrong, and I told her.",
        "And she just looked at me and said, `Well, why don't you just borrow one of our, you know, desk clerk suits?",
        "And I looked...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It was very nice!",
        "You know, it was kind of--you know, if you didn't notice the fabric, it was gray and fashionable.",
        "And so then I sort of started crying again because I'm a larger-sized woman.",
        "I was, like, `You're not going to have any in my size.",
        "And she said, `No, no, no, we do, we do.",
        "So she gave me a suit.",
        "And then I was, like, `Well, what am I going to do with shoes?",
        "I was wearing tennis shoes.",
        "And she had been talking with this other woman who was there who turned to me and said, `Well, I'm the maitre d' at the restaurant.",
        "What size do you wear?",
        "And I wore a size 8.",
        "And she had a size 8 shoe, black shoes to go with the suit.",
        "So I went upstairs and it was great and--except the jacket, 'cause I'm a short woman, was a little long.",
        "So I rolled the sleeves under, so it wasn't too long.",
        "And I went to my job--this would be the next morning--and I extend my right arm to shake the hand of the woman who's interviewing me.",
        "And down comes the sleeve, right over my hand onto hers.",

        "They certainly do.",
        "And actually listening to you talking, I was--only yesterday I was coming back from a restaurant in the Upper East Side, back to where I live in Chelsea in New York, talking to the taxi driver, discovered he was from Bangladesh, and told him I had recently been in Sylhet, and he said, `Oh, sahib, I come from Sylhet.",

        "I am constantly amazed by the kindness of strangers.",
        "I know that's harking back to a book that Don edited two years ago, but these stories, you're absolutely right, reflect mishaps that are invariably overcome by people just being thoroughly decent.",

        "Now you and your husband have a knack of going to the right places at the wrong time.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "And what happened down there on the tip of Argentina, the capital of Tierra del Fuego?",
        "Well, we visited Ushuaia in August, which is the dead of winter.",
        "Ushuaia is the southernmost town of the world and so it's pretty bleak in August.",
        "It was the end of the ski season and the town had pretty much shut down.",
        "There weren't many tourists there anymore.",
        "So a lot of the restaurants were closed and the ski slopes were sort of dead.",
        "The snow was all black and slushy.",
        "And so we had already availed ourselves of the two activities in the town, which were the prison museum and this little Disneyesque train called the Train at the End of the World where you travel through some scrub brush and you hear narration about how good the prisoners had it in Ushuaia a century ago.",
        "Sure.",
        "And I hope the audience doesn't find this offensive.",
        "But this is my life in terms of - it's the end of chapter one.",
        "I'm 7 years old, young man, grew up in New York City, and I was just sexually abused by the woman that gave me birth, my mentally ill mother.",
        "And it starts this way, the end of chapter one, page 46.",
        "Just eight to 10 people.",
        "So we spent our last night in Ushuaia at the Hotel Tolkeyen, which is on the edge of the Beagle Channel.",
        "And my husband and I had gone out for a little romantic stroll along the beach.",
        "It's a very rocky beach and it was really bleak and windy and cold.",
        "And we were talking about how just, unlike all unhappy families who are unhappy in their own special ways, all bleak coastal towns are bleak pretty much in the same way, because Ushuaia reminded us a lot of John o' Groats, Scotland, in January and Crescent City, California, in December and a little Icelandic fishing village also in the dead of winter.",
        "So we deduced our next vacation was going to be the Caribbean or somewhere.",
        "So we're chatting about this and suddenly it becomes very dark and we look off in the distance toward the city center, which is about a 15-minute drive away, and realize that it's completely pitch-black.",
        "We look toward our hotel, which is also completely dark, and the only illumination are the twin headlamps of a car coming down the drive.",
        "So we pick our way along the beach, back to the hotel, and the lobby, which was completely deserted just an hour before is jumping and there's a lot of jovial activity and chaos, and the concierge gives us a couple of tiny little white candles in tinfoil to take back to our room, which happens to be the room closest to the lobby.",
        "And I should note that this concierge, when we checked into the hotel, upon discovery that we were from California said, `Oh, Hollywood, your movies are very big, but they are not very interesting.'",
        "So we go back to our room and, you know, we can't read and we can't watch television and we can't go to the restaurant because it's closed, so we resort to the activity that couples tend to resort to, a rather primitive pastime that couples tend to resort to when all other options have been eliminated.",
        "And I won't go into any detail except to say that the background noise of the chaos in the hallway was kind of pleasant background noise and we're very close to the best part of our story when I heard a noise that seems to be a little bit closer than it should be.",
        "And my back is to the door, and I turn around and I see that we're not alone, and not only are we not alone, but there is an entire family joining us, and the family's coming into our room in the dark and they have all this luggage and there's a bunch of them and they're not really paying attention, so by the time the mother gasps (demonstrates), they're all lined up single file behind the bed.",
        "So there's the dad, a teen-age son, two small children and the mother.",
        "And for a moment we all just sit there in stunned silence and then one of the small children, who's wearing a funny hat, points at us and says something very rapidly in Spanish, which I don't understand, at which point the mother grabs her wits about her, grabs the two smallest children, drags them out the door.",
        "Meanwhile, the father and son are just sort of standing there as if they expect us to invite them to sit down for a cup of latte or something.",
        "The father says very matter-of-factly in perfect English, `Oh, you must be the couple from California.'",
        "And my husband, Kevin, who's rarely surprised by anything, says, `Oh, yes, we are,' and meanwhile, the teen-age son is sort of inching his way around the bed as if he wants to get a better look at things.",
        "And the father says, `Well, enjoy your vacation,' and he sort of shoves the son and out they go out the door.",
        "And you know, there's a window of opportunity for any romantic interlude, and by that point, our window of opportunity had completely closed.",
        "But I guess the moral of this story is not to count on automatic door locks in your hotel, 'cause you might find yourselves in embarrassing situations."

        "Locked up for three months, one does tend to yearn for the kind of activity that you and your husband were engaged in, and after about two months that became painfully evident to the prison governor, who one night unlocked my cell and said, `I've got something to show you,' and he took me into the women's wing and opened up a door, and there was a newly arrested lady of the evening who'd been involved in a fight in a bar.",
        "And she had this sort of microscopic skirt and very little else on, and he had me look at her for about 30 seconds, and then he pulled me out of the cell.",
