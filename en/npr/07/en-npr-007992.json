        "Oh, my...",
        "Oh.",
        "It actually caught on a ledge down the cliff, but it was so far down and so far up that the park had to completely shut down in order to call in a crane that was big enough to get the RV out--to get the camper out of this ravine off of this cliff.",
        "It's only about the second time in the entire park's history that it had been closed.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Expect something to go wrong, and roll with it and see where it ends up taking you, because you'll often end up discovering something wonderful: either a human connection or a lesson about your own ability to be resilient and to deal with disaster.",
        "And that's one more reason why travel is so very wonderful and energizing and enchanting and it's all about that sense of humor, and as you've been pointing out, Neal, it's also all about the kindness, and the fact that these misadventures often call forth kindness in people and these wonderful, unforgettable human bonds are created that way.",
