        "Just last month, a judge told another inmate at Lewisburg he could go ahead and sue over his claims he was placed in restraints so tight that he passed out and was left with long-term nerve damage in his hands.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Richardson versus director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons...",
        "And in the most significant lawsuit, a federal appeals court in July ruled in favor of another former inmate, a man named Sebastian Richardson, and said he can challenge the way he says restraints are used to punish inmates at Lewisburg.",
        "Richardson's lawsuit stems from a day in 2011 when corrections officers came to his cell door with a new cellmate, someone who Richardson thought threatened his life.",
        "They brought the Prophet to his door.",
        "That was his nickname, the Prophet.",
        "Dave Sprout is a paralegal at the Lewisburg Prison Project, a group that advocates for prisoners there.",
        "And he had a history of multiple cell assaults on previous inmates.",
        "Court records show Richardson knew the Prophet as someone who talked incoherently and who attacked his cellmates.",
        "They'd be together in a cell for 23 to 24 hours a day."

        "(Reading) I've heard it said that children are free-spirited, but I don't remember ever being free when I was young.",
        "My mind and my heart carried a heavy burden as far back as I can remember.",
        "As a child, I carried the pain of an adult, and as an adult, I carried the pain of a child.",
        "Now, Dominic, we've had you on before about this, but did you have to forgive before you wrote something like this?",
        "Yes.",
        "And Farai, I will answer your question.",
        "But I - whenever I come on your show - I'm sorry, I just have to make it clear that I am a huge fan of your work, and I am so thankful for what you do in terms of educating Americans, and in particular, people of color.",
        "We have to acknowledge...",
        "Oh, thanks.",
        "...and appreciate the great work that you do as a journalist -perspective.",
        "Going back to my mom, I started writing the story, and initially, I did not put in the sexual abuse.",
        "And it was only after I received more than 600 pages of her mental records, in which I realized, at the age of 16, my mother was in straitjackets and receiving electrical shock that I decided that I wanted to tell my entire story, and I did have to forgive her.",
        "And I feel for the first time in my life that I'm actually free.",
        "And the book has aided me in that process of my soul, finally, after all these years of having a deep, dark secret and never revealing it to someone, being free.",
        "Now Thulani, what do you think about that same question of forgiveness?",
        "I think writing actually forces you to forgive people.",
        "It's very hard to write without a sense of love, a sense of compassion, even for characters that - in a fiction work that start out to be the bad people.",
        "It's like, ultimately, you have to come to understand people to be able to write about them, and that opens up your heart.",
        "Can you read us a little snippet of your book, which, again, was very deeply researched as well as personal?"

        "Sure.",
        "(Reading) When my grandmother, Georgia Campbell Neal, died in 1971, she had started writing a book.",
        "At the time, we thought she was about 85 years old, though it was well known that she was apt to lie about her age.",
        "She was more likely 94.",
        "She was writing the story of her parents, Mississippi cotton farmers - one black, one white - who met near Yazoo City, Mississippi, in the 1870s.",
        "She began the few pages she wrote with a sunny image of her mother, Chloe Tarrant Curry, and Chloe's husband, James Curry, both former slaves leaving Alabama.",
        "It was near train time.",
        "Chloe, a buxom, brown, comely woman of 25 and her tall, lean husband, Jim, were feverishly getting their bags and baskets together to go to Mississippi, a place where they were told money could be made easily and honestly.",
        "They were leaving their four children with their father - with her father.",
        "She promised when she settled in this rich country, she would buy a home for them.",
        "The distance they had to travel was about 250 miles.",
        "But to them, it seemed far, far away because it took days and they had never left a plantation in Alabama.",
        "So what did you learn from this research?",
        "And how long did it take you to write this book?",
        "The research took me three years and the writing maybe a year.",
        "I used to research late at night while working at the Village Voice or waiting for my writers to turn in their copy.",
        "And I stayed on the Internet a lot.",
        "And the research was like a black hole that sucked me in.",
        "I just got so fascinated with what happened to people during the Civil War.",
        "And so I kept going and going, and I really - I found out, I guess, first of all, that I knew nothing about my mother, and no one in my family knew anything about her.",
        "And it - that made it very hard.",
        "It's hard enough to find your ancestors who were slaves.",
        "But in a way, I didn't know where to begin other than with my grandmother, who I knew, but I did not know, for instance, that she - where she was from in Mississippi.",
        "So I would say I learned so much.",
        "I found 500 people I'm related to that I've never heard of.",
        "Wow.",
        "So it was quite an adventure.",
        "And Kym, you set out on a personal journey.",
        "I understand you were involved with an anti-racist group, trying to work out problems between the Italian and black community.",
        "So when did that activism turn into a search that you wanted to put on the page?",
        "I think that it was a convergence of the activism and coming to understand my own story and coming to peace with my own story.",
        "And once that convergence happened, then I felt like I needed to get the story out in public.",
        "And to really have this story of these two communities be an alternative to the news reports of the violence and the tension, something that was another kind of story.",
        "Can you read us a little bit?"

        "(Reading) I don't know where I was conceived, but I was made in Harlem.",
        "Its topography is mapped on my body: the borderlines between neighborhoods marked by streets that were forbidden to cross, the borderlines enforced by fear and anger, and transgressed by desire.",
        "The streets crossing east to west, north to south, like the web of veins beneath my skin.",
        "Now, when you are writing, you have this very lyrical style and we're really inside your head, how much - and this is a question I want to toss to everyone, but Kym first - how much do you have to know to do things like dialogue?",
        "Obviously, when you were a little kid, you weren't actually writing things down and you don't do a lot of sort of retrospective dialogue.",
        "But for things like that, how much of a leap of faith do you have to take in your own writing?",
        "I think the thing about dialogue in memoir is that it's really representative.",
        "And it can never be the exact words or the exact context, the exact moment that the words happened.",
        "And so it really is an act of imagination to think about the flavor of the words, the color of the words, and how those words hit the listener, how those words hit the writer at the time.",
        "So it's sort of the emotional resonance of the words for me.",
        "And that's why I didn't do a lot of lengthy dialogue.",
        "I did sentences here and there, or kind of snippets of dialogue almost like the way I remembered it.",
        "I remember kind of voices speaking certain things, and I wanted to get that kind of lyrical sense of memory.",
        "Thulani, let me move to you.",
        "How did you approach it?",
        "I felt a little nervous about it because, as a journalist, I thought I needed to be scrupulous by - about saying, I think this might have happened this way.",
        "And - but to release that voice in myself, particularly at the end when I'm trying to imagine how a woman who had spent the earliest part of her life - or the first 15, 20 years in slavery, how she would feel owning her own land and standing there free, I really had to just say, I see her this way, I imagined her this way, to release some of the texture that I experienced from being in Mississippi and what it looks like to look out on that cotton field, and what it's like to walk in the mud of - in between the rows of cotton, that kind of thing.",
        "So I had to sort of give myself permission.",
        "Dominic, we just have a little bit of time left.",
        "You are - and thank you for the compliment - a fabulous journalist.",
        "How did you approach that question?",
        "Well, for me, with the restraint of time that we have to deal with now, I tried not to deal with actual dialogue unless I knew it was factual.",
        "As a journalist, that was the top priority for me, that it had to be factual.",
        "The good news for me, in terms of a very bad, negative story in terms of my life, is I received, I would say, about 3,000 pages from mental institutions around the country on my mother.",
        "So that was able to help me piece everything together and make sure that it was factual.",
        "Well, I want to thank all you guys.",
        "And again, we've been speaking to Dominic Carter, author of \"\"No Momma's Boy: How I Let Go of My Past and Embraced the Future,\"\" coming from WAMC in Albany, New York, and also with Kym Ragusa, author of \"\"The Skin Between Us,\"\" and Thulani Davis, author of \"\"My Confederate Kinfolk\"\" from our NPR New York studios.",
        "Gambling is one of the world's oldest pastimes.",
        "Now author David Schwartz has a new book called Roll The Bones: The History of Gambling.",

        "Literally, they were bones.",
        "They were the anklebones of sheep and goats that were filed down and rolled originally by priests for stuff like fortune telling, and then eventually it crossed over and it was used for purely secular amusement.",
        "Really?",
        "You know, the book says that there's no way to really tell when gambling first began.",
        "So how early can you go back to identify when gambling existed?",
        "Well, they've done studies on some of the primates like monkeys and chimpanzees and found that they exhibit behaviors that are like gambling, where they will take a risk to try to get a bigger reward; so they'll take the risky option that might not get them anything, it might get them a lot, over the safe option.",
        "So it seems to go back at least that far.",
        "It seems in human societies, since it's pretty much everywhere like language, it seems to have been around from the dawn of humanity.",
        "The idea of casting lots, which you will find in the Bible, is a way of saying this decision is beyond human intelligence.",
        "Let's ask God.",
        "So we'll roll a die or cast lots, we'll draw things out of the basket or do something.",
        "So that idea kind of transcends just amusement.",
        "Now at one point that developed into cards, didn't it?",
        "Things like tarot cards, is that a sort of a form of gambling?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's really interesting because cards first developed in Asia, probably in Korea or China around the year 1000.",
        "They're just ceremonial and they are thrown and drawn for divination, and eventually they turned into playing cards.",
        "Now the tarot was a special deck of playing cards with a series of trumps or special cards that could beat other cards.",
        "About 300 years after the tarot deck was invented, a French man takes the stack and says you know what?",
        "This really isn't just a game.",
        "It's actually a secret form of Egyptian mysticism that was preserved thousands of years ago, which was complete nonsense because cards weren't invited until a millennia later in China.",
        "But people believed this and they started to believe that the tarot had some kind of mystical significance.",
        "And today it'd be hard to find people who would know that the tarot was originally just a game.",
        "Well, let's talk about the United States now.",
        "And in the book you talked about how the Indians sort of got their revenge, if I can put it that way, in terms of how gambling began and has now evolved to where Indian casinos are a major part of the gambling phenomenon.",
        "This is one of the ironies that I wanted to get into the book.",
        "And one of the major themes that I have in the book is that gambling can reverse things.",
        "I start the book with the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay marching through the Connecticut woods on their way to destroy the Pequot Indians.",
        "But 350 years later, I have Americans driving to Foxwoods, which is in Ledyard, Connecticut, which is the reconstituted Pequot reservation, to gamble their monies.",
