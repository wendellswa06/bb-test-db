        "That's true.",

        "And that's the story of Denmark Vesey and how the lottery played a role in his release as a slave.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is fascinating.",
        "This is something - most people know the story of Denmark Vesey, who led a slave rebellion in South Carolina in 1822.",
        "What they don't know is how he acquired his freedom.",
        "He was born in West Africa and he was owned by a sea captain.",
        "And in 1800, he won a lottery and he won $1,500 and he bought his freedom with that.",
        "And he started to build a very successful career and he got a lot of influence and became a local leader.",
        "And eventually of course he would have led the uprising but he was betrayed and executed.",
        "And it's stuff like this that got a lot of the authorities nervous, the fact that gambling and lotteries and that could really upset the social order.",
        "In a black community there has been historically a certain kind of gambling known as the numbers, and it was really a big thing in the, you know, ‘30s, ‘40s, ‘50s and such.",
        "And my question is do individual groups, individual communities, come up with their own forms of gambling like the numbers?",
        "The final version of the plan is far more solid, far more legally defensible than the draft was.",
        "Well, now that moment, I think stands - it was going to stand in political history.",
        "I think people will remember it for all time because, literally, George Allen was a shoo-in in a red state, and suddenly, George Allen has no political future.",
        "It is an amazing turnaround for a guy who, according to Washington insiders, was the pick to challenge John McCain for the nomination.",
        "Now, let's talk about the Democrats, the other side of the ledger here for the year, what were they up to?",
        "Well, I think that if you look at the - what goes on inside the Democratic Party, there was lots of anger over the failure of Democrats to properly challenge the president in the eyes, especially of the blogosphere, Noah.",
        "So you had people like Joe Lieberman, under lots of pressure in Connecticut.",
        "In fact, he was, you know, losing.",
        "He lost the Democratic primary in Connecticut.",
        "And so I would think that that whole challenge, and the fact that he was able to come back, and then win the general election as an independent, really, tells, the story of what happened inside the Democratic Party."

        "That was the driving issue.",
        "Democrats, Rahm Emmanuel, in particular, selected candidates who were strong on national defense issues who spoke out aggressively and were willing to challenge President Bush and the policies there.",
        "And according to exit polls, that really did determine the outcome of the election, particularly among swing voters.",
        "And we have former Senator John Edwards, a Democrat, announcing, first on his Web site, and then, in New Orleans later in the day - what does that look like?",
        "Well, you know, I think he's interesting because obviously, you've had Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in the Senate as the frontrunners on the Democratic side.",
        "John Edwards enters as kind of labor's candidate, and he enters with very populist themes.",
        "If you saw him yesterday, he was down in New Orleans, in the lower 9th ward, working with people.",
        "No big entourage, just John Edwards, shoveling, working, surrounded and saying that poverty is going to be his issue.",
        "So he, kind of, he's trying to, now, challenge both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton from a more populist left-leaning position.",

        "Thanks for having me, Neal.",
        "And interestingly, you found that many of these people hired to do this work end up disillusioned.",
        "They certainly do.",
        "When I did this study in 2003, we looked at canvassers all over the country in six different research sites, and we ended up studying 115 canvassers.",
        "And while many of them really enjoyed the experience initially, they ended burned off - burned out, excuse me, and turned off to politics in the long term.",
        "And turned off to politics, which is why they got into this in the first place.",
        "Exactly."

        "And then what happens is they come in the doors and whoever is directing or doing the training for them says, you know, we actually need you to work on X campaign.",

        "Is it harder to write about those kinds of deaths when you're speaking of possible suicide or overdoses?",

        "And after 10 years in this job, I am happy and relieved to say the answer is almost never because with rare exceptions, while there may be a sentence or two about the death in the obit, that is just the news peg, as we call it.",
        "And the other 98 percent of this long, rich, we hope well-written story is every inch about the life."
