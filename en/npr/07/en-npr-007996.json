        "Attorney General Morrisey says one thing that makes the new regulations illegal is that power plants already are subject to one section of the Clean Air Act.",
        "Now the EPA wants to regulate them under another section, too.",
        "And he says that's not allowed.",

        "This is a time when lotteries were banned in the United States.",
        "There weren't any lotteries.",
        "And it was a way for people to gamble with relatively little money and to have a good time and sometimes get a hit and make a little bit of money.",
        "There also has been an explosion, technologically speaking, with regard to how gambling takes place.",
        "We have hi-tech casinos, there's online gambling, there's all of these things now.",
        "What's been the impact of that on gambling and what do you see its impact being going forward?",
        "Well, this is something really interesting because one thing that I found doing research for the book was that every time you have a new technology, there's a new form of gambling.",
        "When you have - humans are working with stone and bone and things like that, they are using stones and bones and wood to make gambling devices.",
        "When humans start working with paper, they invent playing cards, and they use playing cards.",
        "When they invent the Internet, they use the Internet to gamble.",
        "So what I found is that no matter what kind of technology you invent, people are going to use it to gamble in some way.",
        "Is gambling - is that in human nature?",
        "Is it an innate thing that we do?",
        "Back when humans were hunting and gathering, they were hunters and gatherers, the ones who didn't take risks, who stayed in one place, would probably have died out.",
        "The ones who took risks and went around forging for food would live.",
        "So it seems to me that maybe this is something that's hardwired into the human brain.",
        "Today, most people, they don't have this opportunity for this kind of risky behavior, this gambling, so they do it with money.",
        "And maybe that's one of the challenges, is how do we adopt this innate human need which is within us and which a lot of people do to an age when you have credit cards and things like that.",
