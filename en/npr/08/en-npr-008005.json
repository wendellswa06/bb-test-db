        "Other scientists say the amount of damage depends on timing.",
        "Irving Mendelssohn, who studies coastal plant ecology at Louisiana State University, says a hurricane might even be beneficial if it occurs before oil has a chance to damage coastal marshes.",
        "It's very possible that the hurricane will tend to both dissipate and break up the oil faster and then, of course, move it over a larger area, more or less diluting it, so that the effect may be minimal.",
        "But Mendelssohn says there might be more damage if the hurricane arrived after oil had reached the coast.",
        "And then the hurricane results in greater erosion of the wetland because the wetland has already lost its vegetation and is already in a degraded state.",
        "Mendelssohn says marsh plants usually recover from a single encounter with oil, especially the less-toxic type involved in this spill.",
        "He says his greatest fear is that some combination of hurricanes, ocean currents and the ongoing spill will cover the same marsh plants with oil repeatedly.",
        "That type of re-oiling will completely kill the plant because all these underground reserves that are used to produce new plants will be used it, and then you can get complete death.",
