        "I would just add, Stephanie, that these are potential activists and they're, you know, many - most of them are young people, so they have this wonderful idealism, but it can be crushed quite easily.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I - maybe it's got me to rethink how I'm going to deal with canvassers that come to my door at a particularly irritating time of the day.",
        "I'm going to be really kind to them.",
        "And I won't tell them that I think it's, you know - to encourage their activism.",
        "But I'm not - I just have a general rule of not donating to canvassers.",

        "Well, from what I understand, and I should just mention here, the organization was extremely private about any monetary information.",
        "So what I - most of the information I have was reported to me from the canvassers and the canvas directors whom I interviewed.",
        "But from what I understand, if an organization is lucky, it sustains itself in terms of covering the canvas.",
        "The goal of the canvas is to create this mailing list, which is useful for increasing donations over time and also for potentially doing, quote, unquote, \"\"action alerts.\"\" But it's a list of people who are in specific congressional districts who might support, for example, health care reform, climate change, politics, those types of things.",
        "And sound, primarily, causes on the left.",
        "These are almost entirely causes on the left.",

        "Hi.",
        "I worked for Florida Public Interest Research Group, and we were canvassing against the sugar industry.",
        "And basically, it was six of us versus, like, the entire sugar industry of the state of Florida for a couple ballot initiatives.",
        "And, of course, we got squashed like a bug.",

        "They - instead of coming to work, they had vans in the same neighborhoods that we were in, canvassing for their side on these ballot initiatives.",
        "And we lost both the ballot initiatives and, you know, that was it for me with politics.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you were - there was a competitive situation, and you were outgunned?",
        "I mean, how can a few, you know, college kids being paid next to nothing compete against a huge industry like that?",

        "Yeah.",
        "I would just say that these kinds of stories exist all over the country.",
        "And unfortunately, Ron, yours is not unique to the experience you had in Florida.",
        "I mean, one of the problems here is that there is - there's a lot of difficulty for general American citizens to get involved in the policymaking process because of the way interests tend to express their influence in Washington, as well as in states and localities.",
        "And so what ends up happening is these public interest groups try to get general citizens involved, and the people who are most willing to get involved are young people, which is wonderful.",
        "But the question is how to get them involved in a meaningful way that doesn't exploit them and that doesn't burn them out and turn them off.",

        "For example, there's a campaign that's trying to put the issue of gerrymandering on the ballot as a constitutional amendment.",
        "I asked the person what they knew about what they are trying to end.",
        "And I received an explanation that was the equivalent to government is doing bad stuff.",

        "Well, actually, the way it worked with us, I was with Iowa Citizen Action Network.",
        "And since we canvassed every night and we were professional doorknockers and professional fundraisers - candidates, and while we were technically nonpartisan, certainly our politics leaned left, so mostly it was from the Democratic Party would hire us to help them do their campaigns.",
        "So they would actually - when every four years would come around or every two years, or oftentimes, it was with more local state elections - they would ask us if we'd endorse them and then we would - along, we've incorporate endorsing them with whatever issues we were fundraising for our own cause.",
