        "And for the deans that's almost overwhelming sometimes.",
        "Yes.",
        "And people will not see things they don't want to see.",

        "And Rick Shaw, too, has labored over that letter to make it, you know, as gentle as possible so students aren't despairing when they get it.",
        "But it's a really hard balancing act for these admissions folks to handle.",
        "What got you interested?",

        "And the month of April is a very tender time and when those rejections come in by cell phone, when the kids are at school and they're in despair, or when the letters arrive in the mail and you speak to the parents who are just despairing, it's hard to miss.",
        "The college admission game has become such a consuming topic for so many millions of families now, that it's pretty hard to miss it.",
        "And a lot of kids are applying to a lot more colleges than you or I may have.",

        "So from that point I realized that, you know, this could be a dream for me and this is something that I want to aspire to.",
        "But I chose Florida State because it was a school that definitely makes great football, playing for Coach Bobby Brown, the winningest coach in college football, and the opportunity to graduate in three years and have a pre-med program, to apply for the Rhodes scholarship and enjoy good Florida weather, you know?",
        "I'm from New Jersey, so it's a little different weather down here in Tallahassee, but it's fun and I really did enjoy my decision and, you know, I don't regret it to this day."
