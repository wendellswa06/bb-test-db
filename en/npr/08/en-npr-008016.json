        "As early as 1933, he gets up in the House of Commons and says the key fact is that Germany is rearming.",
        "He was telling an ugly truth that people didn't want to hear and especially his own party, which had settled on a policy of appeasement.",
        "We think we can contain Germany, and we don't have enough military strength to confront them.",
        "And let's just remind people the 1930s is when Hitler has risen to power in Germany.",

        "But he said, we're going to bring Germany back, and we're going to take over larger and larger parts of Europe.",
        "And throughout the 1930s, Churchill's getting up and calling attention to that.",
        "And for that, he is cast into the political wilderness.",
        "He is not allowed into the cabinet, even though he's a prominent member.",

        "I saw troops who had fought bravely denounced as cowards and traitors and others who had never seen a shot fired hailed as the heroes of imaginary victories.",

        "It always has happened in politics.",

        "What price did they pay for that?",
        "You mentioned that Churchill was kept out of the government for years.",
        "Churchill was kept out of the government for years to the point that it was almost too late.",
        "I mean, we now retrospectively know, of course, Churchill becomes prime minister and leads his country to victory.",
        "World War II started off very badly and they finally needed a new leader, and they picked Churchill."
