        "And the interesting thing is that right now the fingers are being pointed at Iran for supplying some of the know-how and technology for the EFP.",
        "And basically an EFP is a more sophisticated version of the IED.",
        "Originally what we saw at the beginning of the war, you would just have a couple of mortar shells and maybe an artillery shell that was plugged into a detonator; it would usually be hard-wired, and then a person would command-detonate it from a remote point and an observer would basically see a vehicle go by.",
        "Then the technology of the IED started to get more and more sophisticated.",
        "As Americans up-armored their vehicles, the explosive charges got bigger.",
        "As they learned to detect these hard-wired IEDs, they went to remote-control IEDs that would be set off, for instance, by a cell-phone signal, a pager, even a garage-door opener.",
        "So the United States military introduced jammers, for instance.",
        "So things went full circle.",
        "Then the insurgents got more sophisticated in the tactics, the way that they laid these devices.",
        "So the EFP basically is a way of defeating the armor that the U.S.",
        "military has been installing on its vehicles.",
        "And as I understand it, the charges are that these caused the deaths of more than 170 Americans over three years, so these aren't new.",
        "Again as I've mentioned, I had first heard about these in 2005.",
        "And there was a series of reports last summer in the British press where the U.K.",
        "government has basically been charging that the Iranians were responsible also for EFP attacks, which had claimed about 17 - the lives of about 17 British troops in southern Iraq and Basra.",
        "What we hadn't seen was actually the displays of these EFPs and displays of some other associated equipment - RPG rounds and various kinds of mortar rounds - that the officials say look at these markings, they trace back to Iran.",
        "Well, this was sort of the first proof that they had actually furnished - that this actually, this technology, this hardware, was coming from Iran, and there was a lot of back-and-forth.",
        "It took several weeks, in fact, before they actually were able to settle on a time.",
        "And they called in a lot of press and they showed them.",
        "Now all of this was sort of I think on background.",
        "They didn't actually - none of the officials were actually named.",
        "So that has given a little bit more ammunition to the skeptics who say that perhaps that there's some kind of cooking of intelligence going on here, that they are trying to make the case for - well, I think the fear is that there may be someone trying to make the case for more aggressive policy towards Iran.",
        "And when he got into the room with the intelligence chief, he pretended to call these intelligence, these Yemeni members and in fact exploded a device that was hidden inside his body and blew himself apart."
