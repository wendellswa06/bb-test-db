        "He's going to have to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling three times between now and election day, and that's not good enough?",
        "And put the onus on the Democrats too, who would have to vote for this because the Republicans could just sit back and say, well, the Democrats are responsible for - but you know what happened?",
