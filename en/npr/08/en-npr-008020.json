        "And a lot of people in the Republican Party, including a lot of the presidential candidates, Ken, say what's the big scare about not raising the debt ceiling?",
        "Maybe Tim Geithner says - the secretary of the Treasury - says it's going to be terrible things, but the sun will come up tomorrow.",
        "Well, that's - Michele Bachmann is one of those people who said that just the other day, when President Obama said, well, maybe the Social Security checks may not be sent out.",
        "Maybe there will be some delay in that.",
        "She said that's nonsense, and if we don't have the money to pay for it with all the revenue we're taking in, then somebody is not telling the truth in Washington.",
