        "And today, the Associated Press quoted a French official as saying one of those bombs was 17 minutes away from explosion.",
        "Have you been able to confirm that?",
        "Well, actually, it looks like that report was a false alarm.",
        "The French interior minister had announced this morning, at a press conference, that there was this 17-minute gap before it was going to explode, but so far, there have been nothing but a series of denials from just about anybody who has anything to do with the plot - from law enforcement officials I've talked to, to the U.K., to Dubai and even the White House today.",
        "Well, what do we know about the triggering mechanism of these devices?",
        "Well, you know, we don't know an awful lot.",
        "We do know that there was some sort of cell phone detonation device, but my understanding is that the two different packages had two different detonating devices.",
        "They were both filled with PETN, but which is this explosive that's related to nitroglycerin.",
        "But the packages were a little bit different from each other.",
        "This is what they're trying to get to the bottom of, and I think they've been very careful about what they've released in terms of information until they feel they have their arms around the entire plot.",
        "And also different amounts of PETN packed into the well, packed into printers.",
        "Well, actually, it was quite ingenious.",
        "It's a this PETN, almost a pound of it, was packed into the toner cartridge inside a Hewlett-Packard computer printer.",
        "And if you've ever tried to change one of those toner cartridges, you know that there's black dust that gets all over your hands any time you do it.",
        "In this case, it was white dust, and that white dust was PETN, this explosive.",
        "And it was rigged up with a circuit board underneath it that had some sort of triggering device, probably the alarm on a cell phone, and that was supposed to make it ignite.",
        "Is the belief that these were intended to explode while aboard aircraft in the air, or were they intended to explode after they were delivered to an address in Chicago?",
        "Well, the addresses in Chicago that we've heard so much about, that were supposed to be Jewish synagogues or Jewish community associations -in fact, what they were, were obsolete addresses.",
        "So the packages never would have gotten to where, theoretically, they were supposed to go."

        "They were also addressed, rather ironically, to historical characters from the Spanish Inquisition and from the Crusades.",
        "So the packages were not supposed to get to a particular place, I don't think.",
        "And by virtue of elimination, I think that now, authorities have decided that the packages were probably supposed to explode some time in midair, as they were winging their way to Chicago.",

        "According to what we heard from that briefing yesterday, the highest levels in Iran.",
        "That would mean either the president, Mr. Ahmadinejad, or the religious clergy who are really in charge of Iran.",
        "And were there any evidence for that?",
        "Well interestingly enough, there have been a couple of reports, some interviews with President Ahmadinejad where he's been asked directly about whether or not Iran was supplying any weapons that were killing American soldiers, and he sort of danced around the question a little bit.",
        "So again, there's not been sort of a very direct answer from Iran about that.",
        "The Foreign Ministry spokesman was a little bit more open about…",
        "He was a little bit…",
        "But the president himself was not.",
