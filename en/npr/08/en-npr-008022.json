        "Now even if Iran was supplying, to take it for just a moment that this is accurate, that Iran was supplying - who were they supplying them to, and how did they end up getting used against American troops?",
        "Well, the allegation is that these kinds of sophisticated weapons are being supplied to the Mahdi Army, to Sadr's militia, to Shia militia groups.",
        "And this is coming also at a very interesting time when there's a U.S.",
        "surge.",
        "There's kind of questions about whether or not some of the surge is going to be aimed at a crackdown against these Shiite militia groups.",
        "Now what reasons were given for why the Iranian government would want to supply these groups with these sophisticated weapons?",
        "What reasons were given?",
        "Well, I think that this is again what's kind of raised the questions about the timing of all of this because, you know, the allegation is that these militias basically are clients of the Iranian government and that they are being used in some kind of proxy campaign against the United States.",
        "There were also some documents that were shown to reporters, or at least copies of them shown to reporters.",
        "These were the documents allegedly seized by U.S.",
        "forces in a couple of different raids, one on the headquarters of one of these militia groups in Baghdad, the SCIRI group, and another when an Iranian consulate, which apparently wasn't quite a consulate yet, didn't quite have diplomatic status, was raided and five Iranians arrested.",
        "Right, and then there was a recent interview with Defense Secretary Robert Gates where he said that they had \"\"policed-up,\"\" quote-unquote, some Iranians among the bad guys that they have rounded up in some of these raids.",
        "So it's not just a question of documents, (unintelligible) they're claiming to have actually arrested or detained some of the people who - the personnel who are actually involved in either the arming, the training, smuggling of these weapons materiel.",
        "One thing.",
        "What's been the reaction of the Iraqi government, and are they seemingly convinced that this is evidence against Iran?",
        "That's actually a really good question.",
        "I haven't seen a response from the Iraqi government.",
        "But it's important to point out that the Iraqi and the Iranian government, they do have relations.",
        "They've had them since 2003, the fall of Saddam Hussein.",
        "So this is a very delicate balancing act on the region.",
        "Let's get some callers in on the phone.",

        "troops are racing to Baghdad, they were bypassing these very large conventional arms caches, artillery shells, mortar shells, rockets, everything.",
        "They just didn't have the manpower to police all that stuff up, to guard it.",
