        "Well, I think Khalid's point about the skepticism is likely to arise from these charges, as to whether they're not just a prelude to military action, is one that the administration has to deal with.",
        "And that's why I think in fact the way they released this information really undercut their case: Unnamed defense official in Baghdad, of all places, making charges about senior national leadership of Iran.",
        "You know, those are very, very serious charges.",
        "And if they're going to made, I would have expected them to come in Washington.",
        "In fact, if asked, I would have urged the administration to in fact empower a group of graybeards outside to examine the evidence and to report to the director of national intelligence and make it available there.",
        "We simply have to recognize much of the world, and even a significant part of our own population, is very skeptical of claims about what intelligence shows after WMD.",
        "And those charges were far too serious to just be, with non-attribution, be released on the weekend.",
        "And about Khalid's other point, different treatments of Iran and North Korea.",
        "Well, in fact, the United States is involved in multi-lateral talks with them both.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "I was wondering if these new EFPs are the same old armaments as the shaped charges that were being used for years.",
        "That is have them being machined in Iraq to melt an alloy and direct the projectile as an armor piercing projectile.",
        "I think giving it a new name of EFPs, are these the same?",
        "They're in both - well, they're certainly involved in multi-lateral talks with the North Koreans directly in Beijing right now.",
        "The talks with Iran have been less direct, mostly in Vienna at the International Atomic Energy Agency and not as direct as a lot of us think they should be.",
        "The difference right now is we're involved on the ground in Iraq, right next door to Iran.",
        "And so this issue, you know, has a seriousness.",
        "There are hundreds - soon-to-be almost 160,000 Americans on the ground, so we should be concerned.",
        "But the way it's been handled certainly does lead to some justified skepticism about it."

        "Is there any specifics as to whether this could have been equipment, which could have been sent from Iran to the Shia revolutionaries or counter-Saddamists.",
        "I can't figure out the word right now, from the Iran-Iraq war.",
        "And another question I would have with regards to that is why would the administration, knowing that it is already overstretched in troop numbers and that it's pretty much (unintelligible) down in Iraq and can't get out, why would the administration - what was the point of releasing such information that could be damning to Iran and could possibly result in another military action against it?",
        "David Kay, is there a suggestion that these - some of this weaponry might be left over from Iran-Iraq or from earlier uprising against Saddam?",
        "Well, you have to realize I'm relying on the accuracy of the reporting that came out under the difficult conditions that existed in Baghdad.",
        "The serial numbers and data manufacturers that were cited, I think the earliest was around 2005; one was 2006.",
        "So these looked like they were, in fact, more recently produced.",
        "But the listener has a good point.",
        "For example, the first EFP was actually in 2003.",
        "It was used against an Abrams tank, in fact took an Abrams tank out.",
        "Everyone, I was in Baghdad at that time, everyone was greatly concerned.",
        "It turned out to be Czech-produced RPG that Saddam had acquired.",
        "The administration spokesman yesterday I think made a little bit too much about how these are exotic weapons.",
        "EFPs are in the armory of the Syrians, they're certainly in the armory of the Iranians.",
        "The Chinese have produced a lot."
