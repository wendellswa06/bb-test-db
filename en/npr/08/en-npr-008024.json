        "And quickly, what David Kaye said was the important point in this, is the allegation that this has been authorized from the highest levels in Iran, which makes this more significant than just some rogue faction smuggling some arms across.",
        "Well, there's no question.",
        "And I don't know if there is linkage to the - it's always been hard, by the way, to link terrorism or other activities to the senior leadership.",
        "You know, can you link Hezbollah activity in Syria or earlier to the Iranians?",
        "Well, yes, you can link it to the Iranians.",
        "Can you link it to the leadership telling them to do it?",
        "These are very tough things we're dealing with.",
        "We're not dealing with kind of written instructions that you can kind of find and then reveal.",
        "This is a much more subtle kind of - set of relationships.",

        "And it's good to speak with you again, professor.",
        "It's good to be here, Neal.",
        "And let's begin with a question I asked our two previous guests.",
        "What do you make of the evidence that was presented yesterday in Baghdad?",
        "Well, I think that the evidence if quite vague.",
        "As David Kaye pointed out, they provided virtually no evidence that there was a master plan here on the part of the Iranian leadership to do anything in particular in Iraq.",
        "So there's all sorts of reasons to be skeptical of that argument.",
        "With regard to the question of whether or not these weapons are Iranian weapons or not, I think it is quite clear from the evidence, at least from the reports in the newspapers about the evidence, that some of the weapons are Iranian weapons.",
        "And by the way, there were not only EFPs or these shape charges that were displayed, they also displayed mortars and rocket-propelled grenades."

        "There were a handful of different kinds of weapons that the Iranians are said to be giving to the Iraqis.",
        "But this raises all sorts of questions.",
        "Who in Iran is providing the Iraqis with these weapons.",
        "And if they are providing Iraq with these weapons, why are they providing them with the weapons?",
        "Many people say that they're aimed at American troops.",
        "That's certainly plausible.",
        "But it's also possible that the Iranians are arming particular Iraqi groups because they want to see them win the civil war that's now taking place and is almost sure to blossom should the United States pull out at some point in time.",
        "So there are just all sorts of questions that are left open by these briefings.",
        "And if indeed they were used against American troops, it's not necessarily true.",
        "I mean once weapons enter a new country, they can find their way to all sorts of end users that maybe the original source didn't intend.",
        "Well, the design for Lockerby was that it would explode over the mid-Atlantic, and nobody would ever know where the device came from.",
        "There would be no traces left.",
        "So Lockerby obviously did explode over a Scottish village.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I mean you could have rogue factions on both sides of the borders here.",
        "You could have a rogue faction in Iran that's providing different groups in Iraq with those weapons and then rogue factions inside Iraq could be selling the weapons to other groups who could be using them.",
        "I'm not saying that this is likely, but it is plausible.",
        "And the fact is that based on what we now know, we just don't have enough evidence to conclude one way or the other what exactly is going on here.",
        "And given the gravity of the charges that are being leveled at Iran, this is a cause of great concern.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I want to say first off that I'm really - I have been for months very scared about the administration's - what I call build-up to this sort of thing with Iran.",
        "I feel like - that they are, they have some greater scheme, which is far beyond my comprehension, from Somalia through the Persian Gulf, Pakistan, into the broader reaches.",
        "Gates says that there is no intention, the administration has no intention of invading or any sort of confrontation with Iran.",
        "But intention means nothing until they're provoked and then they - and then they have some sort of reason.",
        "And the question being, is this a part of that provocation or if not the entirety of a provocation, at least…",
        "Well, the question…",
        "…part of a case, is what you're saying.",

        "Our guest is John Mearsheimer, professor of political science and co-director to the program on international security policy at the University of Chicago.",
        "And just before the break, Professor Mearsheimer, our caller from Taos, New Mexico was expressing doubt about this, as part of what she feared was an overall campaign to build up pressure on Iran, a campaign that she sees progressing throughout the region.",
        "Well, there's no question that there are lots of people in the country, including inside the Beltway, who believe that the Bush administration is laying the groundwork for an attack on Iran.",
        "It would not be a land-based invasion.",
        "What it would be - be an air attack against the nuclear facilities in Iran, especially the places where enrichment of uranium is taking place.",
        "It would be foolish in the extreme, I believe, and I think most Americans believe, for the United States to attack those Iranian nuclear facilities.",
        "But nevertheless it is possible that that is what the Bush administration is thinking.",
        "Now, there's no question that Secretary Gates denies that.",
        "But as you know, before the Iraq War on numerous occasions high-level officials in the Bush administration denied that they were planning to go to war against Iraq.",
        "But nevertheless, we now know from all sorts of books by people like Bob Woodward and others that the Bush administration indeed was planning to go to war against Iraq.",
        "So when they say they're not planning for a war against Iran at this point in time, it's hard to be confident that they're telling the truth, given that they haven't always told us the truth in the past.",
        "And it should be noted that as this announcement was being made in Baghdad, a second U.S.",
        "Navy aircraft carrier battle group arrived in the region, the Stennis Battle Group ordered there by President Bush, openly…",
        "And they're talking about sending a third one, Neal."

        "So I mean what more do we need?",

        "Yeah.",
        "That's what I'd say, Neal.",
        "There's no question that the United States and Iran have been adversaries since 1979, and indeed they've been bitter adversaries.",
        "In fact, we were closely allied with Saddam Hussein between 1980 and 1988 because he was fighting a war against Iran.",
        "But the issue on the table here is whether or not Iran is contributing in meaningful ways the problems that we're facing in Iraq.",
        "What happened with Hezbollah in the 1980s is largely irrelevant here.",
        "And Bob says that we've seen this evidence for quite a while now, or for a long time, to quote him, about Iran's activities in Iraq, I think is wrong.",
        "And there's some issues with that, too...",
        "And in fact, earlier this month, I think it was on February 2nd, the national security advisor, Steve Hadley, said that the administration was taking a briefing that they were prepared to give to the public and sending it back to the briefers and telling them to clean it up and get the facts straight.",
        "Because what he saw overstated the case."
