        "Well, I think that he's surely correct that the intelligence community is going to be more careful this time around and more likely to get things correct, but I actually don't believe the intelligence community was the problem in the run-up to the war in Iraq.",
        "I believe that the White House and the Pentagon were the principal threat inflators in the run-up to that war.",
        "And here, in this particular case, I see the White House, especially Vice President Cheney, and the Pentagon, again in the forefront of making the case that Iran is causing us very serious problems in Iraq.",

        "Very accurate and can operate regardless of the weather and by punching coordinates this bomb can go right to the target.",
