        "So there were clothes and Yemeni trinkets, and things like that.",
        "So the box itself was supposed to not arouse any suspicion.",
        "I mean, to go back to this Lockerby point that you just made, Lockerby was supposed to go down over the Atlantic Ocean, but what now is seen by terrorist organizations is, if it goes down over the Atlantic Ocean, then nobody gets any footage, you know, film footage.",
        "It doesn't make the news in a way that's very dramatic.",
        "And part of the goal in a terrorist attack is to have dramatic news coverage of it, so everyone sees it.",
        "So having a plane disappear over the ocean now is sort of an outdated mode of a terrorist attack.",
        "They very much want it where everyone can see it.",
        "Was there a return address on these packages?",
        "There was, and the return address on the packages was that of a student who is an engineering student in Sana'a, which is the capital of Yemen, went to university there.",
        "But it appears that her ID was stolen, and actually, her address and all her information was stolen, as well.",
        "Because when they brought her in for questioning, they had the man who had actually taken the packages in try to identify her, and he said that she was a different woman than the one who had dropped off the packages.",
        "So a woman dropped of the packages, though?"

        "That was sort of badly reported by some news organizations, and they said that he had actually provided the tracking numbers of these packages.",
        "And he would have left Yemen too early to have the tracking number of these packages.",

        "The bombs are completely different.",

        "Connected in the sense that they were actually constructed the same way.",
        "The man who was going to try and blow up the airliner over Detroit actually had to inject a particular chemical accelerant into the into his underwear, where this PETN was, to try and blow up the plane.",
        "And what happened was it caught fire, but it didn't quite ignite the PETN.",
        "He was carrying about 80 grams of PETN, and that would have blown a hole into the side of the fuselage.",
        "In this case, they had over a pound of that in these toners, and there was actually a syringe that was sort of set up in such a way, with the same chemical that they think the Detroit airliner bomber had.",

        "Well, I can't be absolutely positive about that, but I can tell you that when it comes to this group in Yemen, al-Qaida's arm in Yemen, AQAP, the Saudis are on them like white on rice because for a long time, their main target was the Saudi monarchy.",
        "And about this time last year, they had actually launched an attack in which they had sent one of their members to meet with the Saudi intelligence chief.",
        "And he theoretically was supposed to be negotiating a giant sort of surrender of a bunch of AQAP members.",
        "Ever since that happened, I think that focused minds of Saudi intelligence in a whole new way, and my understanding from my sources is that the Saudis can hear quite a bit of what's going on with AQAP, and they are following and tracking that group very, very closely, and they're sharing that information with the U.S.",
        "I mean, I thought it was very interesting as a general matter when intelligence tips are shard.",
        "We as reporters don't generally hear who shared it, and in this case, the White House actually put out a press release to say that the Saudis had shared this information.",
        "And is this group, AQAP, believed to be based in Saudi, in Yemen or in both places?",
        "Well, the way AQAP actually started as an entity was in January of 2009, two groups came together.",
        "There was a small group of al-Qaida fighters who were in Yemen, and then there was an even smaller group in Saudi Arabia.",
        "And the problem was that Saudi Arabia was focused so much on al-Qaida it had driven these guys out.",
