        "At the time that the USS there were two of the individuals who escaped who had been involved in the USS Cole attack.",
        "But there was a split after this prison break, where the older generation cut a series of deals with the Yemeni government, where they came to sort of a tacit nonaggression pact, if you will, whereby they would agree not to carry out any attacks within Yemen if the Yemeni government didn't go after them.",
        "But a younger group of fighters, people who'd come back, who'd been in Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden, said that they really couldn't be making deals with what they called tyrants, in a reference to the Yemeni government, and so they essentially went on the warpath.",
        "And Tyrants, is that an accurate description of the Yemeni government?",
        "Well, the Yemeni government right now is in a really difficult situation.",
        "We all know about the threat from al-Qaida, but it's also battling an on-again-off-again war up in the a civil war up in the north.",
        "And there's increasingly violent calls for secession in the south.",
        "So you have those three security challenges, and then you have a state which is really just being hamstrung with massive amounts of poverty.",
        "Almost half of the population lives below the poverty line.",
        "The government's incredibly dependent upon oil revenue, and the oil wells, along with the water wells, are dropping at an alarming rate, which means that the government has no money.",
        "And for a country that's heavily dependent upon subsistence agriculture, people are moving away from that and into the cities, which is really exacerbating the unemployment problem.",
        "Are the militants of AQAP Yemenis or Saudis or who?",
        "Yeah, they're as Dina said earlier, they're a mixture of both.",
        "The leader of the organization is a man named Naser al-Wuhayshi, and he actually spent four years in Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden.",
        "He got separated from bin Laden in the Battle of Tora Bora, and he was really an apprentice, almost an understudy to Osama bin Laden.",
        "So what he's done since he got out of prison in this prison break is he's used this blueprint that Osama bin Laden had in Afghanistan in the late 1990s, and he's used that as a template to built a parallel al-Qaida organization in Yemen.",
        "And he's recruited a number of Yemenis, and there have of course been the Saudis and people from around the world, including Americans and Southeast Asians, who have now joined the group as it's had what in the terrorist world goes by successes."

        "Dina Temple-Raston, one of those Americans that Gregory Johnsen just mentioned, Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who left Virginia to return to Yemen and has been associated with a number of attacks against the United States.",

        "... good and bad on both sides.",
        "And that is the opening story, which I don't even know if I can stay the title on the air because it's a bad word in Spanish.",
        "In addition to him, we also believe that there's a young North Carolina man named Samir Kahn, who born in America and an American who left this time last year to go to Yemen theoretically to learn Arabic and then disappeared off the grid and about six months later, he came out or a magazine for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula came out called Inspire magazine, and that magazine had a lot of articles that were very similar to articles that Samir Kahn had written for a pro-al-Qaida blog he was producing here in the United States.",
        "The concern is that there are more Americans than that.",
        "And I think the other concern is that a lot of people who are members of AQAP are former Guantanamo detainees.",
        "So they have a real focus on the United States that's different than some of these other groups.",

        "Other nations provide resources to fight the terrorist groups.",
        "And so I'm wondering if economic factors aside from the ideological political ones we typically associate with al-Qaida are to what extent those drive the terrorism.",
        "Gregory Johnsen?",
        "Yeah, I think that's an excellent question.",
        "And in fact, if you go back to right after September 11, the U.S.",

        "And I'll give you an example to illustrate what I'm talking about and the situation that Yemen finds itself in.",
        "Two years after that, in November, 2005, President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of Yemen, took a state visit to Washington.",
        "He paid a visit to then-President Bush."

        "He had helped the Americans, al-Qaida was no longer an issue in his country, but this was in the midst, if you'll remember, of then-President Bush's attempts to sort of remake the Middle East, democratize the Middle East, and instead of viewing President Saleh as an ally in the war on terror, he was now being seen as someone who was a problem on democracy.",
        "So instead of rewarding him, they actually slashed aid.",

        "He met with Condoleezza Rice.",

        "The next day, he went to the World Bank, and they told him they were cutting aid to Yemen, as well.",
        "And the message that he took home, on his flight home, he fired all his economic advisors.",
        "And one of the individuals who was on the plane told me that the message that really stood out to President Saleh was that without an al-Qaida problem in Yemen, Yemen was just one more poor country in a world of beggars.",

        "I'm sorry, did you have something else?",
        "Well, then, that makes it seems like that presents some real problems about how to address the problem for nations like ours because it seems like then, there are incentives on both the government and the terrorist side to maintain the status quo.",

        "Yeah, the U.S.",
        "has a real problem in working against muscle memory and how it's distributed aid over the past 10 to 20 years and particularly in convincing countries like Yemen that getting better and getting rid of an al-Qaida threat is actually in its economic interests because the way that the U.S.",
        "has distributed aid has suggested that that is in fact not the case.",
        "And if I could add in here, I mean, Yemen is also getting it from both sides because AQAP just this week had bombed one of its oil pipelines that had belonged to I think a Korean oil company in response to this onslaught in the area where this AQAP is supposed to be.",
        "So you can't win for losing in the sense that al-Qaida's targeting him as much as the U.S.",
