        "The system for the U.S.",
        "was blinking red at the time.",
        "This is an approach that's been talked about and been called the surgical-strike approach.",

        "It may have killed a couple of militants, but unfortunately the vast amount of causalities were women and children in a village in south Yemen - in the village of Maajala.",
        "And this has been something that al-Qaeda has went back to over and over again over the past several months, saying America is attacking Yemen just like in Iraq, just like in Afghanistan.",

        "And not only is the U.S.",

        "has missed on more than one occasion - there was also an instance in the spring of this year where the U.S.",
        "killed a Yemeni government official instead of the al-Qaeda operative that it was targeting.",
        "So when the U.S.",
        "misses, these surgical strikes have a way of backfiring, and it's something that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been able to use to its advantage in recruiting more and more people.",
        "Yet - is the alternative to do nothing?",
        "Well, the U.S.",
        "certainly can't do nothing, but I think that there's a way that the U.S.",
        "can intervene and prop up the Yemeni security forces and put a Yemeni face on this.",
        "Because we have to remember, the U.S.",
        "has been down this road before.",
        "It's militarily defeated al-Qaeda in Yemen once and the organization came back.",

        "Is this a case of making the enemy seem 10 feet tall?",
        "Is this a relatively powerless organization?",
        "I wouldn't say powerless.",
        "I mean, it's sort of depends where you think power lies.",
        "If you think an organization that's able to attack the United States and come pretty close to getting a couple of plots or at least bombs on airplanes, I mean that's meaningful.",
        "I don't think anybody thinks that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is 10 feet tall, but they do think that they're a menace.",
        "And what the caller said is true, and I think that there are a lot of Muslims who feel this way, that what groups like al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and other al-Qaeda affiliates are doing actually erodes the Muslim cause, and it does.",
        "But unfortunately if you go out and kill innocents or try to kill innocents, you're going to get a lot of media attention.",

        "Even San Francisco.",
        "You know, you have to put value to things who are making a bigger, far bigger deal from these filthy losers, groups.",
        "Ayad, I think we also have to point out that there is enormous amount of attention when an engine on an airliner blew up in - off of Australia - a Qantas airliner.",
        "Today people pay attention when airliners are at risk, and this has just been something that's historically always been paid a great deal of attention to, perhaps, as you suggest, exaggerated.",
        "But I wanted to ask Gregory Johnsen about one of your other points.",
        "If indeed al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is counterproductive, do the tribes and the people in Yemen feel that way about them?",
        "Right.",
        "I think Ayad makes a great point here, and this is a real problem that we have in Yemen, is that no one is really articulating and making the argument that he just made in any Yemeni context, in Arabic to the individuals in Yemen, showing how al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is actually bad for them.",
        "If you look at U.S.",
        "public diplomacy in Yemen - and it pains me to say this - but it really is a joke.",
        "I mean, the U.S.",
        "diplomats are really limited to a drive from a fortified housing compound in (unintelligible) to the fortified embassy across town.",

        "So we just - until that takes place, when the U.S.",
        "is completely dependent upon military options, then we're just going to have this repetitive cycle.",
        "And we need to be making the exact argument that Ayad made to the Yemeni people, but we just haven't found a way to articulate that yet.",
        "You would think the government would make that case.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You would hope so.",

        "So, for instance, if you're in Southern California, the eggs might be branded under Albertsons or Ralphs.",
        "So for consumers looking to protect themselves against salmonella and wonder if their eggs, sitting in their refrigerator, are indeed potentially contaminated, they need to look at these little numbers on the side of the carton, called Julian dates.",
