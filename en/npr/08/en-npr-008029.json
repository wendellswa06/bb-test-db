        "Of course many nursing homes are well-run facilities where dedicated staff take great care of patients, but even the best are institutions, hospital-style facilities where patients rise, eat, sleep and take medication on a rigid schedule.",
        "Now an effort called the Green House Project provides much smaller and more flexible facilities where residents feel less like they're in an institution and more like they're at home.",

        "What does it mean for people, for one thing, to be called elders instead of patients?",
        "Well, you know, you kind of put your finger on it when you talked about the hospitallike nature of many nursing homes.",
        "And the Green House is an attempt to kind of build a new vision of long-term care or a new approach to long-term care that's really based on the idea of the virtue and the value that you can find in people, older people, and the honor we give them by calling them elders rather than residents is one way of just making that honor known to others.",

        "Well, actually, they're working great.",
        "And one of the reasons, kind of, we're here talking with you now and why we're out kind of getting the word out about Green House is we took two years to study those first Green Houses very carefully in Tupelo, Mississippi.",
        "And I can tell you that our research shows that the people who live there get good quality care, they have a better quality of life, the staff is more satisfied, and we did it on a budget-neutral basis.",
        "In other words, people can get this kind of small community residence rather than a big institution and it doesn't cost any more money.",
        "Describe for us what a day at a Green House institution--a Green House home, excuse me--what that might be like for an elder?",
        "Well, actually, a quick way to do it would be sort of to start at midnight.",
        "And at midnight, you're sleeping.",
        "And the reason you're sleeping is because you're not sharing your room with a stranger who's making all kinds of noise at night because in the Green House, every elder gets their own room and their own bathroom.",
        "And after hopefully a good night's rest, you get up in the morning when you wish.",
        "And instead of having to meet the kind of panicked food schedule routine of trying to get breakfast on the table for 160 people at once, the people in the Green House will make you breakfast whenever you choose to get up.",
        "And I think that's really important.",
        "And then as the day goes on, you have an opportunity to participate in kind of the community life of this Green House, kind of participate in the preparation of the food or the doing of the laundry or visiting with friends, sitting outside--whatever it is you would like.",

        "Yosi Landau, the medical volunteer, says he worries today's attack signals a new surge in violence after a relative lull, a return to the days during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, when suicide bombings were regular occurrences.",
        "It's not heading back, hopefully it's not coming back as it was two years ago, but, as we know, they promised and they're going to do it.",
        "Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, offered condolences to the victims' families and said the government is weighing its reaction.",
