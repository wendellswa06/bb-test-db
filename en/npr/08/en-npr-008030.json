        "No one really had inspection responsibilities, checking for salmonella, up until that July 9th date.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Basic things, nothing - you know, the companies, obviously, are pushing back.",
        "But things like making sure that the young chicks or hens that are purchased - you know, that those companies check for salmonella, that the farm itself or the manufacturing facility itself is checked for salmonella, that the feed is also free of salmonella - that there are sort of sanitary guidelines and that, there are, you know, precautions or checks every two weeks.",
        "Up until now, those have not been implemented.",
        "One source told me that he compared the regulations to, you know, sort of the speed limit on a highway - that up until now, you know, the only way you were caught or if it was identified were if people got sick or if you are caught.",
        "And now, starting July 9th, the FDA has far broader inspection capabilities.",

        "Yeah.",

        "But yeah, I mean, if - you know, especially if you're buying local and if you trust the farmers and their methods and, you know, them keeping everything up to date and that the standard was sanitary and other type of just sort of safety measures, then you should be okay.",
        "And again, with salmonella, the only way to contract it is if you don't cook the eggs.",
        "So, you know, most people like their eggs scrambled in some form, or in omelets.",
        "And it isn't necessarily an issue for everyone.",
        "And you mentioned meringue and cake frosting, and other places where there are eggs.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ice cream comes to mind as well.",
        "Well, let's clarify.",
        "A lot of the egg thats broken down - say, for instance, in cake mix - it's pasteurized.",
        "So a lot of the processed egg - if the egg is pasteurized, that also eliminates the threat from salmonella from the egg yolk.",
        "Now, there might be something in - you know, if a product is not refrigerated properly, or if it's not handled properly, that might, you know, make it a risk for salmonella.",
        "But in terms of, you know, in this case, you know, inside the yolk, it's mostly taken care of if it's pasteurized.",

        "They don't take that glove off.",
        "And then they'll reach for a plate that they're going to put the scrambled eggs on.",

        "Yes.",
        "If one of those raw eggs are - the cracked, you know, before they were scrambled, in fact had salmonella, that would basically, you know, be smearing it, smearing the cooked version with the bacteria.",

        "That's sort of their identification code.",

        "Okay.",

        "So an example here could be P-1720, and then 223.",
        "Okay.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So - and the only thing - I don't want to take too much time - is that it also said it affects producers with more than - what, 50,000 hens?",
