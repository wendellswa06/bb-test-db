        "How did you choose what went into this volume?",
        "Well, the idea of the anthology, a Travelers Literary Companion, is to give a portrait of the country in the voices of the finest literary writers we can find of that country and a sense of the complexity, regionally, ethically, sociologically.",
        "It's incredibly complex.",
        "I think that one of the things many Americans make a mistake with, with Mexico, is to assume that it's all poverty and everybody's poor.",
        "By world standards Mexico is very wealthy, and this is something a lot of people don't know or tend to forget, so I think that the sense of Mexico being complex is really the more the message I would want people to take home from this.",
        "Can you point to any particular story here that reveals a Mexico that Americans don't often see or know about?",
        "Oh, there are several."

        "(Reading) It was always with a bit of a sneer that people in my neighborhood used the word banquet.",
        "We knew that we would never attend the kind of feast we saw in the movies.",
        "We used the word banquet for Rosetta's(ph) enchiladas, rich with grease, onions and cheese, or for those gorettas(ph) of Dona Pala(ph).",
        "Even now I recall them full of potatoes and dripping with sausage grease or with beans simmered with bacon strips.",
        "That was a banquet, although, of course, the word also had overtones of something extraordinary, maybe a first communion party with hot chocolate and cake with sickly sweet frosting, not especially tasty or nutritious or even exotic, just not ordinary.",
        "A banquet was an event.",
        "It didn't even have to be associated with food.",

        "Hello.",
        "Hudson's Bay was founded in 1670, and it really helped build the nation of Canada.",
        "Tell us the story.",
        "Well, it was exclusively created to develop fur trade, and so this was primarily driven by a fashion in Europe for beaver hats.",
        "We have exploration west as a result, and so we see some of the major personalities, the first to see the buffalo on the plains, the first to discover the Northwest Passage, and Alexander Mackenzie the first to see, get to the Pacific, for example.",
        "And in that process, of course, lots of history of interaction with first nations who were, after all, the primary people who were doing the fur trapping.",
        "So these early trading posts for beaver fur eventually became this huge retail chain in the country.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's about 1870 when they transfer into retail work because the fur-bearing trapping business was really kind of depleted, and what occurs is that the land, the huge amount of square mileage they had in Canada's west, northwest, was sold to Canada and really created our provinces in the west, eventually, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta.",
        "Are Canadians clinging to their Hudson's Bay blankets this week?",

        "So the meal times in Green Houses often take several hours because there's no rush.",
        "People can linger over a meal with conversation.",
        "Say your family comes to visit.",
        "The people who work in the Green House will just put another plate on the table and invite you to sit down and have dinner with them.",
        "The staff eats their meals at the same table with the elders, and they share the food that they have themselves prepared.",
        "Later in the day, there might be kind of a sit-down gathering around a big wooden dining-room table where people talk about what they want to do in the coming weeks or what kind of food they want to be preparing for themselves.",

        "There were concerns about medical care.",

        "Yeah, that's an interesting thing.",
        "And I'll bet a lot of callers would have something to say about this because, you know, for every single person living in a nursing home in America, there's somebody with the exact same kind of medical problems living at home.",
        "It's entirely possible for people with chronic illness to live at home.",
        "The problem is most families--those chronic illnesses create demands that most families cannot meet in terms of social support and supervision.",
        "So we found in the Green House that we could actually deliver a higher quality of clinical care by de-emphasizing the medical nature and putting a new emphasis on quality of life.",
        "Obviously--let me ask you another question.",
        "Some people end up deciding at the end of the day to put their parents in a nursing home because of dementia...",

        "Are Green Houses appropriate environments for people with advanced Alzheimer's, for example?",
        "Actually, that's a great question.",
        "One of the proudest achievements of my professional life was the fact that two of these first Green Houses we built in Tupelo were entirely populated by people who had been living in a locked Alzheimer's unit, and they were able to leave that locked Alzheimer's unit and come to live and have their own private room and live in a dwelling that was very--is very much like home.",
        "And I remember one of the elders who had dementia came to the Green House, kind of turned to a staff member and said, `Oh, it's so good to be back home,' because the size and the scale and the manner of life in the Green House reminded her of her own home.",
        "NPR's Joe Shapiro recently reported a two-part series on the Green House Project.",
        "He's been following trends in nursing homes for a number of years.",
