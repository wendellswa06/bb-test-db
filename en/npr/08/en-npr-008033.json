        "No, actually, they work quite well.",
        "I was very impressed with what I saw.",
        "And they're very different from the typical nursing home because the typical nursing home's a place where you get little privacy, you get little control over your life, you wind up living in a small room with some stranger.",
        "Some stranger decides who you get to live with--the staff decides.",
        "They decide what time you get up, what time you go to sleep, what you eat, when you eat, when you get a shower, when you go to sleep.",
        "The Green House model says, look, let's try to make the nursing home more like a small group home.",
        "And so they build them small.",
        "You heard Bill say eight to 10 people.",
        "Everyone gets their own room; they get their own bathroom.",
        "And then you've got the same staff working with the same small number of people every day.",
        "And that's important because then they get to know the staff...",
        "Continuity, sure.",
        "Right.",
        "So they know that Mrs. Blaylock likes to still bake her special corn bread recipe, that Mrs. Adams likes to sing, and that helps them give those people choice and it improves the quality of life.",
        "And one other thing that's important: The Green House pays the staff more; it gives the staff members more responsibility.",
        "So as a result, it shouldn't be a surprise the staff--they're staying longer.",
        "Those Green House in--well, they're not worrying about aides quitting.",
        "That's a big problem in the traditional nursing home.",
        "Sure.",
        "And they can do all this, Joe, and still be, as Dr. Thomas was telling us, cost-neutral?",
        "This costs the same as care in a traditional nursing home?",
        "Well, they charge the same.",
        "Medicaid will pay them the same, no matter what.",
        "They're now--well, they had to raise several million dollars on the front end to build something new.",
        "Sure.",
        "And the fact that they were a not-for-profit nursing home made a difference, that they were able to do that.",
        "So there were some front-end costs, but for someone who--and by the way, that was at a facility that was going to build a new wing or a new..."

        "Hi.",
        "I visited an Eden Alternative nursing home, Chase Memorial, in 1996 up in New York that was run by Dr. Thomas.",
        "And I had heard about it, having been working with nursing homes for quite a while and getting fed up with the commercial ideas that were--agendas that were being put through.",
        "And I had called months in advance, ahead, and said could I visit, and they said yes.",
        "And I just went unannounced.",
        "And that really is unusual in a nursing home.",
        "And I was really impressed.",
        "The staff was natural and took me around.",
        "I think at that time it was plants and pets and a consistent staff, you know.",
        "Well, you know, as the caller mentioned, basically my entire professional career has been devoted to trying to make long-term care serve elders and the people who work with elders better.",
        "And in the early 1990s, we came up with a strategy called the Eden Alternative which has really practiced all over the United States that helps existing nursing homes make changes that improve quality of life.",
        "And the caller really emphasized that there was changes in the environment, changes in the way the staff were relating to visitors and family members and the residents who lived there.",
        "And the Eden Alternative is a growing and ongoing effort on our part to reform long-term care.",
        "The Green House came about when we realized that so many nursing homes in America are housed in buildings that are aging.",
        "The buildings themselves are becoming antiquated.",
        "Many of them were built in the 1960s and '70s, and something's going to have to be done.",
        "In Tupelo, it was an antiquated nursing home that was being replaced.",
        "And we see this pattern being repeated again and again thousands of times across America where, instead of building replacement institutions, we can build these community residences instead.",
        "Diane, thanks very much for the call.",

        "And it's well-known that this kind of stroke can be associated with depression.",
        "So it's really important that a doctor do a comprehensive evaluation and see if there's a treatable depression that's associated with that particular kind of stroke.",
