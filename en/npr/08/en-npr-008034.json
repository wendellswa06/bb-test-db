        "Nursing homes have gotten some bad ink over the last decades, supplemented by what some would call horror stories on a personal level.",
        "What have you seen?",
        "How representative are those stories of abuse and neglect?",
        "Well, you know, as in any industry, there are some historically bad operators, but there are also some really great nursing homes.",
        "And there are a bunch of nursing homes that are striving to get better.",
        "One of the things I wanted to point out to a couple of your callers--you know, we talk about Green House, and I think that we don't have to wait for a revolution and physical plant to have a revolution in the culture of nursing homes.",
        "Menorah Park in Beachwood, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland, has had a Lab and a greyhound that live in the facility.",
        "It's had private rooms.",
        "You're talking about a Lab, the dog, not a lab, the facility?",
        "Yeah, a Lab, the dog, a Labrador retriever.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that we need to recognize that we can have elements of culture change in all kinds of facilities, things that empower the residents and things that empower the staff.",
        "And while a change in the physical environment is probably greatly to be desired, we shouldn't be limited by the perception that that's all there is to it.",
        "You can have flexible meal schedules and more direction by residents and empowerment of staff in every facility in the country as it exists.",
        "I wonder, Joe Shapiro, do you see that when you go to places around the country?",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "I'm--journalists often tell the horrible stories about the bad nursing homes.",
        "I've also been interested in what makes a good nursing home and in the people who run them.",
        "And there is what Catherine Hawes talks about, this whole movement, what's called the culture change movement, to try to just change the way nursing homes do business and to do things that give residents more choice and also give more power to those aides who do most of the care, the hands-on care, and to change the way nursing homes are, to make them nicer places that are places that we'd want to live in.",
        "And unfortunately I think that's still a small percentage of nursing home operators who are serious about doing culture change.",
        "But--and Bill Thomas is part of this.",
        "In fact, in 1997, Bill Thomas and a small group of nursing home reformers met in Rochester, and I was there, and they started something called the Pioneer Network where they came and talked about how to do this big shift in the way nursing homes operate."

        "But my problem is a handicapped daughter which I try to protect.",
        "And I ran the costs while you were talking.",
        "A nursing home in Texas near my daughter, present, 4,485 a month; 53,832 a year.",
        "If you project that down to the year 2012, if I went in at 90 at 2012, the cost would be 102,840 for a year.",
        "In three years, I would've paid something like 345,180, which I don't have, and my handicapped daughter would be left with nothing.",
        "How on earth is the government--'cause not many people have that much money--going to sustain the costs?",
        "At 15 percent--I understand nationally it's 20 percent--but I ran 15 percent because Kansas and Texas are cheaper.",
        "In terms of the increase annually.",
        "Catherine Hawes, this is a huge question.",
        "It is a huge question.",
        "And frankly, the way that the Bush administration is going runs counter to this woman and her daughter's interests.",
        "They're cutting back on federal support for Medicaid.",
        "I mean, this is an industry in which you're expected to bankrupt yourself before you get any help from the government.",
        "And I think people don't realize that and need to pay more attention to the policy that's going on.",
        "There's a bill before the Congress right now that would cut between 10 and $20 billion a year in federal support for Medicaid.",
        "So people like this woman and her friends will lose the family farm, will lose their home, will have nothing to leave children or a spouse who's impaired.",
        "And it's a national disgrace.",
        "Again, the practice is now, to qualify for Medicaid, you can't have any substantial wealth, Joe Shapiro.",
        "And June's point--this is something that's going to affect millions and millions of people.",
        "(Singing) He took the midnight train going anywhere…",
        "Right.",
        "And right now every state is trying to cut their Medicaid budget.",
        "So it doesn't look like we can expect big solutions anytime soon from government.",
        "Most of the hard work of long-term care falls upon family and friends.",
        "They're the ones who provide long-term care to people in their own homes, they provide the feeding, they lift people in and out of bed.",
        "Sometimes they even do medical care like changing bandages or doing tube feedings.",
        "And that's probably going to continue.",
        "Family and friends are going to do the often heroic, time-consuming and sometimes literally backbreaking work of long-term care.",
        "And they do it with little notice and with little thanks.",

        "I have one more comment, and that is that I believe in Consumer Reports' latest thing they said this long-term care is almost a joke because the expenses per day, even if they pay you $150 a day, it still wouldn't really cover it, and your costs for the insurance would be astronomical.",

        "Let me ask you, Catherine Hawes--one of the consistent problems we've heard about and addressed in the Green House Project by paying those who work with staff members more--turnover of staff--this is a terrible issue for a nursing home operator.",
        "It is a terrible issue, and it's interesting--one of the things that research shows is that one of the biggest predictors of turnover is staffing level.",
        "And one of the national tragedies in this country is that the vast majority of nursing homes in this country have too few staff to meet the needs of residents, and that means that good staff get burned out.",
        "They go home every day knowing they haven't done as much care as the residents need, and the good ones can't stand it and they leave.",
        "So I think it's important to pay people a living wage, but I think it's also important that we hire enough staff to meet the needs of the current residents.",
        "Lots of states were making good progress in providing facilities with staffing enhancement payments, but as Joe pointed out, the states are in about the worst financial shape they've been since the Great Depression, and so it's going to be a struggle to address this problem.",

        "St. Vincent's nursing facilities underwent a major remodel.",
        "Could you describe those for us?",
        "About 1990, we began a restructure of both our physical building and of our way of thinking.",
        "We went from being a very traditional medical-model nursing home with long, sterile hallways and schedules based on staff needs and convenience to a more homelike setting.",
        "We weren't in a position to just take our building down to the ground and start over, so we worked with what we'd had there for about 80 years.",
        "We developed nursing neighborhoods as opposed to units, with more open spaces, with warm colors, and broke down those long hallways and carpeted and tried to make it more like home.",
        "We had nursing--we used to have a nursing station that was very much isolated and set apart from what we then called patients.",
        "We now have a care area that's a part of our living environment, and we've tried to take the physical barriers out of our environment for our residents.",
        "And those changes, those environmental and architectural changes, how did they result in changes in behavior?",
        "Did they?",
        "Yes, they certainly have.",
        "In addition to the changes that I described, we also added full kitchens to each of our neighborhoods so that we have the ability to--for example, as Bill Thomas was describing in the Green House experience, we can serve our meals over a long space of time.",
        "So I have one lady who prefers to get up about 11 in the morning.",
        "She was a night-shift worker.",

        "And so she has breakfast at 11.",
        "We're able to cook what she wants, when she wants it.",

        "I have to tell you that once I retire, the person who tries to pull me out of bed at 5:30, 6 in the morning is liable to get hurt, you know?",
        "That's just not respectful of who that person is, and that's something that we've worked really hard to accommodate.",
        "Well, we--you're saying it's improving life for the residents.",
        "What about burnout--staff--what about you?",
        "Is your job easier?",
        "Well, actually, there's something called the co-housing movement.",
        "It's small right now, but it's the idea of people--intergenerational families or people from different generations coming together to live either in a big house or an apartment building and maybe eating communally and taking care of each other; so older people sometimes taking care of the children, other people taking care of people as they age.",
        "That's the type of thing that I think we'll see--but I think baby boomers will change long-term care, and you may see options like that grow."

        "We've gone from nurses being the ones who are in control, and we've shifted that empowerment to the residents themselves.",
        "Initially, that was a very frightening thought for nursing staff because, after all, we were the people who knew what was best for our clients.",
        "But I have to say that over the long run we knew what was best, for sure, for their physical bodies, but in many ways we were missing the individual and the heart--who that person was that inhabited that body.",
