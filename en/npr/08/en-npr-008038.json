        "Exactly.",

        "So another issue here is that, like Netflix and other streaming services, Amazon doesn't really tell journalists how many people are watching their shows.",
        "So it's tough to know what success means for them.",
        "They come to this press tour to try and get us critics excited about their shows, but they came across this week as kind of disconnected tech executives who don't quite know how to speak to the popular press or the public, for that matter.",
        "Well, Eric, I feel like there's always this tension between sort of the press and, say, companies, politicians, about, you know, how much a company has to reveal to us to be successful.",
        "Is it really important here?",
        "Well, I think one thing that Amazon's competitors - say, Netflix, or if they're really feeling ambitious, HBO - have realized is that journalists and critics are really crucial in spreading buzz for their new shows.",
        "There's so much TV out there that people really do rely on journalists and writers to point out what's hip and cool on television.",
        "Amazon has cleared one hurdle.",
        "They've shown the TV industry that they can work with some of the biggest producers and actors in TV, but they still have to learn to communicate with the press and, by extension, the public.",
        "All right, that's NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans who's in Los Angeles at the TV Critics Association's summer press tour.",
