        "But right now I think there are many Republicans with misgivings about Iraq, but they've agreed to stick with President Bush on this until mid-September, when General David Petraeus, the commander in Iraq, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, who is in Baghdad, come and tell Congress how things are going there.",
        "At that point I think you might see a stampede away from the Iraq policy.",
        "So what we haven't talked about is the shadow of the president's veto.",

        "That's right.",
        "You need 67 votes in the Senate to override a presidential veto.",
        "It's not clear, even in September, whether there would be enough Republican departures from the White House to get that 67.",

        "Yes.",

        "Well, what I was trying to describe really is this very ominous mood that has taken hold of Baghdad at the moment.",
        "We persistently hear stories of leaflets being passed around neighborhoods threatening Sunnis and telling them to leave because--from Shia or vice versa.",
        "So there is this sort of undercurrent, this pulse, which is very sinister and alarming.",
        "When I called you earlier to ask you to come on the show and talk more about this, you described some of Samir's background and what he was like.",
        "Yes, I've actually known Samir for some time.",

        "A year and a half ago if you talked about the possibility of Iraq descending into civil war, you would attract sort of skeptical glances, especially from those who supported the invasion of Iraq.",
        "Now it really is a central issue in the debate about where this country is going, and it is an issue that Iraqis talk about, too.",
        "One of the things that Samir said to us, which was very disturbing really to hear, was that he felt that the atmosphere now was so poisoned that some Iraqis actually believe that they have to have some kind of bloodletting.",
        "Of course, people hope it doesn't happen, but they are talking about it now in a way that they didn't before.",
        "This is something that you say you find in Baghdad, but given the peculiarities of Iraq, maybe this is not going on in the rest of the country.",
        "That's actually a point that Samir himself made to us.",
        "He's from Anbar province, which is predominantly Sunni.",
        "He doesn't believe that the conflict between the Shia and the Sunni will happen in areas which are predominantly Sunni or predominantly Shia--for example, the south, which is Shia.",
        "He thinks that Baghdad will be the caldron in which this conflict will worsen markedly.",
        "You know, we hear about it from our own Iraqi colleagues from time to time, and they all speak about this.",
        "In fact, one came into work today and called the morgue in Baghdad, which he does every day because we're trying to keep a check on the level of killings that are going on in this city, only to be told by the official that he always talks to that one of the people who were brought in dead today was a cousin of his."
