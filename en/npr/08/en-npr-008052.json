        "Well, that was very different from my recollection.",
        "Do you think he was lying about you, or suffering from a memory lapse?",
        "What was going on?",

        "I don't think he was lying.",
        "He asked for immunity in this case, based of his concern that he told me - and NBC's David Gregory -about Wilson's wife working at the CIA.",
        "So I think his concern is genuine in that instance, but I think he's got some kind of memory lapse here because when I've looked at my notes that I took that day - July 11th in 2003 - I look at this file I sent back to Time magazine and then some e-mails I sent, they all support my account, which is that Fleischer and another senior administration official only pointed me and said go look who sent Wilson, as opposed to saying anything about the wife.",

        "And, Mike, I know you've talked with some of those people in various kinds of opposition groups as well.",
        "Even for airstrikes - well, the point is you don't have to defeat them tomorrow, but it seems to me you do have the potential for a pretty broad coalition, including people in Iraq, including people in the region, including people in Europe - for a slow, steady campaign - not going back in, but a slow, steady campaign to defeat ISIS.",
        "The nature of ISIS is such that they're simply a radioactive force who will forever, as long as they exist in this power, will destabilize the Middle East and threaten American interests."
