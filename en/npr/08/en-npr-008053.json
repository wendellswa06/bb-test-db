        "E.J., you wanted to jump in there.",
        "Yeah, I think the difficulty with what David is saying is that it implies that you can defeat ISIS with political instability continuing in Baghdad, with the lack of support from the Sunnis for the central government in Baghdad.",
        "And I think yes, Obama has a tendency to be agonized over a lot of choices.",
        "But guess what?",
        "There are a lot of agonizing choices.",
        "And I think yes, we do want to defeat ISIS.",
        "We don't want them to gain more ground, and we sure don't want them to overrun the Kurds.",
        "So I think the logic of this campaign is we will probably get more involved than the administration is now.",
        "But I think Obama's right that absent some political change in Baghdad, we just can't do this - or even we and allies can't do this without political change.",
        "You know, a lot of people are asking if you can do this in Iraq, why not do it in Syria?",
        "What's the difference in terms of a humanitarian crisis and thousands of people being jeopardized?",
        "Is there one?",
        "170,000 people have died in Syria, and much worse atrocities.",
        "I think the lesson of Syria - and maybe the lesson here is the same - which is it's a lot easier to do the small things at the beginning than to do big things at the end.",
        "And we - now we're beginning to arm the moderate rebels in Syria, but we probably should have been there more assertively in the beginning when they actually had a chance.",
        "And we should've probably defeated ISIS or tried to fight against them in the beginning now - not now that they control so much territory.",
        "But the larger point is that if you're constantly assertive with coalitions, it's a lot easier than if your tendency is one to retrench and withdrawal.",
        "I think the answer to your question is that A, we have more responsibility in Iraq simply because we were there before and are partly responsible for political circumstances there.",
        "Second, we are dealing with clear allies there in the Iraqi government, but even more in the Kurds.",
        "And I think the very fact that the opposition in Syria gave rise to ISIS suggests how complicated it was.",
        "A lot of people - David is one of them - says if we'd only come in earlier and armed moderates, then maybe none of this would have happened.",
        "They wouldn't have risen.",
        "The other possibility is those weapons could eventually have gotten into ISIS hands.",
        "So I think Syria was not as clear as this is, at least to me.",
        "And we did hear President Obama last night specifically mention having a mandate to help - in this case, a request from the Iraqi government.",
        "Correct.",
        "The White House idea - and E.J., you alluded to this earlier - was that the Iraqis would have to come together on a new government and political reforms for there to be any real further U.S.",
        "military involvement.",
        "Is there any promise of that?",
        "Is that completely by the wayside this point, David?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I actually think the Obama administration has done a pretty good job of trying to rally some sort of unified - trying to get Maliki out of there - trying to rally some sort of unified government.",
        "That's just a question of twisting arms and trying to get help from outside to rally a coalition of people to create a new set of political leadership.",
        "That - you know, it looks more promising, frankly, than it did a month or two ago - that that would happen - that we'd have a different government in there - one a broader swath would support that would be less sectarian.",
        "The problem is this will - you know, even if they form a government, it's just going to take a long time to get the government organized, let alone to get the military - the Iraqi military organized, and ISIS can do a lot of damage in that time.",
        "E.J."

        "There's nothing like an existential threat to concentrate people's minds.",
        "And I think there is a lot of awareness among political leaders in Iraq that they - if they do not act reasonably quickly, this situation is going to get worse.",
        "So yes, it's very hard.",
        "Yes, there are no really inspiring leaders on the list to replace Maliki.",
        "Nonetheless, they're looking at either the collapse of the regime or a loss of half their country, and that should put some pressure on the Iraqi politicians to get moving on forming a new government.",

        "Today, a Hamas video claims to show an attack launched on Israeli troops from a tunnel.",
        "Israelis are asking why their forces didn't stop Hamas from building the underground network in the first place, and some want an investigation.",
        "NPR 's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has that story.",
        "In the grainy Hamas video, black-clad militants shove their weapons through a tunnel entrance, then climb out and run toward what looks like an army post inside Israel.",
        "Five soldiers were killed in yesterday's attack, as were a handful of Hamas fighters.",
        "Israeli officials say the militants' aim was to kill and kidnap Israeli citizens.",
        "Such revelations are rattling Israelis more than the 2000 plus rockets Hamas has fired into their country since the war began earlier this month says Smadar Perry, who writes about the tunnels for Israel's largest daily newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth.",
        "Nobody wants to go to sleep and wake up with killers and terrorists in his bedroom.",
        "But she and other journalists say how Hamas was able to build enough tunnels to allow militants to infiltrate Israel six times since the Gaza offensive began is something Israeli authorities will likely have to answer for.",
        "At a briefing earlier this week, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz defended how authorities have dealt with the tunnels of which the military says 32 have been uncovered so far.",
        "You know it's not always the case that if we have some threats we decide immediately to go to a big ground operation in order to neutralize it."
