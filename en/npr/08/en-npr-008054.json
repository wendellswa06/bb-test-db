        "I think there also is a little bit of unease about Petraeus selling the plans for Iraq as a troop drawdown because there are no replacement troops available for the surge and so commanders in Iraq have been saying for months, we're going to start bringing down the numbers in April through October of 2008.",

        "In fact, I think in some ways, if you want to look at a model of the training and advisory program it's not ours in Iraq, it's the Iranians.",
        "It's interesting that General Petraeus also seemed pointedly to oppose a shift in mission in the - more of an advisory role with Iraqi military and it's taking on more of a role in combat.",
        "What does that say?",
        "That's when you're going to see whether Iraqi forces behave well without American troops around.",

        "The Iranians pointed to a reasonably good cooperation that took place between Iran and the United States vis-a-vis Afghanistan at the end of 2001 when the United States was involved in trying to figure out who would govern Afghanistan, and the Iranians had a role to play in that.",
