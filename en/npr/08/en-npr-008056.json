        "To reform advocates here, the 31-year-old Gonzalez is precisely what's wrong with Cuba's current model.",
        "Gonzalez was trained as a computer programmer but quit his government job to make ends meet by selling shoes.",
        "Starting a software company or working as a private computer engineer isn't among the 181 occupations that have been permitted so far by Cuban authorities.",
        "Licenses are available for stone cutters, horse cart drivers and birthday clowns, but not architects, scientists or other educated professionals.",
        "And unless that changes, the mentality of Cuba's Communist Party will remain decades behind China and Vietnam, says University of Havana economist Julio Diaz Vazquez.",

        "That has nothing to do with Marx.",
        "It's not possible to have socialism if you don't have a productive economy to sustain it, he says.",
        "On the scale of liberalism, Cuba is still closer to North Korea than China, a country that looks relatively open to Diaz Vazquez.",
        "Chinese citizens have access to the Internet, he notes, and can publicly criticize corruption or pollution."

        "The reason that's important is since this is a perjury and obstruction of justice trial, Libby - in his grand jury testimony - said he never knew anything about Wilson's wife.",

        "First, blacks should become custodians of our own history.",

        "It is true that blacks have scholars such as Molefi Asante and John Hope Franklin, but a lot of black history is interpreted by writers such as Taylor Branch and Eugene Genovese.",
        "No doubt these are good historians, but should they and other white people share custodianship of black history?",

        "Jews have the first five books of the Bible.",
        "Despite the best intentions of Black History Month, the shared black narrative, to the extent there is one, tends to focus on our enslavement and victimization in this country.",
        "Perhaps black leaders should consider holding a summit to try to come to a consensus on our collective narrative.",
        "The book and television series \"\"Roots\"\" was the beginning of that story.",
        "But where do we go from there?",
        "Third, black folks should have a widely celebrated adolescent rite of passage.",
        "Bar mitzvahs, the coming-of-age rite for Jewish boys and bat mitzvahs for girls symbolize taking adult responsibilities in the community.",
        "While African-Americans do have rites of passage, finding someone who has gone through one is the exception rather than the rule.",
        "And the fourth thing we might adapt from Jews is a continuous inquiry into who we are.",
        "How do we define ourselves?",
        "How are we to behave as black people?",
        "Should our ideal be that of a scholar or of a dropout?",

        "Despite their good-natured ribbing of each other about their differences, there seemed to be an underlying unity among them.",
        "This unity has been strained in recent years, particularly because of conflicts in the Middle East and between neoconservatives and liberals.",
        "Still I have a sense that most Jews feel that what befalls one of them might befall all of them.",
        "The dinner ended and the Jewish man and I happened to leave at the same time.",
        "On the elevator, we recalled how stimulating the dinner conversation had been.",
        "When we reached the street ready to say our goodbyes, I said to him, `Jews really do have it together.",

        "I mean, what's been involved here, security guards, gates?",
        "That's right, and in fact, not too long ago, the British accused Iran of being involved in some of the explosions and bombings that have taken place in Basra.",
        "It's not clear what evidence there is for it, but the British seem to be pointing to a particular expertise in explosives and a particular kind of explosives that pointed to Iran, they said.",
        "Of course, the Iranians denied this, but there's no question that armed militia and armed agents from Iran, probably most of whom have been Iraqi, because there were many Iraqi exiles in Iran during the whole Saddam Hussein period, but probably some Iranian agents as well have been--have infiltrated from Iran into southern Iraq.",
        "The border was never sealed and never closed.",
        "It's been a very porous border since the US invasion in 2003.",
        "And so yes, the United States is naturally concerned about what Iran is doing in Iraq and in southern Iran, and there's plenty of reason to get the talks like this under way.",
        "And we should also point out, the Iranians accuse the British of being involved in a series of bombings inside Iran, so...",

        "There have been bombings in Ahwaz.",
        "There were a series of demonstrations actually when I was there, when I was in Tehran back in the spring.",
        "But there's a great deal of murkiness over what's going on in this particular area.",
        "It's important to point out that this particular area has a large concentration of--a minority that lives in Iran, Arab-Iranians, and it was the area that Saddam Hussein coveted when he invaded Iran to start the Iran-Iraq War in 1980, because it's where a great deal of Iranian oil is located.",
        "So this is an area that--in both Iran and Iraq that have traditionally been tension areas and could very well be again.",
        "We want to focus for most of the program on the politics inside Iran and the challenge that this new regime in Iran is posing for the United States.",
        "And as we mentioned, the new president was elected there five months ago and brought a whole raft of right-wingers.",
        "They now control the parliament in Tehran as well as the presidency.",

        "This is a hard story to get at, but there's a lot being written now on various Iran-oriented Web sites around the world.",
        "When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was first elected president back in June, it was assumed that now the conservatives controlled all the reins of power.",
        "The supreme leader is a conservative cleric, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
        "Last year the conservatives gained control of the parliament, which had for the previous four years been oriented toward reform.",
        "And now Ahmadinejad had replaced the reformist-oriented president, Mohammed Khatemi.",
        "And so there was an expectation that most of the power would fall into the--would be consolidated in the hands of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.",
        "Ahmadinejad was a relative neophyte to politics, and it was assumed that he wouldn't be very strong.",
        "What--the unexpected development is that now there's a lot of talk about a power struggle within conservative ranks in Iran where Ahmadinejad is bringing in a lot of people that supported him that are seen as more a resurgence of revolutionary ideals of the Islamic republic in the early years of the 1980s, challenging some of the more liberal economic policies that have been pursued in the last few years and certainly challenging some of the more liberal social policies that have allowed young men and women to socialize more openly, that have allowed certain dress codes for women to be eroded.",
        "And it seems that this is something that Ahmadinejad and people around him want to bring, and it's made some of the more traditional conservatives, like Ali Khamenei and the former president, Rafsanjani, uncomfortable.",
        "And as I understand it, earlier in the fall, Ali Khamenei gave more power to Rafsanjani as--in his position as leader of something called the Expediency Council to pass on all sorts of policies that the government, the president and the legislature were promulgating.",
        "And now there are those who feel that this is the beginning of the power struggle for who will really control the government in Iran.",
        "Interestingly, those were mechanisms installed to control the previous president, the reformists, and now they're being applied on conservatives as well.",
        "A fascinating situation, and indeed, you're talking about a split amongst the clerics as well.",
        "That's right.",
        "There are some writers and analysts who are saying that there is a much more conservative and ultraconservative ayatollah named Mesbah Yazdi, who's the favorite of President Ahmadinejad and that he doesn't look all that favorably on the policies of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei."
