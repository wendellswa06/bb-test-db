        "And there's even talk that somehow there might be a power play to replace Ali Khamenei sometime next year.",
        "The way the supreme leader is chosen is through something called the Council of--the Assembly of Experts, and this is a nominally elected body that then chooses the supreme leader.",
        "There have only been two supreme leaders in the 25-year history of the Islamic republic of Iran, first Ayatollah Khomeini and then his replacement, Ali Khamenei when Khomeini died in 1989.",
        "There's never been an effort to replace a supreme leader while he was still alive or struggle over how that process might take place, but there are some analysts writing on these Web sites that think that that might be in the cards now.",
        "And in the midst of this, the new president has appointed unknowns to head the important oil ministry, obviously extremely important in Iran, and they have been rejected in parliament.",
        "As we all know, he's recalled 40 Iranian ambassadors from around the world, people who were largely viewed as either pragmatists or reformers.",
        "He's called very notoriously for Israel to be wiped off the map, and some people look at this and question his leadership.",
        "Other people that you've talked to say maybe he's crazy like a fox.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "Initially there was, I think, a perception that he might be simply naive and not smart enough and not sharp enough and not aware of the power that his words convey--all of them--as the new president of Iran.",
        "But there--now an analysis has emerged, a second school of thought, to suggest that maybe Ahmadinejad is provoking a conflict within Iran internally by these moves, certainly by the diplomatic moves and the effort to replace many bureaucrats in other parts of the government and managers of state that run companies in order to provoke this conflict and this clash as a way of forcing the issue and possibly accruing more power to himself.",
        "At the same time, would you agree with Farzad that the United States made a mistake by not talking more to Iran?",
        "Certainly, and--but I think that the traditional conservatives didn't think that there would be such a wholesale housecleaning because they saw Ahmadinejad as one of their own.",
        "As I said earlier, there was an assumption that this might be an easy transition rather than a challenge to the powers that be in Iran.",
        "Part of it seems to be that Ahmadinejad was elected and there, of course, are many questions about the purity of the election, but nevertheless, he was elected with support from poor people around the country on a populist campaign against corruption in government.",
        "And that campaign is leveled not at reformers but at the traditional conservatives who have been in power and many of whom have become rich over the years.",
        "Our focus today is on Iran.",
        "Mike Shuster will stay with us after the break.",
        "We'll be joined by Ray Takeyh of the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "Later in the program, we'll also be talking with Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of Political Affairs at the State Department, about what the United States hopes to do in terms of its Iran policy.",

        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "We're talking today about the new generation in power in Iran and about US policy toward that country.",
        "It involves nuclear power, possibly nuclear weapons, of course, oil relations with Iraq, Afghanistan; a lot of important things go on.",
        "Of course, the United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran and has not had for more than a quarter-century.",
        "We were talking earlier today about an apparently narrow diplomatic initiative that would authorize the US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, to open talks with Iran on the subject of Iraq.",
        "But we'll hear more about that later."

        "He joins us from the council's studios here in Washington, DC.",
        "Good of you to be with us today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And I was interested--you describe this new generation of right-wingers in power in Iraq--Iran as people whose defining experience is not the revolution of a quarter-century ago but the long war with Iraq.",
        "Oh, yes, that's right, for Ahmadinejad and much of his Cabinet, whose average age, I believe, is 46.",
        "Many of them have a background in security services, military service, and, of course, that led them to the war with Iraq.",
        "And that in many ways has been their defining experience and has molded their perceptions of the international community and sort of the strategic requirements of the country.",
        "In terms of the international community, you talk about the fact that there were no or very few complaints from the international community when Saddam Hussein's Iraq used chemical weapons.",
        "There were almost none.",
        "Approximately there were eight UN investigations that resulted in rather conclusive identification of Iraq as the party that employed chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and civilians alike.",
        "And nevertheless, there was no sort of international rebuke, sanction or censure of the Iraqi regime, far from it.",
        "The United States and its allies provided credits and intelligence to Iraqi government while some European states, particularly France, was the leading seller of armament to Iraq and some firms within Germany were providing Iraq with agents necessary for construction of these chemical plants.",
        "And this also is, indeed, part of the rationale you talk about as to why Iran is so determined to develop a nuclear weapon.",
        "Well, it sort of has a number of implications for Iran's leadership.",
        "First, that the security and safety of the country cannot be predicated on international opinion, international treaties or sort of international diplomacy, that there has to be a degree of self-sufficiency and a viable deterrent capability by the Iranian regime itself.",
        "All right."

        "Second of all, as I said, it has led to suspicion of international community's intentions and as a matter of fact, a couple of days ago, Ahmadinejad gave a speech in which he talked about the countries that now are so insistent on weapons of mass destruction but they were rather indifferent before, they're so insistent on human rights; yet looking at the record of their allies and themselves, they have been rather lax in that respect.",
        "So their argument of hypocrisy also comes across rather well.",
        "Let's get a listener involved in the conversation.",
        "Again, our number is (800) 989-8255.",
        "The e-mail address is totn@npr.org.",
        "Farzad joins us from Fairfax, Virginia.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm an Iranian-American, and I'd like to say that the United States has made a grave mistake not to stay engaged since the start of the revolution with Iran and also not being honest toward Iran, and that that has caused the general policy of the regime to go where it is now.",
        "I think that if the United States would have been more honest about Iran and would have admitted to some of the mistakes that they made toward Iran, it could have prevented a lot of problems that are--now we are dealing with.",
        "Well, I want to get Mike Shuster in on this as well, but Ray Takeyh, you describe Iran as a place that is--well, at the same time it has a vibrant society, it is also a country that supports terrorism and is involved in a lot of things the United States has a lot of problems with.",
        "The traditional American concerns about Iran have been threefold: Iranian proliferation tendencies, Iran's support for various Palestinian rejectionist groups and organizations such as Hezbollah which have used violence in their opposition to Israel, and finally some issues on human rights and domestic political abuses as well.",
        "And that's a fairly long list, and it's an onerous list, but that essentially defines American objections to Iran.",
        "I guess to that you can add Iranian policies toward Iraq that may conflict with certain aspects of American perceptions there.",
        "There were a number of attempts in the latter stage of the Clinton administration to rationalize--I don't like to use the word `normalize,' given where we are--but those efforts largely came--they came and went, given the fact that neither political systems was prepared for that sort of a far-reaching agreement.",
        "We're today at a rather unique junction in US-Iran relations in that neither side is particularly interested in embarking toward a rapprochement or normalization.",
        "Iranian government, by its declared objectives, seems rather indifferent to the United States, if not actively hostile, and the United States government obviously has a policy that is based more on coercion and isolation as opposed to engagement and negotiations.",
        "Mike Shuster, would you say that's right?",
        "You were talking earlier about engagement with Iran in Afghanistan and now we hear about Ambassador Khalilzad.",
        "Well, the--most diplomats and officials will say that the interaction between the US and Iran in late 2001 over Afghanistan was a successful one, but then neither side seemed much interested in taking it further.",
        "It was true that there was an effort--a real effort on the part of Bill Clinton in the second term, especially after President Mohammed Khatemi was elected in Iran in 1997, to move things forward, and by the end of Clinton's term, the president and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had practically begged for some kind of serious diplomatic process to get under way.",
        "And Albright made a speech in the late '90s in Washington in which she all but apologized for the 1953 coup that the CIA engineered in Iran that is such a point of contention for the last half-century between Iran and the United States.",
        "But the situation in Iran at that time was that the reformers were in office but not in power.",
        "They were blocked by conservatives and by the supreme leader from pursuing improved relations with the United States.",
        "And when I went to Iran over the last two years--I've been there twice--Iranians always told me that there are many, even among conservative ranks, that would like to see improved relations with the United States at various points over the last few years, but they didn't want the reformers to get credit for it.",
        "So there was a belief that perhaps when conservatives ended up in all the offices of power, that there might be some opening to the United States.",
        "But I agree with Ray that there doesn't seem to be on either side much taste for it right now.",
        "Farzad, thanks very much for the call."

        "Sure.",
        "The question I had--according to National Geographic, BBC, various news agencies, in the early '90s, it appeared that the majority of the Iranian population from ages 16 to 30 were seeking democracy, and my question is, why didn't the US step in at that time and help this group of people?",
        "Ray Takeyh?",
        "Yeah, there is actually a considerable appetite within Iran and its rather sophisticated population and its literate population--unlike many other countries in the Middle East, Iran's literacy rate is about 85, 90 percent--for a more representative political system.",
        "And that's largely an internal struggle, and it has to move on its own pace and with its own dynamic and direction.",
        "I'm not quite sure if an external power such as the United States at any point, whether it's in the 1990s or today, can do much to install or accelerate those democratic trends.",
        "Iran will change, but it is a change that has to come from inside and on the initiative of the Iranian peoples themselves.",
        "I'm--thanks, Ron.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The--obviously the reformers, Mr. Khatemi, were--well, they were--a lot of them were prohibited from running for election last time around.",
        "Pragmatists were defeated in the election.",
        "Ray Takeyh, you describe a situation where politically, Iran's got a lot of internal problems, economic problems as well, and now all of a sudden, the right wing is going to be responsible for everything."

        "In--both elections of 1997 that led to the rise of the reformers and President Khatemi and the election of 2005, were both important elections in one respect.",
        "In 1997, Iranians voted for political change and political accountability.",
        "In 2005, to the extent that Iranians voted, they voted for economic justice and economic accountability.",
        "So this new regime in Iran does have a mandate, and it is a rather--an onerous mandate, namely to resolve Iran's economic situation, to provide more for the population and deal with its material grievances.",
        "I don't believe it can achieve those objectives, and so like every other administration in Iran's post-revolutionary period, eventually Iranians may be disappointed with the government that they elected because of its inability or unwillingness or incapacity to actually deliver on its political pledges.",
        "And what about the opposition groups?",
        "And we've referred to them broadly, I guess, as reformers and pragmatists.",
        "There's obviously a lot of factions in there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The reformers have to essentially go back to the drawing board and think what happened.",
        "In 1997, they got about 75 percent of the vote and in the 2005 election, they got maybe about 20 percent of the vote.",
        "So along the way, they lost touch with the public.",
        "They have to go back to the think tanks or the research organizations or to the grassroots organizations and once again reconnect with the Iranian public, a connection that they lost while they were in power.",
        "And one of the reasons why they lost it is because the reform movement was rather an upper middle-class elite movement that focused on lofty political ambitions such as reconciling democracy with Islam, and it never really had an economic agenda, and for many Iranian people who were struggling with difficult economic times, that was an important shortcoming.",
        "So the reform movement now has an opportunity to go back, rethink its strategies, reformulate its strategies and maybe re-establish a connection with the Iranian people.",
        "There's efforts to do that.",
        "I'm not sure if they'll succeed or not, but that's the only possible way that the reform movement can come back.",
        "It cannot come back with the slogans of the mid- to late-1990s.",
        "It has to come back with a very different agenda that has a populist appeal.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that they're quite confused at this stage of the game.",
        "They fought for some eight years, those outside of government, those in the parliament.",
        "They were--they tried to implement reform policies that were often blocked by the other governmental structures dominated by the clerics.",
        "I think economic policy is of central importance in Iran, and every time I've been there, people have told me that.",
        "But there's an ongoing struggle.",
        "There's a deep-down division within Iranian society and those who hold office, both on the clerical and on the political side, about just what kind of an economy Iran ought to be.",
        "There is a sense among some that the Iranian oil wealth ought to be used to be redistributed to the people, and a kind of Islamic socialism exists in part in Iran, but over the last five or eight years, that's led to a stagnant economy and economists and other analysts say there needs to be much more of a modernization of the economy and opening it up.",
        "And most analysts that I've spoken to do not think that President Ahmadinejad and those who support him are gonna pursue policies like that, thereby expecting that Iran's economy will continue to stagnate despite the fact of very high oil prices which, of course, benefits Iran.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We're talking about Iran and US policy towards it.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Ray Takeyh, I wanted to ask you about the way ahead.",
        "The United States has sort of been playing bad cop in the--to the European good cop in the negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programs, and at the same time Iran, most people believe, is working very hard, as fast as it can, to get a nuclear weapon.",
        "It may be five to 10 years away by most estimates.",
        "You say that the United States really cannot try to bully or use hard-line tactics, sanctions, those kinds of things, to pressure Iran to abandon this approach?",
        "There is no purely coercive solution to this.",
        "The threats of sanctions, however they may be enacted at whatever level of intensity has no particular impression on Iran's new government.",
        "They're rather indifferent to threats of coercion and threats of rescission of foreign investment.",
        "So the idea that this IAEA process will go to the Security Council and some sort of a multilateral sanctions are going to be enacted, which they're likely to be rather watered down if enacted at all, that is not something that's likely to make an impression on Iranian government.",
        "For Ahmadinejad's government, the nuclear calculations are predicated on domestic factors.",
        "On nationalistic factors, namely that Iran is being mistreated by superpower bullying.",
        "By ideological factors, namely their distrust of the international community leads them to try to achieve a deterrent power that is convincing and powerful.",
        "And, frankly, some of their attachment to a nuclear deterrent has been buttressed by the events in the Middle East in the last four or five years where United States has intervened militarily to displace governments that obviously did not have that type of a deterrent capability.",
        "So the argument that one requires nuclear weapons, the strategic option to deter the United States, does have some validity.",
        "Iraq, that did not have nuclear weapons, is subjugated and occupied, while the United States is trying to craft a viable package of strategic and economic concessions to a North Korea regime that does have nuclear weapons.",
        "That does make an impression on domestic calculations and nuclear policy of any government, Ahmadinejad or otherwise.",
        "I actually see a great deal of continuity between the nuclear diplomacy of the current Iranian government and its predecessor."
