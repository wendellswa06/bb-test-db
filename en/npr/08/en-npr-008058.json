        "And, Mike Shuster, you could probably add, you know, that there's continuity back to the shah of Iran as well.",
        "Yeah, well, the US nuclear cooperation with Iran began during the shah's period in the 1970s and, in fact, leaders of the current Iranian government and its predecessor have often cited that, to say that they have the right to pursue these technologies.",
        "What's interesting now, I think, is that the--Russia has come forward with a proposal that's very interesting, even novel, it seems to me, and there might be some room for further negotiation on that.",
        "Russia essentially has proposed that it and Iran together finance, build and manage a new uranium enrichment facility for Iran exclusively, but on Russian soil.",
        "The idea would be that the international community would grant that Iran has a right to this nuclear technology, but should see it in its interests at the moment to produce enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power program in Russia, that then the nuclear fuel would be sent to Iran, used, and then the nuclear waste would be sent back to Russia so that the plutonium in it couldn't be reprocessed.",
        "Iran has initially rejected this, but the United States is on board for this and is urging Iran to continue to talk about it.",
        "And we'll see where that continues to go.",
        "Thank you both very much for being with us.",

        "But I think part of the disillusionment that people are feeling now is that they're realizing that there's no golden solution to Iran's economic and social problems, you know, that, you know, a populist leader, despite the fact that he's a new face, despite the fact that he has all the populist words, all--you know, fighting against corruption and maintaining the independence of the country and so on and so forth, cannot really deliver because, you know, the problem is far more deep-rooted than just a bunch of, you know, corrupt clerics, you know, maintaining bank accounts abroad.",

        "The president was, as I mentioned, speaking in El Paso where he's touring the Mexican border, and he's scheduled to make what the White House is describing as a major address on Iraq and the war against terrorism tomorrow in Annapolis.",
        "We'll have coverage of that tomorrow at this time on TALK OF THE NATION, including analysis of what the president says in terms of the way ahead in Iraq.",

        "You were last in Iran in October, and we were talking a lot about the various political factions in Iran.",
        "How are people there reacting to the new government and the new presidency?",
        "Well, I think there's a lot of ambivalence.",
        "I--you know, I have talked to a lot of people who actually voted for Ahmadinejad across the board, you know, people in the provinces, working-class people or even intellectuals, and I think by and large what I really detect is an increasing sense of disillusionment.",
        "Disillusionment with what aspect?",
        "Well, with many aspects because, you know, people--officially 17 million people voted for Ahmadinejad, and these 17 million, you know, most of them came across the spectrum of a very complex society, so the reasons people voted for him are very different, and therefore, you know, there is--disillusionments are different.",
        "But by and large, I think, you know, what I can--you know, the way it can be generalized is that his campaign platform of fighting against corruption and presenting a new face, you know, in the executive branch and also, you know, kind of a toned-down version of moral conservativism was what attracted a lot of voters for him and, you know, they feel that they have been betrayed by his belligerent rhetoric, the fact that nothing has changed within the economy, that the deadlock within the government and the states has continued and even gotten worse despite the fact that even the--that, you know, the parliament and the presidency are now being controlled by the same conservative, you know, factions.",

        "They are just struggling now to go through day-to-day life.",
        "The economy was very bad, and each year I go it has gotten worse.",
        "And I think all the oil money's going to mullahs' pockets; if not all, at least half of it.",
        "Some of them have all these big accounts in Europe and in Canada and they are just putting the oil money there.",
        "So Iranians are just suffering.",
        "Of course, the politics are very much in their mind.",
        "They talk about it a lot, but they cannot do anything about it for the time being.",
        "Kaveh Ehsani, would you agree?",
        "Yes, although, I mean, you know, I think one of the tendencies in my country, and I mean Iran, is to kind of--the tendency to simplify things.",
        "I mean, the economy is bad in Iran, no doubt about it, but despite one of what I heard--just the end tail of one of your previous interviewees mention that, you know, Iran is really kind of--you know, its economy is in the boondocks.",
        "And this is a country that's been having a regular 5 to 7 percent increase in its GDP and growth rate over the past few years.",
        "So, you know, the problem is that despite the fact that the economy's growing and it's not just the oil, you know, but it's also industry and, you know, other sectors of the economy have been growing.",
        "The fact is that it doesn't trickle down, and the reason that it doesn't trickle down is not because mullahs--the so-called, you know, mythical mullahs have accounts, you know, in, you know, foreign bank accounts.",
        "I mean, that kind of corruption exists in pretty much every society that I know of in the developing world, and it's something to be abhorred and kind of resisted and fought over.",
        "But the reason is, you know, we have entrenched interests, you know, from the military to political class to other speculators who basically control significant parts of the economy and, you know, do not allow basically a more open economic sphere that would allow, you know, greater employment and, you know, trickling down of this wealth.",
        "Number one.",
        "And secondly, you don't have--did have in the 1980s a major war which really kind of affected the economy and it had a huge population boom.",
        "I mean, the population basically doubled from the early '70s to, you know, the mid-90s and, you know, this has put tremendous pressure on the resources of the country while those resources have been shrinking regularly.",
        "So this has to be taken into consideration, aside from the fact that Iran is under international sanctions, continuous international sanctions, primarily by the US."

        "Well, you know, Neal, we haven't had diplomatic relations with the Iranians for 25 years, since they took over our embassy and imprisoned our diplomats for 444 days.",
        "You all remember that.",
        "I certainly do.",
        "But we do talk to the Iranians from time to time.",
        "We have for the last 25 years through various channels, and obviously as Iran has direct interests in Iraq, as well as in Afghanistan, from time to time we discuss with them some of the challenges that we face in trying to provide stability there.",
        "And so this is going to be talks limited to the situation vis-a-vis Iraq?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, we do not have an embassy in Tehran.",

        "There are a lot of reasons for that, but from time to time we do have talks and, of course, when it comes to stability in Afghanistan, stability in Iraq, that's one of the major focuses of American foreign policy.",
        "As we heard earlier from our correspondent Mike Shuster about an offer from Russia to reprocess or enrich uranium in Russia for its nuclear power program, and this would presumably prevent that enrichment--uranium enrichment from being used for nuclear weapons.",
        "The Iranians have initially turned this down.",
        "Do you have hopes that they may reconsider?",
        "You know, it's hard to tell.",
        "The Iranians are very isolated in the world today concerning their nuclear ambitions.",
        "They insist on the right to have nuclear power plants, but they're also insisting on the right to enrich and reprocess and to perform all the functions of a nuclear fuel cycle within Iran itself, and that's dangerous, because the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is headed, by the way, the current Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Mohamed ElBaradei, has said that Iran withheld information for 18 years from the IAEA about its nuclear research program, and most countries in the world, including many of Iran's friends, believe that Iran is actually trying to build a nuclear weapons capability behind the guise of a peaceful civil nuclear program."

        "So the Russian offer to the Iranians, as we understand it, is designed to, in fact, say to the Iranians, `You can have civil nuclear power, but none of us really trust you to have that--have the enrichment and reprocessing done on Iranian soil.",
        "That should all be done beyond Iran.",
        "And we think--as President Bush and Secretary Rice said the other day, we think this proposal has merit, and we hope very much that it will--that the Iranians will be open to it.",
        "But, you know, so far the Iranians have been very dismissive.",
        "They've said, `Well, we'll be willing to talk about this, but we insist on our right to have all this happen on our own soil,' and I think that's a non-starter for nearly all the international community.",
        "And what happens if the Iranians insist on this position, what they say is an issue of national sovereignty?",
        "Well, I think that there's so much distrust of the Iranians on this issue--and this is not just from the United States.",
        "It's from all the European countries, and increasingly, I think, from Russia, China and India, three very large countries that have been involved in these talks.",
        "I think then if the Iranians simply won't go along with the general will of most countries, and that is to cease and desist from these activities, there's gonna have to be a debate in the UN Security Council, and there'll have to be a consideration of some kind of diplomatic action against Iran, such as sanctions.",
        "That is what the United States has long believed is one of the most viable options, but we've worked very hard this year to give diplomacy a chance, and we very much would like a diplomatic resolution of this problem.",
        "We've been backing the Europeans as well as the Russians in the talks, but the Iranians have not given much of a response, and part of that may be because of their elections this past summer when they elected a very conservative president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and he had taken the country on a quite radical course, deviating from many of the policies of the past, and he's concerned a lot of people around the world.",
        "I know you have to leave, but quickly, talk of sanctions on the nuclear side; at the same time you're hoping for cooperation on the Iraqi side.",
        "This is gonna be difficult.",
        "It's a difficult relationship to manage, Neal, you're right.",
        "We've got three major challenges with Iran.",
        "The first is to try to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons power.",
        "No one around the world wants to see a theocratic regime like the one in Tehran with nuclear weapons.",
        "It would be far too dangerous.",
        "Secondly, Iran has been, for many years, probably the leading supporter of state--of terrorism in the Middle East.",
        "They directly support and they finance Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah and Hamas.",
        "And so we've got a real beef with them because those terrorist groups are attacking Israel, Lebanon, and they're making life difficult for the Palestinians who want to have a peace process with Israel.",
        "And the third problem we've got, which is different from the first two, but it's very important, is that there's a significant democracy and human rights deficit in Iran.",
        "It is not a democracy, as you know.",
        "It's very much an authoritarian state, and there is not freedom of the press, for instance.",
        "People like you couldn't have a radio show like this if you were at all critical of the government.",
