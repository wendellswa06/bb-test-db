        "So we are working on all of those issues, and we have tried to bring together a different set of countries on each one of them to put some pressure on the Iranians to see if they can change their ways, but with this new government, most people don't have a lot of hope that we're gonna see an improvement any time soon.",
        "So I think you'll see a very strong focus on the part of our government and many around the world in trying to blunt the policies of the new Iranian government, and we've got to do that in a very assiduous way, and Iran has become for many of us one of the most important foreign policy challenges that we face today.",
