        "(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"\"THE SITUATION ROOM WITH WOLF BLITZER\"\")",
        "Some people have got to go, and it may be that they've got to go unjustly or maybe they're doing the best they can under the circumstances, that doesn't matter.",
        "You've got to give people a signal out there that something's not working and you're trying something else.",
        "OK, that was James Carville speaking on CNN.",
        "He wrote that the president should panic and fire all of his advisers.",
        "Is this just, you know, sort of Washington inside the beltway talk, or is there something to that?",
        "Well, I think certainly the need to send a different signal is one that everybody in the administration would recognize, but I think that the very recommendation that Carville was saying, that the president should panic and do something different, shows how difficult this calculation is.",
        "The president I once worked for, Jimmy Carter, was in a real situation of malaise in 1979.",
        "He gave a famous speech about malaise, which actually was popular until he panicked and asked most of the members of his Cabinet to resign, and that was one more step toward defeat for him in 1980.",
        "So the challenge for the president is showing that he takes seriously how the economy is just not changing as fast as he hoped and said it would without seeming to panic because his argument all the way along has been a steady long-term vision is what's required.",
        "And if he's suddenly throwing aside the people who have gotten him to this point, in a way, it undercuts the main argument he's making.",
        "What's actually kind of interesting, Jim, is that when it comes to things like foreign policy or his handling of terrorism, President Obama's poll numbers are higher, and you would never have thought of that when he was candidate Obama.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And I think I can't easily remember an administration that has gone this long without something really serious going wrong in international affairs.",
        "You can argue that the Israel-Palestinian negotiations have been the biggest failure so far for the administration, but he is managing the two wars he inherited in a at least politically acceptable way.",
        "Relationships with the big countries of China, Russia, the European partners, even Iran are not moving to the crisis point you might have expected when he came to office.",
        "So for somebody whose main argument coming in was about the need to change the internal tone of politics and the economy, it's striking that that's been his main problem, and his main successes so far have been international.",
        "That's James Fallows.",
        "He's national correspondent for The Atlantic.",
        "You can find his blog at jamesfallows.theatlantic.com.",
        "Jim, thanks so much."

        "Thank you, Guy.",
        "This whole debate is about a very, very small piece of the budget and is irrelevant with respect to our long-term fiscal position.",
        "That's Robert Rubin, former Treasury secretary.",
        "He was in that job the last time the government shutdown.",
        "But Rubin thinks the coming battle over raising the ceiling on the national debt is far more important.",
        "In 1995, a stalemate between President Clinton and congressional Republicans meant that Rubin had to scramble to find ways to keep paying the nation's debts without technically exceeding that limit.",
        "And we're almost at that point again.",
        "By current Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's calculations, the country's debt limit will be reached by May 16th unless Congress increases that limit.",
        "And as Robert Rubin reminded me, that's something Congress has done every time it's been asked.",
        "I personally think that it is unthinkable.",
        "I felt this in 1995, and I think this today.",
        "I think with all the rhetoric, it remains unthinkable that we will, as a nation, the richest country in the world default on our commitment.",
        "So I think in the final analysis, in one way or another, an agreement will be reached that will increase the debt limit.",
        "It may be that it'll take some time as happened in 1995.",
        "What happened in 1995 was we got to the date when the federal government's debt hit the debt limit and the Republican majority in Congress was saying to President Clinton, we won't raise the debt limit unless you exceed to our view of what should be done with respect to the budget.",
        "The president was opposed to their view, and it never came down to the dramatic confrontation that would have occurred one minute to midnight because the Treasury Department found a way to borrow fund from the employee pension funds to continue funding the commitments of the federal government.",
        "And that borrowing the pension funds was not considered debt for technical purposes.",
        "And we continued to do that for several months until finally the Congress increased the debt ceiling and that problem was solved.",
        "You wrote in an op-ed for the Financial Times recently that trying to do the same thing now would be much more difficult.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, that's correct.",
        "You could do the same thing today, borrowing from the pension funds.",
        "The problem is that because the numbers are so much bigger, and there's a limit to how much you can borrow, how much is available, you would - I'm told - I haven't done these calculations myself - but I'm told this could only be done for a much shorter period of time."

        "In other words, the Treasury will not be able to buy nearly as much time as we were able to buy to have the process sort of heal and have people come together.",

        "Senator Mike Lee of Utah says he'll filibuster any increase to the debt ceiling unless he can see a creditable plan to balance the nation's budget.",
        "Do you appreciate the Tea Party's point of view on this...",
        "That's right.",
        "This plea was worked out last week with prosecutors and defense lawyers.",
        "There were originally nine counts against her, and the government agreed to drop two of them in exchange for her pleading guilty to the other seven.",
        "So she has now pled guilty to four counts of mistreating prisoners, two counts of conspiracy to mistreat prisoners and one count of committing an indecent act.",
        "That carries a maximum sentence altogether of 11 years.",
        "What did Lynndie England have to say in court today?",
        "Early in the day she was very terse.",
        "The judge would ask her questions, and she would calmly, quietly say, `Yes, sir.",
        "But then he started going through the plea point by point, asking her to describe what had happened at Abu Ghraib.",
        "It seemed as though he wanted to see if she really believed that she was guilty of these crimes or if she had just been persuaded to submit a guilty plea.",
        "That led to another very contentious moment in the court.",
        "The judge was asking her to describe the night of October 23rd, 2003.",
        "He asked Lynndie England how she came to be photographed holding a prisoner on a leash; it's come to be an infamous photograph that most of the world has now seen.",
        "England said she went to the site to visit Charles Graner, who's now serving time for his role in the abuses, and that Graner put a leash on an uncooperative prisoner and asked England to take the leash and lead the prisoner out of his cell with it.",
        "England then stood for pictures with the prisoner on the leash.",
        "Now the judge asked England whether she knew at the time that what she did was wrong, and she replied, `I assumed it was OK because Graner was an MP'; that's a military policeman.",
        "`He had the background as a corrections officer.",
        "And with him being older than me, I didn't question him.",
        "That made the judge ask very sternly whether England really wanted to plead guilty.",
        "He seemed to imply that her lawyers may have persuaded her to take a plea deal when she didn't really believe that she was doing anything wrong at the time she allegedly committed the crimes.",
        "The judge said to England, `This is your trial.",
        "And then England's defense lawyer, who's maintained all along that his client is a scapegoat, very curtly replied, `I don't know that it is.",
        "The court then immediately recessed for lunch, and after lunch the questioning continued in that vein.",
        "Ari, you mentioned Charles Graner.",
        "This is the man who had a relationship with Lynndie England, was the father of her child.",
        "How does her version that she told in court today square with what she's said or what we've known up till now?",
        "It's been a very different story from what we've heard up until now.",
        "Lynndie England granted a media interview very early on, in which she said things similar to what Charles Graner said during his trial; namely, that higher-ups had ordered her to pose for these photos, that they were loosening up detainees for military intelligence.",
        "And that was very, very different from her story today.",
        "Today the judge kept pushing her to say that Graner or Frederick or someone else had coerced her to pose for these photographs against her will.",
        "But she kept insisting that she knew all along that it was wrong, that she did all of this of her own free will, that she could have left at any time and that, really, the strongest coercion against her was simply peer pressure.",
        "That message seemed to be an effort to get the judge to accept her guilty plea, which, at the very end of today's hearing, he finally did."
