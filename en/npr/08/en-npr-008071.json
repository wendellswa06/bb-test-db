        "And what do you mean by hollow democracy?",
        "Well, Turkey is certainly a country that holds free and fair elections on a regular basis.",
        "It has a parliament that is meaningful - political institutions that are meaningful.",
        "But over the course of the last three or four years, there has been somewhat of an authoritarian or illiberal turn in Turkish politics in which journalists had been jailed and intimidated, business concerns that have not necessarily towed the government line in a variety of issues had been slapped with punitive tax fines or hauled into court for questionable reasons.",
        "There has been efforts on the part of Prime Minister Erdogan and the dominant Justice and Development Party to write a new constitution outside of the constitutional committee that was charged with writing it.",
        "And that constitution is one that is tailored very specifically for Prime Minister Erdogan.",
        "There had been an accumulation of these kinds of things that add up to, essentially, reversals of some of the important political changes and democratic reforms that were made in 2003 and 2004.",
        "And someone have described it as a majoritarian dictatorship.",
        "Well, certainly, although Prime Minister Erdogan doesn't actually enjoy a majority, he got 49.95 percent of the vote.",
        "But I guess that's as close as you're going to get.",
        "But, indeed, there is a sense that the prime minister and the government rule with very little regard to half the country that disagrees with their view of the world and their policies.",
        "He governs half the country and intimidates the rest, and we saw that on full display in his responses to the protests in Taksim Square or Ankara or Izmir or some of the other cities where there had been pretty significant protests by calling them - as you pointed out, the protesters calling them thugs, alcoholics, extremists and so on and so forth.",
        "And saying - when somebody said, we can bring out thousands into the street or even hundreds of thousands, I can bring out millions.",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "And that's the - that's essentially the attitude of Prime Minister Erdogan and the people around him.",
        "One of his advisers wondered how one could call Turkey authoritarian if he got 50 percent of the vote.",
        "Well, you know, you can remind the prime minister's political advisers that, you know, people like Hosni Mubarak got 86 percent of the vote.",
        "Of course, their elections in Turkey aren't rigged as they were in Mubarak's Egypt, but just because one got 50 percent of the vote does not necessarily make the country a democracy.",
        "The important thing is the political institutions of the state are - had meaning and aren't rigged in favor of the people who happen to hold power at this moment, and that's precisely the kind of thing that the Justice and Development Party is doing in order to institutionalize its power for many, many years to come.",
        "Yet this is also - the prime minister, Erdogan, under his leadership the country has enjoyed an immense burst of prosperity."

        "Perhaps he wouldn't get 49.95 percent of the vote, but he would certainly get a very large number of votes.",
        "There is a growing middle class of people who vote on one issue and one issue only, and that's on their pocketbooks.",
        "Add that to a core constituency and the fact that the opposition parties are extraordinarily weak, don't have much to offer Turks in the way a positive vision for Turkey's future, and Prime Minister Erdogan, despite this being the greatest political crisis of his decade at power, would still prevail.",
