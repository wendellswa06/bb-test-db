        "Could you still name way more than seven?",
        "I couldn't name the laws, but nor could I say that we have reached true gender balance.",
        "There are still too few women in parliament, too few women in the top levels of business.",
        "But you guys have had a female president.",
        "We haven't.",

        "Then-Senator Barack Obama.",

        "I was aware that I had been thinking for a long time about the paternalistic and authoritarian nature of the way the church operated, particularly in Ireland at the time.",
        "But all of that, I was questioning.",
        "And then the questions came to surface.",
        "I don't need to go to mass every Sunday and feel guilty if I don't.",
        "I don't feel compelled to do it every Sunday or in a sort of strictly paid-up way, because I disagree with so much of what the church stands for, particularly in reproductive health.",
        "So does that mean that you don't follow the trial and tribulation of the Catholic Church, that you don't have any emotional investment in who might be the next pope or what's been going on?",
        "I think I'm more interested in the religions of the world giving us a kind of global, ethical standard, you know?",
        "And I like the work of Hans Kung who's being - looking at a global ethic.",
        "And I know him, and we've talked about this quite a bit.",
        "And I think we do need the spirituality of the great religions of the world.",
        "And it is important for human rights and human dignity.",
        "Well, since you brought up the battle that you have with the Catholic Church over reproductive rights, I have to ask you about the young wife who died in Ireland because she had a troubled pregnancy and she was in the hospital and they refused her an abortion.",
        "What reaction did you have to that story?",
        "There was a huge reaction in Ireland to that story.",
        "It really touched people.",
        "And people were ashamed that it had happened, such a lovely couple, so popular in Galway.",
        "They even said they came to Ireland to have children because it was such a safe country to have children in.",
        "And I think there is sometimes one single human tragedy that evokes a need for change.",
        "I must say I'm proud of the fact that so many people in Ireland were especially touched by that story to come out into the streets.",
        "And it was a bit like what happened in India with that rape in the bus of a young woman.",
        "Sometimes, something that was tolerated and not spoken about for a very long time becomes something that has to be dealt with.",
        "Let's talk about your foundation, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice.",
        "And I found it also intriguing that you called it Climate Justice.",
        "I assume you chose that name, yourself a constitutional lawyer.",
        "But to put Climate Change into the idea of justice, why?",
        "Because of the injustice of how climate change is undermining poverty in very poor countries and very poor communities.",

        "They don't have cars.",
        "They don't contribute to the oil and gas and coal problem that is causing this.",
        "And therefore, to me, there is an injustice that we have to draw attention to.",
        "But the good news is there's so much we can do.",
        "I find it shocking - and this is the first and probably the only statistic I'll use - that 1.3 billion people out of the seven billion in our world today don't have any electricity.",
        "But even more so, the 2.6 billion, mainly women, still cook on open fires, with coal, with wood, with animal dung and ingest fumes that cause four million to die every year.",
        "And that's a lot of people."

        "He began his political career as an aide to the late Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill.",
        "And he remains a fierce defender of the social safety net, but like President Obama himself, Lew has shown a willingness to make modifications to that safety net that he sees as necessary to preserving it for the long term."

        "Now, Senate Republicans have expressed some reservations about Jack Lew.",
        "What are their objections?",
        "Well, some of their objections are really better aimed at President Obama.",
        "There are some Republicans you'll see quoted who don't like Mr. Obama's policies and so they're taking that out on Jack Lew and presumably if there is a confirmation hearing, that could be an opportunity to air some of the grievances that the congressional Republicans have with the administration economic policies, although it's not very likely the president would nominate someone who doesn't share his own views.",
        "But Republicans have also complained about Lew as a negotiator.",
        "They've said that he has trouble getting to yes.",
        "In fact, Lew has not been the point person for the administration the last couple of rounds of negotiations with Republicans.",
        "Now, what Lew's defenders will say is that what the GOP really doesn't like is that he got the best of them in some of the earlier negotiations on a couple of occasions.",
        "He was able to outfox them and if they don't like somebody like that running the treasury department.",
        "Outfox them, how exactly?",
        "Well, just to give you one example, in the spring of 2011, the White House was negotiating with Republicans about an extension of the authority to keep the government's lights on basically.",
        "And the GOP was pushing for big spending cuts.",
        "They wanted more than $60 billion in spending cuts.",
        "They wound up compromising for what Republicans thought would be $38.5 billion in spending cuts, but when the Congressional Budget Office really dug into the details, they found that the short term spending cuts amounted to less than 1 percent of that.",
        "Now, Jack Lew had been budget director.",

        "Getting the debt ceiling raised is really going to be a top priority.",
        "The alternative to that would be a disaster.",
        "But then, in the next couple of months, we're also going to have those automatic spending cuts that were postponed as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations.",
        "Those are going to bounce back at us.",
