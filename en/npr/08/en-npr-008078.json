        "The thing is, it wasn't just people at - you know, at my company.",
        "We had to have assistance from other companies to pull this off.",
        "In order to pull off this fraud, to make it look like a real person closed on a real house, Toby needed a title company to certify his fake documents, so after his staff was onboard, Toby says he made some visits.",
        "And it was the same thing.",
        "It was - here's what happened.",
        "Here's the only way I know to fix it and, if you'll help me, great, and if you won't, I understand.",
        "And nobody said, maybe we better think about this or - you know, within a few minutes, I had approval that they were - yes, I'll help you.",
        "So now, we have people outside of Toby's company saying, sure, I'll help you do something completely illegal and wrong.",
        "Again, we did contact several of the title companies.",
        "No one would talk, but it's clear from the legal case that title companies were involved.",
        "One title company president ended up in jail because of his dealings with Toby.",
        "Another title company agreed to a legal resolution.",
        "But here's the point: when we hear about cases of massive fraud, we tend to hear about the individuals, the Ken Lays, the Bernie Madoffs, the Toby Groves.",
        "But for most big fraud scandals, you need large groups of people - auditors, regulators, staff - assisting in some way in the fraud.",
        "So to truly understand fraud, you have to understand two things.",
        "What's going on with the individuals we always hear so much about; the Tobys.",
        "But, also, you have to understand the helpers, the people who are willing to say: that immoral thing that you're doing right now - sure, I'll help you.",

        "What kind of bastard would do this?",
        "This is Lamar Pierce, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, and Pierce says, when confronted with stories of people like Toby, the vast majority of us just assume we would never behave that way.",
        "Eighty to 90 percent of people, I think, would say, I'm not capable of doing that and it may be higher.",
        "And how many of them are wrong?",
        "A large proportion, if not most people - you're wrong.",
        "Pierce is part of a group of researchers arguing that your assumption that you would not do wrong is based on a flawed premise: the misperception that, when people like Toby face an ethical decision, they clearly understand the choice that they're making.",

        "Now, psychologists have documented lots and lots of ways that our minds have trouble seeing or processing what is directly in front of us.",
        "Ann Tenbrunsel is a researcher at the University of Notre Dame and she gave us one very small example of this.",
        "It has to do with something simple - the way a decision is framed.",
        "The way that the decision is presented to me very much changes the way in which I view that decision and then eventually the decision it is that I reach.",
        "Essentially, Tenbrunsel is arguing that certain frames make us blind to the fact that we are confronting an ethical problem at all.",
        "And, to prove this, she recently did this experiment where she got together two groups of people.",
        "One, she told...",
        "Think about a business decision, think about what aspects are involved.",
        "The others, she told to think about an ethical decision.",
        "Then Tenbrunsel had her subjects do an unrelated task to distract them and presented them with an opportunity to cheat.",
        "And those cognitively primed to think about business behaved radically differently from those who were not, no matter who they were or what their moral upbringing had been.",
        "If you're thinking about a business decision, you are significantly more likely to lie than if you were thinking from an ethical frame.",
        "According to Tenbrunsel, a business frame cognitively activates one set of goals - to be competent, to be successful.",
        "And, once you're in that frame, you're really focused on meeting those goals, and other goals, like ethics, can completely fade from view.",
        "Tenbrunsel listened to Toby's story and she argues that one way to understand Toby's initial choice to lie on his loan application is to consider the cognitive frame that he was using."

        "It's that they have these huge cognitive blind spots which make it difficult for them to see what they're doing as unethical, even when it is profoundly unethical.",
        "A lot of fraud is unintentional.",
        "Which might help explain the first part of Toby's story, how a man who swore to his beloved father to be ethical broke that promise.",

        "Emissions testers who generally make a modest salary see a Civic and identify.",
        "They feel empathetic.",
        "Essentially, Gino and Pierce are arguing that these testers commit fraud not because they are greedy, but because they are nice.",

        "You're helping someone who's real and that I care about.",
        "Gino and Pierce argue Toby's staff were faced with the same kind of decision - future abstract consequences or help out the very real person in front of them.",
        "And so, without focusing on the ethics, they helped out a person who was not focusing on the ethics either, and together they perpetrated a $7 million fraud.",
        "In 2006, that fraud was actually discovered.",
        "FBI agents showed up at Toby's office and he says he quickly confessed.",
        "Two years later, he was in jail, grateful that his father wasn't alive to see him, wondering how he had gone so wrong.",

        "Was it - I mean, did I know myself?",
        "You know, the last thing I ever wanted to do in my life would be to break that promise to my dad, so those were things that haunted me every second of every day.",
        "Now, if these psychologists and economists are right, if we are all capable of behaving profoundly unethically without realizing it, then there are some concrete changes we could make to our workplaces, to our regulations, changes that would take into account how our minds actually work."
