        "To have a meteor shower suddenly appear with rates of tens or hundreds per hour, that's a very rare thing, and it's a unique opportunity both from just going out and looking at it and scientifically because simply by counting meteors, we can tell how active this comet was long before we were born.",

        "He owned houses all over the city and his houses were destroyed all over the city including several modest two-family homes near a levee break.",

        "We visited this devastated area with Scully and two other people with close connections to the neighborhood.",

        "Yeah, I think we will come back.",
        "The man trying to comfort her is Fred Johnson.",
        "He spent two decades helping low-income residents buy their homes, some of which has now been torn off their foundations.",
        "The waters of the Mississippi and Lake Pontchartrain was washed up by the force of God which put everything on the banks of the city and said, `Here are the things that you wouldn't deal with, so deal with them now.'",
        "We brought these three people together as we continue our discussions about the future of New Orleans.",
        "We were in a neighborhood whose destruction led to suggestions that it never be rebuilt.",
        "We stopped near an entire intact roof that was no longer attached to a house.",
        "We found a bit of shade on a street that's caked in dried mud and that's where the teacher, the landlord and the activist talked.",
        "Though she sometimes had to take a break to cry, Charese Harrison Nelson said she is determined to stay."

        "And if you rebuild under these conditions, nobody could afford the insurance or they could find insurance.",
        "So right now even in areas of the city that haven't been affected in the Kenner, Metairie area, it's very difficult to find insurance companies that are going to write policies.",
        "Even in the areas that were not as hard hit, it's hard to find insurance at this moment?",
        "Yeah, because of the fact is that the insurance companies are taking a big hit on other areas of the city.",
        "They have the bottom line on it because nothing will get accomplished, nothing will be built, nothing will be sold unless the insurance companies are going to be backing the homeowners or the investment owners.",
        "What insurance company is going to step up to the plate and start insuring people right away without rebuilding the levee system?",
        "When we look around this neighborhood which is near the levee breach where most of the houses are just piles of wood now--we're looking at appliances and cars that floated into the yards of houses that no longer exist, trees snapped in half--where do you start in a situation like this?"
