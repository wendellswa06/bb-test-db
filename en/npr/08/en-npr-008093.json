        "This is not the Turkish analog of the Egyptian uprising.",
        "As I said, Turkish political institutions have been - some of them, at least, have been hollowed out by the actions of the Justice and Development Party, but one thing that's been strong throughout the days of coups and returns to civilian control dating back to the mid-1940s, there has been a multi-party political system in which parties could contest elections.",
        "And those elections have been free and fair.",
        "And the expectation is that that is the way - the expectation of Turks, that is the way in which to change governments.",
        "We're talking with Steven Cook, a senior fellow on Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "He wrote a piece with Michael Koplow, \"\"How Democratic Is Turkey?\"\" which ran in Foreign Policy on Monday.",
        "You can find a link to it at our website.",
        "Go to npr.org, click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And this description of this hollow democracy, as you describe it, then brings us to the example, the model of Turkey, which has been held out to the newly emerging governments in Egypt, in Libya and in other places as this is the way toward a Islamic democracy.",
        "Indeed.",
        "It seem that once the Justice and Development Party came to power in 2002 and undertook these broad-ranging political reforms that here was an example of a Muslim majority country, an Islamist political party accumulating power, exercising that power in a officially secular political order.",
        "And to boot, they were successful economically.",
        "And I think that many people in the Arab World see Turkey and understand that it has much to offer them.",
        "But the problem is just at the time that - not just the United States, but others were holding out Turkey as a model or inspiration for the Arab World - was when this process of hollowing out Turkey's democratic institutions begin, and that this illiberal drift in the Turkish - in Turkish politics was getting underway, yet people continue to hold out the Turkish model.",
        "This is certainly not what people in the Arab World initially rose up against - rose up for.",
        "Turkey is certainly better than Egypt or Tunisia or Libya.",
        "But some of the things that Prime Minister Erdogan and the party have done are, in fact, reminiscent of the authoritarian moves that dictators in the Middle East had undertaken during their times in office.",
        "And this revision of the constitution, many believe that Prime Minister Erdogan wants a constitution that will allow him to be a much more powerful Turkish president.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "This has been a cause celebre in Turkey whether or not the Justice and Development Party will respect the interparliamentary committee that is drafting a new constitution, or will they try to go around this committee, which they take part in, and table their own constitution that has been written specifically to allow for a more powerful presidency that ultimately Prime Minister Erdogan would occupy that office, and he would exercise a range powers that the Turkish presidency does not have at - under the present configuration of powers in the country.",
        "And it would also allow him to stay in power for years to come.",
        "And so as you look toward the future of Turkey, what lessons do you think the prime minister ought to derive from these demonstrations which are, as you suggest, the greatest challenge in his political career?",
        "At Paris' busy Gare du Nord train station, extra Eurostar trains to Britain and Belgium have been added, but they, too, are booked through Monday.",
        "Iceland's volcanic eruption only seems to be growing worst, and officials are now talking about airport closures lasting into next week.",
        "That was enough to push Frenchman Nicholai Chastaneie(ph) who lives in Moscow to take the train."

        "You know, the prime minister during his first term in office between 2003 and 2007 was pragmatic, did seek consensus on important issues of the day.",
        "So it's clear that he has it within him.",
        "I think over the years the increasing, increasingly better electoral returns, a sort of detachment from the people, which is ironic because he made his political career on being close to the people - if he returns to that pragmatism, to that consensus building, if he understands somehow that in a democracy it is not just majority rules, that the voice and desires of the minority deserve a hearing as well, it will certainly put Turkey on a better path.",
        "But again, based on recent events, it's unclear that he is able to do that, which is a concern about the future path for Turkey's politics.",
        "And in terms of the United States, the prime minister has enjoyed a close relationship with President Obama.",
        "In recent days, American officials have called for restraint by Turkish forces against the protesters.",
        "But this is a country on whom the United States leans for help with Syria and with Iran as well.",
        "It goes without saying that Turkey throughout has been a strong partner and a strategic ally of the United States.",
        "There is not an issue - an important issue in American foreign policy in that part of the world that Turkey is not involved in or touches on in either direct or indirect ways.",
        "And I think that's why the administration has been somewhat reluctant previously to call Erdogan out on, for example, freedom of the press and freedom of expression.",
        "But at the same time, we should be able to work with a strategic partner and at least politely point out that the reversals in Turkey's democratic transition is not good for Turkey and not good for the strategic relationship.",
        "Steven Cook, thanks very much for your time, as always.",

        "Nice to talk to you, Audie.",
        "So to start, back in 2013, what intention of this legislation - allowing migrant workers to drive legally - what was the need you thought you were meeting?",
        "There are about 1,500 undocumented people, mostly Mexicans, working on Vermont dairy farms.",
        "And they are, basically, supporting our dairy industry.",
        "And the need was that so many of them were living in the shadows of the barns - really literally.",
        "They did not have transportation.",

        "- of people in the country illegally; people who have gotten these driver's licenses.",

        "Well, I feel terrible that we facilitated this law and now it's putting people in jeopardy.",
        "And that was not the intent of law at all.",
        "And so it's very, very distressing to hear what's been going on.",
        "As you probably know, in 2017, the state officially ended this policy.",
        "But in the meantime, there have been other sharing of information by DMV, maybe not at the top levels, with ICE officials.",
        "So now you have this same migrant advocacy group effectively suing the DMV, suing ICE over this move.",
        "At this point, are you about to kind of wait and see until things shake out legally or is there going to be a legislative push alongside this?",
        "Well, my understanding is that this is in early stages - the lawsuit.",
        "And our session doesn't start again until January, so there's sort of time to work on some legislation and see what the legislation needs to be in order to have greater protections.",
        "Facial recognition is a tool that law enforcement can use for good - for instance, to find missing children.",
        "Are there situations under which you'd support that kind of cooperation?",
        "Well, certainly, I think in the case of missing children, in the case of some kind of criminal act.",
