        "And so the initial line was, gosh, this is a particularly sort of unit that's out of control, something that's not in keeping with the behavior of most American troops, don't focus on this as representative of the larger war effort, not to give ammunition to the critics of the war, and therefore part of it was to separate it out as a matter of line of authority, to say that this is not a reflection of problems with the war, with inadequate number of troops on the ground or poor supervision.",
