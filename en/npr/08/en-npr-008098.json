        "And I'm wondering if this is a serious move by al-Sadr and his supporters, a permanent move, or something just to make a statement for this meeting.",
        "Well that's really the key question if this suspension by Sadr forces temporary or permanent.",
        "If it is the latter it could have extremely serious consequences for al-Maliki's already shaky, precarious government.",
        "The prime minister is now in the tough position of trying to hold together his fragile power base back in Iraq amid continued violence and bloodshed and at the same time still, of course, very much needs the close cooperation and support of the American government.",
        "And his supporters today said, quote, \"This meeting is a provocation to the feelings of the Iraqi people and a violation of their constitutional rights,\" end quote.",
        "And sources tell NPR that al-Sadr forces are saying this is a permanent break.",
        "But I think that remains to be seen.",
        "Why is this meeting happening in Amman, Jordan?",
        "Well Amman certainly a much safer venue these days than Baghdad although security on the streets of Amman has been beefed up incredibly following last November's deadly hotel bombings.",
        "And security is extremely tight here today.",
        "And Jordan's King Abdullah is a strong U.S.",
        "ally who rules over a relatively stable country in a difficult region.",
        "And there are certainly strong anti-American feelings on the street, especially among some of the Jordanian Palestinians who've settled here.",
        "But I've been surprised that many Jordanians and Iraqi refugees that I've been speaking with, Madeleine, are voicing some cautious optimism and are proud of the fact that Jordan is playing a role here."
