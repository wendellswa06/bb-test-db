        "Now, what else do we know about what could come up at this summit?",
        "Well, we - President Trump would not say when it would happen, but he said a time and a location has been chosen.",
        "He did rule out the DMZ.",
        "He had floated that as a possibility.",
        "What stands out to me, though, is that he's being really optimistic about this meeting.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "And I think it will be very successful.",
        "But as I always say, who knows?",
        "Who knows what's going to happen?",
        "But it's going to be a very important event.",
        "A very important event - what are the risks in raising expectations about the president's ability to negotiate with North Korea?",
        "There definitely is some risk.",
        "President Trump likes to be front and center for all of these decisions, and he likes to make clear that he's in charge.",
        "He doesn't rely on spokespeople or diplomats to get his message out.",
        "But with a complicated and challenging issue like North Korea, if things go wrong, then he's out front getting blamed.",
        "Another thing is that President Trump really likes to focus on his personal relationships with foreign leaders as a way to get his agenda done.",
        "But personal relationships really can only get you so far when it comes to foreign policy.",
        "It doesn't matter how much you get along.",
        "Leaders will look out for their own country's interests.",
        "Obviously the stakes are high, but is there more of a risk putting so much focus on just this one meeting?",
        "Experts I've talked to say yes because ultimately what comes after the meeting will be most important.",
        "Obviously all eyes will be on this summit.",
        "But the difficult part of these talks will be the behind-the-scenes, where the U.S.",
        "and North Korea will need to agree on what it means to denuclearize North Korea or - and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and how to implement that.",
        "That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe.",

        "I think we've seen that, particularly in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone, where if--you know, the youngest soldiers were the ones committing the most horrific acts--mutilations, amputations, sexual assaults against women and young girls.",

        "Who was he and what happened to him?",
        "Francois, like so many Rwandan youths, was, unfortunately, caught up in the frenzy of the genocide, and he was a teen-ager who happened to be half Tutsi and half Hutu.",
        "And in the context of the Hutu-led genocide, he was forced to choose, choose where his--he was--his allegiances lie, where he was committed to be identified.",
        "And when the marauders came to his home, his village, he was forced to kill the children of his sister, who themselves were half Hutu and half Tutsi.",

        "This has been the largest and deepest survey of this many healthy individuals over this many different body sites.",
        "It's been interesting since each of these body sites, these areas, represent really a different ecosystem.",
        "They're very different.",
        "So profiling what the normal variation, even in health, there's a tremendous number of differences between people and seeing how those map out, what the boundaries of that healthy variation are from person to person at each of these different body sites is really important for the project to lay out.",
        "So which site has the most germs in it?",
        "Well, it depends by what you mean by most.",
        "An example might be in the oral cavity.",
        "We observe the largest diversity there, for example the greatest difference in the number of bugs that tend to be in the mouth and how they differ in abundance.",
        "But when you go looking between individuals, a lot of that diversity is shared, whereas if you go to a sparser ecosystem - the skin has been called, for example, a microbial desert.",
        "Each person tends to carry fewer bugs on the skin, but those fewer bugs are more different between people.",
        "So there's lots of ways to slice this variation that we tried to look at in these papers.",
        "And which part of the body would we say has the fewest number?",
        "The fewest number, the skin for example is a good example of a habitat that tends to carry fewer microbes.",

        "Dr.",
        "Huttenhower, it's interesting for me to hear you say that the skin is relatively a desert because we've had other scientists on who do nothing but swab people's skins down and look at the biota that's growing on them.",
        "They find countless numbers.",
        "Is this a comparative number, you're saying, that compared to other parts of the body, the skin is like a desert?",
        "Absolutely, and if you think about macro ecosystems, for example, it's certainly not true that you find no life in a desert.",
        "But if you compare that, for example, to nutrient availability for these bugs in the mouth or in the gut, there are differences both in energy metabolism and what's available for the bugs to eat and in the ways they interact with each other and with your immune system, for example.",
        "There's a great deal more surface area in your gut, exposing all of these microbes to your immune system than there would be on the skin.",
        "So why doesn't the immune system, if there are trillions of these bugs in our guts, why don't the immune system attack it?",
        "That's an excellent question.",
        "That's something that's been under a lot of scrutiny lately since there are at least two answers, one having to do with sort of historical co-evolution.",
        "There have been several other good studies that look at how different hosts, other mammals, for example, have co-evolved with their microbiomes.",
        "And then for humans in particular, it's thought that we experience, early in life, training of the immune system based on the microbes that are present.",
        "So studies are looking at, for example, the effect of different exposures or antibiotics early in life that might interfere with that training.",
        "You said there was a difference between - not only between the bugs that inhabit our own bodies but between me and someone else.",
        "We have different microbiota...",
        "Definitely.",
        "One of the things to keep in mind when thinking about the diversity in the microbiome is that even though people share 99-percent-plus of their human DNA, of our genomes, we're lucky if we share 50 percent of our microbiome at any one particular body site.",
        "So understanding all of that variation and defining its boundaries made that part of the project's goal very important.",

        "So that's an area where there have been some good studies on the differences that show up in infants' microbiomes soon after birth, depending on whether they're delivered naturally or by C-section.",
        "This study looks specifically at adults, 18 to 40.",
        "So we had a little bit of information available about their early life experiences, but we didn't go looking for factors that would be more specific to infancy and development.",
        "What about pregnant women and non-pregnant women?",
        "We have to be very careful when we say this is a study about health.",

        "Thank you, Victoria, good question.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So women who were - so you didn't study whether the biome changes if you're pregnant or before or after you get pregnant or other parts of the body that are involved, might be.",
        "There were some other studies elsewhere in the consortium and ongoing now using this as a baseline with which to compare, for example, the pregnant microbiome.",
        "But this was - one of the defining characteristics of the Human Microbiome Project in particular was the very high stringency of clinical health screening at all of the body sites that the subjects had to meet.",
        "That's a great example.",
        "There are more differences between these 18 different body sites than there are between individuals, even within a body site, and I've already said how big differences between the individuals are.",
        "And that was true even for these very similar microbial habitats like the two surfaces just above and below the gumline, that even though those communities were - overall they shared a lot of similarities, you could still find differences within individuals just across those few millimeters due to, for example, there's more oxygen availability.",
        "So you mean the type or the number of bacteria that would be above and below the gumline?",
        "Mostly type, mostly type."
