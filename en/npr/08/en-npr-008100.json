        "We know we need bacteria to digest food.",
        "Do we all have the same colonies?",
        "That's - like all of the other habitats, there is a wide range of variation in the gut, even at the level of whole groups of bacteria, that certain individuals would be populated by one large group of bacteria, whereas other individuals, again even with this relative homogeneous, healthy population, would have a completely different group of bacteria.",
        "But one of the things we did find during this study is that the same tasks have to get carried out.",
        "Even when you have different bugs in a habitat like the gut, they still have to be performing the same jobs.",
        "So it's interesting to see how these ecosystems found a balance of getting the necessary jobs performed, the necessary microbial processes, even when it was by different bugs in different people.",

        "Yeah, I was wondering, because of the sheer number of microbes on the body, why don't we notice?",
        "I mean, what's the volume?",
        "Like if I weigh 200 pounds, how much of that weight is actually microbes?",
        "And are they all bacteria, or are you counting viruses and fungus, too?",
        "And I was just wondering about that stuff.",
        "Do you think these things are teaming up and causing some kind of toxins that could be maybe be causing cancer and other diseases?",

        "More than you probably want to think about.",

        "So even though there are many more microbial cells, they're small, but small is non-trivial.",
        "It's still several pounds of microbes, mostly in your gut."

        "The HMP, even though it studied or because it studied a healthy cohort, now gives us the boundaries of what the range of normal looks like so that if we look at new populations, either in different locations or with different genetic backgrounds or in specific diseases, we'll be better able to define which microbes or which microbial processes fall outside of those bounds in disease conditions of interest.",
