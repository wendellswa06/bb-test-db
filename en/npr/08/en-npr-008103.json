        "Let's talk a little bit about this specific award, the A.",
        "Philip Randolph Messenger Award, and the AIDS-HIV coverage.",
        "There has been sometimes a tendency in our Africa-American media to say, well we don't want to address things head on.",
        "Other times, there have been huge amounts of social challenge and social justice on behalf of the community by African-American newspapers.",
        "Do you ever get caught up in that tension between painting a good picture of the community, and dealing with the hard issues?",
        "Every day.",
        "And sometimes, trying to resolve issues, you have to frequently bring out the worse.",
        "But the only way I believe that we're going to resolve this issue about AIDS and the virus itself, it's (unintelligible) we have to go and talk about the very serious and devastating effects that it has on our community and any community.",
        "When you really think about your city, Philadelphia, and all of the wonderful things about it and all of the challenges that it, like any city faces, how would you describe it to someone who's never been there?",
        "Well, I think this is the greatest city in America.",
        "Bear in mind that I take an enormous amount of pride in the fact that this is the birthplace of this nation, of this place called America.",
        "This is where it began, right here in Philadelphia.",
        "Do you think, this is something that we find as part of our job at NEWS & NOTES, which is an African-American and African diaspora program, but we have listeners of all races.",
        "Do you find that you can serve both an African-American audience and what's called a general interest audience at the same time?",
        "How about this?",
        "Understated and a heading under the main heading.",
        "It's very interesting since I think it's ghost of racial tension's past.",
        "I am in New York today, and the way that the Bell verdict is being played here is one of anxiety over the possibility of civil unrest riots or people acting out, anger in the part of the black community.",
        "It takes you again back to something more like the '60s and that kind of anxiety and anger on the street, the potential for it at least.",
        "And in the case of Barack Obama, the way that it relates as I think it points out, differences in black, white perceptions, if you think about, for example, this week Reverend Wright, Jeremiah Wright, coming front and center in terms of Barack Obama's campaign.",
        "He speaks with a lot of anger and he says he's speaking to people who are really feeling hurt, and his opinions are being distorted and played for advantage by a white media.",
        "All of this I think plays to what some people had seen as past racial issues in America and that Barack Obama was America's future, and he was transcending race, and somehow, Alex, on this day, we're very much back in the middle of it.",
        "You mentioned Reverend Jeremiah Wright.",
        "I saw him last night.",
        "The lead on ABC News, a clip from these interviews that are playing tonight, Bill Moyers on PBS has a lengthy interview with him.",
        "I actually thought this might help Senator Obama because when you see Reverend Wright talking about the clips that have been played and when you see him, he seems like a much more reasonable person.",
        "His demeanor is just low key.",
        "He seems as if he's a thoughtful person and he claims that his words were taken out of context, and again, he appeals to the idea that there was media distortion.",
        "The problem here is two for one.",
        "The very fact of the interview and the fact that he is going to have a speech in Detroit at an NAACP meeting and then go on to Washington to the National Press Club on Monday makes him now the focus of attention, and it's a focus of very negative attention because you can imagine this is an opportunity for any of the networks to play more of the incendiary clips about, you know, KKK USA or the \"\"God blank America\"\" comment."

        "Those are powerful things and I think they have not helped Barack Obama especially with white working class voters, the very voters that he has been unable to get ahold of in his effort to what we in the political circle have said in cliche terms as close the deal, finally defeat Hillary Clinton.",
        "When you look back at the results from Pennsylvania this week, what you see is his failure with that constituency was central to his defeat.",
        "Well, what does Senator Obama do now, Juan?",
        "Does he just wait for this to go away or does he have to get out in the next few days, make another speech or take some kind of stance?",
        "This is the hard part.",
        "Exactly, how do you deal with Reverend Wright being all over the airwaves in advance then of the May 6th primaries in North Carolina and Indiana?",
        "Indiana is just so critical.",
        "If Barack Obama is able to win there, he's likely to win in North Carolina.",
        "The betting is, he wins the North Carolina.",
        "But if he is able to hold off Hillary Clinton in Indiana, then it would be seen that he really has thing in hand.",
        "But, here comes more of these issues just to drag him down.",
        "So, if he speaks to it, he adds fuel to the fire.",
        "If he doesn't speak to it, he allows the dynamic to stay in place.",

        "You're the first cohort of the first program of this kind anywhere in this country or anywhere else we can think of.",
        "The Matsuis wanted to help families similar to those who helped their orchid business grow.",
        "Many of the students in this cohort are the children of farm workers or immigrants themselves.",
        "The hope was to train them for jobs at Silicon Valley tech giants like Apple, Uber and Salesforce, and some have accepted jobs at those big-name companies.",
        "But since the program launched three years ago, a new opportunity has emerged to do high-tech work here in the growing field of agricultural technology."
