        "More than five years ago, Carter founded an environmental justice group called Sustainable South Bronx after returning home and seeing her community in a new light.",
        "My awakening into environmentalism in general actually happened when I was quite grown, like in my 30s, when I moved back to my neighborhood - and this is South Bronx in New York City - after aching to leave it for so many years because it really was this, you know, sort of degraded place, the kind of place that was the epitome of urban blight.",
        "And then coming back home and realizing that, you know, the fact that our community, you know, was built, you know, in a way that actually sort of degraded people's quality of life, that there were all these waste facilities.",
        "That there were power plants, that there was diesel truck traffic that, you know, on a daily basis makes people's lives miserable.",
        "And our community was actually created and regulated to be that way because it was a politically expedient place to put all of these environmental burdens.",
        "And so seeing that, and feeling that, and smelling that, frankly, I was sort of politicized and realized that if we weren't as a community proposing our own alternatives for the kind of environmental benefits that would reap - that would come back to us in the form of whether it was jobs, whether it was clean air, whether it was just an improved quality of life.",
        "And that, you know, again, in my thirties, was my awakening.",
        "So your parents moved to the neighborhood in the 1940s, and I'm sure between the 1940s and the time that you grew up the air probably got thicker and heavier and seedier and…",

        "All of the above.",
        "I literally, you know, from the time I - and also, the neighborhood was very different when my parents moved there in the '40s, you know, because it was this mostly white working class community and this was, like, their first step up the economic ladder.",
        "And because of many years of this disinvestment, you know, by public and private entities, the neighborhood just, you know, devolved into this sort of wasteland in a lot of ways.",
        "You know, I just thought, there's just nothing worth it about being and living in a city, you know, especially in a poor community.",
        "Because this is what happens, not understanding the political, you know, aspect around it, which is why, at this point, I've dedicated my life into, you know, helping, you know, my community understand that there - as we propose alternatives that actually create a better quality of life for us, it's not just about, you know, because we are, like, tree-huggers or anything like that.",

        "You know, that is just, like, that's a right.",
