        "Well, it shouldn't raise any eyebrows.",
        "Voting in America is the quintessential part of our democracy, and once a felon has paid his or her time and is no longer under any charges, in my opinion, should be given the incentive for civilized behavior by restoring the right to vote.",
        "Several states have taken it away.",
        "Some states give it back.",
        "I think there should be federal legislation.",
        "President Carter and President Ford studied this issue a number of years ago and came to the very same conclusion.",
        "I was asked the question after defending my--or I should say supporting an extension of the Voting Rights Act here on the anniversary of its passage in 1965--I was asked the question, do I think that an ex-convict who has done time, paid their dues, so to speak, and meet all the conditions that society has imposed upon them for punishment for a crime, should they be allowed to vote?",
        "And I said under those conditions, yes.",
        "So the hearings are going to go on.",
        "They're going to discuss this, and I said unambiguously I favored giving them a chance to restore their normal civilized life.",
        "You also talked about how this affects the African-American community disproportionately since African-Americans are disproportionately charged with felonies.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I was making the point that in Florida, there were 600 to 700,000 people who were denied a chance to participate in the 2000 elections who were ex-convicts, ex-felons who paid their dues, served their time, met all the conditions of probation, and a majority of them were African-American.",
        "And let's face it.",
        "Voting registration in the past was used by some to deny African-Americans their right to vote, and this country has an obligation in the 21st century to, I think, remove every single impediment to every American having the right to vote and every American having his or her vote count.",
        "All right.",
        "Secretary Jack Kemp, thanks so very much for spending time with us today.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Well, that was a real event.",
        "The first commercially sliced bread was sold in Chillicothe, Mo., on July 7, 1928.",
        "People had to slice it themselves in the old days.",
        "The innovation is now the occasion for an annual bluegrass festival, and lawmakers are debating a bill to declare sliced bread day, which would be the greatest holiday since - whatever.",
        "It's MORNING EDITION.",
        "Well, in the South Bronx, we handle about 30 percent of the city's commercial waste, you know, about a hundred percent of the Bronx's residential waste.",
        "And we've got about four power plants, a sewage treatment plant.",
        "And we have less than half an acre of open space per thousand people, and that is five times less than what the New York City Department of City Planning says that you should have.",
        "You're supposed to have 2.5 acres for every thousand people.",
        "And, you know, parks in particular are not just there just because they're pretty and green.",
        "They're there because they actually give communities like free opportunities to develop community pride by actually being around; they're eyes on the street.",
        "That's why, you know, when my neighborhood was much younger, it was such a cool place to be because all of those, you know, the parents that lived there would hang out their windows and talk to their kids, or to talk to anybody else's kids and, you know, Ms. Merry up the street.",
        "So if I was something we weren't supposed to do, then, you know, you know, my mother found out about it long before there were telephones or Internet.",
        "And that's what parks and that's what, you know, developing a street network that allows people to feel safe and comfortable allows them to do.",
        "And it also gives them opportunities to get physical exercise, in particular in the black and Latino community where so many of us, you know, are overweight and are obese.",
        "You know, developing the kind of street life that is positive, that produces opportunities for people to get outside more is also an economic and also an environmental justice issue as well."

        "I lived in New York for many years, and I lived in Brooklyn and Manhattan, never in the Bronx, but went up there many times and saw a lot of different sides of the Bronx, even the South Bronx, which at a certain point had, like, the worst reputation within the Bronx, has really changed.",
        "Do you feel that things are getting better, that there is hope?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "There has been, I think, a nexus of support, you know, for the human condition of people living in the South Bronx, whether it's, you know, environmental justice groups or housing or public health advocates; yes, that's all happening.",
        "Much of that, honestly, is being threatened.",

        "As an environmental justice group, we're advocating for, you know, the proper reuse of our waste.",
        "We're trying to push a project called the Eco-Industrial Park that actually uses recycled materials as raw material, and actually takes advantage of the regional transportation network of barge and rail access and providing hundreds of jobs for the community by building this collection of businesses that uses recycled materials.",
        "But right now our city is also, you know, pushing the idea of building more jail cells as well.",
        "You know, so it's kind of like we have to, I think, you know, think about the development of our communities comprehensively and not just think about them in terms of, well - you know, like we're specifically trying to use the environment, you know, as an economic driver, you know.",
        "Like, we need to be a part of that whole climate change game at this point so that we're actually being a part of the solution by training our people, you know, in the development of clean tech industries, so that we're the ones actually learning how to make solar panels and green roofs, and putting them on.",
        "And putting our people to work so that we can actively play, have both a financial as well as a personal stake in the development of our environment.",
        "And if we're not doing that as a people, as a culture, as a country, then, unfortunately, the people who will be suffering most from, you know, the rising sea change, you know, from climate change, it is going to be poor people and poor people of color.",
        "And that is something that we have to understand.",
        "That's why I'm so grateful that you've given me the opportunity to sort of raise that as an issue.",
        "Obviously, I'm not the only person, you know, in this country doing this in environmental justice communities.",
        "There are plenty, plenty more, but we don't necessarily know that, you know, as communities, and especially poor communities because the issues are so great.",
        "This is a great opportunity that we have to be a part of a countrywide, you know, debate.",
