        "Starbucks, when they first expanded beyond Seattle in the early - or rather the late 80s, Howard Schultz, the CEO of the company, set out to make it a third place where people would gather between their homes and their offices.",

        "They're really spread throughout the country, everywhere from big cities like New York, and Chicago, and Los Angeles, to smaller towns such as Bloomfield, New Mexico.",
        "And we're not seeing much of a pattern in the closings other than the fact that most of them had been opened within the past two and a half years.",
        "And these are different - I would assume, the reactions are different.",
        "If it's, well, in a place where there's 15 Starbucks within walking distance, or it's a place that only has one Starbucks in town.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I think we're seeing the strongest reactions from the smaller towns that are losing, perhaps, their only Starbucks.",
        "I've heard from some customers who say there isn't another Starbucks for 10 or 15 miles away.",
        "At the same time, we've also heard from customers in New York City where I think many people feel like there's a Starbucks every other block who felt an attachment to that particular Starbucks or were really excited because it was going to be opening in a building where their office was moving to.",
        "And are some states being hit harder than others?",
        "On a percentage basis, yeah.",
        "The states that are losing the highest number of locations are California, Florida, and Texas in that order.",

        "That includes Starbucks that are run by licensees.",
        "North Dakota, Minnesota, and Nebraska are also going to lose somewhere in the 30 percent range of their Starbucks.",
