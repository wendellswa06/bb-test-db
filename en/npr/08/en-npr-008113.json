        "That didn't happen in this case.",
        "But look, there has been a lot of efforts to improve police and community relationships.",
        "I certainly have been involved in that.",
        "I think progress is being made.",
        "But on the other hand, you still have a lot of it occurring on a routine basis, particularly in significant urban communities where there are large black populations, Hispanic populations.",
        "It is ongoing, and you know, at my efforts, we try to work with this.",
        "We have to understand what police officers are trying to do, which I'm constantly trying to advise, but you have situations where an officer assumes certain facts, given that they've been called to a situation, and before they allow a person to sort of advise and tell what their position is or to demonstrate that they're not engaged in unlawful activities, they frequently are treated in a very rough, aggressive manner.",
        "They're handcuffed, and if they resist in any way about why they are being treated this way, they are physically assaulted.",
        "So it happens a lot in this community, particularly in urban communities.",
        "I think in the black community it is a fait accompli that this kind of conduct is going to happen.",
        "Let me ask you.",
        "Why do you think these kinds of incidents escalate, and sometimes escalate terribly out of control, but…",
        "Well, they escalate because I think there's a lack of appreciation (unintelligible) disrespect.",
        "Certainly in the African-American community they feel like they are being disrespected.",
        "The police officers feel like they're not given the respect that they're due, and ultimately these come down, unfortunately, to a mano-a-mano situation because we don't see it much with women.",
        "We see it much more with white men and black men, and I think it's a question of disrespect that it's the underpinning of all of this, and unfortunately that's how it comes about, and we find very minor situations that escalate in the situation where a person is physically assaulted and ultimately arrested, like in Mr. Gates' position, for a relatively minor and insignificant crime, and an arrest like this has long-term ramifications.",
        "Mr.",
        "Gates was fortunate.",
        "He was able to get out of this, but people wind up having to go to criminal courts and fight these charges, hire a lawyer and then have to try to find out if their civil rights have been violated.",
        "So this kind of case can escalate, and unfortunately I don't think enough consideration is given to the human side of individuals' ego, individuals' sense of self-respect, because I think if you respected people and talked to them in a respectful way, you can de-escalate many of these situations that ultimately escalate out of control.",
        "Well, you've written a book, \"\"Blue vs. Black,\"\" that makes some suggestions about how we can end the conflict between cops and minorities.",
        "What would you say is really key?",
        "What's the key to the ending?",
        "The ultimately key to me, and it always has been, is communication, the ability to talk to people in a respectful way and get them to understand why you are doing what you are doing and giving them an opportunity to respond.",
        "Obviously, every situation is a little bit different, but I'll tell you: Most situations would not occur if the officer talked to the person in a respectful way and tried to communicate…"

        "And what about if the person also speaks respectfully too, I would say, because people get angry pretty quickly in these kinds of situations.",
        "Absolutely, but most people, I have found, if you treat them with respect, that is the police, they will respond in a respectful way.",
        "Obviously, you have situations where they can escalate out of control, but I will tell you: If you communicate and just demonstrate that you understand and have some empathy for the person and why they're there and how you happened to get there, you can de-escalate and you can prevent most of these situations from occurring.",

        "Now, President Obama addressed Henry Louis Gates' arrest in his news conference last night.",
        "Let's listen to a bit of that tape now.",
        "I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that, but I think it's fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and number three, what I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.",
        "That's just a fact.",
        "Now, Ms. Sizer, we want to get into the question of race, but first, let's talk about just the basics.",
        "What should happen when a person is confronted by an officer in their home.",
        "If you do offer proof that you live there, should that be the end of it?",
        "It's my word of the day.",
        "You learn a new one every day.",
        "In most cases, I think it is the end of it.",
        "The call for service that the officer responded to was what could be considered a burglary in progress or some suspicious activity, and in most cases when an individual is able to present proof that they, in fact, live in the house, the call is resolved fairly quickly."

        "There can be, you know, an exchange of words, maybe raised voices.",
        "This would be before anything physical occurred, just raised voices.",
        "From a police officer's perspective, what's - how should a police officer diffuse a situation like that?",
        "Well, ideally you should be able to diffuse a situation like this verbally, and very seldom resort to an arrest situation.",
        "I don't know the specifics of what happened.",
        "And we don't want to get into the specifics of this case.",
        "I'm asking you in general how a police officer should handle any kind of situation where, you know, the person involved is angry but not threatening, let's say.",
        "Well, it really depends on the kind of a call you're responding to, the information you receive about the call, whether or not the suspect description indicates any violence or whether or not the individual may be armed with a weapon.",
        "It's the facts surrounding that determine the appropriate response.",
        "So I think it's very hard to say very generally what the best response is because it's very, very fact-specific.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do police departments in general have specific guidelines for dealing with that particular situation, with a situation where what you've really got at first is just an angry person?",
        "Well, we have training doctrine, and we also have policies and procedures, but policies and procedures are often very much more general.",
        "Training doctrine and training practices often give police officers guidelines about how they respond to a wide variety of incidents, and we also depend upon their maturity and common sense to resolve situations in the best way possible.",
        "Now, what happens when race is part of the equation here?",
        "I mean, what we've been talking about so far is just this could be anybody: a person of any race gets angry, heated words exchanged with the police.",
        "What happens when race is part of it?",
        "Well, race is not uncommonly part of policing in America, and often it adds emotion.",
        "It adds distrust to an encounter that may already be difficult.",
        "And what kind of training do officers have for specifically dealing with these situations when race is involved?",
        "Is there training?"

        "I think there's very little training.",
        "I think there is more than there has been historically, but I think this is a fairly new venture for police departments.",
        "Most police training has been oriented in the past on giving officers background in law, in procedures, and on police tactics.",
        "I think there's been insufficient attention historically given to communications training and very little attention to how communications can sometimes break down in the heat of discussions of race.",
        "Now, do you agree with what the president said - that is, that blacks and Hispanics are stopped disproportionately by police, that there's a history of that in this country?",
        "Well, for about the last 10 years, many police departments, especially large, urban police departments, have been collecting data on their traffic stops, and most departments, including my own, show disproportionate stops based on race when measured against census data.",
        "I think most scholars also recognize census data is not a good benchmark for stops, but there really is not another benchmark.",

        "Yes, I heard his comments, and I happen to have lived in Boston from 1977 to 1979.",
        "So I'm somewhat familiar with the situation in the Boston area, although Cambridge is considered a much better place for people of color than some areas of Boston.",
        "But I heard the president, and I think his statement was accurate.",
        "Okay.",
        "We were talking with Chief Sizer just before you joined us, and I was mentioning before the break, Chief Sizer, that you came up with a plan to deal with racial profiling, and I wonder if you can tell us what's in that plan.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we've been involved in a long discussion about race relations in my community the entire tenure of my chiefdom, I guess, and out of that discussion we developed and presented a racial profiling plan.",
        "I can't say that this is all novel information.",
        "What I can say, it's a principled attempt to make things better, to build public trust between the police bureau and our community, particularly communities of color, and it's divided into four principal parts, one focusing on recruitment and hiring, one on data, a third section is on building relationships with minority communities, and fourth on training.",
        "All right, Clarence Edwards, I wanted to ask you, continuing this discussion about racial profiling.",
        "Do you - in your opinion, is it an exception or is it really institutionalized racism?",
        "In some instances it's an exception, and in others it's institutionalized racism.",
        "I think that the onus falls on the chief and the top echelon within the police department to set the stage by training and by strict enforcement when there is evidence that you have a problem officer, and frequently that's not the case."
