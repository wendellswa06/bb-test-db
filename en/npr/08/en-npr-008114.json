        "Something I'd like to ask both of you, but let's start with you, Mr. Edwards, and that is kind of the weight of history here.",
        "The president alluded to that last night or spoke pretty directly to that last night when he said that, you know, there is a history here of tension between people of color and police departments, of a sense that they are disproportionately picked on, let's say, by the police or targeted by the police.",
        "So how, as police officers, when you are dealing with these kinds of situations, how do you deal with that weight of history?",
        "How do you take that in and make that something you can help your officers understand they have to deal with each time they go out on the street?",
        "Can you?",
        "Well, one thing that I've emphasized over the years is that we have to do a better job of scrutinizing police applicants.",
        "I've advocated we use the polygraph exam to detect unlawful activity or drug use, but there, to my knowledge, are no questions on that that relate specifically to a person's attitude on race, and I think that's something that perhaps we need to look at.",
        "And I think your culture in the organization, you have to be constantly monitoring that to make sure that people who are coming on, people who are actively working the street, as well as your supervisors and managers, understand that this is something that's not going to be tolerated, because if they see someone get away with it, and somebody has that type of mentality, then it will happen.",
        "So when you were chief of police in Montgomery County, Maryland, how did you work on that culture?",
        "I mean, do you institute programs?",
        "Is it a question of saying this is simply not allowed within the police department at all, certain kinds of language, certain kinds of attitudes towards other - I mean, how do you change a culture?",
        "Well, our training in Montgomery County was based on bringing community activists, who are respected people, into the training academy, to sit down and talk to your recruits and explain to them the concerns of the various different communities.",
        "Montgomery County has a significant Hispanic population, as well as a black population.",
        "So we bring people in, and they would be a part of the discussions in recruit school, and also in service.",
        "Because one of the things I've noticed over the years is in America we don't know each other, and a people that don't know each other are apprehensive about each other and have fears, and we're trying to overcome those apprehensions and fears.",
        "Chief Sizer, what about you, this whole idea that it has to begin in the culture of the department?",
        "Oh, I think that's absolutely true.",
        "You talked about the history and the burden of history on minority communities and the police.",
        "Unfortunately, many newly hired officers are not aware of the history at all, and so I think it's incumbent upon us to teach them the history and teach them the various perspectives that exist around the issue and better prepare them for the stew that they're going to face on the street of race and class and politics and resentment, so they are -they react in a way that is not turtling up and just being defensive and shutting down, or at the end of the spectrum, reacting with anger when their moral authority is questioned.",
        "Chief Edwards, is the weight of history so strong that, in fact, minorities can perceive that the situation involves race or is racist or is racial profiling when it really isn't?"

        "It's possible in some instances, and that's brought about because people do encounter problems.",

        "I'm in a suit, and I get on the elevator.",
        "There's a white woman on the elevator.",
        "She grabs her pocketbook and moves to the corner, changes her pocketbook over to the other side.",
        "So I started laughing, and I went into my vest pocket and came out with my credentials and badge.",
        "I said, lady, you don't have to be afraid of me.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, that's an example, and you have another example where Magic Johnson and another basketball player had a similar experience on an elevator, and when you multiply these things out over the lifespan of a person, people become pretty sensitive to that.",
        "Now, what I believe, that our secondary education needs to do a better job of teaching our children about the history of slavery, about Jim Crow, and about all of those problematic areas in this country.",
        "We don't do that, and so therefore you can get an education through - K through 12 and not have a clue about what is really going on in this country.",
        "We are talking about race relations and law enforcement.",
        "Our guests are Clarence Edwards, the Montgomery County, Maryland's first African-American chief of police.",
        "He currently works as a senior law enforcement and security consultant.",
        "And we're also talking with Rosie Sizer, chief of police in Portland, Oregon.",

        "Hi, Jason.",
        "Hi.",
        "I totally agree with your speakers.",
        "The point that I'd like to make is that, you know, I'm a white guy, and I've had many experiences with the police, and in virtually all of them they've treated me, you know, disrespectfully.",
        "They've escalated the situation if I got upset about it, and I think that a lot of times minorities assume that their minority status is why that happens, when in actuality I think it's the way the police are trained to deal with suspects.",
        "Chief Sizer, did you want to respond to that?"

        "We've just gone through our in-service training annually, and we had instructors who really talked about that, clueing officers in that disrespectful communication is often interpreted by minorities as racial bias when in fact the officer may be acting like a jerk, and maybe he or she routinely acts like a jerk.",
        "And so it really incumbent on us to be respectful and professional in how we interact with everyone, even though we in turn do not always receive that behavior.",
        "All right.",
