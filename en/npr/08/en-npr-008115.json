        "And why does that happen?",

        "Well, I really don't think it's fair to put me in the position of second-guessing what happened.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I think what's important for police officers when they hear stories and they were not there and they don't know is to honor the perspective of the person who's telling the story and take into consideration how they can respond appropriately in the job they do every day.",

        "Now, at the closing speed, the headlights on, I would've had a hard time telling the color of the vehicle, let alone the driver.",
        "He immediately played the race card and was extremely confrontational.",
        "I had a great deal of difficulty in calming him down.",
        "I also was torn between writing the ticket and reinforcing his mindset that cops were out to get him, or letting him go and reinforcing the race card play as a way to shame the police into letting you get away with bad behavior.",
        "I let him off with a warning, but he pushed every button.",
        "Clarence Edwards, clearly this - we're not going to resolve this right here, right now in the next minute, but is there one thing you would leave - a thought you would leave us with to how you diffuse these kinds of tense situations from both sides?",
        "Well, one thing that I think police officers have to be cognizant of is the fact that when a person is threatened with a ticket, they'll use whatever ploy that they feel will work.",
        "And by the same token, police officers can't - I don't believe should be so thin-skinned as to allow someone to get them to do something that they perhaps would not have done.",
        "If you were not going to - in a certain set of circumstances, if we're not going to issue a ticket, then don't issue a ticket simply because the person made you angry.",

        "It's basically the same message, which is vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate, and then practical things like wash your hands, don't go to work sick, stay away from sick people, and then if you do get the flu, to take the antiviral drugs that are prescribed.",
        "OK, so those drugs - that gets to our next question.",

        "So that's the short-term problem.",
        "The long-term problem is generic drug manufacturers stop making drugs that don't make money, and then it makes them hard to find.",
