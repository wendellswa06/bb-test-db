        "And now, they're leaving, and I called - I heard that they're going to be leaving, and they don't have a date.",

        "I have no idea, but the things that I love about Starbucks is - and I heard somebody mention the consisting quality and variety of choices, the atmosphere.",
        "I love the music and the training of the personnel is so professional.",
        "I'm going to miss it terribly.",

        "I was calling because - well actually, I used to work for Starbucks, and I'm always been a fan of Starbucks.",
        "And we're on a road called 30-A in Florida, and we have two Starbucks within about nine miles of each other closing, and it actually - it's kind of interesting because there's a locally owned coffee shop, that competes directly with Starbucks that might look to actually benefit from this because it's a coffee shop called Alma (ph) Vida, and it's a wonderful place and it's got all the same kind of morals and even better so about you know, fair trade coffee and how they treat their employees.",
        "And I don't know, for us, it might be actually kind of exciting for - to see what they can do for our community, but it is sad to see our Starbucks go.",
        "And Janet Adamy, that was a complaint that a lot of people had about Starbucks was that they would be crushing the local coffee shops like the one Kevin is talking about in Seaside, Florida.",
        "Is this a chance for local companies to get back up as Mom and Pop operations.",
        "Well, I think that there are some misconceptions about that.",
        "Our newspaper has done reporting over the years that shows that Starbucks actually, in a lot of ways helped create a market for our local coffee shops.",
        "So, I think that it's not necessarily the case that now the competition is going to be lifted, and we're going to see the independents shine because the fact of the matter is they had in a lot of ways been helped by all the awareness that Starbucks created for mochas and lattes and cappuccinos.",
        "At the same time, we're also seeing some larger mainstream food service companies like McDonald's getting into coffee.",
        "So, the market is continuing to see a lot of competition.",
        "Yeah.",
        "McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts and all of those other companies now offering the kinds of espresso drinks that I guess Starbucks really did make popular across the country.",

        "And I guess - I guess Janet Adamy, you know, fun aside - that goes to your point.",
        "That Starbucks really brought it a lot of new coffee drinkers around the country.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And I think there are a lot of people like Erica out there that are - one of the main reasons why Starbucks is having to close these locations.",
        "What they've said is, as the economy slowed down, that's contributed to their softening in sales and particular in areas that have been hard hit by the subprime mortgage crisis like California and Florida.",
        "They said they've seen an impact from that.",

        "Thank you.",

        "And it goes to the question though Janet Adamy, if a company is not growing, some people say, it's dying, how much trouble is Starbucks in?",
        "Well, they are still growing.",
        "They are - what they're doing is they're shifting more of their new store growth to overseas markets where they see more potential, and there's a lot less saturation.",
        "I think in terms of the prospects for the company overall going forward, they were a Wall Street darling throughout the late '90s in the beginning of this decade.",
        "Their stock appreciated considerably, and I think the fact that now, for the first time in their history, they're having a huge round of closings like this, doesn't raise some good questions about whether we need - be passed the peak of the Starbucks years.",

        "My wife and I like your previous caller, we would go and drive 35 to 40 miles weekly to go and purchase products from Starbucks, and we prayed and talked to people about them opening one on our side of town in Jackson where we're just at north side near the airport.",
        "They finally did.",
        "Open up one on Duns Avenue (ph), and I'm there every morning around 5:30, as soon they open up.",
        "I know the people.",
        "They are beautiful people.",
        "Their personalities are great.",
        "Saturday and Sunday morning's my time.",

        "I meet people from Canada, New York - everywhere.",
        "Just sitting up there having coffee.",
        "So, every time I hear about one is going to close, I get worried and go to biting my nails.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Why you - you might want to go to a Starbucks first thing, too."

        "They're also replacing their espresso machines with the new machine that they say is better.",
        "They're introducing a new food line-up starting in the fall, and they've added some smoothie drinks.",
