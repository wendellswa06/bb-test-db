        "That means that this will put us back into square one, where we're not going to be able to calm things down and stabilize it and prepare the masses, especially the Sunni masses, the Sunni populous, toward a real inclusive and conclusive and decent and honest election that will bring the stability back to Iraq and put us on the right track after these two and a half years of turmoil that we have seen in Iraq.",

        "So our idea is that there are some problems, some problematic points that we should really get over right now and maybe postpone it for the next stage, and if we all look at Iraq as a whole and Iraq being all for Iraqis, I think we will have a better chance of acceptance and a better chance of stability for Iraq, which we really badly need right now in Iraq, where everything has been going downhill.",
