        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "You know, we - I had a similar agreement with a friend of mine for 10 pounds over six months and it as $250.",
        "But the only thing I ever thought that would help our listeners was not only pay that them - pay your buddies of money if you don't get it, but then set aside a goal or reward or something you want for yourself for that dollar amount.",
        "And if you reach your goal then you buy that for yourself as a reward for a goal reached.",
        "You know, it's always better to have a positive reward than a negative one.",
        "So that's what we used.",
        "So, Richard, you didn't actually get a reward, all you - you just didn't have to pay the 500.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I can see where the reward could work.",
        "But in this case the pain was more important.",
        "What it did is, you know, it - losing weight is painful and what I did is that I made the pain of the payment greater than the pain of losing the weight which gave me the appropriate cause benefit calculation that we economist are always talking about.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Jason?",
        "Yeah, that's one of the things with when I was in college the economist were always talking about that and we - I just decided to go the one step forward and set that money aside anyway and then when I need it then I got to spend the money on myself."

        "So what did you decide to get for yourself?",
        "Oh, I had set for myself a goal like an accessory for my car.",
        "And I'm the kind of a car nut, so when reached that - it's something I wanted for years I just couldn't just right take it out of my budget.",
        "But once I had reached than and I already set that money aside so, you know what, that new stereo in my car is really nice.",
        "Hmm.",
        "The probably that giving the money to yourself is that you - to have the same incentive that you've got to, I think, contribute - I think it would be contribute more to the fund than you would if you were giving it to somebody else.",
        "I'd have to think about that, but that's an interest - I've heard of a staff member here at U.C.",

        "So there are variations of this kind of deal.",
        "Right, right.",
