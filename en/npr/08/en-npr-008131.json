        "Unidentified Man #1: Probably a 40.",
        "The last days of Israel's election campaign did not work out as Benjamin Netanyahu might have hoped.",
        "The prime minister has warned his Likud Party it may lose in today's election.",
        "The center-right Likud was trailing a center-left coalition in the final round of public opinion surveys.",
        "It turns out Netanyahu's dramatic speech to the U.S.",
        "Congress, a speech that challenged the Obama administration's engagement with Iran, gave him only a brief boost in polls, which was offset by some withering criticism at home.",
        "NPR's Emily Harris is based in Jerusalem, and she's on the line with us for more.",
        "And, Emily, that speech to the U.S.",
        "Congress was supposed to gain Netanyahu an advantage, but it didn't quite happen that way.",
        "That's right, Renee.",
        "A lot of what he said in the speech on Iran wasn't news to people in Israel.",
        "And what happened was people started questioning the tensions the speech had created with the U.S.",
        "and asking, well, isn't the relationship with the U.S.",
        "part of Israel's essential security?",
        "The left wing - the central-left party led by Yitzak Herzog took advantage of this, and he said if he wins, he would make it a priority to re-establish a close relationship with Washington.",
        "Well, another thing that's happened and just hours before the voting began, Netanyahu made what seemed like rather a stunning announcement.",
        "He said that were he to become prime minister again, there would be no Palestinian state created.",
        "What is that all about?",
        "Is that aimed at getting votes?",
        "Netanyahu was asked directly in an interview, if you are prime minister again, will there be a Palestinian state created on your watch?",
        "And he began talking about how this is not the right time to give back land; it would create a launching pad for attacks on Israel.",
        "And then the interviewer interrupted him and said, so if you are prime minister, there won't be a Palestinian state created?",
        "And he said indeed.",
        "So this is the furthest he's gone so far in actually saying he would not pursue a two-state solution.",
        "It's a change from a 2009 speech where he said he was open to the idea under certain conditions.",
        "He has been making these comments recently about this is not the time, there's chaos around Israel.",
        "So in that sense, it reflected the direction he's been going to.",
        "But he's definitely trying to get votes, especially get people further to the right wing then positions he's had to come back and vote for him and the Likud Party in this election.",
        "Well, just lastly, despite his party's fallen opinion polls, Netanyahu could still keep this job, right?",
        "That's right.",
        "He could win, first of all.",
        "And second of all, even if his Likud Party doesn't emerge with the most votes, he could be the one who could negotiate successfully among the 11 or 12 parties that are supposed to get in Parliament and build a coalition government out of that with him at the helm.",
        "Emily, thinks very much."

        "Welcome to the program once again.",
        "Thank you for having me, Robert.",
        "First, the Brussels attackers - what conclusions have you drawn, first, from that blurry photo of three people at the airport?",
        "The first thing that we notice about these people from the photo is how calm they appear.",
        "They're walking, you could say, almost casually, relaxed into the entryway of the airport.",
        "You can imagine that they're just people setting off on a trip and not bombers that are about to blow themselves up.",
        "This we've seen over and over again with these ISIS operatives.",
        "During the November 13 attacks in the Comptoir Voltaire bistro in Paris, the witness statements stated that the bomber walked in, smiled, calmly looked around him, excused himself for the noise he had caused, and then pushed the detonator.",
        "You've written in The New York Times about the use in the Paris explosions of a substance called TATP.",
        "And, again, stories of that have been found in the searches in Brussels.",
        "What's different or interesting about TATP?",
        "TATP has very much become the signature explosive that ISIS's external operations branch seems to be using in Europe.",
        "The reason that we're seeing it is TATP is made from two ingredients, acetone and hydrogen peroxide.",
        "Hydrogen peroxide, that comes from hair bleach, and acetone is found in nail polish remover.",
        "It's very, very hard for governments to put in trip wires that would alert them to the purchase of these ingredients.",
        "These are ingredients that you can buy, you know, in a place like Home Depot or in a beauty supply shop and then return home and bake the bomb.",
        "Before the Brussels attacks, you did reporting about how the Paris attackers had communicated among themselves.",
        "As you tell it, they were extremely disciplined in keeping their communications secure.",
        "How did they do that?",
        "Abdelhamid Abaaoud, as you'll recall, was considered the architect of the Paris attacks.",
        "When his body was found, they found near him literally dozens of disposable cell phones that were still inside their wrapper.",
        "They hadn't even been used.",
        "And at different sites where they carried out their killings, the same thing.",
        "The police found burner phones - phones that had been activated hours, sometimes minutes before the attack.",
        "From what we can tell, they only used these phones and then the phones that they took from their hostages inside the Bataclan in order to communicate with each other, with the police and as well as with accomplices that have not yet been caught.",
        "This, to me, points to the evolution, the arc of ISIS's external operations arm.",
        "Earlier, in 2014 and 2015, a number of plots were foiled, specifically because the fighters made really stupid errors.",
        "For instance, Ibrahim Boudina, who was arrested in the city of Cannes, had voluminous Facebook chats with various friends of his, which allowed authorities to figure out what he was doing."
