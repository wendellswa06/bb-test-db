        "I thought it would be safer to stay at work inside, like, a building.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, can you tell what the atmosphere in the city is tonight or...",
        "I imagine people just want to stay home with their families tonight.",
        "I'm at home with some of my friends and I'm just gonna have a few drinks and just relax, I think, this evening and just kind of count ourselves lucky that things didn't, you know--things weren't worse for us.",

        "Yes.",
        "You have been covering the attacks all day.",
        "Was there anything about today that surprised you once you had heard about the attacks, about the way people responded today?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, this is something that was commented on not just by people I met in the street, but also by, you know, the leaders of the police and the transport police, was just how remarkably calm people were.",
        "I mean, people often talk about--it's kind of a cliche of this kind of blitz spirit of London, but it really showed today.",
        "I mean, there was an almost eerie sense of resignation and sort of getting on with life today.",
        "I mean, I think in some ways Londoners are kind of defiant in their stoicism, and that's what it felt like.",
        "It was surprising to me how quickly the city kind of absorbed such blasts and really this evening, apart from the London underground, it is almost back to normal in terms of the infrastructure.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You were at the House of Commons today.",
        "What was going on on Parliament Hill today?",
        "Well, the House of Commons was actually quite a key scene at one stage in the middle of the day because it received the first official confirmation of the number of blasts, and that came from the home secretary, not the prime minister, who was, of course, in Gleneagles with the G8.",
        "But it was, again, that sense of, `We must carry on to send a message of defiance to the attackers.",
        "And, you know, there's something slightly antiquated to outsiders about the proceedings of the House of Commons, but they did, after that statement, carry on with the rest of their normal business.",
        "So that was their kind of way of showing the attackers a sense of defiance.",
        "But meanwhile, Tony Blair did come down to London, but very briefly.",
        "Again, he was determined to carry on with the G8 conference and he flew back this evening, and he'll remain there.",
        "There's some question there tomorrow about whether there'll be some pressure to finish the G8 conference early, but he--Mr.",
        "Blair's said that he will remain till the end of the G8 and he'll be there for the communiques at the end.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I just want to remind our listeners..."

        "Yeah.",
        "...that we are talking about today's attacks in London, and if you'd like to join the discussion the number is 1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "Helen, do you expect it to be business as usual tomorrow in London, or are things going to be closed down?",
        "What's the expectation?",
        "Helen?",
        "...from, you know, the head of the London police and transport, they've been asked repeatedly throughout the day, do you want people to stay home tomorrow?",
        "And repeatedly they've said, `No, we want people to carry on as usual.",
        "We hope that all the transport will be basically running again as usual.",
        "So they haven't asked people to stay at home, but I expect a lot of people will stay at home despite that because I think there is understandably quite a lot of nervousness now about traveling on public transport here, and just a sense today that people were kind of wanting to, you know, get home to their families and so on.",
        "But, I mean, in terms of politics, we expect tomorrow the pressure to intensify on Tony Blair about intelligence failures, because that seems to be one of the greatest causes of concern amongst opposition politicians here that why, for instance, you know, the intelligence level was actually reduced in advance of these attacks.",
        "And that seems to be one of the kind of biggest issues, especially in advance of--there's a new piece of legislation going through Parliament in the next few months which is a kind of anti-terrorism bill, but I think there'll be a lot of calls for that to be made even stronger in the wake of these attacks.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you so much for joining us today, Helen.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Helen Rumbelow is a political correspondent for The Times of London and she joined us from her home in London.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "As evening settles in over London, thoughts are already turning to tomorrow and how today's tragedy will affect daily life, commuting to work, shopping, banking, visiting with friends and family.",
        "To get a sense of what Londoners are anticipating tomorrow, we turn to Andrew Jack, a correspondent for The Financial Times, and he's with us from his home near London."

        "Will it be open tomorrow?",
        "Well, that's what they're saying.",
        "I mean, everyone has obviously been watching television, listening to the radio, and I think increasingly, including me, overnight and first thing in the morning will be looking on the Internet to see the latest news.",
        "I normally travel in by the underground service, and there's promise by the authorities that even late tonight or early tomorrow morning there should be at least a partial resumption of services.",
        "But there's obviously a lot of uncertainty.",
        "We had reports this afternoon of an awful lot of people buying bicycles if they lived relatively centrally.",
        "Of course, an enormous number of people walking to and fro, central London, at least in the hopes that suburban rail services will be operating normally, most of which were by this evening.",
        "What about phones--the phone system?",
        "We understand cell phones were really out today.",
        "It was pretty hard to communicate.",
        "What's the situation now?",
        "Yes, I had some problems with my cell phone, although normally with persistence you could get through.",
        "There were some suggestions earlier in the day that these explosions could have actually been triggered remotely by mobile phones, and certainly the cell operators were stressing the fact that emergency services would have priority.",
        "Clearly there was a huge overload of people called their loved ones and their employers and rescheduled meetings.",
        "We're hoping that'll be back to normal.",
        "Certainly this evening the networks seem quite reasonable.",
        "And are people worried about more attacks?",
        "Are you--just in conversations with people, do they see this as, `OK, it's over, at least for now,' or are they worried about more tomorrow?",
        "There's obviously a general level of concern, and I think inevitably after any of these sorts of attacks you always think a bit first before you get back onto your normal bus or your train or your underground, particularly, of course, if you were, as I and others were, going through a number of these stations on the lines that were affected.",
        "But I think, you know, apart from obviously those who tragically were directly involved or witness to the explosions today, there's a sense to some degree of resignation, that life goes on.",
        "And I must say I got the impression really of a pretty orderly and calm group of people moving backwards and forwards and trying to get on with their lives.",
        "Yes.",
        "And we'd like to take a call now.",
        "If you could stay on the line with us.",

        "I'm both proud for the way the Londoners have responded to this event, and I'm also proud of the fact that London won the Olympics yesterday.",

        "People quite impressed by your city.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, I think there was a lot of responsibility.",
        "Of course, for Londoners these attacks aren't the first by any means.",
        "We did have a relative period of calm over the past few years but, of course, many people like myself remember a period of the 1970s and the 1980s and the early 1990s when the IRA was still very active, and while we didn't have quite the same brutal anarchic attacks in London for a number of years, there were many periods when there were bomb scares.",
        "So people for a long time, I think, have been used to a high level of security, always keeping their eyes out for unattended bags and so on, a long sense of responsibility, and I think it was really impressive and remarkable the way that they adapted today.",

        "I certainly want to offer condolences to the people of London that were affected by this.",
        "And in a sense we're all affected by this.",
        "The words offering condolences and sorrow just seem shallow and inadequate, but I just want to, you know, emphasize, you know, again, this is the nature of this cruel, ruthless, yet cowardly enemy we face in terror, and you know, I'm just incensed that these acts continue.",
        "The terrorists are just--you know, it's just beyond words.",
        "You know, the G8 Summit is gathered together to try and figure out peaceful solutions to global problems and gathered in the name of peace and economic development, and to see such a ruthless and cowardly act, it infuriates me."
