        "I mean, the dilemma is the same, and it devolves into a social and a moral dilemma, then as now.",
        "What's less clear is whether today's bankers, perhaps less guilt-ridden than their Florentine forerunners, are willing to finance a new renaissance.",

        "For years, retailers have been complaining about the fees banks charge whenever someone pays by card.",
        "Last year, Congress listened and included an amendment in the big financial overhaul to limit fees on debit transactions.",
        "In December, the Fed came out with a preliminary rule that raised howls from banks and credit unions, and thus began a six month lobbying bonanza that included 11,000 public comments, numerous TV and radio ads, social media campaigns, petition drives and efforts to get Congress to intervene.",
        "The result, a revised final rule limiting fees to about 21 cents per transaction, plus a few cents for other things like fraud prevention.",
        "That's just about half of what banks are now charging but it's still a victory, says Bill Cheney, president of the Credit Union National Association.",
        "It's obvious that the Fed listened to the concerns of credit unions and other small issuers.",
        "We feel better about the 21 cents than we did about the 12, that's for sure.",
        "Twelve cents per transaction is what the Fed had originally proposed and retailers were pretty happy with that.",
        "Now?",
        "We are deeply disappointed with this result."
