        "The suspicion that Iran wants to make a nuclear weapon is, of course, the rationale for those tough sanctions, as well as for veiled threats of U.S.",
        "or Israeli military action if those sanctions fail to persuade.",
        "It's also the subject of a global effort that keeps popping up in the news every few weeks, a game of nuclear keepaway, an effort to keep Iran from buying or making the machines that make uranium suitable for a bomb - centrifuges.",
        "We call it the long pole in the tent.",
        "Getting the wherewithal to make the weapon-grade uranium is harder than learning how and assembling everything you need to make the nuclear weapon itself.",
        "That's David Albright.",
        "He's a physicist and a former U.N.",
        "inspector.",
        "Most uranium is useless for nuclear fuel or weapons.",
        "Less than 1 percent is the light radioactive isotope U235.",
        "But gasify uranium with fluorine, put it in a centrifuge, and as Professor Houston Wood of the University of Virginia explains, you can separate the nuclear wheat from the chaff.",
        "The centrifuge is spinning very rapidly and then the gas will spin at the same speed as the wall is spinning, and the heavier isotope, uranium 238 will tend to move towards the wall and the lighter isotope will tend to move towards the axis.",
        "And then you remove uranium that has been enriched in uranium 235 and the other stream is depleted in uranium 235.",
        "Houston Wood, who worked on gas centrifuges at the U.S.",
        "Department of Energy, is talking about a very slight degree in enrichment when you do that.",
        "But if you take the stuff that has more U235 and do this over and over and over again, eventually, you can get uranium that is 90 percent U235, weapons-grade uranium.",
        "That takes thousands of centrifuges arranged in what's called a cascade.",
        "David Albright says the Iranians started shopping for the parts to do all this as early as 1985.",
        "It's when they first showed up in Europe looking to buy equipment and their philosophy at the time was let's go buy what we need.",
        "They went out and bought all kinds of equipment in Europe.",
        "But they couldn't make it work.",
        "In the early 1990s, Albright says, they turned to A.Q.",
        "Khan, the European-trained physicist who had made Pakistan's bomb.",
        "And they decided to just go out and buy 500 of what were called these P1 centrifuges from the Khan network.",
        "P is for Pakistan.",
        "Over the years, Iran has told the International Atomic Energy Agency that with the centrifuges it has, it has enriched uranium to the 5 percent level, that's low enriched uranium, to make fuel for a nuclear power plant.",
        "They also reported enriching some uranium to 20 percent, which they say is for a research reactor."

        "But right now just 17,000 troops.",
        "Now, what other ways is the United States committed in Afghanistan?",
        "Well, they also have what's called provincial reconstruction teams, anywhere from 12 to 20 people who work out in the hinterlands helping rebuild the country.",
        "They're people who know about agriculture, road building and the like, and look to expand those reconstruction teams too as we head into the spring and summer.",
        "I think that's going to be a big part of what President Obama talks about, is that the military can't do this alone.",
        "As military officers say, you can't kill your way out of this.",
        "You have to first provide security; that's what those 17,000 troops will do.",
        "And then after that they'll roll in these civilian experts that will actually help rebuild the country, not only American experts but they hope to get a lot of them from Europe as well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was going to ask you to pull out your crystal ball and tell me what are some of your expectations for Friday.",
        "Well, again, I think a lot more civilian experts; that will be a big push.",
        "And President Obama of course is going to the Europe next week to meet with NATO ministers.",
        "He'll be talking a lot about that with them, having them send over their former mayors and police chiefs and experts from universities and private organizations that can help rebuild the country.",
        "Also look for him perhaps to talk about more money for Afghanistan.",
        "They're already spending billions of dollars there, you know, on the military operation.",
        "Look for a lot more money in Afghanistan.",
        "And also Pakistan, for…",
        "That's what we should point out.",
        "Yeah, you make a good point.",
        "This is also - he's going to reveal plans for Afghanistan and Pakistan; make sure they are announcing(ph) that now.",

        "They're really seen as, you know, two parts of the puzzle.",
        "Explain that Pakistan part of the puzzle.",
        "Well, the real problem with Pakistan is the Taliban have a lot of safe havens across the border in Pakistan, and then they cross the border, particularly after the snows melt, for attacks into Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass area, and then from the South, up the valleys into the southern city of Kandahar, and over into Helm and Province.",
        "There's a real worry that even more Taliban and other insurgents will be heading in this spring.",
        "The sense is, of course, there's been a resurgence in the Taliban, a lot more attacks, particularly in the South.",
        "And there's a sense that the Taliban are emboldened, they're much - have many more fighters now, much more coordinated, and they're going to really make a big push starting in the spring.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Well, one reason is they've never really had enough troops there to secure Afghanistan.",
        "That's why you're seeing these additional American troops.",
        "And so the Taliban have been mounting more attacks.",
        "They feel emboldened.",
        "And again, the whole point of this is to try to stem those Taliban attacks, retake that turf from them, particularly in the South now, and then start to rebuild.",
        "Has the Obama administration articulated why Afghanistan is important?",
        "You know, I don't think they really have enough.",
        "The real concern is making sure this isn't another springboard for terrorism.",
        "Of course this is where Osama bin Laden was hiding out before the 9/11 attacks.",
        "So there's a real concern that you have to make sure that this country is somewhat stable, so it doesn't return to sort of a breeding ground for terrorists.",
        "But it's going to take some time.",
        "They're talking about a three to five year bridge of more troops and more development money, more civilians, and also training the Afghan security forces.",
        "That's a real big part of that.",
        "They want to double the size of the Afghan army.",
        "Roughly now about 75,000, 80,000 troops - they want to double that to get to about 134,000 in the Afghan army.",
        "That's going to take us several years.",
        "So the hope is that after three to five years, you can get over this bridge, and at that point the Afghan security forces can do a better job of securing their own country and you can start withdrawing American forces at that point."

        "It does sound familiar, but the difference, I think, in Iraq was, you know, first obviously you didn't have enough force there from the get-go, and also they thought that they could quickly turn this over to Iraqi forces and quickly pull out U.S.",
        "troops.",
        "And after three years they found out they couldn't do that.",

        "Considering we've been there since October of 2001?",
        "Well, again, you never had enough troops to secure the population.",
        "You never had enough, you know, civilian experts and money to help rebuild this, and I think they put a lot of faith and effort into Afghan President Hamid Karzai, and he's widely seen as ineffective.",
        "His government is viewed as corrupt.",
        "He's not getting out into the hinterlands in providing services to people, providing security.",
        "So they're pulling back a bit from Hamid Karzai, and what they want to do now is continue to work with Karzai's government but make it more of an effort to deal with local officials and local tribal leaders to find out what their needs are, what they want, and to sort of work both ends there, both the top and also at the bottom level, at the local level.",
