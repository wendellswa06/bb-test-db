        "So partisanship matters.",
        "The other thing that matters is elite debate, whether the elite largely are in consensus and in agreement for the strategy that the president is advocating or whether they're arguing against it.",
        "It'll be very interesting to see how the elites respond to President Obama's announcements on Friday.",
        "Okay, what else?",
        "What do you think is happening to the water, Dantes?",
        "Whatever he says, there's going to be a tremendous amount of debate.",
        "I suspect that the strongest critiques he will get may in fact come from his left flank - that is, from his own party, from his own base - rather than from Republicans.",
        "Let's go to Noel in Portland, Oregon.",
        "Hi, Noel.",
        "Hi, how are you?",
        "I'm doing well.",
        "So where do you stand on this?",
        "Well, I'm just going to make my comment, assuming that combat is the solution, and I just think that by doing what we're doing now, we're just adding a branch to the Bush blunder bush.",
        "We've come to the party too late.",
        "If we had sympathy - at least it seemed we have sympathy worldwide in 2001.",
        "We had a defined target, and yet things just got completely out of hand with Iraq and other issues.",
        "So I think by going in now, we're just going to be spending money.",
        "We've tried with clandestine and overt attempts to find Osama bin Laden and that group, and we made comments like - well, our actions say we're going to destroy your countryside or we're going to do this kind of damage, but then, of course, we'll come in and rebuild it.",
        "So, I just - I think we're - I don't see a win-win here for anybody, and I just think we're too late.",
        "Noel from Portland, thank you so much."

        "One more question for you, Peter.",
        "You also said that President Obama is living on borrowed time with Afghanistan.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Well, I mean that there's still a majority supporting the Afghanistan mission, both retrospectively - if you say, do you think we did the right thing going in, you still have a slender majority saying yes - and prospectively.",
        "Do you think we will win?",
        "Depending on the way the question is worded, you can get almost 50 percent or a little bit more saying yes.",
        "So, that - there's still a reservoir of public support for the Afghanistan, and you do not need a majority to continue.",
        "So President Bush stuck it out in Iraq and reversed the situation - in fact, did the surge over and against public opposition.",
        "So you can - if a president's determined, you can, in fact, do what is necessary to prevail in a war, even if public support is weak.",
        "But you have to expend a lot of political capital.",
        "And that's really my big question for the Obama team, is are they willing to spend the political capital to mobilize public support, to explain to the public why we're there, to explain to your three or four callers who've already expressed they're fed up with this war, to explain to them why they should stick it out and why they should stay the course with this war?",
        "That requires a tremendous focus and a tremendous expenditure of political capital.",
        "And President Obama has his plate full with other issues, and he has not really done much in a focused way of explaining his national security priorities in Iraq and Afghanistan to the American people.",
        "He just hasn't done that yet, and he'll have to if he's going to keep public support for these wars.",
        "We're speaking with Peter Feaver, who's a professor of political science at Duke University.",
        "I want to bring in Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution.",
        "And Michael, what's your reaction to Peter Feaver's claim that President Obama has done not enough to get his message out and that he's going to have to decide whether or not to spend political capital to keep people on board with United States being active in Afghanistan?",
        "Dr.",
        "MICHAEL O'HANLON (Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy, Brookings Institution): Hi, Alison.",
        "Hi, Peter.",
        "Nice to be on with you both."

        "I think that Peter's certainly right up until this point.",
        "Of course, we're only 65 days into the presidency, and this Friday will apparently be the big unveiling of the new strategy.",
        "And so that, arguably, is the moment when the clock starts ticking.",
        "And I think President Obama will have to work on this one additional challenge, in addition to all the other ones that callers and Peter have already pointed out, is that I believe that even if the strategy in Afghanistan is successful - and I'm a relative optimist, partly because I set the bar fairly low myself.",
        "It's going to take time.",
        "You know, the surge in Iraq began from a base of 135,000 U.S.",
        "troops, and we went up by another 30,000 within six months of - actually, within about five months of President Bush's decision to do so in his speech to the nation.",
        "In Afghanistan, we've been hearing about an increase already, even going back to the latter months of the Bush presidency.",
        "Now Mr. Obama's going to announce it.",
        "As Tom Bowman said, the 17,000 additional troop installment's not even going to be complete until August, and at that point we'll have about 50 to 55,000 troops, with more expected perhaps later in the fall.",
        "So the timeframe over which the Afghanistan increase is being announced and actually implemented is a full 12-month-long period, which is twice as slow, twice as long as in Iraq, starting from a lower base of capability for NATO and for indigenous security forces in the first place.",
        "In other words, we're not going to see progress even if the strategy works, in my opinion, until 2010 at the soonest.",
        "Let's get a couple of callers in here for you, Michael.",
        "Dave is calling us from Oregon.",
        "Hi, Dave.",
        "Hi.",
        "I just wanted to say I think we should stay the course and finish the job we started in Afghanistan.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Well, as the previous caller had stated, I mean, these are the folks that attacked us, so we need to go finish the job."

        "Yes.",

        "John brings up an interesting point.",
        "I'm going to get to it sideways from John's call, Michael.",

        "O'HANLON: Right.",
        "Well, let me say something about my interpretation.",
        "We've heard various views, and I think there are certainly important themes and kernels of truth or important points of reality in all the callers' previous comments.",
        "But I do want to say my understanding of the Afghan people, from having talked with a number of them and watched their political system, they are not interested in staying locked in the 16th century or the seventh century in some old-fashioned caliphate where sharia law is applied, there's no contact with the outside world, and no economic or social progress.",
        "That's not the Afghan people I know.",
        "Yes, they are a bit more conservative in some ways, especially in the south and east of the country, but they're angry about the Taliban.",
        "They despise the Taliban, if you look at any kind of public opinion polling.",
        "I was in Kandahar City in December, just after the population essentially revolted when acid had been thrown to those two schoolgirls' faces that some callers may recall.",
        "And the Kandahar City population in the heart of Taliban country was extremely angry about that action by the conservatives or by the, you know, conservative extremist Taliban sympathizers that opposed girls going to school.",
        "I think Afghans actually want a relatively forward-looking country.",
        "Just how they define that is their choice, and it will be different from some Western mores.",
        "But I don't accept the view that they are inherently against any kind of effort to bring them or help bring them into the 21st century, and that's one of the other reasons why I'm a guarded optimist here."

        "And if we do not stay and complete the job, I'm willing to stay there until we're asked to leave by the Afghan government because - for the long haul.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This is not a matter of spin or messaging alone.",
        "The facts on the ground matter and the facts on the ground will turn with a coherent strategy.",
        "So that's what I'll be looking for first on Friday.",
        "But secondly, he has to demonstrate his commitment to that strategy, the sort of presidential resolve, the I'm-going-to-stick-with-this-no-matter-what fire that President Bush demonstrated - the stubbornness that some people called it.",
        "But that was - that resolve actually served to bolster public support, that, okay - and bolster support from the Iraqis or the Afghanis in their current situation, that they're willing to stick with us because we're going to stick with them.",
        "And then the third thing he has to do is he has to expend the political capital to persuade the people that this strategy is going to work.",
        "And he's got to engage with the Michael O'Hanlons.",
        "Michael plays a very important role in evaluating these things.",
        "Peter Feaver, professor of political science at Duke University, joining us from Duke Studios in Durham, Carolina.",
