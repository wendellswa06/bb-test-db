        "Right.",
        "But there's three months until Copenhagen and, you know, you said they're going to start setting out like what's they're going to try to do on Tuesday.",
        "From what you're saying, it doesn't sound too likely that there will be an agreement in three months in Copenhagen.",
        "What happens if there isn't?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think that there's got to be some sort of agreement as to hope.",
        "I think the expectations are beginning to be scaled back.",
        "I think the hope for a full new climate treaty is really unrealistic.",
        "But the question is how to make Copenhagen not a complete disaster.",
        "Because if that's a disaster then the odds are that countries will decide, oh, this problem is just too hard and we'll go away and think about something else for a while.",
        "And that's obviously the worst possible outcome.",

        "Well, there's been a long-term trend in Oklahoma towards the Republican Party.",
        "But if you want to get to the basis of what's going on, it's about culture and it's about the economy in Oklahoma.",
        "We are a socially conservative state with a booming economy, and we weren't influenced by most of the forces at work in the election this year.",
        "And this, we should underscore, is a state which has a long tradition of Democratic success, isn't it?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Democrats have dominated this state ever since statehood in 1907.",
        "The president of my university, David Boren, is the quintessential Democrat from Oklahoma - strong on national defense, strong ties to the business sector, but also able to tap into long-standing populist sentiments in the state of Oklahoma.",
        "When David Boren passed from the political scene in 1994 to become president of OU, it really led to an unraveling of the Democratic Party in the state of Oklahoma, and they've never recovered.",
        "Do you think Oklahoma Republicans are doing something that national Republicans might learn from?"

        "The point is to prove that they are not just a fighting force but a governing force.",
        "And I think in the coming days, we will see exactly how that rule will be carried out in Mosul.",
        "Now along with all those things that you mentioned, Deborah, they've also imposed a code of Sharia Law - rigid, strict, Sharia Islamic Law - which includes the banning of music, the banning of cigarettes, lots of restrictions on women who are not supposed to leave the house unless it's absolutely necessary, and when they do, they have to be covered up.",

        "When they first came to Raqqa in Syria, they let that one go, but as time went on, they got stricter and stricter.",
        "They've already set this as a rule in Iraq, in Mosul, a city of about 2 million people saying that women have to be covered.",
        "Whether the Iraqis will like that or not is not altogether clear, but the men with the guns tend to make the rules.",
        "Apparently the ISIS militants when they overtook Mosul also seized the central bank there and got about half a billion dollars out of that.",
        "What more do you know about that?",
        "Well, I had that confirmed by a security analyst in Dubai.",

        "It's a very important question, Melissa, and they absolutely were able to do so.",
        "I don't think if there was a vote, that the people of Mosul would vote for a caliphate there.",
