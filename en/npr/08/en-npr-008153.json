        "He was painting a sign that said, hope, quite simply.",
        "He says that his mother is undocumented and his friends are already starting to leave the country because of this bill.",
        "People think it's a joke that I actually have papers.",

        "Now, unfortunately, that's changed.",
        "Since the advent of the propeller engine 150 years ago, the noise that we have been putting into the sea has grown and grown.",
        "Just about everything that humans do in the water makes noise - when we ship good from country to country, when we explore for oil and gas and minerals, when the military trains with explosives or intense sonar systems.",
