        "His sister told me Henry never understood what it was to be an outsider until he had polio.",

        "And out of the blue in 1978, he got a call from Capital Cities television, and they were casting around for minority producers to do a project of their choice.",
        "And Henry said it took him about 10 minutes to decide that he wanted to do the history of the civil rights movement.",

        "The first attempt to make \"\"Eyes On The Prize\"\" went down in flames, and the company came within an inch of completely folding.",
        "It was down to one employee that was Henry Hampton.",
        "But he, you know, he refused to let this thing die.",
        "He just was not going to let it go away partly because there were - there had been other documentaries about civil rights that were being made in the late 1980s, but they were all about Martin Luther King and his charismatic leadership.",
        "They were all by white producers, most of them with white presenters on camera.",

        "And that's why he refused to give up.",
        "You know, and he was - you know, funding documentaries has always been a struggle, but in the 1980s, funding documentaries about the African-American experience with an African-American executive producer was tripley (ph) hard.",
        "And in this particular way because the interviews in \"\"Eyes On The Prize\"\" are only with people who were actually there when the events occurred."
