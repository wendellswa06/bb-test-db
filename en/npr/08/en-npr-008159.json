        "Sappell held other editing and reporting jobs over the years but about a year ago after struggling with the decision he left for a job with a powerful local politician, Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.",
        "And here's what Sappell told me about how he feels about his new position.",
        "I'm working for the people, and I love that feeling.",
        "I like that feeling better than working at the L.A.",

        "That's the voice of the former investigative reporter Joel Sappell, who spoke to NPR's David Folkenflik.",
        "And he is happy with the move away from journalism, it sounds like.",
        "He loves it.",
        "He is using his reportorial skills to try to figure out what's going wrong in county government and how things might be improved.",
        "His increase on behalf of Yaroslavsky helped lead the Los Angeles County Sheriff's office to count all of its unprocessed rape kits, turned out there were thousands.",
        "And then helped to encourage the department to start to process them to identify possible suspects.",
        "Well, David someone like Sappell leaves the newspaper world, what do they think of the work newspapers are doing?",
        "People like Joel and others who I talked to said that they have a lot of respect for reporters and editors who are still striving under terrible economic pressures to do good work.",

        "But, look, the solution to violence and poverty in Central America isn't going to be that everyone can come to the United States.",
        "We have to apply our laws and we will do it in a way that's faithful to the humanitarian concerns at stake here.",
        "Why do you call it a humanitarian crisis and not a refugee crisis?",

        "And it's one that we should view from a humanitarian lens, whether or not it's a refugee crisis is a legal question that lots of folks are going to debate.",
