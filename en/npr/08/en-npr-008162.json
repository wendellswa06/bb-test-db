        "(Soundbite of Wal-Mart ad)",
        "Last year alone, Wal-Mart created tens of thousands of new American jobs and we offer eligible associates health insurance for less than a dollar a day.",
        "Those are the values that guide us.",
        "Sam's dream, your neighborhood Wal-Mart.",
        "We think we have a positive impact on the overall communities that we're located in and the people that work for our company and for the people that shop at our stores.",
        "Vice President Bob McAdam says the average Wal-Mart employee earns a little over ten dollars an hour.",
        "The company has long been criticized for offering such costly health insurance that most employees don't sign up.",
        "This year Wal-Mart began offering a more affordable plan, although it comes with high deductibles.",
        "Wal-Mart argues that its pay and benefits are competitive with most other retailers and that keeping its cost low saves money for shoppers.",
        "Critics counter that Wal-Mart has far more influence than most other retailers and that it helps set the pay scale for both its competitors and suppliers.",
        "Whether Democrats are helping themselves by attacking Wal-Mart, it's clear that the company has become kind of a political litmus test.",
        "Pollster Zogby notes that people who shop at Wal-Mart every week voted overwhelmingly for George Bush in the last election, while people who never shop at Wal-Mart voted overwhelmingly for Kerry.",
        "It's turned out for me to be a better voting indicator than frequent church attendance, whether or not one's a member of the investor class or a NASCAR fan or pretty much anything else except obviously party identification.",
        "Zogby's polling this year shows even weekly Wal-Mart shoppers have grown less satisfied with President Bush.",
        "He says they might not even vote Republican in November, but they'll probably keep shopping at Wal-Mart.",

        "Nancy, how big are these surcharge cuts?",

        "Wait a minute.",
        "This is saying Chinese people are free to denounce the government, but they can't call for collective action, like Tiananmen Square, the uprisings in 1989.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "King says there's often vitriolic criticism of the government that's widespread across social media sites in China.",
        "But the censors crack down on any attempt at social mobilization, the things that actually get people onto the streets.",
        "Let me give you a couple of examples.",
        "There was a local official who was apparently holding a group of schoolgirls in his hotel, and the mother of one of these girls shows up outside the hotel, holds up a placard saying: Let the girls go.",
        "Take me.",
        "Here's my phone number.",
        "Wow.",
        "And this became a meme on the Internet, with hundreds of people posting messages saying let the girls go, take me, and here's my phone number.",
        "But there was only one person who was physically on the street, this mother.",
        "Everything else happened online, so the censors left it alone completely.",
        "Here's the counterexample: right after the Fukushima earthquake, there was a run on salt, because many people in China believed that it would protect them against radiation sickness.",
        "Because they were fearful that radiation would come over the ocean, over the sea from Japan, basically.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now, this had nothing to do with being pro-government or anti-government, but it got people on the streets.",
        "It got people mobilized, and there was a lot of social media chatter about it, and the censors immediately cracked down on that chatter.",
        "King told me he also looked at what happens specifically when you had pro or anti-government mobilization efforts.",
        "If you go and you say, hey, let's go protest and, you know, have a whole bunch of people march on some government office, it'll be censored.",
        "But at the same time, if you say let's have a big party for the government officials who are doing such a great job, and you're able to move people, then you'll also be censored."

        "They are worried about a crowd, period.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now, King realized that tracking these posts on the websites is potentially unreliable, because if you don't see something on a social media site, are you not seeing it because it's being censored, or because it wasn't posted there in the first place?",
        "So he decided to conduct a field experiment inside China.",
        "He used extraordinary secrecy.",
        "He set up accounts at the hundred most popular social media sites in China and posted hundreds of messages.",
        "Some were pro-government.",
        "Some were anti-government.",
        "And he found the same thing again: The government cracks down on any attempt at mobilization, but it does not crack down on criticism.",
        "OK.",
        "I think I understand why the government would be so anxious about a crowd, even a supposedly friendly crowd.",
        "It can be very unpredictable.",

        "Why would the government be so seemingly loose in allowing people to denounce even the Chinese government or the Communist Party itself?",

        "You don't have a gauge of public sentiment.",
        "So for the leaders in Beijing, having people voice criticism is actually a very useful intelligence-gathering tool.",
        "So if they're reporting about a local public official who's corrupt, for example, the people in Beijing can step in and remove the public official, which is why local officials in China are often very unpopular, but the central government is extremely popular, according to Shirk.",
        "King told me there was only one form of criticism that actually was censored.",
        "Can you guess what it is?",
