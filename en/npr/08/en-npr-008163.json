        "That small phrase, minimum intervention, was a huge change because the Army's official regulations just say the wound needs to require treatment in order to get the Purple Heart.",
        "It doesn't say how much treatment you need to get for a bullet wound or a shrapnel wound or any other injury.",
        "So Caravalho's language makes it much tougher to get a Purple Heart for a concussion.",
