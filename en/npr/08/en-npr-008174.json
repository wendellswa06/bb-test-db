        "Well, TikTok is kind of a culmination of every viral video app that's existed in the last five, maybe even 10 years - kind of going back to early YouTube.",
        "And it's comedy.",
        "It's music.",
        "It's sometimes makeup and sometimes monologuing.",
        "And it's a weird hodgepodge of every sort of viral thing that could happen in a short-form video app.",
        "And they're really surreal.",
        "They're these psychedelic videos, a lot of cosplay.",
        "What's the appeal?",
        "It's really a meme incubator.",
        "There's a lot of trends happening, a lot of trends around maybe songs or maybe specific styles of comedic video or different forms of making the videos.",

        "The meow dance.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Facebook can be used by everyone, even Grandma.",
        "But when I showed TikTok to my 20-something producers, they thought that they were too old for it.",
        "It feels distinctly for the very young.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It moves so quickly.",
        "And especially with the way that memes move now, the way that Internet content moves now, it moves just as fast as that does - for the user that is high school age that's kind of going through three to four to five different social media platforms at once and absorbing many different viral moments concurrently.",
        "And that's what TikTok is.",
        "What does that say about the social media future we will inhabit?",
        "I mean, do you think different generations will not be able to even understand each other and will be in these kind of completely different social media universes?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, that's been happening for years now.",
        "I mean, we're seeing so much stuff that's very aimed for a younger audience that's meant to appeal to them, that's meant to kind of give them this coded language of their own and reflect their certain interests.",
        "And so I definitely think it's going to only get bigger.",
        "And things like that are going to exist tenfold in the future."

        "That's a lot of cash, and it means CBS needs to sell a lot of advertising at a time when the economy is barely dribbling.",

        "Well, GM is a corporate champion of the NCAA.",
        "So, as such, they had a multiyear contract with CBS, and they're honoring that contract.",
        "This speaks to a larger issue about whether or not people think it's wise to advertise during events like the Final Four, or events like the Super Bowl.",
        "To ask GM to try to grow its business without advertising in places where people are going to watch is really not realistic.",

        "Where they're seeing a lot of growth is with Hollywood.",
        "People - the movies are coming in, and they're really advertising, they're (unintelligible), that's also where the Super Bowl the past few years has seen a lot of growth, with advertisers that really want to get that demo of the young men that are sitting there, you know, with face paint on watching the games.",
        "Tell us about this thing called - I love the name - the boss button.",
        "Well, because they have the games coming to the computer, a lot of people in their cubicles stream it to their computer at work.",
        "CBS has something called the boss button.",
        "So, if your boss comes in, you can press this button, and all of a sudden, an Excel spreadsheet pops up on your computer instead of the actual live video.",
        "So, you can fake your boss into thinking that you're working, and they actually have sold that to Comcast."
