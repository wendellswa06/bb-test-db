        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Now, in fact, I mean, the striking thing about him is that you - he was an extremely popular professor when he taught at the University of Chicago Law School, and you know, our session was at one of those seminar tables.",
        "We didn't have to serve him food, and it was like a seminar in a course on how to be a calm president in the middle of a whole series of crises, and he was very...",
        "So, he was doing most of the talking?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it was mostly a Q&A - in our case, it was mostly Q&A.",
        "And he was very direct, he was good humored, and when you thought about it, he was extremely calm, given the problems he was describing, both here and abroad.",
        "David, you did share meal with him in your meeting with the president.",
        "Your sense of him?",
        "Well, he's an incredibly impressive man.",
        "I mean, with the conservatives, he had a very sophisticated meal, a very complicated policy discussion.",
        "I'm sure with liberals he used a much smaller sentences, more simple words.",
        "But I think he's competent at both levels.",
        "And no, I think what comes across probably in our private conversations, and in the public conversations he's had this week, is an intense empiricism, a pragmatism.",
        "And I think, you know, he's been emphasizing this publicly and privately, the evidence-based idea, governing on the evidence, not having a grand ideological vision where he wants to go, just whatever works to get us out this problem.",
        "And then the second thing, which, I guess, is really reassuring for a lot of us, is we're going to be spending a lot of money in the next couple of years, and we understand that, but he's clearly demonstrated this week that he's committed to tackling the big entitlement projects - Medicare, Social Security - that are the real fiscal disaster waiting to happen.",
        "So, it's not only short-term spending, but there's long-term fiscal balance, that's very much in his mind, which was not in his mind, or at least not talked about as much, during the campaign.",
        "David, I hear you said that the conservatives were reassured by the incoming president?",
        "I think it's fair to say that in the group - not to say what he said at the dinner, but the conservatives at the dinner were deeply impressed with the man and came away thinking, A, it was impressive that he would meet with us, and B, we had a very sophisticated policy discussion of the sort you could not have had with the current president.",
        "I want to look beyond Inauguration Day, if we could, and look at the agenda that awaits the president.",
        "E.J., you wrote this week about the future president's ideology.",
        "We spent years listening to him talk as Obama, the candidate.",

        "Well, you know, I think, it's very hard to pin him down ideologically.",
        "I think the - that what he is, is someone whose leanings are broadly progressive, center left.",
        "But as David said, he is a pragmatist and an empiricist, and I think somewhere in the zone between broadly progressive objectives and a real desire to do what works is what we're going to see.",
        "I think one striking example of that was just this week in his own stimulus plan, where he had a business tax cut, this tax credit to create - supposedly to create jobs.",
        "It didn't really work.",
        "It didn't have much of an economic kick, and empiricism led him to drop his own campaign promise out of the economic package, and I think that kind of fact-based approach is going to be very much what his presidency is about.",
        "And he had a victory out of that, something they are saying was similar to an 80-yard pass completion.",
        "Right, and I think there's a very good chance that the stimulus will go through with quite a few Republican votes.",
        "And the group where I think we need to pay attention to, are not, you know, moderate Republicans, Republicans from states Barack Obama carried.",
