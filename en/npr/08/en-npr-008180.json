        "One theory of how our moon formed suggests that when the Earth was very young, something hit it with an impact so big that it broke off a large chunk that remained close by and became our moon.",
        "And looking at the craters on the moon, that should tell you that the lunar surface is no stranger to impacts.",
        "But this week comes a new idea.",
        "What if, researchers say, the Earth once had two moons, two - one big, one small - and the smaller one splatted onto the far side of the moon and stuck there?",
        "That idea, they say, could explain the highlands on the far side of the moon, and perhaps could explain differences in the composition of the lunar surface from one place to another.",
        "Joining me now to talk about it is Erik Asphaug, one of the authors of the idea published as a paper in Nature.",
        "He's a professor of planetary science at the University of California Santa Cruz.",
        "He joins me from his office there.",

        "Ah-ha.",
        "We had a second moon at some time?",
        "Well, you described the hypothesis really well, that you had one moon, the one we know and love, and then you had a smaller moon, about a third the diameter in order to make the model work, and it went unstable.",
        "If you go back to the giant impact theory of the origin of the moon, a big planet the size of Mars careens into the Earth, crashes, makes a huge, big mess, sets the stage for the rest of our planet's history, pretty much, and from that disk of material pops a moon.",
        "And it's - you see it in models, and you see it in lots of analyses, but you get multiple moons at the start.",
        "So that part of it's not entirely new.",
        "What's new here is kind of the physics of what happens when this last moon, the last of the small moons, plays out.",
        "So the original idea that there was this collision, with a large object, that's the same?",
        "That's not changing?",
        "That's not changing.",
        "But you're saying that the models show, hey, you know, these shouldn't be just one object, one splat leftover, one piece of debris.",
        "There should be a few of them, and they also agree with that model.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so what's novel here is the endgame.",
        "As you form the moon pretty quickly - and people haven't spent a lot of time really thinking about the fate of the debris.",
        "There have been some papers that sort of study how long these should stick around."
