        "We have been paying close attention to a lot of models, trying to explain the far side of the moon.",
        "What needs to be explained there?",
        "Well, in 1959, the Soviet Luna 3 mission was the first human spacecraft to take any pictures of the backside, and it looked totally different from the near side.",
        "If you look up in the sky, this evening or in the coming days, as the moon waxes, you see the familiar man in the moon or the bunny in the moon, and these are all caused by the huge lava flows that Galileo saw with his telescope, and he called the marea: the oceans, the seas of the moon.",
        "Now, we know that there are volcanic planes, but the moon on the near side has been totally resurfaced.",
        "About half of it's been resurfaced by these lavas.",
        "And you go back on the backside, and nothing of the sort.",
        "It's hills, mountains, and if you measure the gravity of the moon using an orbiter, you find out that the crust on the far side of the moon is about twice as thick as the crust on the near side.",
        "And none of the theories that were out there seemed quite adequate to explain that.",
        "So if you smash another object into it, then you can get that extra crust.",
        "You can shape the landscape, things like that?",
        "Yeah, you know, modelers, we like to play God.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "We like to say, you know, here we have a computer code.",
        "Let's see what happens if X hits Y.",
        "And, you know, you have to obey certain rules of physics.",
        "So if you have a colliding object hit the moon, you have to say, well, where did it come from?",
        "Now, if you have the moon being clobbered by a cosmic bullet, say, somewhere else in the solar system, it's going to hit the moon so fast that, just like all the other holes you have in the moon, it's going to form a crater.",
        "And it'll actually make a thinning of the crust.",
        "It'll actually make a hole.",
        "And we see lots of holes in the moon."

        "And what we wanted for our theory was a collision that was quite slow.",
        "Now, slow by cosmic standards is still about 5,000 miles per hour, but we needed something that was so slow that it would have come from the Earth-moon system itself.",
        "And this is where we tried to connect these two theories together, one of a slow cosmic collision that the model shows slaps onto the moon like a pancake and makes this extra crust on the backside, and where this object could have come from in the Earth-moon system.",
        "And so this is where we went back to the old theories that were looking at the stability of these moons, and there are a couple of key spots where a second moon could hide out for about 100 million years and be orbiting along the moon that we know and love.",
        "And these are called the Lagrange points, or the Trojan points.",
        "Interesting.",
        "We have a tweet that came in from Sean(ph), who says: Have you considered a similar giant impact history for Mars, which also exhibits a high highland-lowland divide?",
        "Well, this is a very good question.",
        "We looked at Mars, and a couple of other research groups looked at Mars as a collision.",
        "And this is an idea that goes back to the mid-1980s, where Don Wilhelms and Steve Squyres looked at, you know, how much mass was lost if it was a collision.",
        "Well, I think, you know, you've been there and you've seen that cell.",
        "It is the smallest tiniest little room that you can imagine with nothing in it.",
