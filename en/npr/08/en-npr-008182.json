        "We know there are fewer children learning braille because of research that's been done showing that about 12% of students who are blind are getting braille instruction or no braille.",
        "And why might that be?",
        "Well, one possible reason is because more and more students who are blind or visually impaired are being mainstreamed in public schools.",
        "And because an emphasis often gets placed on the core curriculum - math, science and reading, history - there is little time left to teach braille.",

        "I'm thinking now, like, if you get on the subway or the metro or the T, people are going to be plugged into their devices.",

        "Is there any way, Eric, to test that theory out?",
