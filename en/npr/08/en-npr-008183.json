        "I have a question about our good old moon, and that is: Why do we always see the same face?",
        "Is the moon pendulous, so gravity pulls that one face toward us?",
        "You know, if you look at almost all the big satellites in the solar system, they all do the same thing.",
        "They have one face facing their planet.",
        "And in some cases, like Pluto and its moon, Pluto always has the same face facing its moon.",
        "And so they're doubly locked together, kind of like a bolero spinning through space.",
        "So this impact may not have set that up, that synchronicity with the Earth?",
        "This impact probably messed up synchronicity that already existed.",
        "This kind of locking-in happens pretty quick.",
        "It's kind of like an unstable bicycle tire, you know, it'll always end up with one side on the bottom.",
        "You've got to balance your wheels if that's not going to happen.",
        "And so anything that's a little bit unbalanced is going to get locked.",
        "This impact probably knocked it a-kilter, and then it came back to the way it was, and so it's one of those dynamical things where the big planet likes to lock its moon into place.",
        "Is there any evidence that parts of that moon that originally - you know, the big splat that hit the Earth, that pieces may have fallen back on the Earth, created craters or things we haven't discovered because they might be in oceans or something like that?",
        "You know, that certain happened, that the debris, you know, created a big debris field, and a lot of this re-impact hit the Earth.",
        "Some of it goes into orbit around the sun, and it's going to hit the Earth a lot later.",
        "The Earth's record, though, is so young.",
        "The average age of the Earth's surface is only a couple of hundred million years.",
        "Oceans are quite young, and the Earth is mostly ocean.",
        "We live on this incredibly active planet, and so seeing craters from that long ago, you're not going to see them on Earth even if they formed.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Hi there, go ahead.",
        "Why don't you think that the moon co-accreted alongside the Earth when they were both forming?",
        "Allison Aubrey, NPR News, Washington.",
        "That was the original idea going back to these really, really smart guys like Laplace and Immanuel Kant.",
        "And they thought about, you know, how did this planet formation occur.",
        "Well, you have a disk that collapses.",
        "It spins out into like a pizza, you know, spins out as a flat thing.",
        "And then planets can coalesce, and the moon would coalesce around the Earth.",
        "It's a great idea, and the problem is that the moon is so unlike the Earth compositionally.",
        "It doesn't have a core, for example, a very small amount of iron in its core.",
        "And so why wouldn't it be made of the same stuff as the Earth if it formed along with the Earth?",
        "So that's the main argument against co-accretion.",
        "Here's a tweet that came in from George Burger(ph), says: So what kind of orbit would the second moon have had to be in - to put it on the far side?",
        "Well, the far side, you know, it could have hit anywhere on the moon, and then this moon, the tidal tugging by the Earth would lock it into place the way we see today.",
        "But the - it does take a special kind of an orbit for this theory to work out.",
        "It's a co-orbital with the moon.",
        "So it's like this Trojan asteroid.",
        "This is a Trojan moon.",
        "And it's very stable for the first couple of hundred million years."

        "But I don't know if everybody knows the moon's actually receding from the Earth by about two inches per year.",
        "And early on, it was receding from the Earth much faster even than that.",
        "And so what was stable early on became unstable, and that led to the collision that we're theorizing was this - you know, it was sort of anchored in this one spot, and then eventually it got loose and got into trouble.",
        "How close was the closest point?",
        "You say it was receding, our moon.",
        "How close was it at one point?",
        "Well, if you go and look at the first thinking about how the moon formed that addressed this idea of - you know, we knew that the density of the moon was much less than the density of Earth back in the 1860s.",
        "And so we already knew that the moon had to form in some magical manner that we hadn't understood.",
        "And so George Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, he was a geophysicist who knew that the moon was receding from the Earth.",
        "The evidence is in fossils.",
        "You can see that the Earth's day used to be faster.",
        "The month used to be longer.",
        "You see this recorded in clamshells and corals that record the day and record the month.",
        "And so he pieced together the fact that the moon's coming towards the Earth, you know, or is leaving the Earth.",
        "And if you go backwards in time, he calculated how long it would have been when the moon was part of the Earth.",
        "And so he came up with what is known as the fission hypothesis, and he proposed that the moon popped out of the Pacific Ocean when the Earth was rapidly rotating.",
        "And so you can do that kind of argument, and that's what makes moon theory so fun, is you have a couple of pretty live hypotheses out there, and all of them have pretty significant implications for how it all started.",
        "If the moon was so close, would it have affected the Earth's surface, maybe the water?",
        "Was there water at that time?",
        "Or would the seas have been - you know, we have tides now.",
        "Wouldn't they have been incredible at that period?",
        "Yeah, the tides go with the square of the distance.",
        "And so as you get closer and closer in, the tides get amplified quite a bit.",
        "When you talk about these - this early epic, when the moon was really close, probably Earth had oceans, as of maybe 4.4, 4.3 billion years ago.",
        "We have maybe some evidence of the first oceans on the surface of the Earth.",
        "If you go farther back in time, around the time the moon had just formed, and you think about the planet, well, Earth was, you know, probably this hot lava ball with a steam atmosphere and a lot of hydrogen in its atmosphere, and it was really a messy, nasty place.",
        "So the tides that would be raised would be powerful and significant, but it wasn't really until about maybe 4.1 billion years ago when the solar system's activities had started tapering down a lot, and things had settled down, that somehow - and this is the big mystery - you know, we started the process of the first life on Earth."

        "Why don't you explain how this all started?",
        "Well, boy, they are really working this NAFTA issue hard.",
        "NAFTA, a very important issue to Ohio voters, they feel like NAFTA really has been a raw deal for them, and that the Clinton campaign is talking about a memo that has surfaced.",
        "It was written reportedly by a Canadian embassy official who describes a meeting, perhaps in February, with Austin Goolsbee, an adviser to Barack Obama.",
        "And the memo describes the words of Goolsbee suggesting that the remarks that Senator Obama has made about NAFTA, against NAFTA, should not be taken out of context and should be viewed as more about political positioning than a clear articulation of policy.",
        "And what Hillary Clinton, what her surrogates have said today is that it's just wrong to come and tell the voters of Ohio one thing about NAFTA, that you oppose it, and then give some reassurances to the Canadian government that if you are president, you know, you'd back off and things will be okay.",
        "Okay.",
        "Now, from the Obama side, let's bring Don Gonyea in on this because the Obama campaign clearly has a very different take on this meeting and this memo.",
        "Last week, we heard from the Obama campaign that there's just - there was no meeting.",
        "Now we're hearing that, yes, there was an unofficial, an unofficial meeting between Austin Goolsbee and Canadian officials that took place in Chicago at the Canadian consulate.",
        "But what Goolsbee himself is saying is that it was about a 40-minute-long meeting, it covered many topics, that NAFTA only took up about two to maybe three minutes of it, and that Canadian memo that describes him as saying, what Senator Obama is saying, on the campaign trail is just political positioning."
