        "Goolsbee says that is not an accurate reflection of what he said in that meeting.",
        "He said, he stressed to them that Obama has concerns about NAFTA, but that Obama believes in free trade, but that he feels it has to be revisited, the agreement, to address environmental and labor provisions and to take into account what it's meant for workers, like those in Ohio.",
        "And this discussion about positions on NAFTA seems to be aimed squarely at the voters in Ohio, but you are both in Texas now with Senators Clinton and Obama.",
        "Does the NAFTA issue have the same importance there that it does in Ohio?",
        "It certainly doesn't.",
        "And what we've seen in the final days with Hillary Clinton, two very different messages when she has been in Texas, when she has been in Ohio.",
        "And in Texas, we'll see what she says in these last few stops, but so far much more about foreign policy, much more tapping into people's patriotism and also their fears about terrorism and the world, and suggesting that she is much more prepared to be commander in chief than Barack Obama.",
        "So going after her opponent, but in a very different way with a different message in these two states.",
        "And, Don Gonyea, how is Barack Obama trying to steer the discussion away from this question about the NAFTA meeting?",
        "Well, there are direct appeals to Hispanic voters here in Texas, obviously an important part of the voting public here.",
        "So we're seeing those kinds of pitches.",
        "Senator Obama is meeting with veterans groups and talking to people about the Veterans Affairs Administration and the kind of treatment that wounded veterans and veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder receive when they get back from someplace like Iraq.",
        "You know, this last day before these big primaries in Ohio and Texas, there is a lot of posturing on both sides about expectations for tomorrow.",
        "David Greene, why don't you tell us what's going on the Clinton campaign?",
        "The Clinton campaign in public is talking about being very confident that they can win these two states.",
        "But in private, you know, they say that they feel more confident in Ohio, they're worried about the sort of strange voting system in Texas that involves caucusing, which has been an advantage to Obama.",
        "But they're saying if they win Ohio, perhaps they can use the message that this is a really important presidential swing state in the general election.",
        "If they beat Obama here, that sends a message.",
        "But certainly they're going to have a lot of thinking to do.",
        "And Don Gonyea, what about the expectations on Obama's side?",
        "For the Obama campaign, it's all about the delegate count.",
        "They are hoping for a win in Texas.",
        "They think they have a very good chance there.",
        "There are indications that maybe they're ready for a loss in Ohio.",
        "Senator Obama pulled out of there, and had a night in Chicago before heading to Texas today.",
        "So the Obama campaign officials are stressing that whatever happens on Tuesday, at the end of the day, Senator Obama will still be ahead in delegates, and that is the critical point they really do want to make, even as they hope they get the win that they think really could effectively end the Clinton campaign.",
        "Okay.",
        "NPR's Don Gonyea in San Antonio and NPR's David Greene in Beaumont, Texas.",
        "Thanks to you both."

        "And Chavez, through the price of oil, as Putin, has done fairly well for the population as a whole.",
        "But that doesn't mean that they are popular forever, and they want to create circumstances in which they can rule even if their popularity goes down.",
        "You know, dictatorships and authoritarianism, it's obviously nothing new in world politics.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think there's two important issues here.",
        "First, with the end of the Cold War, now being able to call oneself democratic is almost necessary in the international sphere.",
        "The second thing is, especially since the Color Revolutions of Ukraine - the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Rose Revolution in Georgia - the leaders are on edge, and they're realizing that having some competition could put them in greater danger."
