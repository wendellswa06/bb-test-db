        "Plenty of parents have learned the hard way that to avoid these seasonal attacks, they need to keep their asthmatic kids taking puffs of corticosteroid inhalers daily even when they're not wheezing.",

        "But, you know, the doctor was very clear that this is not the same steroid, and that the benefits are sort of overwhelmingly in favor of doing it.",
        "UC San Francisco's Homer Boushey says Shelton's concerns are typical.",
        "He's helped lots of asthmatics through this fear.",
        "He explains the beauty of the inhaled corticosteroids, which go by trade names such as Pulmicort and Flovent, is that they reduce inflammation in the lungs with doses that are small and targeted.",
        "So we inhale tiny doses, and because the dose is deposited directly in the lungs, it's deposited where we need it.",
        "And very little is absorbed into the circulation to cause systemic side effects.",
        "That's why they're safe, and they are effective.",
        "Boushey says long-term studies have demonstrated this.",
        "Kids do grow slightly slower in the early years while using corticosteroids.",
        "But follow-up suggests they catch up.",

        "And for the first time, they address 5- to 11-year-olds separately.",
        "For this group, corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for kids with persistent asthma.",
        "The guidelines also call for children to have short-acting, bronchodilator inhalers, such as Albuterol, as a rescue medication.",
        "To keep all the meds and doses straight, mom Alison Shelton and her little boy have written it all down.",
        "Here we have his asthma action plan.",
        "It's a sheet of paper.",
        "It's got three different parts - the green part, the yellow part, and the red part.",
        "The green part is sort of the daily maintenance, and that's the things he does every day."

        "We have 500,000 hospitalizations a year from asthma, and most of these could be prevented.",
        "If, Boushey says, more families learned to stay ahead of the symptoms.",

        "How can it be more vigilant, more aggressive in its oversight?",
        "Well, I think we're going to get an opportunity to do what the framers of the constitution had in mind and that's checks and balances.",
        "What has been missing the last six years has been the balance in terms of checking the power of the administration, holding the administration accountable for the decisions that they have been making.",
        "I think if I were to criticize the Congressional role of the last few years, we've been too fast to rubber stamp just about anything that the administration has wanted to do.",

        "Rubber stamp is a strong word and what is the sort of question that has not been posed to the Intelligence Agencies under the Republican majority over the last six years that you do intend to pose?"

        "And consistently the answer we got was no. Clearly, something changed in subsequent hearings after pressure applied by, I believe, Vice President Cheney.",
        "Then we saw a complete turn around which prompted me to write a memo to then chairman Porter Goss and then ranking member Nancy Pelosi complaining about the epiphany that the Intelligence community had had and now we're willing to say that Saddam Hussein had had a relationship with Al-Qaida and that Iraq presented a danger to this country.",
        "When you say that you're being a bit sarcastic there had been an epiphany about that had indeed the same briefers who had told you there was no role then come back and actually said there was a role by Saddam Hussein or did they say that they might have been or that they couldn't rule out the possibility that there was?",
        "No, it was a definite change - enough of a change in the position to prompt me to write a memorandum objecting to that.",
        "As chair of the Intelligence Committee, you and the ranking minority member, your two counterparts on the Senate Intelligence Committee and the leaders of both parties in both houses would constitute the so-called gang of eight that has in the past been briefed privately, as in the case of the warrantless domestic surveillance program.",
        "As far as you're concerned number one, does that system work and do you agree with the Bush administration that if those eight members are informed of something, that constitutes keeping the Congress fully and currently informed of intelligence activities as the law requires?",
        "I have been a critic of not getting the information as a member of the Intelligence Committee.",
        "There are certain things that only either the gang of four or the gang of eight - get that kind of information from the administration.",

        "I think there's good rationale for keeping information close hold within the gang of eight or the gang of four, but that is definitely one of the areas that I think we need to visit.",
