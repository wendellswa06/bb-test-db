        "This is an idea the White House has floated before.",

        "Again, this would add to an already large federal deficit.",
        "And it's a tax cut that would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.",
        "More than three-quarters of capital gains tax is paid by people making more than a million dollars a year.",
        "One reason the White House likes this idea is they think the administration could do it on its own without needing to get a vote from Congress, although that's a theory that would truly be tested in court.",
        "So which is it?",
        "I mean, is the economy doing really well, as the president likes to say?",
        "Or does it need sort of a helping hand from him if he's considering this stuff?",
        "The economy is still growing, and it is still adding jobs.",

        "Manufacturing is a sector that is particularly vulnerable to slowdowns in other parts of the world, which we've certainly seen.",
        "And it's also disproportionately affected by the president's trade war.",
        "Even parts of the manufacturing base that are supposed to benefit from the president's protectionist moves, like domestic steelmaking, are hurting.",
        "U.S.",

        "Now, I don't want to overstate this.",
        "It doesn't look like we're staring at an imminent recession.",
        "But even a modest slowdown could be challenging for a president who's facing re-election in less than 15 months.",
        "That's right, the election coming up.",
        "And a White House that is looking for reelection always keeps a close eye on that economy to see what might happen.",
