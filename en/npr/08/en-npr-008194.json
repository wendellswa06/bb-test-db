        "How significant do you think that moment was?",
        "They argued for her to have greater recognition, but I think her genius was so undeniable that she was always a person on the radar when big decisions were being made.",

        "Michael, what about the whole idea of buy black?",
        "That's something that has come up and it's, in some ways, similar to buy American, the whole idea of putting your money where your mouth is.",

        "And it's my hope going forward, that we'll be able to have more sincere conversations about this, and that people will understand that how you spend your money and where you spend your money, not only says something about you, but says something about - how business operators will respect you going forward.",
