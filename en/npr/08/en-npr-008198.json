        "Vice President Mike Pence spoke.",
        "Bush, of course, was a vice president for eight years.",
        "And there was one moment that really stood out where Pence talked about - you know, George Bush was famous for the letters he wrote.",
        "And toward the end of his life, just a few months ago, Bush wrote a letter to Pence's son, who is a Marine pilot who had actually been taking off and landing aircraft on the USS George H.W.",
        "Bush.",
        "And in the letter, Bush used an acronym Pence said he wasn't initially familiar with, CAVU.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "President Bush described CAVU, in his words, as the kind of weather we Navy pilots wanted when we were to fly off our carrier in the Pacific.",
        "So Pence was saying Bush was speaking aviator to aviator.",
        "And Pence went on to say that that description is a way that Bush lived his life.",
        "President Trump was not present for this ceremony, although he and the first lady, if I'm not mistaken, paid their respects later.",
        "And is it correct that just about anybody can walk past that casket at some point in the next day or two?"

        "That 1988 presidential campaign - he really eviscerated Michael Dukakis and also ran ads focused on that Massachusetts prisoner Willie Horton that were really a high-profile moment in race-baiting politicking.",
        "Yeah.",
        "People involved in that campaign will emphasize they didn't themselves do the ad, but it was out there from a Bush supporter.",
