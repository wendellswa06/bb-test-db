        "You know, Condi is - Condi Rice is - by making this trip, basically the only thing she's doing with this - the last several trips she's made to the Middle East is building up her frequent flyer miles because there's just no way at this point she's going to be able to salvage the Bush administration's diplomatic legacy on this issue of Israel."

        "Now, as you point out, previous administrations haven't had much luck either, but at least they'd made the effort and at least they appeared to be seriously negotiating.",
        "And they were again negotiating from a position of strength, from the position of still being seen as the world's great power.",
        "I'm not so sure the United States has viewed that way internationally anymore.",
        "And we're -because of all the other international promise we have, in particular in Iraq and Afghanistan, it just doesn't allow us either the political capital or the resources, or maybe even the political will, to be able to make any change here.",
        "But I think right now because of the impasse, because of the Palestinian's refusal - and I agree with Michael - their refusal to recognize Israel, it would not matter what we did.",

        "You've got two leaders - Olmert from Israel and Abbas from Palestine - who are in some ways very much in the shadow of their predecessors, two strong men who stood for their entire nation.",
        "Is it a good thing or a bad thing that now Israel and Palestine are really run by men who have not as much history as the men who preceded them?",
        "Well, it's probably a good thing, I would think.",
        "Because you were never going to have a situation and you had a situation where Yasser Arafat came to the table and obviously nothing happened.",
        "And people just couldn't get past who he was, who he was connected to, the terrorism that we just tied to his name.",
        "At least now that you have these two new leaders in there, relatively new leaders in there, it kind of opens up the field.",
        "It gives a new horizon and you might think that it's sort of a new day.",
        "But as Mike and Laura said, you know, Palestine still is not going to acknowledge Israel and their right to exist.",
        "That's just an amazing statement.",
        "And of course they can't because they have these people back at home who, sure, the leaders can acknowledge that they exist.",
        "But that doesn't mean that the people back at home are going to say, well, wait, they killed my brother.",
        "They killed my sister.",
        "They bombed our village.",
        "They're still going to hold these against them.",
        "So on a people, personal, non-political level, this is a situation that reminds me very often of the gang situation here in the United States, where people just cannot get past to what happened in the past.",
        "Well, I'm going to move on to another controversial topic - very different.",
        "Lawmakers in Tennessee are pushing legislation that mandates death certificates for aborted fetuses, which would in turn create public records of women who have abortions.",
        "A Republican representative said his bill would provide a way to track the number of abortions performed in the state.",
        "But abortion stats are already available to the state Office of Vital Records.",
        "Now the identity of women who had abortions are not listed on these records but the death certificates could list their Social Security numbers.",
        "Bob, what does this all mean?",
        "Is this just a way of trying to put a scarlet A for abortion on women or is this a much needed public health issue?",
        "It is not a public health issue.",
        "This - I almost applaud this because it's so deviously, evilly brilliant or whatever you have it.",
        "This is obviously pro-life, anti-abortion groups.",
        "This is a ploy.",
        "This is a PR move.",
