        "And information stored there is shared in-person, not over unsecured phone lines or through email.",

        "Just to clarify, Ayesha, did you say this is a system that was set up explicitly for the Trump administration?",
        "No.",

        "Ned Price worked at the NSC during the Obama administration.",
        "He said he never heard of anyone taking any actions like this during his time there.",
        "He pointed out that the idea that this information would need to be stored on a separate system is undercut because the administration released the unredacted notes on the call.",
        "So it doesn't appear to be classified information.",
        "So, Ayesha, we still don't know the identity of the whistleblower.",
        "Neither does the president, but that's not stopping him from trying to undermine this person's credibility.",
