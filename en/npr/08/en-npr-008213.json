        "Well, Dina, authorities are investigating this as they - as an act of domestic terrorism.",
        "How do they decide when to consider a mass shooting like this, an act of possible terrorism?",
        "When do they not move toward that option?",
        "Why does the FBI, when does the FBI get involved, as opposed to local police?",
        "Can you fill us in on that?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think that this domestic terrorism - sort of label has taken on more importance than maybe it should, at this point in the investigation.",
        "Essentially, what happened is, this is a case that spans more than just Wisconsin.",
        "It spans a couple of different states where he lived - North Carolina, where he was posted - and generally, when you have a kind of crime that spans more than one state, the FBI steps in.",
        "In addition to that, apparently, local law enforcement said that they felt that the FBI had more resources to investigate this.",
        "So the FBI assigned a unit to investigate, and the unit they assigned is from the Domestic Terrorism Unit.",
        "And I was told by my sources there, that not too much should be read into that.",
        "I mean, clearly, they wouldn't assign a mortgage fraud unit to do this.",
        "Well, what difference would it make if it were determined that this was domestic terrorism, in terms of how it is prosecuted?",
        "If they were to determine, for example, that this could have been a hate crime, would that make any difference in the way they investigate or prosecute it?",
        "It wouldn't make a difference in the way that they investigate it, but it would make a difference in the way they prosecute it.",
        "But this is more of a decision that's made not from - in the FBI, but at the Department of Justice, when they decide how to prosecute a case.",
        "And very often, there are times that they don't want to make something a hate crimes case.",
        "Maybe they don't have the right kind of evidence they need to make that kind of case; that they'll just make it a more simple, straightforward murder case.",
        "So, you know, I know people in the Sikh community in Wisconsin are talking about this being a hate crime.",
        "But I'm not quite sure that they've determined that yet.",
        "Well, in fact, Sikhism is completely distinct and separate from Islam, even though Sikhs are often mistaken for Muslims because of their appearance and dress.",
        "But isn't it true that even the FBI lumps Sikhs in with Muslims, when they are suspected to be targets of hate crime?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "I guess I would say that if you have a neo-Nazi - and we don't know if the shooter is, in fact, a neo-Nazi.",
        "But if you have someone who's a white supremacist or neo-Nazi, you know, they're not going to focus on Muslims or Sikhs.",
        "I mean, they're going to notice - focus on people who are not white, and not like them.",
        "So I think there's been this sort of understanding that this must be some mistake, looking at Sikhs as Muslims.",
        "But it's very possible that he just looked at them as foreigners.",
        "Of course, and we are going to be talking later, in more depth, about the Sikh religion and the Sikh community.",
        "One thing you haven't mentioned, Dina.",
        "There have been some reports that the shooter had tattoos.",
        "What do you know about that?",
        "Well, it's interesting because the witnesses who were there, in the temple, apparently very much focused on this one tattoo he had, that was sort of a 9/11 tribute tattoo.",
        "And they focused on that as being a sign of his white supremacy.",
        "But in fact, these 9/11 tribute tattoos very often are worn by the military - or at least put on by military people - or first responders, like firemen or law enforcement people.",
        "And there are some pictures that are supposed to be of him in his band about five years ago, and he was covered in tattoos.",
        "So the question is, why did people zero in on this particular tattoo?",
        "And we haven't gotten to the bottom of that yet.",
        "Well, you know, Dina, I want to hear from a caller first - at this point.",
        "Yaseen(ph) is actually calling us from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",
        "He is a Muslim, and Yaseen, you feel for the Sikh community.",

        "That's been - sort of the big break in the case that we've heard since he was actually named this morning, and some details of his past in the military have been revealed.",
        "A second person of interest, even though the police chief earlier said - in his press conference today - that there was only one person involved, and that we should - or the community should be relaxed about, or not worried about the prospect of something else happening.",
        "Well, a person of interest could be anybody.",
        "It could be somebody who happened to have walked by the temple when this was happening, and they caught him on a security camera - that sort of thing.",
        "So I wouldn't look too much into that except that they have released this other photo, and they'd like to talk to this person.",
        "Dina, give us a little background here on what has happened in the past.",
        "We've mentioned that the Sikh community has been targeted in the past by what appear to be hate-crime-type attacks.",

        "Well, there's been a lot of confusion, as you had said earlier, between Sikhs and Muslims.",
        "And in particular, I think the sort of famous case was a Sikh gas station owner in Arizona was killed because someone thought he was Muslim.",
        "And the man who killed him went out saying, I'm going to go and shoot myself some - and these are his words - \"\"a towelhead.\"\" And he ended up shooting this Sikh who had nothing to do with anything."

        "Exactly, exactly.",

        "And I'm not sure that that clarity is where it needs to be.",

        "And I do feel that the label of terrorism is absolutely important because when we recognize that that label makes it something that's not based on ethnicity or religion but on insane - or on people that think that they can take other people's lives, then we recognize that terrorism is much broader.",
