        "That's from Emily in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",
        "And Jim in Chico, California, writes this, he says: Please ask your Sikh guest what would be appropriate and respectful ways to express support and concern to Sikh neighbors?",
        "I am a Christian pastor who is heartbroken by the shooting.",
        "We have a Sikh community in a nearby town.",
        "How can I and my church be helpful to them?",
        "Navdeep?",
        "The easiest thing to do and the one thing we encourage everyone to do, go to the gurdwara, go to the Sikh temple, introduce yourself, pray with them.",
        "Sikh...",
        "Are non-Sikh worshippers welcome at your temples?",
        "The doors of a gurdwara are always open.",
        "And after this incident, the response of the Sikh community around the country has been, how do we open our doors even wider?",
        "They want you to come.",
        "They want you to come and pray with them because the prayer area is open for all persons of all faiths.",
        "And then we have the communal meal, langar, which was started as a sign of equality.",
        "All people sit together.",
        "It did not matter if you are king or you are a pauper.",
        "You - we're all equal in the eyes of the God.",
        "It did not matter if you are Hindu, Muslim or Sikh.",
        "All are equals in the eyes of God, so all should come and partake together as a common humanity.",
        "And one of the sad things about the incident yesterday is, in fact, women were preparing that very communal meal at the time when the gunman arrived on the scene.",

        "First of all, I want to offer my condolences to your guest, Mr. Navdeep Singh, and to the entire Sikh community on this great tragedy, you know, the senseless violence, the senseless lost of life.",
        "I think the couple of things in addition to that which brings to me as a member of a minority Islam - I'm an American Muslim - is looking as your guest, Mr. Navdeep Singh, said this act of violence could have been because of the fact that this is a community who prays differently, who looks differently, and that's the reason they were targeted.",
        "The sender would then touch the receiver's forearm, trying to communicate the specific emotion, such as envy, fear, love, embarrassment, anger, gratitude, pride, disgust.",
        "The receiver had to then decide which emotion was being communicated.",
        "Hertenstein tested over 200 participants."

        "If that's the case, not only the Sikhs in the U.S., but all the other minorities need to be concerned and are concerned because - whether they be Muslims, Hindus, Baha'is, Buddhists or even Jewish temples we've seen had been targeted.",
        "Anytime a place of worship is targeted like that, it's an awful shame for the entire American nation.",
        "All of us are ashamed by these acts.",
        "When - as minorities, they are concerned even more because I think - because the next - the one that I find, which has been, as an American Muslim, of grave concern to me, which I think needs to be part of this discussion, is that we've heard in the past, even after 9/11, the first victim was actually a Sikh who was attacked because he was mistaken to be a Muslim.",
        "And then the recent attack on the gurdwara in Michigan because that they thought was a mosque.",
        "And there is some suspicion, although not confirmed as of yet, that the Sikh temple could have been targeted because they thought it was a Muslim place of worship.",
        "If that is the case, I think the authority and the society needs to also provide some education and information and protection for the hundreds of Muslim mosques around the country because I think the intended target, it seems in the past - we're not sure of this one - but it seems was the Muslim community.",

        "And Navdeep, we have, as you've noticed, many calls today from Muslims who are concerned and feel bad because they have this sense that the Sikh community of Milwaukee was - could very well have been targeted out of ignorance or mistaken identity, pointing out that Sikhs and Muslims, in some ways, look alike.",
        "I mean, Sikh men wear turbans and, of course, some Muslim men wear turbans as well.",
        "Is there anything that you can tell our audience about the way that you dress and why you dress the way you do and, you know, what we can learn from that?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, there are over 700,000 Sikh Americans in this country.",
        "And almost 99 percent of the people you see in this country who wear turbans are actually Sikh Americans.",
        "Now, I don't say that to condone violence against any community.",
        "Whenever any community is oppressed, we must all stand up, and we must all stand shoulder to shoulder with them.",
        "But in terms of articles of faith, these are deeply personal articles of faith, part of us, which are given to us by our gurus as signs of our independence, and the idea that as a Sikh you are a servant of God, therefore you must accept God.",
        "So you do not cut your hair."

        "Now, Navdeep, as we were talking earlier, the FBI still counts hate crimes against Sikhs in the same category as crimes against Muslims.",
        "And there was, of course, this initiative from members of Congress, a letter earlier this year, again, April, I believe, asking the FBI to distinguish Sikhs and Muslims.",

        "Well, SALDEF has been one of the organizations that has been spearheading the efforts along with our partners to get this category added.",
        "Simply, it's put like this.",

        "That means that crimes that are purposely gone against Sikhs or in which the victim is a Sikh.",
        "So what we're having is a question of, we don't have reliable data because the people who collect that data don't do it.",
        "They don't include anti-Sikhs, therefore, we cannot have a reliable count of how many hate crimes are actually reported to the FBI, reported to local law enforcement.",
