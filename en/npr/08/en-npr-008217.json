        "One of the most hysterical things that I've read about Iran, ever certainly in the last year, to my mind, it seems less and less likely that there'll be any kind of military attack against Iran as we see here and there incrementally a case building for diplomatic engagement between the United States and Iran.",
        "And it seems that those who urge military action within the Bush administration seem to be accepting the fact that in this election year, the results of an attack would be so unpredictable vis-a-vis the presidential election that it would be - that it's almost entirely out of question.",

        "Well, the previous policy was a very open-ended definition of what kind of evidence could be admitted before these military commissions at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "The rule was that evidence that was probative to a reasonable person, and also consistent with having a full and fair trial, could be admitted.",
        "Now, that was not a specific invitation to allow evidence through torture, and the government has said that it does not permit the torture of prisoners or defendants at Guantanamo Bay.",

        "Well, they say no. The government's position is that they never were seeking to introduce evidence taken through torture, and they feared that had they adopted a rule that said we will not admit evidence taken through torture, it might imply that they actually were torturing people.",
        "That was the, one of the rationales given as to why they never adopted it in the past.",
        "However, they reconsidered more recently, when this became a controversy at hearings they held at Guantanamo earlier in this month, and the decided for reasons that haven't been made perfectly clear, that they should have an outright prohibition on it.",
        "Now, it just so happens that next Tuesday, the Supreme Court will be hearing arguments over the legality of these military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, and one of the reasons that they have been challenged is the contention that they have no prohibition on the use of evidence taken through torture, and that would make the illegal under a treaty the United States has signed.",

        "One of the issues he raises is that he is not guaranteed a fair trial, because evidence taken under torture could be admitted under the rules as they were written.",

        "So, we don't know.",

        "Does the defense have to prove that evidence introduced by the prosecution was derived through torture, or does the prosecution have to show that it wasn't?",
