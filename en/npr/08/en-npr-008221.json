        "But first, we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy.",
        "On October 3, according to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, Chinedu Okobi was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in Millbrae, Calif., when police stopped him.",
        "According to the police account, he allegedly assaulted the deputy, and then he was tasered several times.",
        "Mr. Okobi later died at a hospital.",
        "And it might have ended there without much public attention but for the fact that his sister, Ebele Okobi, is Facebook's public policy director for Africa, and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story.",

        "Ms. Okobi, thank you so much for joining us.",
        "And I'm very sorry for your loss.",

        "It fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color, in particular black men.",
        "I think that it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men, even white men who have killed.",
        "I mean, I think the classic example is Dylann Roof, who murdered - who went into a church and murdered people, and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him.",
        "It's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men, in particular, versus arrests for white men that there's a clear racial disparity.",
        "You noted, though, that he had been described as 6'3\"\" and 300 pounds.",
        "Those are factual details, though, aren't they?",
        "I mean, if you were describing someone, wouldn't you describe those things?",
        "You might not.",

        "Do you know how much he weighs?",
        "That was never mentioned.",

        "Yes, that's absolutely accurate.",
        "Do you think that that is a factor as well?",
        "I mean, it's been reported and that there is also data to support the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police, or they are often disproportionately the target of police encounters, in part because police - people call the police to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to.",
        "Do you think that his mental health issues were a factor in this as well?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I think here you see the impact of intersectionality.",
        "So he is at the intersection of being a person of color, a black man, and the intersection of having a mental health disability.",
        "And I think statistics - and I think I know statistics show that encounters between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race, but they are worse if the person is a black man.",
        "So I definitely think mental health has something to do with it.",
        "And I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly in a mental health crisis.",
        "It's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who has just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent.",
        "I noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa.",
        "And I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble.",
        "And I wonder how the tech community has responded to this.",
        "Whenever you have areas where privilege and power intersect in the United States, they do tend to be bubbles, and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty, that aren't as connected to issues of mental health and certainly aren't connected issues of race.",
        "In terms of how people reacted, I have been overwhelmed with support.",
        "Even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell our story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who shouted above the rooftops this is a story that needed to be told.",
        "I've been talking with Max Siollun.",
        "He's author of the book, \"\"Soldiers Of Fortune: Nigerian Politics From Buhari To Babangida.\"\" Thanks so much for talking with us.",
        "Thank you very much for having me on.",
        "Well, Brian, we've enhanced the features to make them safer and easier for people to use.",
        "What we're trying to do is to have everyone be aware that if they use those features, they can protect themselves from taking counterfeit notes.",
        "So, for example, if you look down on the right-hand corner and tilt your 10, we want people to look at the fancy ink that's down there in the corner that changes color from copper to green.",
        "So that's a very sort of discreet and subtle feature that people can use without, you know, wasting a lot of time verifying their note.",
        "They also, on this--if you've seen the image, we've enhanced the watermark space by creating a frame in the image so that people will know right where to look for the watermark, which is a portrait in the paper that matches the engraved portrait of Alexander Hamilton that they see in the center of the note.",
        "So they can look for those two features, or they can look for the threat that's embedded in the note which, when they hold it up to the light, there's a thin strip running down the note that says `USA 10.",
        "So we've enhanced these features so that they'll be easy for people to use, and hopefully will give them a good protection.",
        "And so these were all in the current bill, but you've just made them a little bit better in this one."

        "But at the beginning of the process, for about two weeks, we put out nothing but the new ones, so that people get used to seeing the new ones, and then as time passes they'll both be in circulation together.",
        "What's--let me ask you a little bit about the reason for this change.",
        "Obviously, it's making it more user-friendly, but there's been a problem, I guess, with counterfeiting the older 10-dollar bills.",
        "Well, the basic reason that we do this is actually to stay ahead of emerging counterfeit threats.",
        "So what we want to do is be prepared for the things that we foresee on the horizon, particularly as computer technology gets more sophisticated, because as you can imagine, today, because PCs and all the kinds of graphical software are so sophisticated that people are able to make copies of documents, and we and to make sure that currency has the best features in there to protect people from this threat.",

        "How much money are--is made each year?",
        "Well, last year, we--the Secret Service seized about--actually, we found in circulation about $44 million in counterfeit currency, which when you consider that there are $730 billion dollars of US currency in circulation, it's a relatively small problem.",
        "Now, of course, it's a problem for anyone who accepts a counterfeit note because they suffer a loss in that case.",
        "So we consider every instance of counterfeiting to be a problem.",
        "But overall, in general economic terms, it is not a significant crime.",

        "And eventually, if people will check they money more thoroughly by going over the guidelines that the Secret Service puts out and the Bureau of Printing and Engraving puts out, and learn about the security features, they'll be able to stop it before it even gets into circulation.",
        "And that would probably thwart quite a few counterfeiters from wanting to do it in the first place.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I'm just wondering--do--does changing the bill, as the Treasury is now doing with a new 10-dollar bill following--they put out new 20s and 50s--does that increase the degree of difficulty for counterfeiters, or is it only a matter of time before you catch on and you figure out the tricks and are able to duplicate the new ones?",
        "It certainly does help, and there's more than a dozen security features on the genuine bills.",
