        "It's now another 20 years since you wrote the book.",
        "What do you still carry?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, I carry the memories or the ghosts of a place called Vietnam, the people of Vietnam, my fellow soldiers.",
        "More importantly, I guess, I carry the weight of responsibility and a sense of abiding guilt.",
        "I carry joyful memories, too, friends I made and the conversations at foxholes where, for a moment or two, the war would seem to vanish into camaraderie and friendship.",
        "The wars don't end when you sign peace treaties or when the years go by.",
        "They will echo on until I'm gone and all the widows and orphans are gone.",
        "In some ways, you write how the experience of being close to death so often made things extremely vivid.",
        "Do those remain the most vivid memories of your life?",
        "I think in a down economy, this is just really bad timing, because the last thing we need to do is put more burden on businesses.",
        "I think that yes, it's a character.",
        "I very much hope that when my wife reads my writings so she reads it as if she is a character and not the real one.",
        "Sometimes she takes it too personally.",
        "I used to give her to read the column every week before I sent it to the editors.",
        "And sometimes she was so mad - are you crazy?",
        "You're not going to send that, or, you're not going to write that about me.",
        "So I would go, OK.",
        "You have five hours.",
        "Go ahead, write the column yourself.",
        "(Laughter).",

        "Do you still write about her?",
        "Sometimes, but in a different way.",
        "Not because she changed or I changed.",
        "It's the fact that we are not in Jerusalem any longer.",
        "So the whole style of the writing I guess that - that the columns that I'm delivering from here, from Champaign to her, it's more politically direct.",
        "Probably also due to the political situation getting just worse and more extreme, but also this distance and this sadness of this feeling that I gave up - that I surrendered, that I felt that I lost my small war.",
        "So the whole column is different than the columns that I used to write back home, back in Jerusalem.",
        "How do you look back on that decision now?",
        "Still traumatic, the feeling.",
        "Very confusing.",
        "I knew very well that I could not stay.",
        "Everything collapsed.",
        "Everything in my life just collapsed, and it started with the kidnapping of three teenaged settlers and then judging the life - the young Palestinian from Jerusalem.",
        "That was the day that I decided that I have to go now.",
        "I'm not sure that I recovered, but I also know that I cannot afford going back yet.",
        "I see how much the kids are happier, I guess, here and I think that they might have a better future not hiding.",
        "I couldn't lie anymore to my kids telling them that they are equal citizens in the state of Israel.",
        "They cannot be equal because in order to fit in and to be accepted and to be a citizen in Israel, you need a Jewish mother.",
        "So basically what I'm trying to tell my kids is just, it's their mother's fault and it's not my fault.",

        "Yeah, if they blame me.",
        "Yeah, blame it on her.",
        "But I hope that one day I will gain power somehow, and somehow convince myself that there is still hope and go back and fight, people who's trying to make that place worth living for both Jews and Palestinians.",

        "The new president of Nigeria is a former dictator who imprisoned journalists and dissidents without trial and ordered soldiers to whip people who didn't form neat lines at bus stops and banks.",
        "Back in the 1980s, Muhammadu Buhari took power in a military coup, and he ruled a harsh law-and-order regime in Nigeria for 20 months.",
        "Now he calls himself a converted democrat ready to operate under democratic norms.",
        "But is that possible?",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you very much for having me on.",
        "And I have seen Buhari's previous role 30 years ago described as a draconian military regime.",
        "Talk a bit about his human rights record back then in the 1980s.",
        "What did he do?",
        "Buhari first came to power on the last day of 1983 in an atmosphere of euphoric jubilation because he displaced a very unpopular civilian government that was regarded as corrupt and indisciplined.",
        "But that popularity and euphoria very quickly dissipated when opposition against the regime started.",
        "He jailed many of the politicians of the former regime for very, very long prison terms, sometimes exceeding 50 years.",
        "And given that some of these guys were already in their 50s and 60s, it was, quite frankly, as good as a death sentence.",
        "When some trade unions protested against his regime and went on strike, he arrested the leaders of the unions and put them in prison - arrested some journalists as well under - for violating a decree passed by his regime which made it a criminal offense to publish material that was embarrassing to the incumbent government.",
        "I've also seen mention of a campaign that Buhari led back in the '80s called a war against indiscipline which involved public humiliation - things like that.",
        "The war against indiscipline, or WAI, as it was called then, was an attempt by Buhari to introduce civic virtues into Nigerian society and public life.",
        "He introduced things like compulsory making people sing the national anthem, promoting queueing at bus stops and in public buildings - all ostensibly noble aims, however, violators were often forced to complete frog jumps.",
        "What are frog jumps?",
        "It's basically crouching down with your hands behind your head, then leaping up in the air, going down to a crouch and then leaping up again.",
        "At the time there were WAI brigade enforcers who had the discretion to implement whatever punishment they saw fit.",
        "And those guys, being soldiers, of course used punishments that they use on military cadets and on - that they use on errant soldiers in the barracks."

        "Do you think that human rights concerns in Nigeria might be trumped right now by people's desire to see a strong government that will smash the Islamist insurgents Boko Haram?",
        "What I'll say is that the human rights concerns are less of an issue with a democratically-elected civilian government than with a military dictatorship as Nigeria had 30 years ago.",
        "Thirty years ago, Buhari got away with some of the things he did, and the military got away with it because they suspended on coming to power several parts of the Nigerian Constitution, mainly those parts that dealt with human rights and the people's freedom of assembly.",
        "That situation does not exist today.",
        "A government in Nigeria today has to behave in a far more benevolent manner.",
        "There are far more civic institutions at play.",
        "The citizenry has evolved as well and are a lot more sophisticated, a lot more cognizant and aware of their rights and would not tolerate some of the excesses that the military got away with during the decades of military rule.",

        "I just finished talking with a group of high school students here in D.C., and the conversation eventually got to just that question.",
        "And there's something about being amid the chaos and the horror of a war that makes you appreciate all you don't have and all you may lose forever, which goes from the sublime, your parents, down to the petty, the Big Mac and a cold Coke.",
        "When you're really, really thirsty and you're drinking paddy water, the mind will lock on a can of cold Coke the way your mind might, you know, back in high school lock on a pretty girl.",

        "I had written the book for adults.",
        "I had imagined an audience of literate people on subways and going to work and in their homes reading the book.",
        "But I certainly hadnt imagined 14-year-old kids and 18-year-olds and those even in their early-20s reading the book and bringing such fervor to it, which comes from their own lives, really.",
        "The book was taken is applied to a bad childhood or a broken home, and these are the things theyre carrying.",
        "And in a way, it's extremely flattering, and other times, it can be depressing.",
        "I had a kid come up to me not long ago, though a book-signing line and say, yours is the only book I've ever finished.",
        "And of course, it was meant in a flattering way, and I took it that way, but in the back of my mind, I thought, God, all the pleasure that this kid has denied himself.",
        "Yeah, but he's got all those great books in front of him."

        "And in a way, for me, although on the surface, of course, it is a book about war, it's I've never thought of it, really, that way in my heart.",
        "Even when I was writing it, it seemed to be a book about storytelling and the burdens we all accumulate through our lives, our moms and dads and backyards, teachers, which I mean, my dad died, I don't know, four years ago, and he is as gone as anybody I knew in Vietnam.",
        "But like the ghosts of Vietnam, all I need do is, you know, close my eyes a moment and there he is throwing me a baseball.",
