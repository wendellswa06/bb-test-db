        "Let's see if we can go next to this is Daniel, Daniel with us from Greenville in Tennessee.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "I was in First Battalion, Second Marines in Somalia.",
        "At the time I was a 19-year-old kid and I picked up there and I've carried since an empathy for other people's suffering.",
        "And now I currently work in the mental health field, and I want to thank Mr. O'Brien because when I was in college his book was one of the books that we studied.",
        "That was after your tour in Somalia, I understand.",
        "Yes, sir, and it was kind of cathartic for me, actually.",
        "Mr. O'BRIEN: I'm delighted to hear that.",
        "I was talking with Neal before the show started and saying that books can sometimes have impacts on human lives that go way beyond what an author intends as the book is being written.",
        "And you can help people in ways you would never expect.",
        "I'm delighted to hear it.",
        "Maybe it helped you a little.",
        "Thank you very much, sir.",
        "And Daniel, the things you still carry - I wonder, every day you hear about another ship being taken by pirates off the coast of Somalia or about the gun battles erupting between the government that holds three square blocks of downtown Mogadishu and the warlords.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Actually, you know, at the time I was too young to truly understand, but I think we as a nation and as a military service did a major disservice to the Somali people.",
        "We left them in a vacuum that, you know, we were there to kind of take that vacuum away, but we left it almost in a worse condition than it was.",
        "Daniel, thanks very much, appreciate it."

        "And I think you're crucial to me having been a now-published author myself, if only for the reason that I wear my Red Sox hat with all my book covers because Mr. O'Brien does it, so I can do it too.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We like you anyway, Chris.",
        "Of all the amazing things you've given me, probably the most crucial to my development as a person is you gave an arena for my father and I to talk, and I think I'm 35, and I think a lot of my generation, Vietnam is a lost topic for us because our fathers don't want to talk about what happened to them.",
        "The memories are too close and too horrific.",
        "And through \"\"The Things They Carried,\"\" my dad and I were actually able to have conversations about his time in Vietnam, which ultimately led to me and he's very sick right now, actually, but it led to us being able to have conversations about each other.",
        "And so it really became this place where him and I could go to, when we couldn't talk about anything.",
        "We'd talk about your work and use that as a vehicle to discuss war and what he had experienced but also who he was as a person.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: That's a great thing to hear.",
        "You know, the rewards of being a writer can include, you know, awards and money and that sort of thing, but a story like yours is the one that makes me remember being 24 years old and setting out on a career to be a writer.",
        "I hear from disparate sources stories sort of like yours.",
        "I had a letter from a young woman, a 26-year-old woman in Minneapolis, a story kind of like yours.",
        "My dad was quiet and there was trouble in the family, and my mom was trying to explain to me why she had never been able to fall in love with my father, who had been in Vietnam, at least not wholly in love."
