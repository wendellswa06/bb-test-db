        "Boeing not only used the Caterpillar model, where it's extracted enormous concessions from its workers, which they didn't need in order to prosper, but then they went and took it a step further and hijacked and blackmailed the government.",
        "Those are strong words.",
        "Still, Boeing got almost $9 billion in tax incentives.",
        "The company declined to comment, but University of Portland finance professor Richard Gritta says the aircraft industry is cutthroat and volatile and Boeing does have to worry about labor costs ballooning over time.",

        "And when it does that, that hydrogen peroxide has targets in the hair follicle itself - important enzymes that control the color of hair."

        "Yes, but this is a true breakthrough, because the exact molecular mechanism of how the hydrogen peroxide hits the follicle cell at the bottom and what it does to melanin, which is the pigment of your hair, what it does to the enzymes that form it has now been worked out on molecular level.",
