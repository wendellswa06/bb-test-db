        "Is there any way to explain what seems to be happening there?",
        "People have tried.",
        "There's no - there is no direct relationship from my understanding, but now that we know the mechanism of hair graying in general, one can begin to start studying other effects.",
        "For example, take someone like Susan Sonntag with a big shock of white hair in the middle of black…",
        "Right.",
        "That's a striking finding.",

        "And for example, the way it's been studied very neatly is in the kind of hair that comes back after you lose your hair follicles from chemotherapy.",
        "And what happens is that the first hair that comes in is a bit gray, and then gradually the hair regains its color.",
        "So, there's complex stuff going down there?",
        "The hair follicle, in a literally - I won't say nutshell, but in one small, tiny part of our body sums up everything that we need to know about aging.",
        "We can study telomeres, DNA - all of the stuff that people who study aging do for a living.",
        "And we can use the hair follicle as an exercise in studying the aging of our whole body, and that's, again, what this research has captured."
