        "She's an excellent speaker.",
        "I was there this morning when she was rehearsing.",
        "She wasn't actually talking but she was getting a feel for the place and seemed very comfortable on the stage.",
        "One of the things though that she has to be aware of, there's a lot of pressure tonight.",
        "She has to make a case to the American people, that not only will her husband make it to president but that she will make a great first lady.",
        "That's very difficult for her to do because there has been a lot of negative publicity, there are a lot of people she still has to win over.",
        "There are a lot of people who don't know who she is.",
        "So this is her opportunity to introduce herself to America.",
        "We're talking with Dahleen Glanton, national correspondent for the Chicago Tribune who's been assigned to cover Michelle Obama, who speaks tonight to the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.",

        "Go ahead, please.",
        "My question was actually - I read a great article in the Chicago Tribune this weekend about her work on the south side of Chicago in her hospital, and how she referred many poor patients out to other smaller clinics.",
        "And it sounded like a tremendous job she did.",
        "Do you think she's going to have much influence on Barack's policies when - if he takes office?",
        "I think she will.",
        "I - Barack listens to her very closely.",
        "She certainly listens to him.",
        "There are certain things that she's passionate about, that's one of them.",
        "Another thing she's passionate about is helping military families.",
        "So, those are some things that will be high on her agenda, and I'm sure she'll make those known to her husband if he becomes president.",
        "Again, people are going to draw that analogy to Hillary Clinton at the beginning of the Clinton presidency.",
        "He put her in charge of the health care task force.",
        "Would she take a direct policy role like that, do you think?"

        "There has been no indication that she would even be interested in doing something like that.",
        "With two young girls, that's her primary focus right now and her priority.",
        "So, it would be a bit surprising if she takes on a role like that.",

        "Appreciate it.",
        "We've read also that she was not in favor initially of her husband's decision to run for the presidency.",
        "She wasn't.",
        "But she's completely changed on that now.",
        "Understanding that one of the things she'd been quoted as saying is that, she realized that this was not just about them.",
        "She, again, was more concerned about the time that she and her husband would be away from the children.",
        "That was the major issue for her.",
        "But she seems to have come to terms with that now and has been on the campaign trail when she needs to be and according to her aids, she will be doing much more of that leading up to November.",
        "She has also been quoted once as saying that the country would only get one chance to elect Barack Obama and got some criticism for that.",
        "Yes, and my understanding is that she has tried to clarify that as well.",
        "She said some things that were pretty controversial because she is very outspoken.",
        "And one of her challenges has been in this campaign to figure out how to balance that, not to make her not so much the person she is, which is a very candid person.",
        "But to also understand that sometimes what she said, is very misunderstood.",
        "That comment, the first time in my adult life, I'm really proud of my country.",
        "Do you think she's going to address that directly in her speech tonight?",
        "I really don't think so although I have not talked to her campaign directly about that.",
        "Her speech tonight is really going to focus on her family life.",
        "And it's really going to focus on how she met her husband, the things they have in common and basically laying out the case as to why he should be the next president.",
        "It's going to be a very personal presentation tonight.",
        "Their goal is that when you finish hearing her, when she's done tonight that you'll know exactly who Michelle Obama is and who her husband is through her relationship with him.",
        "Let's talk with John.",

        "I mean, going back, all the way to Eleanor Roosevelt, but I'm just curious why it really matters who Michelle would be addressing the Democratic National Convention when she's not the politician we're voting for?",
        "Well, it's very interesting because I quoted in my story this morning a professor who has done a bit of research on the importance of first ladies, and they found that voters do care that the potential first lady has an impact on how people feel about a candidate.",
        "Now, because the interesting thing is if Barack Obama is elected, Michelle Obama will play a prominent role as a representative of this country, so people need to feel like they know who she is, what she's going to bring to the table and what influence she might have on anything that he decides to do.",
        "So, the campaign felt that it was important enough to have her on the first night to kind of set the stage for what the rest of the week will bring.",
        "OK.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you very much for your answer.",
        "And John, thanks very much for the call.",

        "So far, I've had only polite rejections.",
        "Basically, what has happened, in already difficult area to find a job, the jobs have been diminished.",

        "Michael, when you talk to your friends, with unemployment so high and with things so tight in Greece right now with all of the cuts going on, the austerity measures, what's the mood when you talk to people?",
        "Well, my understanding is that they have talked about this somewhat, and the girls have become - it's just amazing how comfortable they have become with all of this.",
        "On the stage this morning, they actually stopped and paused and smiled at the cameras a bit while their mother was busy trying to get settled in for tonight's speech.",
        "They understand - they're young still, but the oldest one at least, understands that this is an important event.",
        "I don't know that they understand every detail of what this means if they do make it to the White House.",
        "But certainly, they do understand that what their father is doing is very important and they play a role in this.",

        "Well, has your state come up with a plan of its own?",
        "Oh, yes.",

        "So a large part of this is how do you educate the public ahead of time so they'd understand what would be necessary on their part.",

        "That money is primarily 85 to 90 percent of it going to local communities to help them develop their plans.",
        "One of the things in this national plan that's very clear is that in a pandemic, the federal government and the state government is unlikely to be much help, because we will be affected the same way that local communities will.",
        "So we can help right now in getting prepared for something like this.",
        "But in an actual pandemic, everything's local.",
