        "Yeah.",
        "What is the mood amid all this?",
        "I - the best way to describe it is people are shocked.",
        "People feel like these accusations and these resignations are coming so rapidly that there's a feeling of waiting for another shoe to drop, which is a strange time when people in Congress don't want to be talking about this.",
        "This is not - I mean, at any point in time, is this ever something that people want to have as the main conversation?",
        "But they've got a long list of policy priorities that they'd much rather be focusing on.",
        "But this has become the thing that is discussed at every watercooler and in every hallway.",

        "I mean, there's no way around it.",
        "This is a part of a national conversation.",
        "And if this is happening on Capitol Hill, I mean, there's an obligation to discuss it, I guess at watercoolers and also publicly.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "And that's part of what's happening here is that people feel - I think we're hearing a lot about women feeling emboldened to speak up after feeling that they had been retaliated against or that their careers had been inhibited by some event of sexual harassment or just being made very uncomfortable by powerful men in the workplace.",
        "And as more people feel empowered, we're seeing more people coming out.",
        "And we should say - I mean, this keeps going.",
        "We have the Ethics Committee in the House now investigating another member, Representative Blake Farenthold of Texas, a Republican.",
        "This is over complaints not just about what he might've done but complaints that may have - this all resulted in a taxpayer-funded settlement, which is raising a lot of eyebrows.",
        "Right.",
        "So one of his staffers sued him in December of 2014 - well, the settlement was issued in 2014.",
        "She received $84,000.",
        "And the Ethics Committee apparently did look into this at some point in time, but the accuser didn't really want to participate.",
        "She said she wanted to move on.",
        "She had left Washington, and she wanted to establish her own life outside of this accusation and this experience she had had.",
        "But based on new reporting after this woman came forward to Politico and CNN and talked about her experience, the Ethics Committee is reopening their investigation."

        "And to do it, I'm going--my government is going to really hire the best Congolese that we have, because good governors start with good leaders that you can trust.",
