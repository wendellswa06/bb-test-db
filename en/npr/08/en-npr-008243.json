        "There wasn't a lot new there.",
        "I think what I was most impressed with was when he said we can't be second to none.",
        "And it's really time that we get that attitude back in the country, where we say we are not going to be second to none from any country when it comes to innovation and competitiveness.",
        "And unfortunately we are second, in fact, we're below second.",
        "I'd like to know, how do you define innovation?",
        "Well, we define innovation as the development of a new product, a new process.",
        "So, in other words, we're figuring how to make something better, a new service, a new business model.",
        "Innovation is so much more than simply a semiconductor or the new Apple device.",
        "It's, you know, that's what people think of it but it's really about a small manufacturer or figuring out a way to make something different or make something better.",
        "It's about an insurance company going and selling insurance on the Internet.",
        "It's a wide variety of things.",
        "But the key reason innovation is so important is we can't compete with the Japanese or the Mexicans or the Indians if we don't innovate.",

        "State of the States you'll find governors talking about, whatever party, Republican or Democrat, talking about innovation, how they're going to drive technology, how they're going to get universities to work more closely with industry, how they're going to help venture capital - all of these things to create jobs.",

        "What they've promised in this deal is that they're going to shut down and seal their main nuclear facility at Yongbyon in the next 60 days, with the aim of eventually totally dismantling their atomic weapons program.",
        "As for fuel aid that they'll get in return, they'll get 50,000 tons to start when they shut the reactor and readmit the international inspectors, and they'll then get another additional 950,000 tons when they irreversibly disable the reactor.",
        "So they're getting a million tons of fuel oil in total.",
        "So I suppose you will have to negotiate questions like what happens with North Korea's nuclear weapons.",

        "There are a number of other issues.",

        "Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill, is happy about a couple things.",
        "One is he is very happy about the way this issue has brought together the U.S.",
        "and Chinese working on this.",
        "He believes that the Chinese have applied pressure on North Korea to get them back to the negotiating table, to moderate their demands for fuel aid and to finally approve the deal.",
        "I think it has to be said that China probably put some pressure on the U.S.",
        "to compromise a bit, too.",
        "But Hill is also encouraged because he thinks that the six-party progress could be used to build a new sort of security structure for northeast Asia and resolve more deep problems that have been there since the Korean War and even before.",
        "Hm.",
        "Does he think he has an agreement that can be verified and that North Korea can be assured of actually following; because of course they violated the last one?"

        "The keypad device worked very well, however, we had a lot of user error because the customers had to put codes into the device every pay cycle.",
        "And the error rates cost a lot of man time hours for customers calling in saying their car was off, when in actuality it was just a input error.",
