        "I mean particularly the next evolution that we're going to see with video on the Internet is people being able to watch it on their TV, so kind of making a connection between the Internet video on their PC to the television set.",
        "And what we're used to watching on our television is very high-quality material and so I think when you have the, you know, skateboard accident video or the cute kitty taking a nap video and it tends to be sort of lower quality, you're not going to want to watch that sitting in your living room when you've got a 100 channels of really high-quality content available.",
        "And I understand we're talking about this in a specific content, but you just described broadcast television as really high content - quality content, which, in another context, you might want to take that back.",
        "That's true.",
        "You know, production values tend to be high.",
        "You know, the camera isn't shaky, the, you know, the sound isn't fuzzy.",

        "And I find that the amateur homemade video podcasts and videos that you find online, most of them are - can be very dumb but every once in a while you'll find one that's very clever, very witty.",

        "And every once in a while you'll find a specific podcast or you'll find person whose sense of humor really matches your own online.",
        "And whereas on regular they really are produced to please the widest possible audience, which really means that it kind of makes it pretty boring for most people.",
        "And, Scott Kirsner, what Andrew seems to be saying is he likes these tiny little niche broadcasters.",
        "And I think a lot of people do.",

        "It's ridiculous.",

        "Well, yeah.",
        "I mean if you think about - if you were someone who was using the Web in the early days, you know, 1994, '95, '96, there weren't a lot of really well made professional Web sites out there.",
        "And so you find yourselves spending a lot of time visiting someone's pictures of their dog on their homemade Web site or - I remember there are a lot of universities that would put up, you know, information about, you know, was the coffee pot freshly made on the fifth floor of the university, you know, computer science center.",
        "And people went to these Web sites because there wasn't a whole lot else available.",
        "And I think that's kind of what we've been seeing in the last year with video is that, you know, there kind of was a vacuum of professionally created content on the web.",
        "And so a lot of people jumped to the conclusion that this is going to be a medium dominated by amateurs, and I just don't think that's going to play out long term.",

        "I don't think anybody predicted that it would be predominantly taken over or run by the amateur.",

        "No, I don't think that stuff is going to go in.",

        "And I think that's going to force both the big media companies to be more creative about what they put on the Web and maybe less formulaic; and it's going to force, you know, the folks who are making video in their backyard or their basement to be just really clever and really funny and really unique in what they create.",

        "They were both seen 80 million times, or 85 million times, so that's a pretty big audience.",
