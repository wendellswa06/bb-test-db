        "So just as briefly as you can, tell us where do you think things went off the rails, and do you agree with the president, that something good could come out of this?",
        "I think it was wrong in substance, and it was wrong in process.",
        "Somehow Paul Ryan got it in his mind that in 17 days he could introduce a bill, stick in front of his members, get it passed.",
        "And by the end of that 17 days, I would venture a guess that maybe 20 people actually in the House knew what was in it.",

        "So it was a substantive mess.",
        "It was a, I think, a political disaster for Paul Ryan, who really for the first time had to try to govern, not only pass a bill but pass a bill that was going to be signed, which is a different exercise.",
        "And yes, I think it was a debacle.",
        "What could have been done differently?",

        "He is president.",
        "Why didn't he tell Paul Ryan start the way President Obama did - it was a 13-month process, they had hearings, they had markups, the president went around the country, there was the big summit with the Republicans - and do the legwork to come up with a bill that you think can have some bipartisan buy-in.",
        "That may have been very difficult, but no one said this was easy.",
        "You know what?",
        "I'm going to ask you later why do you think he didn't, but let me hear from Domenico on this.",

        "And the fact that they didn't have anything ready to go is just a fundamental failure on all sides.",
        "And for President Trump to show the kind of impatience he did to then deliver this ultimatum, which in \"\"The Art Of The Deal\"\" he talks about, you know, you've got to be willing to walk away from the deal and that should be the thing that is the lever that can get people to go - well, he put all his chips in and lost all of them, you know, and then walks away from it.",

        "They're going to move on to tax reform, and tax reform, by the way, is a lot harder than health care.",
        "Ken, what do you think?",
        "What do you think this means for the agenda of the Trump White House going forward and also congressional Republicans?",
        "Well, if you make the argument that the House Freedom Caucus was emboldened by their opposition to Obamacare Lite (ph) as we heard Tom DeLay say, which is kind of funny, I mean - but if you think that the conservatives are more emboldened, then I don't see what you can do and what you can say that will bring along more moderates, let alone entice Democrats to come onboard.",
        "Yes - it's interesting.",
        "We talked about how the Democrats so-called rammed Obamacare down Congress's throat with no Republican votes.",

        "I think it's much easier to say no, because they've been saying no for seven years, than it is to say yes.",
        "And I don't see how a new bill that brings along the conservatives would be any more palatable to the moderates who are nervous and the Democrats who just completely are against it.",
        "But for all of that attention to the problem, the reconstruction has still not begun in earnest.",
        "Some people are still waiting for insurance checks before they can start to work on their houses.",

        "Everything in here was gone.",
        "All we had was just a few two by fours holding up the whole structure, and I think what really held this structure up was the columns that I had.",
