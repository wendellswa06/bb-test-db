        "Hi.",
        "Thanks - good to be here, Neal.",
        "Can you describe how conversations have changed?",
        "Can you give us an example?",
        "Well, I think what you're having is more explicit conversations about race and safety in classrooms.",
        "One of the things that happened after - immediately after the Trayvon Martin killing was that teachers wanted to talk to their students about safety, what their experiences were like, and if they had ever really experienced, you know, racial profiling themselves.",
        "And this is a subject - it's difficult even now, but taboo.",
        "It - it often is.",
        "And, in fact, we've - we heard from teachers who actually either had very good conversations, because they were supported by school principals who thought this was important, and we heard from teachers who were afraid to have those conversations in classrooms.",
        "And what's worked, and what hasn't?",
        "Well, generally, what's worked are frank ones that talk about - well, you know, there are a couple ways.",
        "One is with younger children, even just talking about stereotypes, because this is a complicated problem.",
        "And you can talk about it explicitly as what happened to Trayvon, or you could talk about it explicitly as what it's like to be a, say, 14-year-old black male.",
        "But you can also talk to eight-year-olds about what it feels like when other people judge you because of how you look or because of another label they've applied to you.",
        "So depending on the age of students, we found that those kinds of things worked.",
        "But generally what teachers are telling us is that conversation works, you know, getting kids to talk about their real fears, their experiences, if you have a mixed racial class, even servicing the idea that, you know, depending on your race, you may not look at the police the same way.",
        "And, I wonder, you're sort of describing what African-American kids are reacting to.",
        "What about in those mixed-race classrooms?",
        "What about white kids?",
        "What about Latinos?",
        "What about Asians?",
        "Well, I think what's important is that teachers facilitate conversations, because what's important is that the white kids aren't dismissing the experiences or, you know, perceptions of other kids.",
        "And that's part of this thing about getting rid of stereotypes.",
        "We don't dismiss your experience because - just because it's yours, and I haven't had it."

        "I mean, if you go back to the original democracy, I mean, if you look at Greek democracy, with all its problems - with its slavery, with its exclusion of women - there's something very interesting amid the problematics of Greek democracy, which is that Greek democracy and Athenian democracy never had elections.",
        "Instead, citizens were chosen at random at the beginning of every year, and 6,000 citizens would take political responsibility for the city for a year, and after that year, their term would expire and then another 6,000 would be chosen at random.",
        "Like jury selection.",
        "Well, exactly like jury selection.",
        "I mean, that's the vestige that we have of citizens taking responsibility for one another.",
        "But I think that we've been rather inured to the possibilities of taking responsibility for ourselves in terms of bigger government.",
        "We've been deskilled by our transformation into consumers rather than citizens, and I think that we do need to reclaim the possibilities of actually being responsible not just in what we buy but in how we govern ourselves.",
        "Is that practical given that this is a country and an economy far vaster than anything that ancient Athens had to deal with?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
