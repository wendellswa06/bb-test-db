        "Hi.",
        "I was falsely arrested just shortly after - actually, shortly after the Trayvon Martin case.",
        "And I was wearing, you know, not surprisingly enough, a hoodie and a - a black hoodie and a black pair of pants.",
        "It was raining and cold outside.",
        "I was with two of my friends, and they were both male.",
        "And it was all thrown out, you know, the whole case was thrown out and everything.",
        "But I was put in jail overnight and everything while they figured it out.",
        "And, you know, it was a long process.",
        "But, you know, it was cited that one of the reasons that we were stopped and arrested was because of, you know, the way we appeared, that we, you know, were dressing, you know, suspiciously, I guess because of my hood.",
        "My friend also had a hoodie on.",
        "And that was honestly written down as one of the reasons, that we looked suspicious.",
        "You know, we both had our hands in our pockets, and I guess it wasn't conducive to, I don't know, the way we were supposed to look at the time and in the area we were in.",
        "So now I don't dress like that.",
        "It was, you know, about 12 o'clock at night, and, you know, I do specifically avoid wearing a hoodie.",
        "And, you know, I'm a young, white female, and I have that fear myself.",
        "So, you know, it's kind of silly, in my opinion, but I don't want to be profiled.",
        "I don't want to, you know, (technical difficulties) wearing a hoodie does that, then, you know.",
        "That first night in jail can be a very long night.",
        "Yeah, it was 14 hours, and it was awful, you know, just awful.",
        "It was a tiny cell, by myself, and I was separated from my friends, you know, and it was - it was detention where anybody could be put in there with me.",
        "And nobody was, you know, and I'm glad for that, but that was a big fear, you know.",
        "I understand.",
        "Do you think that's fair?",
        "Do I think it's fair?",
        "That you decided not to wear a hoodie after that?",
        "No.",
        "I think it's ridiculous that I have to fear what I look like, and that somehow, that's going to be stigmatized, and I'll be put in prison for it and my freedom taken away from me very quickly.",
        "I mean, it's something that has just sat with me and stayed with me, and I wish it would go away.",
        "You know, it's really sad."

        "The Community Relations Board is being very proactive in addressing the potential outcomes of both the stand your ground hearing, and if the case survives the stand your ground hearing, the trial.",

        "And we're trying to stay ahead of the curve by engaging the youth of our community in a partnership to promote nonviolence, regardless of the outcome.",
        "How do you do that?",
        "How do you convince people...",
        "Well, I guess there are limited ways that you can do it, and about the only way to go about it is to roll up your sleeves, engage the young people in our community in the process, which we have already done, and the whole - we're going to begin the next phase by holding a youth summit in partnership with the Miami-Dade County Youth Commission, as I said, on March 28th at the Board of County commissioner chambers.",
        "It's going to be televised community-wide, and we're going to hear from young people in the community what their ideas are about how to avoid problems, how to avoid violence if the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case is one that creates an atmosphere of violence.",
        "I wonder, Maureen Costello, would you have any advice for Edward Shohat?",
        "Cars.",
        "Well, I encourage them to really go - really act positively on that, listening to youth and letting youth speak, because the best way to avoid violence is to be able to service - to get people talking to each other.",
        "And, you know, it's not simply - the Trayvon Martin case was this outward, you know, very public example of something that is for many people a daily part of their existence.",

        "And so I think that the dialogue that goes on has to be wider than that, and you have to be willing to hear some pain on the part of people, that this is something that has affected their whole lives.",

        "We have to take precautionary measures, but I think it's really important for the people who have the issues.",

        "I wonder, Edward Shohat, as you work there in Miami-Dade, this is part of the conversation you must be having, as well.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We've already met extensively with groups of young people in our community, and we've heard the message, loud and clear, that there are serious issues among them of racial profiling and of experiences with the community that doesn't necessarily recognize them as being equals, and that there is a potential for very negative reactions should the outcome of the Trayvon Martin trial or the stand-your-ground proceedings not be viewed as acceptable to them should the case get dismissed, for example, on a stand-your-ground motion."
