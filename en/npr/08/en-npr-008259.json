        "And the message that we're promoting is a message that all of that is important and well and good, so long as it is couched in a nonviolent, dialogue-oriented response, rather than in a response of violence.",
        "We know, for example, that we can reach a large segment of young people by partnering with young people who are of like mind and who agree with the message of nonviolence, regardless of the outcome of the Trayvon Martin case, of the George Zimmerman case.",
        "I don't know...",
        "However, there is a segment of the community which will promote violence and seek violence regardless of anything we say, and we are interested in hearing - and that's why we're convening a youth summit, to focus on how to reach a broader segment of that community.",
        "Yes, I have two children, one who's in law school right now, and one who's about to start.",

        "The reality is, as Sean pointed out a few minutes ago, my children are not in the community, the specific community or in the specific peer group, of Trayvon Martin.",
        "And we need to listen to that community very closely as to the messages that they're hearing and the important points that they feel need to be made in order to promote a message of nonviolence.",

        "I agree completely.",
        "You know, classrooms are the place to talk about these things, and you have to have a lot of courage to be a teacher.",

        "The conversation has to be two-way.",

        "That's the essence here.",

        "Do they hold those kinds of beliefs?",
        "And how do they - how did they acquire them and test them?",
        "Are they truth?",
        "They have to have exposure to people who are unlike them and understand - and that's probably the best way to learn that those beliefs, those stereotypes, aren't true.",
        "The other thing that we saw happening right after the killing last year and which I think continues, this is a generation that is a real activist generation.",
        "They want to make social change.",
        "And I think that's true of students who are black, white and brown, that they want to do something.",
        "And right after the Trayvon Martin incident, what you saw was rallies of kids wearing hoodies, for instance, standing in solidarity.",
        "We heard of so many schools that were raising money to send to the family to help offset funeral costs.",
        "Those kinds of things may not be directly addressing the underlying issues, but they're collaborative activities that bring community together and build community, and when you build community, you reduce violence.",

        "I'm an eighth grade teacher, and I just, in listening to all of this, was thinking about some of the things I do a little bit differently.",
        "And one of the things I've been trying since some of this happened is just when looking at stereotypes with my eighth-graders, not even getting into the violence of it, but talking about how we can use humor and do things to sort of defy those stereotypes.",
        "And one of the things we've done in classes, you know, we looked at, like, for example, Bill Cosby.",
        "And then my - the community where I teach is predominantly white, but we, you know, we read this article about how, when he first became a comedian, he talked about things that were really only familiar to those in the black community, but then how he wanted to be a positive influence and to relate to a broader audience, and then, you know, with \"\"The Cosby Show,\"\" the idea of bringing in a successful black family into prime time.",

        "And so rather than go, you know, some of the negative route, what I've tried to do is be more positive with that instead of talking about the violence, but just how can we all relate to stereotyping and how can we stop that.",
        "Maureen Costello, I wonder if you had a thought about that and about how the conversation changes in a predominantly white class.",
        "Well, it does change very much, and I think that's fine that it does because there are two distinct problems that have to be addressed.",
        "What I'm hearing - I think it's marvelous to, you know, to go to a predominantly white class and show positive images of people of color.",
        "That's incredibly important because these are kids who may not have any daily interactions.",
        "So we get to, you know, kind of what people talk about as contact theory, which is I'm going to be less afraid of somebody if I know them.",
        "So if it's not an integrated school, then you're going to have to do that by proxy.",
        "And so you do it by Bill Cosby or by popular sports heroes, people, musicians, whatever.",
        "That is one way to do it.",
        "My concern about that is that it kind of only scratches the surface.",
        "And until those students who may be living middle-class lives and who have never encountered any of the things that your last guest talked about when he was driving his Cadillac and gets, you know, stopped constantly is that they don't understand how the system works against certain people because of their color, and I think it's important to expose them to that.",
        "So it's two-pronged.",
        "It's, one, you know, let's humanize and become familiar and give you windows into the lives of other people.",
        "But secondly, let's also kind of examine the circumstances that create the circumstances those folks live in and that they have to deal with every day.",
        "Melody, do you think - is there a way to do that that you try to do?",
        "You know, I think so.",
        "And I have a - I teach eighth-graders, so some of them, just from a maturity standpoint, are not ready to deal with that conversation.",
        "But, you know, as we talk about stereotypes, there are a lot of them that can identify with just, you know, I'm alone without a parent in the mall.",
        "And so the store clerks watch me a little bit more closely because I'm a teenager, and they think I'm going to shoplift, you know, or do something like that."
