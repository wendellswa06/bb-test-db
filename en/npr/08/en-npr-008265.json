        "She was surprisingly subdued about it.",
        "I don't know if I'm really skeptical or if I'm not this trusting, but if I see the money in some form, then I will be quite happy."

        "So, I mean, I'm happy for Heida that she's getting it, but the overall thing - it feels very unfair.",
        "Once you get over the thrill of the idea of a jubilee, you realize it's just a government policy.",

        "Really?",
        "Great story about how, yes, the Supremes were booked onto the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars Tour, on which we considered the Supremes going from worst to first, unknown at the time, they were almost forced out of the tour by Motown head Barry Gordy, who told Dick Clark that if he wanted to bring aboard his new, hot soloist, Brenda Holloway, he'd have to accept the Supremes, for a very small rate of course, as kind of the other part of the deal in order to get Brenda Holloway.",
        "Well, Dick Clark agreed, and while that tour was going from coast to coast in June and July and early August of 1964, the Supremes' single Where Did Our Love Go was released.",
        "It went to number one right during the time when the Supremes were at the beginning, the opening act, on this twelve or fourteen act of the tour.",
        "And by the end of the tour Where Did Our Love Go was number one, and the Supremes were closing the show every night.",

        "Okay, here's an e-mail we got from Susan in San Antonio, Texas: \"The very first album I bought for myself was a mono, not a stereo, best of album of Gene Pitney hits back in the mid-1960s.",

        "Great music.",

        "Now Gene Pitney, interestingly enough, a couple of his biggest hits, Town Without Pity, we heard a little bit about that before, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, they were the theme songs from a couple of pretty big movies.",
        "Well, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence really wasn't, because John Ford, the director, didn't want a theme song.",
        "And, in an interview a couple of years ago, Hal David, the lyricist for that song with Burt Bacharach, said that they were basically hired by the movie studio to write what he called an exploitation song.",
        "They were hoping it would be the closing or opening theme of the movie, but John Ford, certainly not a rock and roller, not of the generation of Gene Pitney and Burt Bacharach and Hal David, John Ford said I don't want a rock song, a pop song, in my movie.",
        "So the song was never included, was never mixed in.",
        "But in effect, it became a three minute commercial for the movie and did very well on the radio.",
