        "During a time of heated debate and immigration policy playing a big role in the presidential election, what does this ruling change for people who might face deportation?",

        "Mark?",
        "Well, the ruling actually doesn't change anything, so that the illegal immigrants who would have benefited - nobody's really sure, but maybe 3 or 4 million people who have U.S.-born kids - are already explicitly exempted from deportation by the president's other policies.",
        "And what this program, which was blocked, would have done - would have given them work permits, Social Security numbers, EITC welfare, driver's licenses at the state level.",
        "So it would've been a provision of an actual benefit so that they don't get the benefit, but they don't actually change in their current status.",
        "And it's important to note that the Supreme Court didn't rule - and neither did, really, the lower court - on the substance of the program - in other words, whether the president is allowed to do this under the Constitution.",
        "All they did was say that the hold on the program, the injunction that froze it, has to stay in place until there's a full litigation, a full airing of the issues at the lower court level."

        "So yes, Mark is correct.",
        "The status quo continues, which means that our valuable law enforcement resources are stretched thin and unscrupulous employers continue to benefit from a broken immigration system.",
