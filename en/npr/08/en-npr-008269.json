        "And as the president pointed out today, the Department of Defense, during the Bush administration, had already investigated the cases and sent some of the abusers to prison.",

        "In fact, the most direct consequence of releasing them, I believe, would be to further inflame anti-American opinion, and to put our troops in greater danger.",

        "And she says she's not alone in believing that today, President Obama broke his promise.",
        "All the groups that have been pushing for the release of this information have been pushing for accountability for the widespread, unsystematic abuse of prisoners that was conducted under the Bush administration.",
        "All of these groups would be sorely disappointed in the breaking of the promise of transparency and accountability that President Obama issued.",
        "But Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, thinks the president did the right thing, even though he had to backtrack on a commitment.",

        "Are people talking about that, even thinking about that and thinking about politics?",
        "Yeah, it's really kind of a neat concept.",
        "It's one we introduced, actually, about 15 years ago, in an early article in Nature in 1996.",
        "But we didn't know how to make the particles form different crystal lattices.",
        "We could zip them together, but we couldn't get them adopt the perfect structure that we were after, a design structure, let's say, one that mimicked table salt, sodium chloride or diamond.",
        "We now know how to do that, and what this paper really does, it doesn't introduce that idea.",
        "That idea, as I said, has been around now for about 15 years.",
        "But it introduces the set of design rules that allow scientists to systematically make almost any structure that they'd like with completely tailorable what we'd call lattice parameters.",
        "Give me an example of the kinds of things.",
        "Well, as I said, so if you wanted to have a structure where you had an arrangement that's similar to the way atoms are arranged in table salt, you could do that; the way atoms are arranged in diamond, you could do that; in silicon; really anything you'd like based upon these sets of design rules that dictate what the governing principles are in terms of guiding the assembly process and controlling which particles surround others in the solution containing similar entities."

        "Can you make substances that never existed before?",
        "Well, all of these substances never existed before because they're made out of these nanostructures, and they have this tailorable structure so that the pattern has existed before, in many cases, but the actual composition is brand new.",
        "But in addition to that, we can make arrangements of particles where there is no mineral equivalent, where, you know, it truly is an example of, you know, man over nature in this case where, by creating these programmable atoms, if you will, we can make lots of structures that make sense from a geometric standpoint, but we don't have chemical or mineral equivalents.",
        "Well, apart from the elegance of what you've been able to do, what kinds of practical items could come out of it?",
        "Well, it's early there, but there already are examples of practical items coming out of the atomic-scale building blocks, or what we're calling the nanoparticle building blocks that I've been describing.",
        "They're the basis for diagnostic systems, for example, medical diagnostic systems, probes that are used in high-sensitivity assays for biomarkers associated with disease.",
        "So a company we started, called Nanosphere, that's commercialized them over the last 10 years, they're beginning to be used now for all sorts of therapeutic applications.",
        "There's a new start-up company called Arosense(ph) that is now beginning to use these types of particles for very powerful forms of gene regulation.",
        "But I think that's really just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.",
        "I think that this is a fundamentally new way of thinking about building materials, and materials are important to almost every application that we take for granted, whether we're talking about electronics, optics, biomedical applications, even examples where we're interested in things like solar energy harvesting and energy conversion and storage.",
        "The ability to take tiny building blocks and arrange them with sub-nanometer precision in three-dimensional space with total control over the types of building blocks and, as I said, all the lattice parameters, the distances between them is going to create a pathway to realizing a whole new class of materials that I think are going to have many important applications.",

        "It's more the analogy that matters here in the sense that we're taking inspiration from nature.",
        "We're not making anything that nature makes, but we're taking inspiration from nature, the fact that we now know what the double-helix is made of, and the base pairing that occurs within.",
        "We're using chemistry to synthesize components of that structure and attaching them to a natural structure, materials, as you said, physical entities, and then using those recognition properties to build a larger structure, and in this case the properties of the larger structure depend upon where the different particles go.",

        "I actually used to work at Center for Nanospace Material Science in Oak Ridge National Laboratory.",
        "And part of my time there was spent trying to study the health and safety aspects of working with nanoparticles.",
        "And at this current moment, I know there is no real conclusive evidence on the effects of nanoparticles just because they're very new and, you know, it's very tough to study long-term things that haven't been around for very long.",
        "And I was wondering if there's been any insight recently into whether or not these particles are safe to work with, if there's been any negative or even positive health, like, benefits from working with nanoparticles.",
        "All right, thanks for calling, Michel.",
        "It's a good question.",
        "It's an often-asked question.",
        "It's a tough one to answer because nanotech is so broad in terms of definition.",
        "So it really depends upon the class of materials that you're referring to.",
        "In this case, much of what we're doing involves gold nanoparticle structures, especially the biomedical applications that I was alluding to.",
        "Gold is a fairly chemically inert material.",
        "In certain cases, in actually many cases, they've even used it in therapies, for arthritis, for example.",
        "It seems to be a material that is fairly innocuous and shows some extremely beneficial properties in terms of developing biodiagnostic tools or medical diagnostic tools that allow us to track disease in early states.",
        "And in the case of therapies, we've created a new way of actually using them to affect gene regulation in a very - what appears preliminarily as a very safe and very powerful way.",
        "And so when you talk about health benefits, I think they could be enormous because if you could design - make designer materials that could dramatically change the way we treat disease and get it at its genetic roots using these types of nanomaterials, that would be an enormous win."

        "But we keep pushing the development of that.",

        "That's a type of thing that might be able to be made by other tools, although I'd argue actually it would be difficult if you made it out of the types of materials that we made it out of.",

        "What's the next step?",
        "Well, there's a fundamental aspect to it.",

        "That's really what our whole research has been about.",
        "But then every time we do that, we often discover new materials and new techniques that can be translated into the development of powerful new technologies, and in this area that we started out talking about today, I see incredible promise in the use of these types of materials in intracellular gene regulation, in the development, as I said, of powerful new medications, pharmaceutical reagents, for example, that can treat many debilitating disease.",
        "We have several programs focused on a variety of different types of cancer types and a lot of promising results not just in cellular models but in animal models.",
