        "So this number of missing, I mean, has jumped up astonishingly high - I mean, at more than 600 people.",
        "Why the sudden increase from the sheriff's department?",
        "Well, it's the counting, basically.",
        "The sheriff's department, law enforcement's going through records collected at the height of this crisis, when people were calling in like crazy - 911, missing persons reports.",
        "They're going back through those and tallying them up.",
        "And that's why you saw the number go up, you know, 501 people yesterday.",
        "Again, you know, a lot of those people probably don't know they're being looked for.",
        "Others, in this case, more - sort of an abnormally high number of them might be found dead.",
        "But people are coming out of the woodwork all the time.",
        "And I spoke with this gal, Laura Whitaker (ph).",
        "She was really ecstatic when I spoke with her.",
        "She'd just heard from a friend who had escaped the fire narrowly, just took off without her phone and kept driving - went all the way to San Francisco, found a place to stay and didn't think to call to tell her friends that she was OK.",
        "I said, I love you.",
        "I love you.",
        "I love you.",
        "And when you get back here, I am going to hold on to you, and I will never let you go.",
        "Don't you ever do this again.",
        "But great news.",
        "Yeah, Whitaker's house was burned down to the ground except the wood stove.",
        "Wow.",
        "That is just the sound of relief that I think so many families are just hoping for and desperate for right now.",
        "You know, I was just up there with you reporting on this.",
        "And, I mean, even in Chico, it's like you sometimes have to wear a face mask because there's so much smoke.",
        "I mean, you can just feel the sense of this fire everywhere.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean, the smoke is, you know, sort of omnipresent, just hanging in the air.",
        "It kind of, you know, traps the light and makes it smudgy.",
        "So it's this - almost reminds you - the way you'd expect winter in Dickensonian (ph) London to look like.",
        "Plus, I think it makes the cold colder.",
        "So it's just doubly dark and doubly cold - really nasty - and apparently some of the worst air quality anywhere in the world.",
        "Unidentified Man #1: Oh, your mom was just like you when she grew up.",
        "Well, I built that in a metal shop in Nong Pling(ph).",
        "But the idea here was to make music that sounds like Thai music.",
        "For instance, that instrument that you just heard is using a Thai scale.",
        "And when Thai people hear it, they say, oh, that sounds like some of the music that we play in the Buddhist temples up north."
