        "Yeah.",
        "We're in the middle of a two-week challenge, which I will remind everyone of in a moment.",
        "Ron, in a number close races, the candidates have not been closely tied with their party's presidential candidate.",
        "In fact, only a few of them are running ads featuring endorsements from either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Neither the president nor Governor Romney has been particularly a great updraft in a lot of these states.",
        "They may be the most popular candidate for that state in their party, but they are not a tremendous boost to the Senate candidate.",
        "And Senate candidates, by and large, would rather run on their own terms and be elected on their own.",
        "Now, there are some exceptions to this.",
        "We mentioned the Mourdock campaign in Indiana and they want the endorsement, and they have had a televised endorsement from Mitt Romney, because that helps him look a little bit more moderate on that social issue that got him into trouble.",
        "Chris Murphy, the Senate candidate for the Democrats in Connecticut, is very eager to have people know that he's the Democratic candidate against Linda McMahon, self-financing Republican candidate.",
        "Vote for President Obama and For Me, Linda McMahon.",
        "So, in those cases, you do see the Senate candidate wanting to grab onto the presidential identity a little bit.",
        "Ron, predictions are dangerous game.",
        "But do you have a sense of whether the contours of the Senate will have broadly shifted come Wednesday, or whether we'll be looking at more or less the same fundamental body?",
        "Any prediction you make at this point, Melissa, has to rely primarily on polls.",
        "And we simply don't know if all of the polls or any of the polls, or most of the polls are right or wrong.",
        "But if they are right, and if we're reading other factors correctly, the Democrats would seem likely to lose three of those vulnerable seats, probably the ones in the Great Plains: Montana, North Dakota and Nebraska, maybe one in Wisconsin, as well.",
        "The Republicans though are likely to lose three of theirs.",
        "We mentioned Indiana, Maine is a state were Olympia Snowe's retirement really hurt the Republican prospects.",
        "And Angus King, former governor there who's an Independent but expected to organize with the Democrats, is the likely winner.",
        "And I already mentioned Brown and Warren race in Massachusetts.",
        "And the Republicans holding their seats in Arizona and Nevada is largely going to depend on how big the Hispanic vote is in those states, as well.",
        "So, on balance, probably not much change, probably not much chance the Republicans get the majority back this time.",
        "But tune in tomorrow night.",
        "OK.",
        "NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving.",
        "Ron, thanks so much."

        "He's 30 years old.",

        "Do you think that the Affordable Care Act, now that it's been upheld by the Supreme Court, will change things for you?",
        "I really hope so.",
        "The insurance I have now is sufficient, but it's just so expensive.",
        "And I've been denied insurance from several other companies.",
        "And so I went to the only route that I could, which was this health insurance risk-sharing plan.",
        "It's been a bit of a lifesaver for me, so that I can least have some sort of coverage right now.",
        "And do you figure you can shop around once the law fully goes into effect, assuming it does; that you can shop around, and find something that's more affordable?",
        "I hope so.",
        "I think a lot of people thought everyone can shop around already.",
        "But the problem was that I felt like for me, personally, I wasn't even allowed in the marketplace.",
        "I was shopping around.",
        "I did apply for other providers.",
        "But I was completely denied based on what they considered to be a high-risk condition - which was me being ill one time but otherwise, very healthy.",
        "How much were you following this ruling today?",
        "Were you glued to a computer at 10 o'clock, trying to figure out what the court had done?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It was a bit confusing, initially."

        "You know, if things are still up in the air, or if Congress and the courts are still going to be involved, and this is going to be politics as it has been, then I don't know.",
        "Then I'm left with the plan I currently have - which, you know, results to being nearly a quarter of my current take-home pay.",

        "It's scary to me.",
        "I understand their perspective; you know, allowing people to cross borders and compete.",
        "But in the end, I feel like I still haven't gotten to compete - or shop around in this marketplace.",
        "It's one of those things where I get where they're coming from, but the reality isn't what they're saying it is.",
        "And so I'm left with the options I have - which is unaffordable health care.",
