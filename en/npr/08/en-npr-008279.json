        "For the first time this week the President announced that he expects to turn over most of Iraq to what he deemed the newly trained Iraqi troops by the end of this year, a timetable if you will.",
        "This is something that people have been asking about.",
        "Again, not the kind of hoopla that I thought would surround this announcement.",
        "Well what's interesting is this is really seismic because for the Bush Administration to say something like this, which clearly isn't true.",
        "I mean, the Iraqi troops are not going to be ready in anything like that time, shows that they are actually having to acknowledge that something is terribly wrong in Iraq at this point.",
        "It's really just a kind of posturing because that's not going to happen by December or, if you ask me, the December after that, but it means that things have gotten so clearly bad, it's not almost a civil war in Iraq right now, it is a civil war depending on what you call it.",

        "It was quietly, again, quietly announced in a speech by the president.",
        "it was not delivered with the same hoopla that one might expect.",

        "So he has to say something, but he says it in a low-key manner knowing that policy wants such as ourselves will pick up on it and broadcast it to the world that he is thinking about a timetable, but as John says, December 31 does not sound feasible at all to think that the Iraqi troops will be able to take over most of the country.",
