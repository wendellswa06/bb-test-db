        "Okay, so that's just some of the irreverence that people who watch South Park are used to and Chef is one of the recurring characters and one of the craziest characters.",
        "And what we have heard from Isaac Hayes, who, much like his prostitute song there, has dealt with some sensitive issues through the years as they parodied many, many things on this show--but he has suggested now that he believes that the show has inappropriately ridiculed religion.",
        "In particular, many people are pointing to the idea that they, in fact, in a recent episode played satire against the Church of Scientology, which Mr. Hayes is a part of.",
        "Here's the real question: we can't speak to whether Isaac Hayes should be able to step away, E.R., from what his beliefs are, but do you believe that the irreverence that we've seen in many shows, in particular South Park, starts to cross a line when we talk about these things that heretofore have been untouchable, like religion?",
        "Well, to talk about South Park specifically, it started as a show that grew out of ridiculing religion and sacred iconic figures.",
        "So, for Isaac Hayes to suddenly get religion on this, so to speak, is a bit suspicious.",
        "They've ridiculed Jesus, they've ridiculed Jews, they've ridiculed a lot of different faith communities on this show.",
        "Now, Hayes said something though, having said that, he said something worth thinking about, particularly as people around the world, particularly in the Middle East and in Africa have been really upset about these cartoon depictions of Muhammad.",
        "People are dying around the world because of rioting, this is what Hayes said: religious beliefs are sacred to people and at all times should be respected and honored.",
        "As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices.",
        "My question is why did it take him so long to come to that conclusion?",
        "You know, obviously what really ticked him off was the Scientology part and I wish the man would have a sense of humor.",
        "It's one of those where do you draw the line cases.",
        "I don't think South Park would be funny if it depicted kicking a pregnant woman in the stomach or something like that, but when it comes to twitting religion, it seems that we're at a point, in Western society at least, where we can be humorous or ironic about such things.",
        "And for Hayes to suddenly step away claiming that it's not funny, for example, that this show has a Jesus character, frankly it's primitive.",
        "It makes it seem like he hasn't advanced to the late 20th Century and early 21st Century.",
        "And I'm excited because it's the first time I ever get to field the term lachrymose in a baseball interview.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, Loury, let's allow for people if we can here to change their minds.",
        "We should note in December of last year he was asked about the Scientology episode in particular and Isaac Hayes is quoted as saying, \"\"one thing about Matt and Trey,\"\" and these are the co-creators of the program, \"\"they lampoon everybody and if you take this 's'-fill in the blank--seriously, then I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge for $2.00, I ain't buying it.",
        "Now he is suggesting, as E.R.",
        "said and here's a further quote from Mr. Hayes, that he sees \"\"a growing insensitivity towards personal, spiritual beliefs in the media, including the recent controversy over cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad.\"\" Perhaps this is just..."

        "Perhaps this is just a metamorphosis that has occurred in his belief.",
        "Perhaps and perhaps it's a bit of a culture war inside of the South Park TV show.",
        "Or perhaps it's a contract negotiation ploy.",
        "That's a possibility as well, but I'm inclined to think that it's a great gift of our culture that we are able to engage in this kind of ridicule, criticism, joking, humor.",
        "It's a way of letting of steam, it's a way of not taking things too seriously.",
        "Everybody doesn't share the same religious beliefs, it's true that religious beliefs should be respected, but it's also true that their pluralistic.",
        "And for us to be able to get along in civil society with each other, when we have different pluralistic beliefs, requires a certain amount of deference and respect, but it also requires a certain amount of lightening up and being able to laugh at yourself when people are not being invidious or malicious in what they're doing.",

        "These employees will be deputized to make arrests, carry weapons and they'll dress in the same uniform as do the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Department.",
        "This is based on the idea that many of the areas are now seeing evacuees come back in and the strapped sheriff's department is not able to police in the way that they would like.",

        "Well, no because unfortunately we can talk about why, for example, there might be an uptick in criminality when those evacuees come in.",
        "But, for example, in Houston in November and December, the crime, the homicide rate went up 70 percent, five out of 14 of the homicides in Houston were from people who were from New Orleans.",
        "And so the fact is that there does have to be a certain kind of measure taken when large numbers of evacuees from New Orleans come in and we don't have to condemn the people in order to admit that that tends to be a problem because of the experiences of those people.",
        "E.R.",
        "Shipp, you know what the concern is going to be, that we're going to kind of see this happy policing by junior sergeants who now are given power to wield the big stick.",
        "That may be an issue, but what seems to me more glaring is that the parish we're talking about, St. Bernard Parish, laid off or fired or whatever you want to call it, about two-thirds of its staff and now they're going to hire people to come in at much more money than they were paying their original officers.",
        "Why not try to bring back the original officers who know the community, who know the players, and can use the income and the normalization of their own lives?",
        "It seems, to me, to be a stupid policy on the basis of that alone.",
        "Glen?",
        "Yeah, I think this is right, both what John and E.R.",
        "have said.",
        "That is: security is necessary, let's face it, but that the real issue here is a two-track employment thing where the private company comes in and at $750.00 a day to employ these people and they thing that's a low rate, whereas the full- time guards were making 30 grand a year down there and it has been pointed out some have been laid off.",
        "I don't know all the logistical details.",
        "There's also the issue of whether or not FEMA would provide money to the parish that it could use in that way, but the problem is going to be resentment within the ranks of people who are being paid on very different tracks to do basically the same job.",
        "Well, not just the ranks here, what's surprising to me and I'm a little shocked that no one in this group suggested, historically when we've seen outsiders brought in, in capacities like that as E.R.",
        "noted, if you don't know the lay of the land, particularly if you've shipped in from other areas like this, Texas to Louisiana, often there is this sense of occupation.",
        "It's the reason often that there is a residency requirement for police officers--the idea that, you know, you can wield power in a place that you don't live and don't have to answer to in a different way than if you were part of the neighborhood and have to see the guy at the local corner store, at the local movie, your kids go to school together.",
        "So it will be interesting to see, outside of the economic, how this all plays out.",
