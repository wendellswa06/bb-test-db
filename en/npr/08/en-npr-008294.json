        "It's by far the biggest challenge the regime has faced in decades, probably since 1982.",
        "And it's something that many Syrians just thought would never happen.",
        "The regime here has ruled since, you know, effectively since the 1970s, and the Baath Party has ruled since the early 1960s.",
        "And there's been limited challenge to that.",
        "There was a militant uprising in the 1980s, which was violently put down, and there's just been nothing since then.",
        "It's hugely significant and somewhat unexpected.",
        "I mean, two weeks ago, I was sitting here in Damascus and talking to people who are now seeing all those happening, and they were saying, no, it'll never happen in Syria.",
        "Syria is - effectively operates under an emergency law, where the government uses that to arrest dissidents and protesters.",
        "Where do you see this headed?",
        "I mean, do you see this headed toward an Egypt-style revolution?",
        "It's still difficult to say.",
        "As I sit here now, we've been hearing reports that the government has said it will lift the emergency law, which is, again, hugely significant because this emergency law has been in place for nearly five decades, and it gives, basically, the security apparatus here the right to do whatever it wants with almost total impunity."

        "Phil, do you find that people are more willing to be critical of the regime specifically in the last week or two, or do they feel - do people feel more emboldened as a result of what's been going on in Egypt and in Libya and now in Yemen?",
        "Yeah, there's no question about that.",
        "And literally, three weeks ago, people would almost have whispered conversations about the emergency law and whether or not it might be possible to consider removing it or relaxing it a little bit.",
        "And now on television here, Syrians are watching people in the street shouting that the emergency law must be repealed immediately.",
