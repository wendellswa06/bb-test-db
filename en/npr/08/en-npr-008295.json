        "Right after he made his announcement, I actually went out to the protest that was happening outside of the governor's mansion and spoke with people who said that his decision not to seek reelection wasn't enough.",
        "They said he had to resign now.",
        "They seemed even more motivated to continue protesting because this was no longer just about the governor, they told me, that the governor had become sort of a symbol of decades of corruption and bad decisions by leaders that have gotten Puerto Rico into all kinds of crises - fiscal crises, post-hurricane crises - and that they want something new.",
        "It's an interesting - really interesting thing that's been happening over the last week which is that each time the governor said he's not going to step down, the crowds and the demonstrations against him only seem to get more energized.",
        "And, you know, really, these protests happening across the island are remarkable and unlike anything that Puerto Rico has ever seen.",
        "I mean, we should just remind people this was about allegations of corruption within his own administration, his general handling of the aftermath of the hurricane and these specific text messages that were, to many, seem to be misogynist and offensive, right?",
        "Misogynist and offensive and sort of reflective of a governor and more broadly, the sort of a political system that is sort of out of touch with the real struggles that Puerto Ricans have been facing for more than a decade because of all those crises I was just talking about.",
        "Tomorrow there is a massive protest - I'm sorry.",
