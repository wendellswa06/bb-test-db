        "Not yet, and the Indonesia authorities have been very careful so far not to blame anyone in particular, but suspicion will clearly fall on Jemaah Islamiah.",

        "And after the Bali bombings, Indonesia really got serious about going after Jemaah Islamiah and several other militant groups operating in Indonesia with help from Australia and the US.",
        "Indonesia rounded up more than a hundred and fifty alleged Jemaah Islamiah operatives, and I think today most people, most analysts would tell you that Jemaah Islamiah is much weaker now than it was three years ago as a result of that effort, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have some operatives and some resources to carry out high-profile attacks like the Bali bombing, like the bombing of the JW Marriott in Jakarta in August of 2003, like the bombing on the Australian Embassy here in Jakarta just a year ago.",

        "He said that September and October were special months for such attacks, a reference to the October 2002 Bali bombing and the Australian Embassy bombing in September of last year.",

        "We think of it as a beautiful resort island, that Bali would somehow be isolated from this type of thing.",
        "And that's what they thought back in 2002, and after the Bali bombings then, I mean, foreign tourists just stopped coming and the people in Bali were just incredibly despondent because tourism was the main source of revenue on the island, and only last year did tourists begin to start coming back and did things start looking like, OK, they could get back to normal again.",
