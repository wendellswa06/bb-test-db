        "I think - I mean, I think eventually, they have to see that - I mean, we see the story of this woman, Tamara Greene, who may or may not have been at this party in the mayor's mansion and later was killed, and I think, you know, beyond how that fits into this soap opera, the real tragedy of that is it's one of so many murders that have happened in Detroit, and there's so much crime and poverty and serious issues that they're facing, and the longer than Kwame Kilpatrick stays in office, the longer he perpetuates this soap opera and takes resources and attention away from all the serious issues Detroit is facing.",

        "Absolutely not.",
        "I think that - I don't think that the prevalence of anything in our society is license to legalize it.",
        "I think that there are aspects of prostitution that are harmful to society, harmful to the individuals, and I don't necessarily think that legalizing it is going to help anything.",
        "Now Jay, in the Netherlands, prostitution is considered a legal profession, just like being a teacher or a police officer.",
        "They have the right to unionize, run ads for their services, collect government benefits.",

        "And I think whatever laws we have in place should be set up to protect those women from exploitation rather than persecuting and shaming them, and I think maybe decriminalizing it, if not straight-up legalizing, would go a long way towards making sure those women are protected.",

        "In terms of the rise and fall of gun violence on the streets, what happens if the court effectively says D.C.",
        "citizens should be licensed to keep handguns at home for self-defense?",
        "Does that change the game, make the city more dangerous?",
        "I mean, not living in D.C., it's hard for me to say definitively.",
        "But I think - I'm always ambivalent about this because I think we need as many controls as we can to limit the use of guns.",
        "But I feel like America just has such a deep-seeded cultural connection to guns and violence that if people really want guns, they're always going to find a way to have them, and I would be hesitant to tamper too much with the Constitution in order to try to stop something that just runs deeper than that."
