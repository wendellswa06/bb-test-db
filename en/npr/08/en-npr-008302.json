        "So some laws that are on the book kind of don't make sense to begin with.",

        "I mean, there's so many different facets of it.",
        "There's what is legal, there's what is possible - that is, you know, people are able to take assault weapons across state and county lines even when they're not legal.",

        "I mean, I think at the end of the day, the one thing America refuses to do on this issue is to really look at human nature and the people who are behind the guns.",
        "And I think that, you know, regardless of - if we take them off the streets or whatever the case may be, people will find a way to exhibit violence towards one another.",
        "It does scare me a bit to not have any guns at all, I mean, to be moving towards a society where, you know, an average citizen can't carry a handgun, especially looking at the economy and some of the things that are to come.",
        "It's interesting to see, you know, I think that weapons might be of a lot more importance in the future than they are even now.",
        "So it's like that saying, an armed society is a polite society?",
        "You believe that?"

        "How important is it for you to focus on issues like gun control versus other issues that are affecting urban communities?",

        "I mean, there's so much economic hardship and lack of economic and educational opportunities and lack of other things for people to get involved in, it leads up to the point where someone is getting involved in gun violence.",

        "Correct.",
        "And do you think that the cities need to work together, Eric, to do a better job of coming up with policies that deal with gun violence?",

        "just briefly.",
        "Okay.",
