        "That tune's called \"\"Saints and Sinners,\"\" written by David Torres, my musical director in the band, and that's David playing organ and the piano in there, \"\"Saints and Sinners.\"\" But it's cool; that's pretty close.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "They were together.",
        "But \"\"One Mint Julep\"\" is a tune that, of course, was made very popular in the '60s by Ray Charles himself, and Ray's on here and the great Billy Preston on organ.",
        "Well, you know what?",
        "We have the song now.",

        "Well, you know, that tune, when I was a kid, I would hear Ray Charles - I would hear it on the radio, on the record player.",
        "And I always loved that tune because it was very happy, you know.",
        "And it's got a good groove and Ray did it as a Cha-cha but I don't think he really knew he was doing it exactly like a Cha-cha-cha, you know?",
        "Because his was a little different.",
        "And I said, man, that lends itself perfectly to the Cha-cha-cha rhythm, you know.",
        "And of course, the Cha-cha-cha's a dance and a rhythm and so - and it's got the blues feel to it..."

        "You could hear Ray in the center here talking with us and he also recorded another song with us, \"\"Mary Ann.",
        "And that's something that Poncho has brought to the world of Latin jazz, that R&B influence.",
        "Willie Bobo and Mongo did it a little bit back in the '60s and '70s and Poncho just took on a whole new personality in combining those elements.",
        "In fact, he even took the New Orleans sound, with the harmonica and all that and the singing, and brought Latin jazz - you know, kind of fused it with Latin jazz.",
        "So he's having a good time, you know, putting his own voice, his own stamp on Latin jazz.",
        "It's clear that both of you are having a good time and Jose, a little bit later, we're going to hear some of your work.",
        "But you know, in addition to this being an American music, you've talked a little bit so far about how it's popular in Europe and, you know, I hope I get his name right - Sebastian \"\"Shoonk\"\"…",

        "Now, what do you like about this music and what do you hear when you hear it?",
        "Well, Sebastian Schunke added also a classical element to Latin jazz and there's some parts where he goes off more into a classical direction.",
        "And it's more like orchestral and he puts a lot of elements, a lot of progressive jazz that's used in it.",
        "And a lot of European players and people in South America, they're listening to the Latin jazz from the U.S., but they're as well adding their own special elements of their region, of their culture and creating just something new, just the music evolving.",
        "Poncho, when you look out in the audience - I'm sure you see a lot of different types of audiences, but what's your connection with the audience when you play?"

        "What's your sense of the state of jazz radio?",
        "Jazz radio for some reason always has had a very selective audience.",
        "It just always has been that way.",
        "And jazz stations have always just tried to just survive.",
        "There are no more commercial jazz stations.",
        "Those are gone, you know, they're dinosaurs.",
        "But now there are - jazz survived in public radio and now there are only less than a handful of full-time jazz stations in the whole country.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so that's why the few that are left are really supported very heavily by its members like here, K-Jazz here and WBGO in New York City - well in New Jersey and the New York area.",
        "So it's something - and then the interesting thing about us here on the West Coast, we're trying different things.",
        "We have now Latin jazz during drive time everyday, 5 to 7 p.m. on K-Jazz and that's one of the highest-rated programs on the jazz station.",
        "One of the few jazz stations left in the country, probably two - one of the two top in the whole country and people love listening to Latin jazz during drive time.",
        "So, you know, again, jazz radio is also evolving.",
        "Mr. RIZO: Right.",
        "Their station there, KUVO, they were doing Latin jazz every third song but actually, I think they've changed that policy now.",
        "But it is a jazz station and Carlos Landau, our good friend there, runs the stations over there.",
        "You know, one of the things that strikes us is that there's a question of jazz education.",
        "Do you think that there needs to be a little bit more of an outreach to people to educate them and if so, how do you that?",
        "Well, for me.",
        "I've done - what I do when I play universities and colleges and schools all over the country - is they usually line up clinics that we do before we play the concert.",
        "So I've done many question and answer periods and clinics with my group.",
        "I also have a book, \"\"How to Learn to Play the Basic Fundamentals of Latin Music,\"\" Poncho Sanchez's book and instructional DVD.",
        "So yeah, of course, and then there's a lot of stuff on the Internet nowadays, but very important to get more into the universities and the colleges of our music here.",

        "And I thought, it's good to expand jazz radio even further by introducing this to, you know, our jazz audience.",
