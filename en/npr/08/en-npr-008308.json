        "He was.",
        "He was the undersecretary of Labor when Arthur Goldberg, secretary of Labor, was named to the Supreme Court in 1962, and a few weeks ago, Stewart Udall, who was secretary of the Interior, I believe, under President Kennedy, he died a few weeks ago.",

        "HALTER: Well, I'm working here to put Washington back on the side of middle-class families, and unfortunately, as I go around the state, there's a lot of frustration with the incumbent, a belief that she has not been decisive on issues that are important to Arkansans, a belief on many issues that in fact she's sided with special interests rather that middle-class Arkansas families.",
        "I was out yesterday in East Arkansas, in the delta region, meeting with folks, and frankly, county judges are endorsing me and have said that she's disconnected, not responsive to them.",
        "And the fact is here, there are serious issues and serious differences between us.",
        "She voted for a Wall Street bailout bill, and Arkansans are extraordinarily frustrated with that, especially as they see tens of billions of dollars of bonus payments being made to Wall Street executives, and they also see the reports that the bailed-out banks in fact have lent less and paid their executives more than banks that were not bailed out.",
        "So there's a whole host of issues that we've debated.",
        "I asked Senator Lincoln, in fact, to give back her contributions from Goldman Sachs.",
        "She refused to do that, finally gave back some of the contributions yesterday.",
        "We have asked her in fact to give back all of the contributions from Goldman Sachs.",
        "And in the debate she actually drew a parallel between contributions from soybean growers and cotton growers and Wall Street executives.",
        "And, frankly, I was astounded by that because, obviously, soybean farmers didn't put our economy into the train wreck that we're experiencing.",

        "Mr.",
        "Halter, obviously, there's probably a difference between the Lincoln-Douglas debates and the Lincoln-Halter debates.",

        "We're trying to define what is a true Republican.",
        "In Arkansas, especially in a state that went only 39 percent for President Obama in 2008, the question is: What is a true Democrat?",
        "Is Blanche Lincoln less a Democrat, or is she just - has the Democratic Party left her, or is she just fearful of a situation in Arkansas that doesn't look so promising for the Democrats?",
        "Lt.",
        "Gov.",
        "HALTER: Well, you know, I think - I've tried to avoid labels, but let me answer your question here.",
        "You know, I've run as a mainstream Democrat in Arkansas for lieutenant governor, got over 57 percent of the vote in the general election.",
        "I have put initiatives, ballot initiatives before the voters and had those passed.",
        "I think you can stand for principles, and I think you can be a principled Democratic candidate and win election here.",
        "One of the most frequent complaints I hear about Senator Lincoln from Democrats, independents and Republicans is they don't know where she stands on particular issues.",
        "And, in fact, she takes stands and then reverses field 180 degrees, whether it be the public option in health care, where she was initially for it and on record for it and, in fact, wrote and op-ed for the statewide newspaper saying she was for it, and then came out against it and then went to the floor of the Senate and threatened to filibuster it.",
        "Whether it's the Employee Free Choice Act, where she was an original cosponsor of the - or a cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act and then decided to be against it, and then again threatened to filibuster.",
        "Or, you know, a range of issues where she said one thing and then done another.",
        "And I think that is not so much about whether you're a Democrat as to whether or not you're taking principled stands and sticking with them in the face of special interest pressure."
