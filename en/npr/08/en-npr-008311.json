        "It's basically the same health care bill we've been talking about for a week (laughter).",
        "That keeps not getting the votes in the House of Representatives, OK.",
        "Correct.",
        "And it has, you know - the difference here, what's new, is that the president is weighing in, saying that this plan guarantees coverage for preexisting conditions.",
        "You know, there's a clause in this - in this bill that states, nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting health insurance to limit access to health coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.",
        "Sounds pretty straightforward, but experts, including the American Medical Association, warn other parts of this amendment would weaken protections for those with preexisting conditions.",
        "It allows states to opt out of requiring coverage based on people's, quote, \"\"health status\"\" and whether they have continuing coverage.",
        "Now, states would have to set up high-risk pools to bring on those sicker individuals.",
        "But they can be costly, and there's questions about their effectiveness."
