        "Hi, I was a fan of the late William L.",
        "Shirer, who wrote \"\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\"\" When the Berlin Wall fell, he said to beware of a unified Germany.",
        "And Mike, were you influenced by Shirer?",
        "And what do you think of his warning?",
        "I'll take the answer offline.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "There was a great deal of discussion at the time about the effect of a unified Germany on Europe.",
        "And there were fears expressed, some in France, some in Great Britain.",
        "I'm not sure that those fears have been realized at all.",
        "Germany obviously is an economic powerhouse in Europe and is having a great effect on the unified Europe that evolved since the end of the Cold War.",
        "But I don't think that - I don't think that the threat or the danger that Shirer referred to and wrote about is - reflects the reality of Germany in the new Europe.",
        "It's interesting, Shirer of course a broadcaster for CBS in the great years leading up to the Second World War from Germany, where he was based and was part of that group that Ed Murrow put together to cover Europe in those days.",
        "And he invented the whip-around as people went from Berlin to Vienna to London to Rome to cover the different news.",
        "And I remember thinking about that back in '89 as I was listening to you there in Berlin, and our colleague Alex Chadwick was in Czechoslovakia where the leakage through the wall had started even before that, and some of the other great broadcasters, of course Sylvia Poggioli in Rome and many of the others.",
        "I think that that particular event put NPR's foreign coverage really on the map.",
        "I think that we began to attract many, many more listeners as a result of those events, and I think that the - our coverage became essential listening for many more Americans as a result of the way that we covered that and those events and the realization among our listeners that this was a very important time in history and that NPR was providing access to it.",
        "Let's see if we can go to another caller.",
        "This is George(ph), George with us from Prairie Village in Kansas.",
        "Hi, thank you.",
        "Mike I just wanted to see on the seismic scale how the Arab Spring compares to the two events that you've talked about before?",
        "I mean, it seems to have caught equally as flat-footed.",
        "I think that that's true, and I think the Arab Spring is an enormous event, and it's still playing out.",
        "There is profound change in nearly every nation in the Middle East.",
        "And where it's going we don't know, and we haven't been able to predict."

        "It's an extraordinary period of time in the Middle East, probably as profound as the changes in Eastern Europe were in 1989 and 1990, '91 and so forth.",
        "It - you know what?",
        "It feels like that somehow after the end of the Cold War that history has become accelerated or compacted so that things happen much more quickly and much more profoundly and sometimes much more violently than we could have expected before.",
        "There was that long period after the Second World War where things were sort of glacially frozen in place by the Cold War.",
        "We think of Central and Eastern Europe for the most part peacefully transitioning.",
        "Of course that skips out on the former Yugoslavia, which was quite bloody.",
        "That's right.",
        "It was impossible to predict all these events, and that keeps being true.",
        "The wars in the former Yugoslavia were also quite extraordinary, very difficult to cover because of the breakup of territory that Americans were very unfamiliar with.",
        "Truly tragic set of wars that broke apart maybe the one nation in Eastern Europe that had a good future and expectation of a good future at the end of the Cold War, very sad because that didn't work out the way many people had hoped and that many people in Yugoslavia had hoped.",
        "And there was, up until that point, an air of certainty about American policy, for one, and other countries for that matter, as well.",
        "Then nobody knew what to do.",
        "No, I think that American policymakers and American presidents have been scrambling since that time to understand the changes in the world, and they often went against expectations.",
        "I can remember going back to the first George Bush presidency, and there was a period leading up to the disappearance of the Soviet Union where there had been - there was a movement for independent in Ukraine, and eventually there was a referendum in Ukraine in the fall of 1991, and it led to the breakup of the Soviet Union.",
        "They would have to ask when - where did you gain all that weight you have now?",
        "We're talking with Mike Shuster, longtime correspondent for NPR.",

        "This is TALK OF THE NATION; I'm Neal Conan.",
        "Mike Shuster's been with NPR since it was less than 10 years old, more than 30 years ago.",
        "He's brought an incredible breadth and depth of stories to our air.",
        "In recent years, he's focused much of his energy on Iran.",
        "He made seven trips there.",
        "In September 2009, Iranians took to the streets of Tehran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.",
        "Protesters gathered spontaneously in Central Tehran, and soon after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the official winner of Friday's presidential election, they began to march.",
        "Suddenly there were thousands in the streets."

        "You were also there, though, to see the crackdown that changed all that.",
        "That's right, it was a truly momentous political event, this demonstration, after the - what turned out to be the fraudulent election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.",
        "The estimates that newspapers made and that historians are now using is that there were three million people in the streets of Tehran that day protesting the handling of that election and chanting give us our votes back.",
        "It was the largest and most extraordinary public display of anger and desire for political change that I've ever seen anywhere.",
        "And it was truly astounding, and there was the feeling in the streets that this was going to change the outcome, that those who manufactured the number of votes for Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would be forced to back down.",
        "Of course they weren't.",
        "Then there was a long period of time, the better part of a year, when there were ongoing demonstrations.",
        "And eventually the authorities were able to lock that down.",
        "But this doesn't - this does not mean, in my view, that people have given up in Iran.",
        "They expect change, and they just don't know how it will come and when it will come.",
        "Yet we follow all of these events, and there's hope now for another round of negotiations.",
        "We'll have to see how that works out.",
        "But underneath lying it all - underlying it all is a sense that those events, that election undermined the legitimacy of the regime in Tehran, and that's a problem they're going to have a hard time overcoming.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "The powers that be in Iran since the Islamic revolution in 1979 have always used this notion of elections, electing a parliament and electing a president, as demonstrating to the world and to their own people the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic.",
        "What this presidential election in 2009 did was the very opposite.",
        "It undermined, deeply undermined the sense of legitimacy that the Islamic leaders of Iran wanted to instill in the public and in the international, in the international notion about Iran.",
        "And I think that it's been quite clear that the authorities have not been able to get that sense of legitimacy back.",

        "And - but it occurs to me that each of those things is just that, a singular event, albeit with wide-ranging implications.",
        "I'm wondering with your exposure, if you were to zoom out to where each of these things was a microscopic event, has your exposure given you any sense of the macroscopic scale of the world at large?",
        "Just to restate because the phone line was crackling, each of these individual events, can you zoom out and give us some macroscopic sense?",

        "No, the Peace Prize.",
        "You know, I'm not sure that I have a good answer for you, but it struck me that the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, in awarding this to the European Union, meant to remind the people of Europe just how horrible centuries of conflict had been in Europe and after the Second World War how far Europe had come in uniting and trying to overcome those impulses toward violence that so characterize European history.",

        "Now maybe that wasn't in the mind of the Nobel Committee, but it seemed to me that that must have been a part of it.",
        "And it was important to remind the people of Europe and the people in the wider world just how far they had come in Europe.",
        "Just as a reminder, the tensions between France and Germany, all those years through much of the 20th century, had been the cause of so much horror before - that of course predates the tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union - and the, well, going back to the coal group right after 1945, that these organizations that developed into the European Union have largely gotten around that problem.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think they've largely been successful.",
        "Now the financial crisis in Europe is a global problem, and it seems that - it seems that the Europeans have gone a long way toward roping it in.",

        "I'm not sure about that.",
        "But Europe has been a problem on the world stage for many, many long years, and it seems to me that there has been a great deal of progress in trying to overcome the way that Europeans solved their political and economic problems in the past.",
