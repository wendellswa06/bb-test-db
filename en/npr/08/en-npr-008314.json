        "Hi, I'm a journalism student and a very big fan.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "I wondered if there was ever a time, Mike, where you couldn't or found it impossible or hard to separate your journalism duties from your concerns as a citizen?",
        "There are - there were many times that that was the case for me, and you struggle with this as a journalist.",
        "I particularly remember being in Kosovo in 1999, and there were - there was a lot of murder.",
        "There were a lot of murder of Kosovo civilians by paramilitary groups.",
        "And they - a lot of bodies were thrown in wells and in shallow graves, and I had to report on that, and that was very, very difficult, perhaps one of the most difficult sights that I've ever seen.",
        "And it - you're tempted to want to editorialize, but I think it's far more effective to report accurately and well what you're seeing.",
        "That, I think, that maximizes the trust that our listeners put in our coverage, and it, I think, informs them far better than my expressing my own opinion about that.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "You really are an inspiration.",
        "Well, you're welcome.",
        "Thanks, Miranda.",
        "I wanted to play a cut of tape that - Mike Shuster actually changed, well, broadcast law, broadcast history.",
        "This was back in 1989.",
        "Mike Shuster was in New York, covering the trial of John Gotti, a mob figure you may not remember, but known as the Dapper Don, a man whose public charm, well, was at variance with what he did for a living.",
        "And during the trial, the FBI played some wiretaps, including one, well, let's let Mike Shuster describe it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "And you get your (bleep) down here and see me tomorrow.",
        "I'm going to be there all day tomorrow.",
        "Yeah, never mind you'll be there all day tomorrow.",
        "And don ma, let me have to do this again, because if I hear anybody else calls you and you respond within five days, I'll (bleep) kill you.",

        "And there were many more than that.",
        "Yes, they were.",
        "And - but what it did was illustrate the fact that Mr. Gotti was, despite that public image as the Dapper Don, a thug.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And what this did is it sparked a lawsuit on the part of someone who didn't like the fact that we played that tape.",
        "There was a lawsuit against the FCC, and eventually, it went all the way to the Supreme Court.",
        "And the Supreme Court, if I have my facts correct, essentially found in our favor and the FCC's favor, that this was a legitimate use of what is deemed indecent language for news purposes.",
        "So it protected speech, especially in the context of news coverage.",
        "Overturned the previous doctrine, the seven dirty words doctrine, you know...",
        "That's right, yeah.",
        "Right."

        "Back in 1992, the Gulf War - the First Gulf War, I guess we have to call it now - and the experience of being in a city that is being attacked with guided missiles.",
        "That's right.",
        "I was one of many reporters - and later on, you were, as well - who covered the First Gulf War.",
        "And I was in a hotel room in Dhahran in Saudi Arabia when the war started, when the U.S.",

        "And there were some really loud explosions not far from the hotel that I was staying in.",

        "Yeah.",
        "My question is that I'm a broadcasting student hoping to get into international correspondence, and I was wondering if Mike had any advice.",
        "Well, I do, actually.",
        "I've given covering foreign places a lot of thought, particularly after I went to the Soviet Union and covered Russia in those years.",
        "It's very hard, and it's very hard operating in a language that you may not be as familiar with as your native language, English.",
        "And there's a way in which I felt that I was triangulating on the truth, that I never - I often felt that I didn't have the absolute truth of what was taking place, but that by going to different sources and triangulating on an understanding, it would give us and it would give me as the journalist and NPR as the news organization and the listeners a sense of what was true without claiming that this was absolute truth.",
        "I think that that really characterizes a great deal of what international reporting is all about.",
        "And the other thing is, always worry about whether you're getting it right or not.",
        "I don't think I've ever done a story that I was 100 percent confident that I got it all right, and I think that always kept me on my toes and always had me looking for additional information to be confident that I was reporting accurately what I was living through.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Jennifer, thanks for the call.",

        "Is there a story that you think you've left unfinished?",
        "Well, from that time, no. But I feel that I've left the Iran story unfinished.",
        "I had a great opportunity to go to Iran many times between 2004 and 2009.",
        "It was the only way that we were able to cover Iran, because the Iranians wouldn't let us have a bureau in Iran.",
        "And then that stopped after the presidential election in 2009.",
        "They didn't issue press credentials to us after that.",
        "And I've done a lot of stories since that time based on sources outside of Iran, sometimes in Iran.",
        "And that's definitely an unfinished story and a fascinating story, a fascinating place.",
        "I think it's a great place for reporting, and I hope we'll continue to hear as much reporting from or about Iran on NPR's air.",

        "I think that there are solutions to all conflicts, but they take - sometimes, they take a great deal of time, and exactly how those conflicts get resolved is - seems completely remote and impossible at a certain time, and then comes into focus later on.",
        "And, in retrospect, seems obvious.",
        "That's right.",

        "And this from Bill: What will you be doing next?",
        "Well, I have some ideas for projects.",
        "I actually, along the way, wrote a screenplay with a co-author, and I wrote two pilot scripts for TV series, one about the nuclear emergency search team and another about Wall Street in the 1860s, '70s and '80s - which is, I think, a fascinating period of time in American history that's largely overlooked.",
        "So I want to keep writing and find also a way to keep reporting and doing work as an independent producer and reporter for public radio.",
