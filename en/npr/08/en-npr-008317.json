        "The president clearly demonstrated that he has absolutely no idea how the American economy functions.",
        "The men and women all over America who have worked hard to build these businesses, their businesses, from the ground up is how our economy became the envy of the world.",
        "It is the American way.",
        "And I wish this president would learn how to be an American.",
        "So he has since apologized, saying he meant to say he wished the president would embrace this American way of job creation.",
        "But what does this do for the campaign?",
        "Well, I mean, the fact is John Sununu was born in Havana, Cuba.",
        "It's interesting for him to be talking about what a real American is.",
        "But the point is that this is part of the Romney frustration, that every time they seem that the Obama campaign is so effectively attacking Romney, you have somebody like John Sununu who, you know, wants to rebut what the Obama people are saying, but he puts his foot in his mouth by saying he's not a real American.",
        "And then I think at one point Sununu also went on to say that well, you know, he spent a lot of his time as a youth smoking something.",
        "I think they just feel so frustrated that Obama's winning that they'll basically say everything.",
        "This only calls to attention to how desperate they are to change the conversation.",
        "But Republicans will make the case that, well, it's the Obama people who are changing the conversation by talking endlessly about Bain Capital, and yet it's effective, and it's working.",
        "Am I misremembering that this was sort of the discussion of, like, August, September, or is it always kind of this nasty this early?",
        "It is nastier than usual.",
        "I mean, to say that, you know - I mean, it seems to be getting worse and worse.",
        "A lot of the vituperation that we've seen so much basically since January of 2009 just seem to be ramped up in this campaign, and the fact is the Obama campaign didn't have to spend any money because it wasn't really challenged during the primaries.",
        "So in the past couple of months, the Obama campaign has been on TV spending $25 million on negative campaigns against Romney, and Romney and the Republicans are saying, well, we are being swift-boated, which is very ironic for Republicans and Romney to complain because Romney spent a lot of the campaign attacking fellow Republicans like Gingrich and Santorum and things like that.",
        "OK, in another instance of odd statements out there, in the Florida Senate Monday, Majority Leader Harry Reid was pressing for campaign finance legislation called the DISCLOSE Act.",
        "And he criticized some big Republican superPAC donors.",
        "Here's what he said.",
        "Mr.",
        "President, if this flood of outside money continues, the day after the election, 17 angry old white men will wake up and realize they've just bought the country."

        "OK, Harry Reid's maybe not angry, but he is kind of a senior citizen white man...",
        "Kind of an angry white man.",
        "And, of course, the last time we heard from Harry Reid talking about race, he complained that - he said that President Obama was benefiting because he had no negro dialect.",
        "So I think Harry Reid knows a lot about race.",
        "Look, the point is this was about the DISCLOSE Act that would basically increase the transparency of corporate and political campaign spending during the campaigns.",
        "But for him to talk about white men, again it's one of the things that Harry Reid seems to stick his foot in the mouth, as well.",
        "So Harry Reid is known for this.",
        "OK, and Vincent Gray, here close to home, we've had a bit of a scandal coming out in recent weeks about our own mayor here in the District of Columbia.",
        "Tell us...",
        "We haven't talked about this because I think we're so close to home, and we think it's so local that nobody will care, but the point is the history of D.C.",
        "mayoral embarrassment certainly go back to Marion Barry with crack cocaine and prostitutes and things like that.",
        "But this is a real scandal.",
        "This is not - I mean, even under Barry, the city was running pretty well.",
        "But Vincent Gray apparently when he was elected in 2010, defeated Mayor Fenty, there was illegal and unreported campaign funding in his campaign, and he says: I have no intention of resigning.",
        "But apparently, he talked to people who did raise all this unreported money, and it sounds very Nixonian or Watergateonian or something.",
        "But - and again, it's a scandal that seems to be getting worse and worse, and a lot of people are predicting that Mayor Gray is not going to survive his term.",
        "At least three members of the city council have already called for him to resign.",
        "All right, let's see how folks are doing on that trivia question out there.",
        "Let's go to John(ph)...",
        "Do we want to repeat the question?",
        "Please go ahead, just if there's a Romney-Pawlenty ticket, when was the last time a major-party presidential ticket was comprised of two governors of former governors."
