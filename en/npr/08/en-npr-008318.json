        "Of course John McCain's surprise pick, then, though, was Sarah Palin.",
        "Other popular options this cycle include Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, Ohio Senator Rob Portman and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.",
        "There have even been some rumors that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice could be on Romney's list.",

        "Well, thanks for having me.",
        "I appreciate it.",
        "So what do you think Romney should look for in a running mate?",
        "I think the most important consideration for Romney, aside from the qualifications of the man or woman to be president, of course, is whether his campaign requires a boost, in which case a riskier, more aggressive pick makes sense, or if they're feeling pretty confident about where things are, in which case a safer, more conventional pick makes sense.",
        "Yeah, but didn't risky and aggressive backfire four years ago with Sarah Palin?",
        "I would argue, and that pretty much makes my point, the difference between picking Sarah Palin or John Edwards on one hand or picking Dick Cheney or Joe Biden on the other is the difference between a campaign that feels like it's got to do something to shake up the mix and one that's feeling pretty confident about the way things are going."

        "So back in the spring, when Romney was running 10, 12, 15 points behind Obama in the hypothetical match-up polls, there was a lot of talk about Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida; about Chris Christie, as you mentioned, the governor of New Jersey; about Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico.",
        "That's - those aren't necessarily dangerous selections, but they're less conventional, riskier ones.",
        "Now that the polls have gotten closer, you hear a lot more about a more conventional alternative like a Portman or a Pawlenty.",
        "Think of it as a football coach in the fourth quarter.",
        "If you're two touchdowns behind with five minutes to go, you put the ball in the air, and you risk an interception because you've got to do something to change the dynamic of the game.",
        "But if you think the game is close, you run the ball into the line, and you try to get the - you try to move down the field more gradually.",
        "Think of Rob Portman of the political version of the Romney campaign running off tackle.",
        "Ken Rudin?",
        "Dan, I mean, I kind of agree with you.",
        "I think it actually is going to be Rob Portman.",
        "I know Pawlenty's name has been mentioned a lot, as well.",
        "But the problem, in addition to the fact that Romney seems to be on the defensive over the latest Obama tax, he still has problems with his so-called base, the conservative base, and they are always talking about a Rubio or a Christie to shake it up.",
        "What - the argument against a Pawlenty or a Portman is that they are kind of bland, they are kind of vanilla, they won't excite the convention.",
        "How important is exciting the convention, and how long does that last?",
        "Well, it doesn't last a lot, and if the Romney campaign is really concerned with the trajectory of the campaign, either because they believe that the Bain attacks are taking a toll or because they really are concerned about the conservative base of the Republican Party and their level of enthusiasm, then they do need to do something more dramatic, you know, like a football team that's running behind in the fourth quarter.",
        "It looks now, because you hear so much more speculation about safer choices, that while they might not necessarily be confident of victory, they do feel like it's a pretty close race.",
        "That said, you know, Romney gets back from his trip to Europe in two weeks.",
        "If we're still talking about Bain, and we're still talking about tax returns, a more aggressive choice - not a Hail Mary like Sarah Palin, but a more aggressive selection like a Rubio - might become more alluring to them.",
        "Let's bring a listener in on the conversation.",
        "David's in Hartford, Connecticut.",
        "Hi, David.",
        "Yeah hi, thanks.",
        "I think that Romney is in a real jam here.",
        "I think that the rumors are that he's going to wait until after the Olympics to announce his choice.",
        "I do think it's going to be a boring choice, and that will dominate the news cycle for a couple of days, and then the attacks about Bain Capital and the Republicans asking for him to put out his tax returns will continue."

        "Thank you.",
        "Well, I mean, we'll have Dan weigh in, as well, but I mean, of course if you pick somebody who is going to excite the base, like a Marco Rubio or a Chris Christie, they could be somebody who is going to have their own problems.",
        "I mean, there are a lot of questions about Marco Rubio's finances that have been kind of unreported by the national media.",
        "Chris Christie, while very popular with some in the party, has proven himself to be a bully and not an attractive bully I think in a lot of places.",
        "So ultimately, you know, I think, you know, the argument for a Portman is that he's ready to take over at any time.",
        "But I don't think he solves - but I think he - but he doesn't answer David's question about whether it removes the questions about Bain Capital and the problems that Romney has.",
        "You know, Ken, if I can weigh in on that, I would suggest to you that there is not a running mate selection that can permanently address a campaign's problems.",
        "I'm not aware, looking back at the last half-century or so of modern American political history of any running mate that has fundamentally changed the dynamic of the campaign.",
        "I think you could make...",
        "In other words, if a candidate of either party has serious troubles with the party's base, with tax returns, with a particular issue, the running mate is a distraction, as you talked about a moment or so ago, but it doesn't solve the problems.",
        "Yeah, I think other than Lyndon Johnson in 1960, who gave Kennedy states that he may not have gotten on his own, I don't think any vice president has made that much of a positive difference.",
        "Of course, a Dick Cheney did add to Bush's lack-of-foreign-policy resume.",

        "I'm a Democrat, but I - there are Republicans that I highly respect, like former Senator David Durenberger.",

        "You know, so it's not just that I'm a Democrat, and that's it, because I find that there are people that I can agree with on the other side of the aisle.",
        "But right now, I just think that - my personal - I'd like him to pick somebody terrible so he doesn't win, but I think Condoleezza Rice would be a far better choice for him because first of all, she's a woman, and I think that would help, and he's really having a hard time with women voters, rightfully so.",
        "And she's a very smart person, and I don't see her as being quite as - being sucked into the right-wing super-conservatism stuff that would I think help with independent voters, which is really what this election's going to turn on.",

        "But going back to that football analogy, you've got to be throwing a pretty long Hail Mary to risk the kind of upheaval that a selection like that would pick."
