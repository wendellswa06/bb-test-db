        "And I don't say that to disparage or demean her in the slightest, just rather to talk about the likely effect it would have with a party base that Romney has already had some difficulty with.",
        "All right.",
        "Francis in Sonoma County, California, writes in: Romney needs someone who can appeal to those who aren't filthy rich and someone with recent experience as a leader in government or in Congress.",
        "Let's take another caller here as well.",
        "Jason, also out there in San Jose, California.",
        "Hi, Jason.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you?",
        "Good.",
        "Great.",
        "So I've actually been a Republican for years and years.",
        "And in the last election, it was actually the choice of V.P.",
        "that actually caused me not to vote at all.",
        "When Sarah Palin was announced, I was just floored because my belief for a good vice presidential contender is that they really need to be somebody that's sort of the yin to the yang to the president, like somebody that brings their own strengths and gifts in this to the table.",
        "You have one caller mentioned or one email mentioned sort of the balancing-out effect.",
        "And in that regard, you know, I'm on the fence right now in terms of even I'm going to stay Republican, but I can tell you that if Condoleezza Rice was the vice presidential nominee, that I - and was on the ticket, I would absolutely be voting Republican simply because she supplies that balancing-out effect.",
        "And, yes, it might be, quote, \"\"revolutionary,\"\" but I'm hoping that the Republican Party has learned that by sort of throwing what ended up being a flash-in-the-pan but deadweight vice presidential candidate in Sarah Palin out on the floor that maybe somebody that would cause a little bit of revolutionary excitement might be exactly what Republicans need, especially to reach out and snag independent voters or to keep current Republicans like myself.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you, Jason.",
        "And let's get another one in here before we go to our panel's comment here.",
        "Randy in Madison.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi.",
        "Ken, what I think is you've got a bunch of what sometimes is mistaken as blue dog but independent Democrats who like, for example, when Biden was picked.",
        "They were considering McCain, but, boom, they all went back to Obama overnight.",
        "Biden was the perfect choice for them.",
        "Now, you're right.",
        "It's very critical this time.",
        "If he would look at someone like - I don't know if this is the right guy because I'm obviously not a Republican - but someone like a Bobby Jindal who seems to show up always sort of saying the right things for those folks.",
        "He would be someone like who he needs to pick to bring those people into sort of their fold because Obama keeps sort of sticking his foot in his mouth with that group.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks, Randy, for the call.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Ken Rudin.",
        "Well, two things.",
        "First of all, going back to what Jason said earlier about Condi Rice.",
        "We also failed to mention that Condi Rice's relationship with the Bush administration is very, very strong - obviously, secretary of state during George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "And you don't want to bring up the Bush name and Iraq, and you don't want to mention that all over again.",
        "I think that would be a big mistake.",
        "As far as what Randy is saying, I mean, he's absolutely right.",
        "You do want somebody who can make a difference, and Bobby Jindal is interesting."

        "They generally can be, although people have been able to impersonate some of these biometrics, in particular fingerprints.",
        "The other problem is that many of the ways in which these biometrics are collected from the users are particularly invasive.",
        "OK.",
        "So what is active authentication?",
        "It's Bath Township, but that's close.",
        "He's on the short list.",
        "Of course, he would be the first Indian-American elected.",
        "He's the governor of Louisiana.",
        "It wouldn't necessarily bring Louisiana because that's a solid Republican state, anyway.",
        "But, again, I think, again, as Dan said from the beginning, it would be more of a Hail Mary thing, and the fact is that Obama and Romney are still neck and neck, and I don't think that the Romney campaign needs to do something dramatic if all the attacks on Romney is still making it an even race, you know, I think that's why Pawlenty or Portman would be the most logical choice.",
        "Dan Schnur.",
        "Well, I think the caller made an excellent point about Obama's selection of Joe Biden.",
        "For all sorts of reasons, Biden was an ideal pick for then-Senator Obama.",
        "He had a great deal of foreign policy experience, which Senator Obama lacked at that point.",
        "He had extensive time in Congress, and Senator Obama was a relative newcomer back in 2008.",
        "And Biden, as much as any politician on the national stage today, is very, very comfortable reaching out to the working-class voters who can ultimately - may ultimately decide this election and who neither Romney or Obama are particularly good at talking to.",
        "So if you look for somebody who can fill in those gaps for Romney the way Biden did for Obama, you can make a case for Portman in terms of his Washington experience, for Jindal from a generational perspective or for Chris Christie and his ability to talk to that particular brand of swing voters.",
        "But once again, I think it comes back to how comfortable the Romney campaign is with the trajectory of the race.",
        "If Pawlenty or Portman is running the ball, if Marco Rubio or Condoleezza Rice is a long pass, think of Bobby Jindal as maybe a short pass, five or six yards over the line of scrimmage; a little bit risky but not dangerous.",
        "Ken Rudin, you wanted to bring up a little point with former vice presidential candidate who was in the news this week - Sarah Palin and the unknown nature of her role in the upcoming GOP convention.",
        "Well, you know, she has complained, or she sent at least emails out that she has yet to be invited to the convention.",
        "Of course, she has yet to endorse Mitt Romney, and she's kind of criticizing Obama and Romney at the same time.",
        "But it would be interesting what you do with people like Ron Paul, who also has not endorsed Romney.",
        "Sarah Palin hasn't either.",
        "What kind of role do they have at the convention?",
        "Four years ago, we could make all the jokes we want about Sarah Palin, but in St. Paul, she gave an amazing speech.",
        "It was a very dramatic speech, far more exciting than anything that John McCain could have come up with.",
        "Now, ultimately, she turned out to be, I think, a very poor choice.",
        "But at the time, it was very, very dramatic.",
        "You know, you had somebody four years ago who got all the delegates to their feet.",
        "She has the capability of doing that, but again, a lot of this is about Sarah Palin.",
        "Her numbers with independents have really gone rock bottom.",
        "And the question is what the Romney people need to know and decide is whether it's worth the risk of having her speak there."
