        "Along with states like California, Arizona, Nevada and Florida, Ohio has been hit hard by foreclosure.",

        "No - in a word, no. It's - it doesn't seem to be getting terribly worse, but it's about the same as it was last year.",

        "And that was mainly the subprime mortgage problems, the subprime loans coming due and people being foreclosed upon because of that.",
        "Then in 2004, 2005, 2006, the second mortgage, the home equity loans and falling home values triggered a lot of foreclosures there.",

        "And the number of foreclosures has doubled in the past, you know, five or six years across the state.",
        "Now it's mainly job loss and that's, you know, forcing people from their homes.",

        "And they say, it's helping a little, but they're still frustrated by the pace.",
        "They're saying there's some loan modifications, but they're not seeing enough in their estimation.",
        "They're saying that some of the modifications are coming back where they'll cut the payment by only $50 a month, which isn't really going to help someone who's hurting and in danger of losing their home - $50 a month really isn't going to help a whole lot.",
        "They want to see more assistance, but they are frustrated by - and they will tell you that the bottom line is for all these - this assistance is if the homeowner does not have the income coming in, there's not a whole lot they can do.",

        "So I want to move on to some domestic news because back here in the U.S., the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office examined the Republicans' health care bill and said that it might reduce the deficit by $119 billion over 10 years, but it will also leave 23 million more people uninsured by 2026 than if Obamacare had stayed in place.",

        "Well, it matters in terms of it's bad news for Republicans overall because this is the news that America is hearing.",
        "The bill that this report scored is dead on arrival.",
        "It's the House-passed bill.",
        "Senate Republicans have already made clear that they're going to start from scratch, that they are not going to work off of this bill.",
        "So it's dead.",
        "But at the same time, this is yet another message to Americans saying, look, we may cut the deficit and lower taxes for some in the upper income bracket, but millions of people are going to find it harder to get coverage on this bill.",
        "Reihan, you've written that the most important thing to understand about the politics here is that House Republicans would rather blame Senate Republicans for failing to repeal and replace than taking that blame themselves.",
        "That's certainly one of the dynamics at work here.",
        "So the real concern was that the CBO might come out and say that this legislation, this bill is no longer deficit-improving.",
        "Had that happened, then you literally would have had to get House Republicans - you would have had to corral them all over again to pass another bill, which would have been very, very difficult.",
        "But what we see here is that as long as it shows that it's a deficit-improving you can kick it over to the Senate and the Senate can put together its own legislation, which is likely to look very, very different from this particular legislation.",
        "So the funny thing is that when we hear this news, when we hear about, you know, what's coming out of the CBO, understandably a lot of people are very anxious that, you know, this might be something that's going to actually become law.",
        "But in practice, what they were really trying to do is just reconcile some of the clashes and disagreements within the Republican caucus just enough to hand it over as though you're handing over a baton in a relay race.",
        "And now the really hard work is going to have to be done by Senate Republicans.",
        "Whether they can put together something that is going to be broadly acceptable to the American public, you know, is a tough question to answer.",
        "But what we do know is that Republican senators answer to different, bigger, broader constituencies.",
        "There are Republican senators representing states that embrace the Medicaid expansion.",
        "And so they have very different political incentives at work.",
        "So the legislation we're likely to see come out of the Senate is definitely going to be quite, quite different, as Kimberly suggests."

        "He was a candidate who was battered by Democrats when he ran statewide as a gubernatorial candidate just a little while ago as a carpetbagger, as a kind of heartless businessman.",
