        "And the answer to that is difficult to assess, but you know, there were a couple things there in what Joe was talking about, that, you know, one is this idea that the bank saves money if it does this loan work, and this is sort of the paradox in all of this.",
        "I mean, you know, people say, well, why should we bail out these homeowners who made mistakes or whatever?",
        "But in a lot of cases, everybody's really better off.",

        "Let's listen.",
        "And so then the question is why, and it's a very complicated answer.",
        "One piece of it is that often the bank that's making the decision about the loan modification does not own that loan.",
        "So Bank of America or Chase or some other bank, they're what's called a mortgage servicer, and don't worry too much about that term, but that basically means you send them your check and then they send it off to the 100 different investors who bought into this pool of 1,000 mortgages that, you know, your loan is a part of now.",
        "But so the bank doesn't actually lose the money if the loan goes bad, but to do the loan modification, they have to spend some money to hire people who can actually do this, who aren't just debt collectors, who can, you know, do underwriting, assess how much the property's actually worth, and so there's all these disconnects in the system.",
        "So like, you know, the people who do the loan mod, you know, they're not really on the hook if the loan goes bad, so you know, there's - and it's - that's oversimplifying it even a little bit, but you get the sense that there's just a lot of moving parts here.",
        "And Mike?",
        "That's one of the frustrations that the councils tell us about, is that some of these cases take a long time just for that reason, because these, you know, these elaborate securities, mortgage-backed securities, they have to get the investors to sign off on the re-work of the mortgage, and sometimes that happens very quickly if it's a fairly simple mortgage.",
        "Other times it can take months, and that's frustrating, of course, for the homeowner who's trying to re-work the mortgage and waiting all this time.",
        "And falling further and further behind in the meantime.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's - what's sort of this problem is such a macro problem, but it's fought on an individual basis, home by home by home.",
