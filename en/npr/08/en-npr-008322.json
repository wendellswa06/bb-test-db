        "We would just get somewhere within the modification, and the mortgage would get sold off.",
        "Ended up, we went into foreclosure.",
        "We were at the 11th hour and found a wonderful attorney through Moratorium Now in - here in Michigan, and who's a consumer rights attorney.",
        "We fought it, lost in district court, but just last week the circuit court judge overturned the district court judge.",
        "We're keeping our home.",
        "They said that Wells Fargo is hiding behind the front of Deutsche Bank, acting as the trustee, to avoid participating and living up to their contract with the United States on the Making Home Affordable Act, and this wonderful judge, who happens to be married to a Republican congresswoman, took the bank to task.",
        "And you know, first of all, we get to keep our home, which is wonderful.",
        "But honestly, this is the first person that I know of in very conservative Macomb County, Michigan, this judge actually said you're lying, you're hiding behind this, this is a global problem, these people did not get pay cuts and lose their jobs or their businesses other than for the fact of the fraud that was perpetrated in the banking system.",
        "And I know that Deutsche is actually the trustee on a lot - on thousands of mortgages across the country so that the mortgage holders don't have to participate.",
        "Well, first of all, Susan, congratulations.",
        "You get to keep your home.",
        "That's the upshot here.",

        "And that - and a lot of people are in that situation too, and sadly the outcome is not always a triumph.",
        "But I'd like to know from your guest, do they know - have they looked into the fact that Deutsche does act as a trustee for Citi, for JP Morgan Chase, for a lot of mortgage companies, and…",
        "Chris Arnold, can you help us out on this?",
        "And I haven't looked into Deutsche Bank in particular too much, but you know, there's this - there's almost a sort of like a bogeyman that's raised out there, like oh, well, the investors, whether it's Deutsche Bank as the trustee or some other trustee that, you know, basically, okay, these loans get kind of wrapped up into pools of 1,000 mortgages and sold off, and for the first couple years of this thing, we were being told, oh, well, that just makes it so complicated and then the investors object or the master trustee objects, and so therefore we can't do it.",
        "But what it's been sounding like to me, the more I've dug into this, is that the banks 95 percent of the time do have the authority to do the loan modification if it makes sense, and that this is something that's been sort of waved around as a red herring, like, oh, it's just so complicated, we can't do it, you know…",
        "And I'm just going to interrupt for one second, and then I'll go offline so you can take other calls.",
        "But I know for a fact that Hasco(ph) is actually the investment firm that held our mortgage that Deutsche Bank was the trustee for, but Hasco, when you go to them, they're Wells Fargo.",
        "They have the same address.",
        "So this is - to me it's a shell game, and I like your perspective.",

        "So that's coming up towards 50 percent.",
        "So we've got a high vacancy there, and what I'm finding is initially it started out as investor properties because the properties were so inexpensive, it was very easy to buy many properties, and then, of course, when the economy took a downswing, we found that many of the investors didn't have…",
        "Enough extra income to cover the investment property.",
        "Correct, and they didn't have any tenants in the property.",
        "So therefore our neighborhoods are just left, you know, a sham.",

        "And are those now being - can they modify those loans under this program?",
        "They can be modified.",
        "They can be modified, but what we're finding is when the individual themselves try to go to the servicing companies, again, with the lost paperwork, numerous calls, just very frustrating.",

        "They took in some family members.",
