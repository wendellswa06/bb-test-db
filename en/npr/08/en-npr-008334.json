        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, the president yesterday directed the Department of Defense and also the Department of Homeland Security to work with border state governors to come up with a plan here.",
        "The administration is not providing many details, but they did emphasize that they think extra security is needed to stop immigrants from entering the country illegally.",
        "And it is worth saying here that last year, arrests for illegal border crossings were actually at their lowest level since 1971.",
        "All right, let's bring in NPR's John Burnett, who's been covering immigration for a long time at the border.",
        "He joins us from member station KRTS in Marfa, Texas.",
        "Hey, John.",

        "So this is something other presidents have done - right?",
        "- deployed the National Guard to the border when the situation's really urgent.",
        "But just as David pointed out, and as you have reported before, border crossings - illegal border crossings and those arrests are actually down.",
        "So what's the urgency?",
        "Well, Trump said the troops are needed on the border until more of the wall can be built.",
        "Yesterday, his homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, gave this explanation in a briefing to reporters.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We continue to see unacceptable levels of illegal drugs, dangerous gang activity, transnational criminal organizations and illegal immigration flow across our border.",
        "This threatens not only the safety of our communities and children, but also our very rule of law.",
        "The administration has been really frustrated.",
        "The so-called Trump effect is wearing off.",
        "Remember, right after he came into office, immigrants were afraid to come, and apprehensions, which are a rough measure of illegal crossings, dropped sharply.",
        "Trump bragged at the time that he'd finally gotten the border under control, and now the numbers are creeping back up, not necessarily among Mexican men who cross the border to find work, but among family groups and even children traveling alone that are coming up from Central America.",
        "They say they're fleeing..."

        "So numbers are rising a little bit, at least.",
        "They absolutely are.",
        "And they say they're fleeing murderous gangs, and they've taken - that they have taken over these neighborhoods in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.",
        "The administration says that they're using pretexts to ask for asylum, that they're actually scamming the system.",
        "What have you heard from people on the border?",
        "Well, you know, today, fewer people are being apprehended than in the last 47 years.",
        "They're far lower than when George Bush or Barack Obama called out the National Guard to the border when they were presidents.",
        "But that being said, the Border Patrol - the agents tell me that the crossers are more emboldened than in the - in the last few months.",
        "They - because the Trump effect is wearing off, they're seeing these large groups of women with children, of unaccompanied kids.",
        "And both of them get special treatment under the law.",
        "The Border Patrol calls it catch and release.",
        "Under the law, they detain the immigrants for a while.",
        "Then they have to release them until they wait for their day in immigration court.",
        "And the administration says they want to change the laws, speed up the deportation process and narrow the door to asylum.",
        "But, of course, this is the law.",
        "They can present themselves at the border, and they can ask for asylum.",
        "Right.",
        "All right, so based on the other times that this has happened, what do we expect the deployment to look like?",
        "Well, if the past is a guide, the previous Guard deployments cost the federal government well over a billion dollars.",
        "Soldiers were used for surveillance.",
        "They put them in towers with night vision goggles.",
        "They assisted in narcotics interdictions.",
        "They helped process undocumented crossers and allowed the Border Patrol to get back to the line.",
        "Right.",
        "And what the National Guard cannot do is arrest people who cross the border illegally.",
        "That's the job of federal immigration agents.",

        "More as in 87 million.",
        "That is how many people may have had their information compromised here.",
        "Facebook says malicious actors took advantage of the platform's search tools to get their hands on this data.",

        "He's saying, hey, we're sorry; we didn't focus enough on this abuse.",
        "What else did you learn from that call?",
        "Well, one of the main interesting things here is that Facebook has stepped up how much they're engaging with the media.",
        "So this call yesterday that Zuckerberg had with hundreds of reporters is something that's very unusual for the company.",
        "And he answered a wide range of questions, saying that he thought he was still the right person to lead Facebook, and he talked...",
        "Because people had questioned whether or not that was true?"

        "...The Quran is God for them.",
        "So a few things.",
        "And let's be clear that once data leaves a company as happened here, it's really difficult, according to experts, for - if not impossible for it to be recovered.",
        "So this data went to Cambridge Analytica in 2014, 2015, and it is probably going to be difficult or impossible for Facebook to track down where that is now.",
        "But they are cracking down on third-party app developers and the data that they have access to now.",
        "So the rules were much more lax at Facebook from 2010 to 2015.",
        "They're tightening up those rules now.",

        "For all the users over there, the privacy rules are stricter.",
