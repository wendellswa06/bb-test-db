        "You know, I remember in high school, studying Shakespeare and my English teachers said notice how often he starts with an argument or a fight.",
        "That's how you get the attention of the audience.",

        "He snaps.",
        "And he does something that he can't take back.",
        "And in that act of violence, he climbs up to the roof to get away from something he's done.",
        "And he ends up pushing over these Saints, these stone statues, trying to hit the people below.",
        "And I thought, that's pretty terrifying.",
        "So we can have our main characters kind of run out and try to be the heroes.",
        "And you see them trying to do the right thing.",
        "And, as the story goes on, you see how a kid goes from someone who'll run out in the middle of danger to save somebody he doesn't know, to possibly becoming the one who's trying to cause the pain.",
        "Well, there is - I mean, the book is very dark.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But at the same time, there's this is bullying.",

        "And you never forget them.",
        "Those are like foxhole friendships, you know.",
        "And the friend who takes the punch, who takes the blame, who absorbs the insult when they know you can't take any more, those are priceless friendships.",
        "And I wanted to sort of pay tribute to that, in this story.",
        "And to do that, I had to put the kids through some really bad stuff.",

        "And I wanted that to be a little bit representative of what we face, today, with kids being bullied and called names on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr.",
        "You know, any kind of social media could be used as a blunt instrument, in the wrong hands.",
        "And I think, this is the analog version of that.",
