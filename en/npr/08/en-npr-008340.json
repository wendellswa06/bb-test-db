        "If we walk away from this, all that's going to be remaining is the negative caricature that the insurance industry, with their advertising and their allies in the Republican Party, have placed on it.",
        "And what - and that caricature is wildly inconsistent with what is actually in the bill.",
        "And if you look at all of the research, what you see is that when you tell people what's actually in the bill, they're very enthusiastic about it.",

        "And let's put that combined $50 billion and say use it or lose it over the next 12 months.",
        "You can't draw down this money and simply put it on your balance sheet.",
        "If you draw down some of these funds, you've got to actually lend them out to small businesses.",
