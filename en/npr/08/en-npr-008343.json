        "Now, what he said he wants in exchange for protecting DACA recipients is that border wall, and he's not with the majority in this one.",

        "Thirty-six Republicans - 36 percent of Republicans are against it and say no. So by the way, when it comes to cousins, aunts, uncles, they face a much less welcoming American public.",

        "Only about a third of Democrats said they feel that way, and independents are split.",
        "But one of the things that really struck me in this survey is there has been a real spike in Republicans believing the number of immigrants coming to America should be decreased.",
        "Currently 62 percent of Republicans say that.",
        "That, Ailsa, is a 26-point - percentage point increase from 2014.",
