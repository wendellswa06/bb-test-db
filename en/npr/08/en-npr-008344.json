        "The other thing we've done is we - first of all, there were two examples we've seen on four other locations with very similar-looking deposits, although we haven't seen them change.",

        "And, of course, we've known that there was water at both polar regions of Mars for some time, so I don't want to say that that is a new result.",
        "But the novelty of our study was that we combined information from three spacecraft - the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Odyssey and the Mars Global Surveyor - to refine what the water budget and exactly how much water ice there is at the south pole.",
        "And this is the water ice that is at the south pole of Mars today.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "It's covered with a very thin veneer of carbon dioxide, which is the same composition as the Martian atmosphere.",
        "But there are depressions in the south polar cap that indicate that there's water ice below that.",
        "And then around the south polar cap, there is a region that is dark, like the surrounding terrain but it's elevated by a couple of kilometers over the surrounding terrain that's much bigger than the south polar cap itself.",
        "And the question is, was that sand and dust and dunes, or was that predominantly water ice, or was it CO2 ice?",
        "And what we've been able to measure by looking at the gravity field, which give us the mass and then using altimetry to give us the elevation of the top of these deposits and then a sounding radar to give us the bottom of these deposits.",
        "We're able to measure the volume very precisely, and mass divided by volume gives you density.",
        "What we find out is that the density of these deposits we've now been able to measure very precisely and it gives you constraint that it's almost pure water ice maximum of 15 percent dust.",
        "So when you put all that together, what you have is that that's the largest reservoir of surface water, water ice on Mars today."

        "We thought we might see a fine grain deposit, perhaps with layering, perhaps with bright layers similar to a sedimentary, aqueously altered deposits we see elsewhere.",
        "Instead, what we see are no layering and lots and lots of boulders.",
        "So we've been puzzling over what that means.",
        "And I think it makes it difficult, certain concepts for an ocean, for example, one that would deposit a 100-meter thick layer of fine grain sediments similar to deep oceans in Earth.",
        "That seems difficult to reconcile with all of these boulders.",
        "There are other concepts of oceans as well, though that can be reconciled with it.",
        "So I don't think we've settled that one, yet.",
        "It's a very interesting question and we don't know the answer yet, but we're certainly aren't finding the smoking gun at this point.",
