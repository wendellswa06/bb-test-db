        "Were they - were there episodic impacts or volcanic intrusions that would liberate water to the surface where it stayed for a short period of time and then froze over?",

        "This - well, I think this is one of the most interesting new results from HiRise is what see from some young, but fairly large impact craters, greater than a kilometer in diameter.",
        "And that's evidence for water in these things that are young, not ancient.",
        "There's - there are flows, like debris flows.",
        "There's evidence of impact melt, which is made more easily in the presence of volatiles.",
        "There's even erosion of sand, erosion of gullies and sands or channels and sands over low slopes and so forth.",
        "It looks very much like - there's a critical Mojave crater, it looks like the Mojave Desert - a spitting image of it.",
        "So that, I think, supports the - this clearly supports the idea that impacts can liberate water from the subsurface and lead to some of the effects we've seen in modifying the landscape, may be explaining much of what we see back in the ancient Mars when, you know, the channels are much bigger, the erosion is much greater, but also the impacts were much greater back then.",

        "It's very difficult to send humans.",
        "It would be a big investment and we have, I believe, not reached the point where robotic science has limited, in any way, in discovery.",

        "NASA decides where the landing site should be, but they open up to the entire worldwide community to provide input.",
