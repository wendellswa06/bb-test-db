        "Your father, George Wiley, was a famous activist in the New York area advocating for the rights of poor people, white and black.",
        "He was constantly being arrested when you were growing up.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "And seeing all that, what made you want to do this?",
        "I think the fact that I grew up very much in a household that prioritized the marathon, not the sprint - recognizing that we've actually been struggling for full inclusion in American society for 400 years - not just for the period of time that was the height of the civil rights movement in the '50s and '60s.",
        "And that struggle continues today.",
        "Nicole, what about you?",
        "You are a lawyer.",
        "You come from a big law firm background.",
        "I mean, you could be doing that.",
        "What made you decide to switch course in the same way, frankly, that Michelle Obama did, which is to leave the - sort of the practice of law in the big law firm setting and dedicate yourself to this kind of nonprofit work?",
        "Well, Michel, I'm one of those - I call them weirdos - who knew at the age of 13 that I wanted to be a civil rights lawyer.",
        "I grew up in public housing.",
        "And growing up in that kind of community - it was a wonderful, nurturing community, but it was a community that was very clear to me had been disenfranchised.",

        "I mean, Martin Luther King was, what, 26 when he was leading the Montgomery bus boycott?",
        "But I think - you know, in your, you know, era, I think a lot of people aren't used to seeing young people in these kinds of prominent role.",

        "And while I was in Sacramento one day lobbying against tuition increases, I got a phone call from one of my really close friends back at campus who said that someone had hung a noose on my campus.",
        "And then, all of a sudden, the attack of the color of my skin on my campus became a problem that chose me.",
        "I didn't choose those issues.",
        "And ever since then, ever since that day, I have been organizing and fighting for, not only my community and black folks, but people of color and young people specifically.",
        "For the last six years, I've organized and done work around only racial justice and economic justice.",
        "You know, one of the reasons I was interested in talk with this group is that we were looking back at the pictures of the Big Six civil rights organizations that were credited with pulling off the March on Washington.",
        "Now, we know for a fact that there were many women playing critical roles in organizing all of these civil rights campaigns - people like Ella Baker, people like Diane Nash, Fannie Lou Hamer, you know, of course.",
        "But they were hardly ever in the picture.",
        "And I'm just curious about the fact that so many women are now leading organizations like this.",
        "I just wonder why you think that is.",
        "I don't know, Nicole, do you want to start?",
        "Do you have a theory?",
        "Coretta Scott King was often referred to as the first lady of civil rights.",
        "Tomorrow, we'll hear how she came to be seen as a civil rights leader in her own right just days after her husband's death.",
        "Well, Pluto always was a little bit of an oddball.",
        "It was, even when it was found, it had a strange orbit compared to the other planets.",
        "The other planets have nice circular orbits, and they're all in one disk.",
        "Pluto's in the shape of an ellipse instead, and it's tilted.",
        "And Pluto was much, much smaller than everything else we had that we called planets.",
        "So it always didn't really quite fit in.",
        "But there was nothing else to call it, so it always just stayed a planet because there was nothing else to do.",
        "And then starting in 1982, astronomers started finding many, many more objects out there in that region where Pluto is in what we now call the Kuiper Belt.",
        "And we knew all along that this was going to cause problems, that eventually something would be found out there that was even bigger than Pluto.",
        "And finally, last year, when we actually found something that was bigger, this 2003 UB313 - also known sometimes as Xena - it was pretty clear that we needed to do something.",
        "Either Xena had to be a planet, or Pluto had to not be a planet, or we needed to change totally the definition of what a planet is.",
        "And so we've arrived at the point we are today."

        "That's exactly right.",
        "And the - what is the proposal of the Astronomical Union.",
        "What do they want to do?",
        "So the proposal that they have come up with is to say that a planet is anything that's large enough to be round due to its own gravitational pull.",
        "So if you put something in space and it pulls it itself into a shape or a sphere just by gravity, that qualifies you to become a planet as long as you're in orbit around a star.",
        "And anything that satisfies that is a planet.",
        "And so we could have countless number of planets.",
        "Yeah, in fact, we already have - if you take their definition, although they have a list of 12 official planets - it's only because they haven't really taken the time to look at all the rest of them yet - if you take their definition and you look at the bodies that we know of already out there in that region of the Kuiper Belt, there are probably about - I count about 43 new planets that they need to add, and that's only probably half of the ones that we'll eventually find.",
        "So my guess is that the list of planets will eventually go to 100 or even 200 depending on how good we are at looking for these things.",
        "If you were a betting man, do you think this is going to be voted positively to accept that definition?",
        "Well, I've heard that just in the last day or two, there has been some considerable controversy there from other astronomer's in Prague, so I'm not sure what's really going to happen.",
        "But I have to say that astronomers have been having this debate for years now, and I think they're actually mostly tired of it.",
        "So my guess is that if the proposal were to call anything that was shaped like a donut and painted yellow a planet, that would probably -",
        "Well, in fact, even here in the Hayden Planetarium, they took Pluto out of the exhibit hall.",
        "Yeah, and that was quite controversial.",

        "And it's entirely reasonable.",
        "I mean, you could come up with I think three reasonable definitions of the word planet.",
        "And the most reasonable scientific one, I think, would be really that if you look at the solar system, you would very quickly classify the first eight planets in one region and classify everything else as something else.",
        "And you wouldn't include Pluto and you wouldn't include the thing that I found, 2003 UB313.",
        "And that is a very reasonable scientific definition.",
        "You could also go for what I call the good cultural definition, which is to say, look, we've called Pluto a planet for 76 years.",
        "There's no good scientific reason for that, but culturally we have come to accept it as a planet, so let's keep it.",
        "And let's just make a definition that's totally arbitrary and say that Pluto's a planet, and anything bigger than Pluto is a planet, too, and be done with it that way.",
        "Scientists get very wary about that because they think that these definitions need to have very specific, scientific reasoning behind them.",
        "But the analogy that I always like to use is the word continent.",
        "You know, the word continent has no scientific definition, but it sure sounds like some geologist should be scientific about it when they say it.",
        "But there's really no reason why, that I can think of, that Europe is a continent and India is a subcontinent.",
        "They're just cultural definitions.",
        "And I think the geologists are wise to leave that one alone and not try to redefine things so that the word continent has a big, strict definition.",
        "So you could make 100 continents if you really wanted to, like you could make 100 planets.",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "In fact, I'm about to get on the airplane to go out to Hawaii to observe at the telescopes out there.",
        "And by the IAU definition, if you sort of extended it to the definition of continents, I would be going in fact to the continent of Hawaii, not the island of Hawaii.",
        "So you're saying let's - why not just leave the planets the way they are, and then we can teach people what the other stuff is.",
        "I would say that's a very viable cultural approach, and I would support that one.",
        "I also think that the eight-planet approach - although it's the one that gets the most people riled up.",
        "If you go on record as saying that you think there are only eight planets and Pluto is not a planet, you come across as just as big cosmic bully.",
        "But it is a very rational scientific approach.",
        "The approach that they took, that everything round is planet, is a radical change from what we think of as the solar system right now, and it doesn't sound so bad when they first tell you that there are only 12.",
        "But when you realize that it actually means that there are hundreds of new things that are called planets, it's a very big departure from what I think most people think of when they think of the word planet.",
        "So you know, you don't know how they're going to vote next week.",
        "I - as I said, I have - I'm encouraged to hear that there's actually some discussion, but I really do think that planet fatigue will set in and people will just raise their hands and hold their noses."

        "But I think the definition does matter - and this is why there's so much discussion about it - I think the definition does matter culturally.",

        "Yep, I think that's a good description of exactly what it is.",

        "The moon's going to be grandfathered in as a non-planet, but you could have things like moons orbiting each other out there become planets?",

        "The moon is not a planet because it goes around the Earth, and that's part of the definition.",

        "Sort of like two ice skaters holding onto each other by hands spinning around like that.",

        "Well, this is quite interesting, and I guess astronomers will be glued to their TV sets, their Internet screens waiting with baited breath for the decision next month.",
        "I, yeah, even though it's going to come early in the morning for me out here in California, but I'll be waking up to see what's finally decided.",
        "As I said, it actually doesn't affect astronomers in any actual way, but, boy, I am dying to see what they come up with."
