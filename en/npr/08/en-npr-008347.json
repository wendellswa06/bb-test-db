        "Do they then have start all over again?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, if they vote no - this is why I think that most likely the vote will go yes - because people just fear that if the vote is no that means that we are back to where we were before this vote came along, which is that everybody knows there are nine planets, some people talk about 10 planets, the occasional science museum puts in only eight planets, and confusion continues to reign.",
        "Now I think that's actually not bad.",
        "This is the way cultural decisions get made by this sort of confusion.",

        "I have to say, I will admit that it is quite exciting to have the possibility that one of those 12 planets that people are talking about is one that I discovered.",
        "So part of me is very excited about this, but the scientist in me just still doesn't see this definition as working very well, and so I have to try to divorce those two parts of myself when I talk about it.",
