        "And not an extraordinary amount of political news this week -some fresh polls, but they just seem to show what every other polls seem to show.",
        "Well, they do.",
        "But again, eight days is still - eight days before Iowa - 2004, I was still saying Howard Dean was going to win and he finished third.",
        "And I guess, you know, it doesn't matter what Ken Rudin has to say.",

        "He is doing really well in New Hampshire.",
        "He is narrowing the gap between himself and the frontrunner Mitt Romney.",
        "And if McCain, who is campaigning in Iowa today - if he does some kind of a decent showing in the Hawkeye State on January 3rd, that could really benefit him five days later when New Hampshire votes.",
        "All right.",
        "Later in the program, we're going to be talking with callers and e-mailers about why they went to volunteer in the snows of New Hampshire or Iowa, for what candidate, at what time: 800-989-9255.",

        "Well, I'm glad to talk - there are so many influential people who left the scene in 2007.",
        "One of them, of course, is Norman Mailer.",
        "You don't think of him as being a political person, although, of course, he's a great, you know, writer and everything.",
        "But he did won for mayor of New York City in 1969.",
        "So the trivia question - this may not be the toughest trivia question - but, who is his running mate for city council president that year and what was their slogan?",
        "What were they pledging to do in that campaign?",
        "Norman Mailer's running mate and also the slogan as they ran for mayor back in 1969 in New York City."

        "And, of course, an interesting Henry Hyde was first elected at the Congress in 1974 during the Nixon impeachment year.",
        "But Henry Hyde, for all the, you know, the things that liberal - the problems that liberals had with him - certainly on abortion, he was not so much the author - I learned that only recently - that he did not write the Hyde amendment.",
