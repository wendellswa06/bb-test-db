        "Hmm.",
        "And as you listen to this music, I'm wondering how you think about what it's going to be like when you go back to New Orleans and what that city's going to be like and what the music scene's going to be like.",

        "Is any effort being made to get them together and continue sort of a subculture until things can straighten out?",

        "And it's definitely designed to take care of musicians' needs because many people are displaced in all kinds of strange places.",
        "But he definitely wanted the word to get out to all of the musicians that these units exist, and he's located them in different areas, and he's getting the word out that that's a place to go for medical help.",
        "And that's so very important as well with so many people being displaced these days.",

        "My husband's a jazz bassist and he was born in New Orleans.",
        "But 20 years ago, we were at Jazz Fest and had the opportunity to hear The Neville Brothers live for the first time.",
        "We went to a midnight riverboat concert and they got on stage and launched into \"\"Hey Pocky Way,\"\" and the hair on the back of our necks just rose up.",

        "And the other one I wanted to mention, keying off your first caller, who said that he'd heard the Cajun or zydeco radio station driving through the area.",
        "We had heard about a wonderful event in Mamou, Louisiana, at Fred's Lounge, which is a Saturday morning get-together of musicians playing traditional Cajun music.",
        "And we flew into New Orleans on a Friday night, got in the rental car, drove to a motel in Mamou, got up the next morning and arrived at Fred's at about 9 in the morning to find the place just hopping.",
        "And that was a ball; that was just fantastic.",
        "And I danced my feet off.",
        "All these wonderful old guys were asking me to two-step with them, and it was just totally delightful."
