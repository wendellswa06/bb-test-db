        "What is the atmosphere been like day by day as people have come back from another day of doing this?",
        "For the soldiers and for the police officers it's a very difficult mission.",
        "So when they come here at about 7:00 or 8:00, they get hot food, very good food and they have a very big canteen and fast food, satellite TV, several service stations, soft drinks, and everything to make their life better after their very difficult mission.",
        "After your 24 years in the IDF, you must have many acquaintances or friends who are among those who are going out every day.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What are some of the stories that you hear?",
        "Very difficult to take people from their homes, small children and women, and people that live there in Gaza Strip about 10 years, 20 years, very difficult for them.",
        "But we prepared these people mentally, the soldiers are very strong.",
        "To this mission, we took senior soldiers, not younger soldiers and officers so the stronger--mentally strong to do this mission.",
        "What is the key to getting through this mission for your troops to succeed?",
        "We let them cry, if they need.",
        "We let them hug, give a big hug to the men they take out, but all my soldiers, all the troops make it very, very good, this mission.",
        "You've been out to look around at some of these settlements as they've been evacuated.",
        "Is there a specific scene or a specific moment that you can recall from when you've been out talking to the troops, watching what they're doing that you think some ...(unintelligible)."

        "Yes.",
        "When they was in Neve Dekalim--it's a big settlement--I saw about maybe 500 soldiers and the police officers with black hats and blue vests, they go very strongly to the main street.",
        "And small children call them very, very bad words, and it's like assault against--a stronger power against very weak people.",
        "But the other side, this is a mission and we have to do it.",
        "How did your soldiers respond when they were in the street and being called names by children?",
        "They just ignore it.",
        "They take their eyes down and they ignore it.",
        "But when they have to take someone from his home, when they--some soldiers take women or men from his home, they give him a big hug and they hear the bad words, but they continue to do this mission.",
        "Do you think it's likely that of those 500 soldiers, there were probably some Israeli troops who more or less agreed with the kids who completely disagreed with this mission but are doing it because it's their duty and their job to do it?",
        "Absolutely, yes.",

        "Why did they change their mind now?",

        "The first is that the first round of domains were pretty modest: .biz, .info--and that they didn't want to approve too many domains considering this was the first time that domains were added in decades up from the original .com, .org and so on.",
        "And so the second time around they're going to take a little bit more risks.",

        "Exactly.",

        "Well, it's--if you had pornography or sexually explicit material just in .xxx that would be one thing, but once you spend so much time and effort on a .com you're probably going to keep that.",
        "The interesting thing is going to be whether sites like--or sorry, countries like Singapore or Saudi Arabia--those that may not have this First Amendment tradition that we have--say, `We're going to block the national level all .xxx sites,' and so then you have to conclude that if American sex sites want to market to these countries they're going to keep their .com as well.",

        "And obviously, you have non-profit sites as well: org and edu and those sorts of things.",
