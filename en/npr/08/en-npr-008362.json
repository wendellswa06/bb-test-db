        "It's great to be here.",
        "And I know in your last appearance on the program, you said we have to be clear that torture is always illegal.",
        "It should always be illegal for just - on the basis of the rule of law, and this is a country that stands for the rule of law, and we hold other world leaders accountable, Milosevic and on and on.",
        "And you know, if we can excuse ourselves, shouldn't we excuse them as well?",
        "And then where do we stand, especially, you know, in terms of the Nuremburg Trials?",
        "You just go on and on, and Ted is right.",
        "It is a slippery slope.",
        "We shouldn't go down there.",
        "But my argument is first and foremost, we should look at the facts.",
        "What did we get out of the torture?",
        "And I am willing to bet, listening to the public statements, including statements made by the vice president, that we got nothing out of it.",
        "And this is what I'm hearing from inside, so that we can just…",
        "I'm sure you're referring to the former vice president.",
        "The former vice president, yes.",
        "You know, I think once we undercut the argument that it's useful, we will never have - well, I can't say never.",
        "We won't have to face this recurring temptation to torture.",
        "So in resolving the debate, which both you and Ted said, we need a moment of calm to figure out this policy for the future, it's going to be extremely difficult if there's another 9/11.",
        "In the midst of this debate, you say, we have to go back and figure out what we got out of the last instance, too?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "We need to look at the transcripts from the interrogation sessions.",
        "We need to consult with the FBI to see what they got out of it.",
        "Did it lead to any arrests?",
        "Did it lead to stopping attacks?",
        "So far, the FBI, Bob Mueller, the FBI director, and a very good agent, Ali Soufan, have said we got nothing out of it.",
        "I mean, we still don't know if this was all a terrible waste of our reputation and our time.",
        "I think, Bob, that that's kind of a dangerous - even that is a dangerous point of view to take because if the argument can be made successfully that yes, torture really is successful, and we got all kinds of stuff out of these guys that we didn't get by the more conventional means, then in fact, you enhance the argument for torture.",
        "I think that should be irrelevant."

        "You're probably right.",
        "I'm just such a - a former CIA case officer.",
        "Look, I have spent 30 years in and out of jails through the Middle East, South America, and I have found that torture undermines a society, whether it's in Peru or Lebanon or Saudi Arabia.",
        "It ultimately descends to the point where it's a weapon of intimidation.",
        "And I have never seen a country that uses torture that ever collected useful intelligence - ever.",
        "And Ted, let me add to you that you sort of put it both ways as well.",
        "You suggest that an individual CIA interrogator or somebody else in that position, given that ticking-time-bomb scenario, might decide to go ahead and do it, knowing full well that those penalties are out there but hoping maybe that they get jury nullification or maybe a presidential pardon.",
        "They might get that if they're right.",
        "The second point, Peter, I would make is you're assuming the guilt of the party that is being tortured before any kind of procedure has been taken to establish that guilt.",
        "There were, for example, down in Guantanamo, any number of men who were sent into or handed over to U.S.",

        "I'm not saying that these people were tortured.",
        "I'm just saying you can't automatically assume the worst of everybody who falls into our hands.",
        "That's right.",
        "And all I'm saying, Neal, is I think we're all realistic enough to know that if the scenario you sketched out at the beginning - a couple of kidnappers, one of them has a child, a 7-year-old, the child is buried, the child is running out of oxygen, if you're the person who's holding the other kidnapper, who can extract that information, is it likely that you're going to use violence?",
        "Is it likely that you're going to use some technique to try to get that information as quickly as you can?",
        "I think it is.",
        "The only point I'm making is you can't go into that, you can't go into the interrogation knowing that no matter what you do, it will be forgiven.",
        "You have to go into it knowing that look, I don't give a damn.",
        "I am so worried about this kid, or I am so concerned about the ticking time bomb and the possibility that thousands will die, I'm willing to take that risk, even if it means I'm going to prison.",
        "After the fact, people can then argue about the merits of what you did and why you did it.",
        "And Bob Baer, doesn't that put an awful lot of the onus on the person who's in that situation, the person who conducts the interrogation?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that ultimately, someone's going to say no to that.",
        "I'm not sure that that's workable, but I'd like to underline another point - is this idea of a ticking time bomb.",
        "In Israel, all the arrests they've made with Hamas and the Islamic jihad, they have never had a case where there was a ticking time bomb.",
        "One couple I met in prison, two women who were going off to set off bombs in Jerusalem, their timing was minutes apart.",
        "Even if the Israelis had caught one of the bombers, the other one, there was not enough time to catch the other one.",
        "It's this whole idea of torture warrants, the ticking time bomb, the \"\"24\"\" scenario, which really bother me because they're absolutely as rare as hen's teeth.",
        "It's just - I've never seen a case like this.",
        "And when we keep on reframing this torture argument in terms of the ticking time bomb, you're going to get a majority of Americans supporting torture.",
        "Or in the event of another attack, they're going to support it again, and there'll be some executive order, and we'll be back in the same place we were before.",
        "And I think one of the reasons - forgive me, Bob, I didn't mean to interrupt.",
        "Go ahead."

        "My view on it is that these unlawful combatants are not entitled to protection under the Geneva Convention or military law, and those should be the laws that are accorded to them.",
        "Under civil law, it should be illegal; however, my position is that torture should be used, oh, in very rare instances, most often in emergency intelligence situations.",
        "And should the United States, therefore, repeal the international treaty against the use of torture, which it ratified?",

        "They're dirt.",
