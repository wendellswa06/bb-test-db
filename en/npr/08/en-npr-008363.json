        "And I was in an intelligence unit, and I can attest that torturing people does not work and should never be legalized, especially a civilized nation like us.",
        "Because a lot of times, I've heard people talk about the most perfect scenario, when someone has, you know, intelligence, and you know, actable intelligence.",
        "And in the intelligence community, there is no such thing as a time bomb or anything like that.",
        "And if you want a real intelligence, you build it through chatter, and I mean that there's a lot of sources that are coming through, and from what we have used, we've never - the United States Army does not torture, and we've never tortured any insurgents or terrorists or anything like that because we knew it wouldn't get us anywhere.",
        "Bob, forgive me, Bob, but it sounds like you're telling us you were taught that torture never works, but you don't know that torture never works because you haven't tried it.",
        "No, actually, we have been shown both sides of the, you know, the issue, and as the real experience - and personally, if we chose to torture somebody, we could've.",
        "But you know, as our experience told us that it doesn't - that would not get us anywhere and would not provide us any valuable intelligence because a lot of times, the people you're dealing with are not people that you can easily scare them off.",
        "These people are willing to die for what they believe in, so if you are torturing or anything like that, you're just going to, you know, escalate the situation.",
        "And instead of de-escalating and putting this person in a conversation mode where this person can relax and talk to you and maybe have some sense of what he was doing, if you start - because many times, these people are in a different kind of mindset.",
        "And what we have tried to do was, you know, de-escalate the situation, calm down, understand why this person was doing what they were doing and what has caused - you know, try to get to know this person.",
        "I understand.",
        "We've had military interrogators on, talking about such techniques, which they say work and which they say work in ticking-time-bomb situations, Bob, but do you think that if you really believe that some enormous explosive was about to go off under Camp Liberty or something like that, that you or someone else in your unit might not have tried something more violent?",
        "Well, I personally would have tried other ways that are valuable in getting that information.",
        "But the torturing will, via violence, would always escalate the situation.",
        "And I have no see - I don't see, in any way or shape or form, a person can tell me a valuable information when I'm actually using violence, you know, upon himself.",
        "Why would these characters stop violence from happening somewhere else?",
        "So, that just logically sound very good to me to stop violence - in the first place to stop violence."

        "The difficulty being - and I think you address this in your commentary - if there is another incident, how do you then look at the members of the families of those who were killed and said, well, we had somebody who had some intelligence about this, but we didn't get it in time.",
        "Well, you've got to be able to prove that you would have been able to get it, which is clearly an impossibility.",

        "Every time that we grab one of these drug dealers, then, should torture be employed?",
        "If the argument is, it should be employed because it's more effective than any other device, because you can get to the bottom of a situation much more quickly than by using some of the more patient techniques, what is to stop it from being used every time, then, there is a difficult case in which lives may be at stake, domestically and overseas?",

        "So by making it illegal, we really just get ourselves in trouble - with the world and mainly, with our own country because they're looking at, you know - as a citizen, we're looking at the government going, they're doing something that they said that we weren't supposed to do."
