        "And actually, his voice is telling the story of the previous heroic age, when, you know, there was no virtue in turning the other cheek.",
        "The heroic age, it went out - you won glory by defeating enemies by calling up danger and facing it and overcoming it.",
        "So the melody of a kind of Christian understanding and submission to the Almighty is in the voice of the poet.",
        "I mean, he says, at times, the truth is clear, almighty God ruled over mankind and always has.",
