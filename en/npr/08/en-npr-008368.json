        "It's a tale of bravery and pride and boasting and kind of these epic battles.",
        "And a number of them saw the movie as I did myself this weekend.",
        "And my question for Seamus Heaney - thank you so much, it's a very interesting conversation - is you have an Anglo-Saxton poem about Scandinavian warriors.",
        "And you, as an Irish poet, kind of retelling this tale.",
        "And so I was wondering if you could kind of comment on this kind of retelling of these tales and these different cultures, kind of telling the stories of different cultures and that how you approach the poem that way as an Irish poet.",
        "Well, I didn't think of myself, you know - I didn't position myself immediately as an Irish poet.",
        "Actually, as an Irish student in Belfast in the late 1950s, I studied \"\"Beowulf\"\" for my English literature B.A., so it was part of my memory and I actually liked the Anglo-Saxon poetry when I was at Queens -the melody of it good into my ear.",

        "Of course, I did begin to think about my position as an Irish writer doing it.",
        "So what I did, for better or worse, I put in certain words that had an Irish basis.",

        "So I thought that that dignified simple utterance, was useful for \"\"Beowulf\"\" in the verse in \"\"Beowulf.\"\" This is written in verse.",
        "It's not a prose translation.",
        "So I imagined the voice that I imagined speaking the poem was the voice of these old fellows who might known as the monster(ph).",
        "I just have a bit of the poem open in front of me here in Dublin studio.",
        "The geek people built a pyre for Beowulf.",
        "Now, if my old fellows have been speaking, they will say, the geek people built the pyre for Beowulf stacked and decked it until it stood four square.",
        "And that, I suppose, was the fundamental Irishism in my relationship to it.",
        "I also used a term for the hall, the king's - the Danish king's hall which is under attack by the monsters.",
        "It's called Heorot, and it's a center of civilization of feasting, of music, of the warriors not fighting but being there with their lord and receiving gifts so on and so on.",
        "So it's a center of civilization in the midst of this dark, menaced country.",
        "The word I use for it here and there throughout the translation was bawn, B-A-W-N, which is a word that was used in Ireland in the 17th Century, when the English settlers came over.",
        "There has rebawned(ph).",
        "So there, I thought of it that as a way of Irishing it, a wee bit.",

        "What would it mean specifically for women?",
        "Which rights would they see curtailed?",

        "They cannot work without the permission of the husband or the father.",
        "So it will eliminate their role in the society, and certainly they don't want that, whether they are conservatives or they are liberal and secular."
