        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "The truth is there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in this country from the working families of America to the top one-tenth of 1 percent.",
        "And together, you and I have got to turn that around.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "Sanders has been delivering variations on this speech for decades, choosing statistics about income inequality over the heartwarming personal stories and soaring rhetoric used by most presidential candidates.",

        "I'm writing other songs, you know, down the side or at funny angles to that one and then--but those turn out to be the good songs and the one I've been working on, you know, forever is just an epic piece of junk, you know?",
