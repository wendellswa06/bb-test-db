        "And ABC gave a preview of their new midseason replacement shows at the end of the Academy Awards, and we didn't see one person of color.",

        "Hi, Karen.",

        "I think they have stopped being surprised, because he's made a couple of movies before now and they made goo gobs of money.",
        "And they kept looking and say, how could this happen?",
        "How could this happen?",
        "Well, the reason this happened is that Tyler doesn't leave the marketing up to somebody else.",
        "He goes out, and he is very hands-on about this.",
        "He's kind of like President Obama was in terms of marketing through the Internet.",
        "I'm always getting emails from Tyler Perry saying, God be blessed; my movies are doing great; please go out and see it if you haven't already; take your grandmother.",
        "So, that's why he made $40 million.",
        "Well, also, $40 million, that's a lot.",
        "Is that just African-Americans, or is that crossover?",
        "You know, there may be a little bit of crossover.",
        "I still think that the rest of the world outside the black community in general isn't quite getting Tyler Perry yet.",
        "But they don't need to when he's making that kind of money.",
        "And I think, frankly, he's been so good at marketing that all you need is a couple of mega churches saying, OK, after brunch, we're going to go see Tyler Perry, and there you go, ka-ching(ph) 40 million.",
        "Is that why he's been so successful?",
        "I mean, is that the key to his success, just sort of knowing how to promote and who to promote to?",
        "You know, I interviewed him a couple of years ago when I was on Day to Day, when \"\"Madea Goes to Jail\"\" was actually a play here in the Kodak Theatre, and it was fuller than the Kodak was on Oscars night.",
        "There was not one empty seat.",
        "People had saved up.",
        "They were coming, and the reason they came - he firmly believes - the reason they came is that he doesn't talk down to them, that he's doing theater that he says his relatives would like to see, and in this case, movies that his relatives would like to see, because he says, you know, I go see \"\"Hamlet;\"\" I go see, you know, serious stuff.",
        "My relatives ain't going to see that; they want something more fun.",
        "And so, this is what people want.",
        "Well, it's interesting because Hollywood has a history; when something works, they try to duplicate it.",
        "But this seems like this would be a little harder to duplicate because he developed such a core audience over the course of years.",
        "This is not - didn't happen overnight.",

        "Right.",
        "That's a good - next question.",

        "So, I think that your big successes, for instance, have been the ensemble shows - the cop shows, the forensic shows, the \"\"Grey's Anatomy,\"\" its spin off, \"\"Private Practice\"\" - and now \"\"Grey's\"\" and \"\"Private\"\" had a black show writer - have a black show writer Shonda Rhimes, but these other shows - a lot of the ensemble shows often have black directors or black producers; there's some black sensibility in there somewhere.",
