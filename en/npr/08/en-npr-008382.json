        "Right before he was to be sentenced, Polanski fled to Paris, never to return to the United States for fear of being arrested.",
        "That story, what happened during the trial and the fallout is told in a new documentary that airs on HBO tonight.",
        "I don't think anyone, other than the two of them know what really happened, but I was more interested in what happened after that and what made him flee.",

        "You know, for me, with Roman Polanski, you always have to go back in time.",
        "You know, it starts with his childhood in Poland where he survived the Holocaust where his mother was murdered.",
        "Goes to London in the swinging 60s and is making films, \"\"Knife in the Water,\"\" \"\"Cul-de-sac.\"\" Meets Sharon Tate, they fall in love and what was surprising for me was to just see how he had such hope in his life at a certain point when he was a hot young director after making \"\"Rosemary's Baby.\"\" And then she was murdered.",
        "So, for me, in going back, it just painted a picture, for me, of what brought him to this night in 1977.",
        "So, do you think that the murder of Sharon Tate, and he did say his marriage to her was the happiest time of his life, do you think that after that he fundamentally changed?",
        "I think Roman Polanski is the survivor, but I thought Mia Farrow said it best, kind of that he didn't have the blueprint for life that most of us do",
        "One hoped for Roman, you know, this brand new life with a woman who loved him, and who seemed so right for him.",

        "But he is - he's blamed by not only Polanski and Polanski's defense attorney but also the prosecutor for a miscarriage of justice.",
        "Yeah, I mean, when I was interviewing the lawyers and discovered what had happened kind of behind closed doors, I was astounded.",

        "Polanski pleads guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.",
        "The punishment was supposed to be based on a probation report.",
        "The judge got the probation report and it said that he wasn't a mentally disordered sex offender and the he shouldn't go to jail.",
        "And I think he was feeling a lot of pressure and didn't know what to do, so he started enlisting advice from Richard Brenneman who was a young journalist for the Santa Monica Evening Outlook at the time.",
        "He said, you know, I went into his chambers and he looked at me and said, Dick, tell me, what do I do about Polanski?",

        "Well, now, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, if this man said that he was a born-again Christian and that his white supremacist days were behind him, and if the authorities are indicating that this was a private dispute and not necessarily a - overtly a racial dispute, why has it caused such tension in South Africa?",
        "The racial tensions are great.",
        "It has led to even the president of the country going on the air Saturday night after the murder, appealing for calm.",

        "I think this latest trove of information about China is truly fascinating.",
        "For example, it seems that the latest Chinese government campaign against Google over the last year and a half or so was touched off when the propaganda chief of China, a man named Li Changchun was shocked to find that when he used the Google, he found some critical result about himself.",
        "And then many dominos fell after that.",
