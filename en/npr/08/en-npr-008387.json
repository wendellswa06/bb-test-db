        "And to a certain extent there's been a little bit of educating fire in the sense that the thing that they've been hitting have been in positions that are being used by artillery or mortars to attack the Peshmerga front lines.",
        "Guys will shoot off a few mortars and a drone comma and zap them basically, which of course is going to put ISIS sort of on its back heel a little bit because one of the things they rely on in terms of combat is the speed and maneuverability of these kind of large wolf packs of hundred pickup trucks with heavy machine guns mounted on the back that will swarm in out of the desert around a town and sort of overwhelm its defenses.",
        "That's going to be incredibly hard to do considering they're basically unarmored pickup trucks in a big flat desert if F-18's are flying around looking for things to bomb.",

        "The American on was quite extensive but at some time, you know, you drop in 8,000 meals and water that's an awful lot to drop from a plane but it's nowhere near enough if they got 40 to 50 thousand people up there.",
        "So as that crisis is unfolded what we've been finding out today is that the Iraqis have diverted military helicopters to a Kurdish base in the North and they're trying to evacuate them but again you're talking about a few hundred at time being pulled off the mountain.",
        "Some Peshmerga have gone into the mountains to help guide people out.",
