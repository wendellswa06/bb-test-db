        "How does Atrazine work?",
        "I mean, how does this chemical turn a male frog into a female?",
        "Well, in part, we're still working on that, but what we believe now is that Atrazine turns on an enzyme called aromatase, and this enzyme is the machinery, if you will, that converts testosterone into estrogen.",
        "So we exposed frogs starting from the tadpole stage all the way out to three years, and what we found was that first of all, about 10 percent of the animals turned completely into females that were capable of laying eggs or reproducing with unexposed males, and the males that didn't turn into females, those were chemically castrated.",

        "Well, there's at least one study that was conducted in Kentucky, and that was a fairly large study.",

        "Which is the company that makes Atrazine.",
        "He called your study seriously flawed.",
        "He said the whole issue was resolved by the EPA back in 2006, when it determined that Atrazine was perfectly safe.",
        "If the issue was resolved by the EPA, then the EPA wouldn't be holding three scientific advisory panels this year to review Atrazine.",
        "So I think what you're hearing from Tim Pastoor, as they say, the money talking, not the science."

        "Syngenta also says that farmers in the U.S.",

        "Well, Atrazine has been banned in Europe, and studies have been done, both in corn production in Europe and on their economy.",
