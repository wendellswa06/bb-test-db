        "WES WATKINS: It's the way that we interact with each other that makes the music good or not and makes the democracy good or not.",
        "And it's about this magic balance, I think, that jazz musicians have the ability to balance individual freedom and what's best for the group, which I think is a struggle for any democracy.",
        "And he realized that there was an opportunity to teach junior high school and elementary school students, who normally got bored at talk of things like democracy, more about it by using principles of jazz.",
        "And so he's done that in an incredibly successful way in a number of schools in the Bay Area, and particularly in Oakland, and is continuing to grow it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, if anybody's ever actually tried to play the music, to actually do that - to integrate and have your own voice - it does make sense when you think about it.",
        "He has the students role play a little bit or sometimes he will show them professionals performing and kind of weave in those concepts.",
        "And ultimately it allows them to understand qualities of dissent, of working together, of allowing the minorities sometimes to standout.",
        "And it's been an incredible vehicle for students understanding and getting more excited, honestly, about the issue of democracy.",
        "Finally, you know, a lot of people are going to be planning New Year's Eve parties right about now, and, you know, you either stress out about the food or about the music.",
        "At least on the second one of those two, there's some help for that you've been writing about.",
        "So there's this wonderful new site called Mixify that just launched about a year ago.",
        "Not surprisingly, like many good party things, it started in Brooklyn.",
        "The cool thing about Mixify is that you log on and, there, famous DJs from around the word are allowing live streams of their performances.",
        "So they may be in a club in New York, but you could stream from the website their music and even their performance.",
        "You could put it onto a screen, in your home, in another club.",
        "And that way, you not only get to kind of enjoy the party remotely, but you get access to the coolest music.",
        "And whether you want it for a full-on party or whether you just want to exercise to their music, it's a very cool way to expand the party, if you will, to take the party global.",
        "And I guess these DJs feel comfortable enough that they're not worried about losing people in the clubs.",
        "Not at all.",
        "In fact, in a lot of cases, whether you're kind of one of the big name acts, like Crystal Method, or if you've heard of the Adventure Club, which is one of the very cool DJ duos out there, in some ways, you're kind of expanding your brand.",
        "You're getting people who normally wouldn't get access to you because they're not in New York, L.A., London, Ibiza or other places to get a chance to taste what you're doing.",
        "And in some cases, Arun, what they're doing is the clubs - a local club - might actually strike a deal with these DJs and agree to have a remote DJ, if you will, and will actually pay them.",
        "So for some of these DJs, there's also some commercial upside if this goes well.",
        "Nice.",
        "So there could be a holographic DJ coming soon to a small town near you."
