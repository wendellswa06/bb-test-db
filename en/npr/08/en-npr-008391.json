        "But, at the same time, prosecutors are also arguing that there is no way the FBI could have figured that out on its own, without Moussaoui telling them so.",
        "The two FBI agents on the stand yesterday seemed to wrestle with this problem, seeming almost defensive at times, as they testified that the Bureau knew a lot about al-Qaida before the attacks--that they knew the group had looked into using box cutters, training at flight schools, and even flying planes into buildings."
