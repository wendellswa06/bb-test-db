        "Hallie Bulleit who was also in \"\"De La Guarda\"\" says Diqui James came up with some gasp-inducing ideas for \"\"Fuerzabruta\"\" as well.",
        "I mean, it literally springs out of Diqui's imagination and he thinks, well, what would happen if we put a 50-foot pool with a clear bottom in the air over the audiences' head.",
        "How would that work?",
        "And what sort of things could we do in that kind of a pool?",

        "It is.",

        "Well, I think something - according to a report that came out last spring from your organization, 50 percent of all people in developing countries working today, work in agriculture.",

        "There's no question, when we look at the sectors where child labor occurs, agriculture is probably the largest.",

        "The challenge is to really drill down and deal with the root causes of child labor.",
        "And when we're talking about agriculture, it means we've got to increase the productivity of parents who are providing for their families through agricultural means to make sure the infrastructure is there, and to help them in that regard.",
        "We also have to be sure that quality, free education is available for their children, and that there are social protection programs in place that will allow parents to work, and children to go to school."

        "Well, does the ILO help with that?",
        "I mean, what does this organization actually do other than say this is a terrible thing?",

        "One of the big outcomes of our work together are international labor standards.",

        "But we also know that we can provide and help workers, employers and governments figure out how to get at these root causes; for example, in the area of youth employment.",

        "Can you give us an example of one of these ideas that worked?",
        "Yeah, more recently, for example in Bahia state in Brazil, which is working to become a child-labor-free state, we are taking an area-wide look at the issues associated with child labor.",

        "So, you know, it's not - as you pointed out at the top of the show, it's not black and white.",
