        "We were always paid at the same we often did bindery piecework at the same rates that adults could, and kids' hands can be fast, and we actually were able to earn quite nicely under those conditions.",
        "I also did things like emptying wastebaskets, but Dad was extremely safety-conscious.",
        "I was going to say, those presses can be dangerous.",
        "Oh, well, we were taught to stay away from the these are the dangerous places, and keep yourself away from them.",
        "We also learned a great deal about how the folks made the money that we all lived off of, and how hard they worked.",

        "And we think of - again, the phrase brings up images of kids chained to looms somewhere in, you know, India or Pakistan or, as you say, kids working on farms in Africa or South America.",

        "They're put to work as soon as they can walk.",
        "I lived with families that had dairy farms, and they were waking up in the middle of the night to milk the cows, as well as during the day, waking up small toddlers and bringing them out.",
        "I did see a lot of children getting injured, and in the two years that I was going to the Mennonite church, I actually even attended a funeral for a little girl who fell off a tractor and was run over by her father, who didn't notice she had fallen asleep.",
        "So there was all kinds of ranges of injuries and death.",
        "And my brother, who was 14 when we moved there, was put to work on a pig farm.",
        "And he had no experience in farms prior to moving there, and they suddenly were working him 16 hours a day.",
        "And he has permanent hearing damage from the screaming of the pigs, and he has back damage from the weight of the loads that he was forced to carry during work.",
        "So it was kind of horrible for him.",
        "For the rest of his life, he'll have these injuries."

        "That's right, and that's how it was explained.",
        "And no one really questions it.",
        "And most of the people living there, they had known no other way.",
        "They had no basis of comparison because they're pretty well sheltered from exposure to, you know, environments where that kind of thing would be frowned upon.",
        "And then when they do go out into the communities, you know, they're viewed as, you know, quaint quilters and farmers, and it looks very wholesome on the outside.",
        "But having been on the inside, I just saw it as like, there was like -horrific violations of childhood in that these children were working so long, so hard and in such a dangerous situation; coupled with the fact that they weren't, most of them weren't even allowed to continue going to school past eighth grade.",
        "There was a church school, and then most children were pulled from the school at the legal minimum and then immediately, you know, forced into whatever their families...",
        "Well, let me just pose a question to Jane Stewart.",
        "The Eastern Mennonites are not the only group that feels this way or treats their children like that.",
        "What do you do in that situation?",
        "There are laws.",
        "And that's what these conventions are about, to help countries to pass and articulate legislation that can deal with the issues of child labor.",
        "It means you do have to have monitoring, and you have to have strong labor institutions, but these are the kinds of things that we're talking about.",
        "You know, economies evolve, and we know now that these are things that are not positive in terms of child development, and in terms of a bright and strong future.",
        "And these are things that need to be dealt with.",
        "I hear that, but this group says wait a minute, this is a violation of our religious freedom.",
        "But these are fundamental standards that are now part of a society when they're passed in legislation, and they apply to all citizens."
