        "So these are the kinds of I mean, this articulation and, you know, this is Arcadia's experience, so I can't comment on her experience - but there's an element that I would like to draw on, which is this question of the minimum age and the relationship to education.",

        "So that was an issue, but...",
        "And Neal, when we're looking at the minimum age, we really do connect the two parts and identify that the minimum age for work shouldn't be less than the age of completion of compulsory schooling, and in any case shouldn't be less than 15.",
        "But that linkage between work and school is fundamental to our approach to dealing with child labor and, as I say, getting at the root causes of it.",
        "Arcadia, we can hear in the background you've got some kids of your own now.",
        "So we'll give you time to go back and take care of them.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "(Unintelligible) pick up their own toys, let alone work.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "And good luck getting them to pick up their toys."

        "But you know, the plan in Indonesia - the number is decreased, but the market is still significant, especially in the informal sector and in agriculture.",
        "And how do you convince parents that they should stop sending their children to work?",
        "This is an important part of their income.",
        "Yeah, this is the I know in Jakarta, I work with - what's it called - the government union employers and other stakeholder, like a government organization, to work on this issue, especially by advocating the government to have a policy, and an environment and legislation that can stop child labor in Indonesia.",
        "Are businesses that hire children subject to penalties?",
        "According to the law, the minimum age - for example, in Indonesia, is 15 years old because Indonesia already ratified the ILO convention, both ILO conventions, on minimum age as well as on the small-child labor.",
        "And it's there in the national law that, you know, employing children under minimum age is prohibited, as well as employing children (unintelligible) is also prohibited.",
        "The problem is that, you know, the root causes of all of this is poverty, and sometimes the legal approach alone is not effective.",
        "We have to also work from other side - like, you know, wellness, poverty alleviation, education program, etc. So the approach should be a multi-approach.",

        "But I did that for $3.27 an hour, and to me back then, that was a small fortune.",

        "The challenge is, again, looking at the age - and I'm so happy that you were looking at it in terms of your capability as a 14-year-old to do some of the work that was out there - running the tractor, sitting on the back, you know, popping the plants in or priming.",
        "And it could be very dangerous.",
        "And you've got to have certain strengths, and you got to have certain capacities and a mental agility to be able to participate in this kind of work.",

        "And this is one of the real challenges, in terms of the root causes of child labor and why at the U.N., for example, during the Millennium Development Goals, we're talking about the importance of having social protection floors in place, where there really are opportunities to help families who are poor or who are aged, you know - like in Africa, where the HIV/AIDS epidemic has just killed so many, and grandparents are looking after children - to having cash transfers that will help them support the family if they can't make enough money themselves and therefore, stem the need to send children to school.",
        "So this idea of, you know, people who through no fault of their own are poor - you know, to find ways, through government policy and sharing, to assist with that is essential to dealing with this issue of children labor, for sure.",
        "Jane Stewart, where do they grow tobacco in Canada?",

        "No, I don't.",

        "And in Norfolk County and Brandt County, where I'm from, we had a pretty robust tobacco industry going.",
        "And what kind of tobacco - cigar-wrapping tobacco, as they grow up in northern Connecticut?"
