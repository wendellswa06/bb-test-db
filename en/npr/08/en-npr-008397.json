        "And I lived in Brazil for about three years recently.",
        "I was actually in Sao Paulo, but I did do some traveling in the northeast.",
        "And one of the things that I noticed in Brazil, which I think is common in many countries, is that in addition to child labor in what we might refer to as more acceptable areas of work, such as agriculture, they have a large problem with child prostitution and children beggars on the streets and parents who have, you know, baby after baby after baby and after baby to send them out - because people are more likely to give them money."

        "And I shouldn't say participating because they're forced into it.",

        "I don't know, how do you deal with this kind - these kinds of issues?",
        "It's an excellent question.",

        "It's also about having robust labor institutions in place and monitoring.",
        "It is about, you know, having decent work for parents so that they're paid well enough so that kids don't have to go out and do this abhorrent kind of work.",

        "Or are johns taken to task if they hire, you know, child prostitutes?",
        "You've got to have that capacity, and you've got to have the - you know - the investment in policing and - or in labor markets - institutions.",
        "So it is an integrated approach.",

        "When the economy was a little bit better.",
