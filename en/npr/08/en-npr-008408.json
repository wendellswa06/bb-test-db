        "So I was thinking about this, and I realized I didn't know much about the history of crossword puzzles.",
        "Can you briefly tell me?",
        "When was the first crossword puzzle put into a paper?",
        "What's the history?",
        "Yeah, it was invented in 1913.",
        "The inventor was Arthur Wynne.",
        "It appeared in the old newspaper The New York World.",
        "And in 1924, Simon & Schuster published the first crossword puzzle book, which became a best-seller.",
        "And virtually all newspapers in American started crosswords in 1924 or '25.",
        "And this is where we are now.",
        "OK.",

        "Yes.",
        "I said think of a familiar phrase in the form I blank you, in which a four letter word goes in the blank.",
        "Rearrange those letters, and you'll get another familiar phrase in the form I blank you.",
        "And I said both phrases get more than half a million hits in a Google search.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "What phrases are they?",
        "Well, they are I read you and I dare you.",
        "We got nearly 1,000 responses - obviously people who do a lot of Google searches.",
        "And our winner is Helen Haller of Pittsford, N.Y.",
        "Congratulations.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Maureen Pao, NPR News.",
        "But, you know, it makes a good point, which is escape is escape, you know?",
        "You define it on your own terms, and a character who's living outside the norm and doing things that you can't do can be a reassuring figure.",
        "I mean, it's - everybody describes, you know - escape is personal for people, and to be good escape it's got to connect to something that the audience feels or believes in."

        "And it can go in any direction, it doesn't have to be mindless, either.",
        "During World War II, people went in huge numbers to films about combat and World War II because it was on their mind.",
        "It was reassuring to them to see stories in which it turned out OK or in which at least they could kind of empathize or connect to maybe what their loved ones were going through in combat.",
        "They wanted to know about it.",
        "They wanted see it.",
        "So, you know, it's really tricky when you start defining these things, unless you want to oversimplify, people find what they want to find in movies, and nowadays there are so many choices, so many different kinds and...",
        "Well, I want to - speaking of choice.",
        "I want to bring in another guest, because what gives us the most choices, of course, these days is the Internet.",

        "Thanks for having me, Lynn.",
        "So, what are you tracking right now?",
        "What kinds of sites are popular, the most popular right now?",
        "Well, there are the intuitive sites that are increasing in traffic, sites like financial news.",
        "We see big increases, about 20 percent year over year, and visits to sites...",
        "Now, that's not escapist.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's not escapist at all.",
        "You know, sites like Yahoo!",
        "Finance and Google Finance, definitely increases there.",
        "But when you back up a little bit and look at the sample that we track, which is about 10 million Internet users in the U.S., some of the segments that are increasing are a little counter-intuitive.",
        "Celebrity gossip tends to be up significantly over the previous year.",
        "It's doubled since last year and quadrupled over the last two years.",
        "And I think that represents one of the areas of escape or diversion a lot Internet users are engaging in.",
        "Was that a trend before the recession?",
        "Increasing news about gossips going up, up, up or has it started with the news of the recession?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "It was a trend but I think it was in its infancy before the economy really started to go bad.",
        "One of the things that we studied, we did a little analysis for Forbes Magazine and we looked back in August, 2008, segmented our sample just for the most affluent households, and what we found is if you looked at those affluent households, the top sites they visited were their brokerage accounts, sites like eTrade and Schwab and Merrill Lynch.",
        "Then, if you forwarded that sample or that view to August of 2008, all of a sudden those brokerage sites started to drop down to the bottom and we saw sites like Perez Hilton and TMZ, celebrity blogs, at the top of the list."
