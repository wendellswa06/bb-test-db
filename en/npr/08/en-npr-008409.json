        "What about a show like \"\"Damages\"\"?",
        "That has a little bit of that in it too, doesn't it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Damages\"\" is really, again, had a funny prescience, because when it debuted in 2007, it revolved around the prosecution of an Enron-type CEO named Arthur Frobisher who was played by Ted Danson who had built his company's pension fund.",
        "And the entire plot, you know, revolved around a lawyer trying to nail him, a very, sort of amoral lawyer, but again it was a revenge, a corporate revenge fantasy.",
        "Now CBS, which hasn't been doing very well in recent years, is suddenly doing pretty well in the ratings.",
        "Yes.",
        "How do you explain that?",
        "CBS, which is always considered the sort of stodgier network, not young, not youthful, not hip, has really been sort of having a renaissance with the police procedural, primarily a series called \"\"The Mentalist\"\" which stars the Australian, an Australian actor who had been a psychic fraud on talk shows.",
        "He would pretend to be able to connect people with the dead, to be able to solve crimes with his psychic abilities.",
        "You know, he comes clean that he's totally been a fraud, in the meanwhile his family members have been murdered and he goes to work as a detective as a kind of payback, really, for his fraudulence, and is very, very successful because he is actually just intuitively very, very gifted.",
        "These episodes wrap up in one hour, they are purely episodic, they do not make certain demands of the viewer that shows with long, you know, and complicated narrative arcs like the HBO dramas make.",
        "So, we sort of understand this as kind of comfort food television, you can really get into the show for an hour, not think about anything else.",
        "What about something like \"\"Lost,\"\" are those kinds of series where..."

        "Lost,\"\" you know \"\"Lost,\"\" is so complex.",
        "It still does very well, it's still popular and it is certainly escapist, but you really, you need to be focused when you're watching it, you can't be distracted with your own dwindling...",
        "And it's been losing some viewers hasn't it?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Abrams, \"\"Fringe.\"\" It's based on the far-fetched segment of science called \"\"fringe science\"\" and it's just as addicting as \"\"Alias\"\" with turns in every episode that keep me coming back every week.",
        "It has given me something to turn to now that \"\"Heroes\"\" has started to become less and less entertaining.",
        "So...",
        "Yes.",

        "Well, tell us a little bit about that.",
        "Why do you like it?",
        "Well, in World of Warcraft you have a lot more control over your own success.",
        "The more work you put into the game, the more you get out of it and so, unlike the real world, you can actually see the fruits of your labors rather than watch them evaporate."

        "Oh, yeah.",

        "Oh, you live, that's right, in the Motor City area.",

        "Let me ask you about that, Bill Tancer.",
        "Games like World of Warcraft and other computer games like that, going up on popularity?",
        "They are.",
        "I can't comment specifically on World of Warcraft because of a lot of that traffic happens outside on a private network, but I can tell you that visits to fantasy games - the other category of online games, the non-betting games that are up are those simple games like solitaire, things that you may find on a site like Pogo, we find traffic to those sites increasing as well.",
        "So, that's yet another diversionary activity that we think is increasing because of where we are today.",
        "Right.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, Janine, we were talking earlier with Ginia about TV shows that were sort of prescient about the way things are going.",
        "I wanted to ask you about the movie \"\"The International,\"\" which is a movie about a really bad bank (laughing).",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, it would have been in the works, of course, for quite a while as she referred to the turn around time, not being able to get things ready so quickly but starting to get it ready.",
        "I think they had a piece of good luck having that.",
        "Of course, bankers and banks have always been ready villains in the movies, going back to Frank Capra movies even in the 1930s.",
        "But that movie isn't doing too well at the box office and it didn't get good reviews.",
        "So, it's fortuitous that they came up with a plot we can all identify with, but again, it needs to be good to compete with everything else.",
        "Notice all the Internet things, the games, the betting, the television, there is so many choices for people, that actually getting up and going out to see a movie, you know, is the hardest kind of form of escapism probably that there is.",
        "You can sit home and do so much else.",
        "Plus you have to spend so much money for it with you, to get all that popcorn and soda and everything (laughing).",
        "Still cheap compared to theater or going out for dinner or to a sports..."
