        "Yes, I definitely think so.",
        "They - ones that you've seen before, you're glad to look at again, and ones that you missed, on Turner Classic Movies they're available or at your DVD store, whatever.",
        "And people do find the quality of the old films and the stories to be reassuring, old genre forms they're familiar with, stars that they love and feel comfortable with.",
        "And those really make great escapist routes even though the films themselves may be sad or end sadly or, you know, whatever, they become really great sources of escape because they're familiar and they're brilliantly done, many of them."

        "Ginia Bellafante, what about TV, what about old TV shows?",
        "Well, you know, the '70s were a high mark for very realistic shows about difficult economic times.",
        "Obviously, you know, we were in the middle of a gas/oil shortage and a terrible recession, and Norman Lear was a kind of one-man factory for the genre with shows like \"\"All in the Family\"\" and \"\"Good Times,\"\" which was set in, of course, in a Chicago housing project.",
        "And the theme song which, it's hard to imagine a theme song quite like it today, you know, talks about easy-credit ripoff and, you know, tough life in the projects and he found comedy in the difficulty, let's say, of getting health care when you have no insurance.",

        "Great.",

        "Ginia?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, \"\"24\"\" has taken a sort of self-reflective turn this season.",
        "It was maligned last season, really for kind of dramatically falling apart and for its elevation of torture of, you know, many people thought that it really made torture seem reasonable and feasible.",
        "Now, the problem with this season is that there's still a lot of provocation and unsavory interrogation practices, but the twist this season is that the enemy, you know, is not a Middle Eastern terrorist group but an actual corrupt U.S.",

        "Well, it's sort of about this kind of Plain Jane who works at a fashion magazine and the end she befriends her office - her office manager who is like a Casanova kind of type and, you know, it just shows that a lot of what matters is what's on the inside as opposed to what's on the outside, which is kind of a reassuring moral in this tough times.",

        "One of the works' central themes is that in American culture, including academic and Wall Street, the role of luck - good and bad - has been grossly underestimated and that the data simply do not support the widely-held belief that America's rich got there through brains and hard work.",
        "I think that's a good thought for the moment, to reassure ourselves that it's not all our fault that we're in a situation we're in.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, Bill Tancer, about one other thing about what people are doing online, and that is, as I understand it, a lot of people going to job sites.",
        "Of course, and that's one of the intuitive things that we see is that there is a lot of traffic going to job sites.",
        "I found it really interesting that a look at the click stream of job sites, and that - when I say click stream I mean where people are coming from and where they go to when they visit a job site.",
        "And I was looking for escapism or diversionary activity there and what I found is one area that we haven't talked about yet, and that is social networking.",
        "About 2.5 percent of all people leaving a job site go to their favorite social network, MySpace, Facebook.",
        "A lot of that could be explained by people actually networking to find a job, but I think a bit of that is also trying to get away, talk with friends.",
        "And of course social networking is just going crazy right now...",

        "His presentation is as crisp as his starched white shirt.",
        "I think Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or John Edwards would take America on a sharp left turn, with big government and big taxes and Big Brother running your lives.",
        "And I think the other course - if you will, the house that Ronald Reagan built, which is based upon personal responsibilities, individual liberties, strong families - that is the course that has the most promise for America's future.",
        "Romney started out in New Hampshire at about three percent in the polls, surprisingly low for the governor of neighboring Massachusetts.",
