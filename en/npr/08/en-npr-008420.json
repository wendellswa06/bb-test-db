        "Less than four days after Tomi had hung out the sign of her tobacco stand, a pair of swallows begin to build a nest under the projecting eaves of her tile roof.",
        "Watching the two swallows laboring on their nest with what seemed to her to be both heroism and desperation, Tomi murmured to herself, swallows are building a nest under the roof of my shop.",
        "She began to feel confident that good fortune in some form, however slight, would visit her life from now on.",
        "This was not just because of the saying that happiness comes to a house where swallows build their nests.",
        "In her loneliness, Tomi felt as though she were being blessed unexpectedly with children.",
        "She knew nothing about swallows, except that they flew in from the south in the spring, laid their eggs, hatched and raise their chicks, and returned to the south in the fall.",
        "She fantasized that her son, drafted by the army and killed in battle on New Guinea, had come back to his mother in the form of a swallow.",
        "No good came of being born a human.",
        "How much more fortunate to be reborn as a swallow and soar freely in the sky.",
        "Lovely images.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the story opens with the head of the local merchants association coming and telling her she has to take down the swallows' nest.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And she interprets this request as a sign that the other people within the area are trying to chase her out.",
        "So this story touches on what is really a universal theme, how this older merchant is being pushed out of her store by a larger store that wants to take over her space.",
        "If we were to walk through Osaka today, would we still see these small merchants?"

        "Nowadays chains such as 7-Eleven are moving in and taking over the business that was formerly done by these smaller shops.",
        "Now, this is intended to be a travel book of sorts, as we said, and the selections that you have made take us to all different places in Japan.",

        "What is the role of place in Japanese literature?",
        "In pre-modern Japanese literature, there was a tremendous amount of poetry, a tremendous amount of fiction written about specific places, and to a certain extent that still exists in modern Japanese literature as well.",
        "For instance, the area Nagano, where the Olympics were held several years ago, there's lots of beautiful literature that evokes the Sea of Japan, the sunsets over the Inland Sea that separates the islands of Honshu and Shikoku.",
        "There's another selection here that I'd like you to read, and it's from a memoir that's set in Kyushu.",
        "Can you tell us about The Snow of Memory?",
        "The Snow of Memory is the first part of a long memoir which is written by a contemporary poet, a gentleman by the name of Takahashi Mutsuo, which describes his life in an impoverished village in the southern island of Kyushu.",

        "And as the younger generation becomes a larger portion of the population, that can have a small effect on overall attitudes.",

        "If Barack Obama, Senator Obama is looking at 2,900 lives and saying that it's a catastrophic failure and we need to leave, I think it shows a lack of sophistication at looking at the history of the United States and the struggles of winning a very, very difficult war.",

        "And I think he's making quite a statement by articulating this issue in the way he's articulating it.",
        "Notice that he said 2007, immediately when we think 2007 we think January.",
