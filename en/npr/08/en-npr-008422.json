        "Very quickly, we're almost out of time, but Sean, would you favor some regulation that says you must disclose - universal?",
        "But that brings it back to the responsibility of the women who are going to be in the lives of these men in an intimate way to take more responsibility, too.",

        "I think the pressure today on so many of our young children is to gain as much wealth to look like the picture-perfect model and to achieve these materialistic assets.",

        "Whereas if perhaps - and again I'm just generalizing - if you're in a situation where you're in a developing nation or you spend a lot more time bonding with your family and surviving and slowly moving up the strata, I think that your happiness is derived on your interactions with your loved ones and your families; as opposed to in the States and Japan and Britain and so many of these other countries where so much pressure is placed on our young children, and young girls in particular, of looking the right way or dressing the right way or being a certain way.",
