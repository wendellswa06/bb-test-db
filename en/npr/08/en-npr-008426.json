        "And there are any number of circumstances, though, where people say we can't identify who is funding these ads.",
        "Right.",
        "The Target case is noteworthy because the group that they gave to is a political committee that has to disclose, under federal and state law.",
        "There is a lot of money flowing now into what are called 501(c)(4) groups -sorry for that - advocacy groups that are not considered political committees in the federal election law.",
        "They're not political committees, but they are playing politics extremely vigorously this cycle.",
        "And as we look at these various groups, what's the difference between these kinds of ads and the ads that we saw - for example, well, the Swiftboat ads that everybody denounced as factually challenged a few years ago in the John Kerry campaign?",
        "They weren't what's the difference between those and these?",
        "Legally, the difference is that Swiftboat Veterans was a political committee, had to disclose its donors.",
        "And under the Citizens United decision, they can use Swiftboats could use that corporate money, if it were around now, to say, you know, John Kerry lied about his military record - which is what they said - so you should vote for George Bush.",
        "They could add that.",
        "I see.",
        "And before, they could only say John Kerry lied about his military record, and therefore is not trustable, or something like that.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And the...",
        "Just to go back one more time before we get a lot of emails - widely disproven.",
        "Okay."

        "They're not as close to some legal line that they might accidentally go over, and the corporate counsel might view this less skeptically now.",

        "I'm doing quite well.",
        "My question was: With the Citizens United law, do you think that the Republicans in the Supreme Court used the timing of the Democratic democracy that's in Washington right now to make the ruling, or do you think that it was just inevitable that it would happen when there was a Democratic House, Congress and president?",
        "Oh, so the timing of the decision coming in the effectively about a year after Barack Obama was sworn into office as the president of the United States.",
        "Peter?",
        "Yes.",
        "The timing really has to do with the case that brought it there, the case by a group called Citizens United.",
        "And the case originated during the Democratic primaries in the '08 presidential cycle.",
        "Citizens United, in the the issue that came before the court was making a movie documentary and advertising a movie documentary about Hillary Clinton.",

        "And Joe, thank you very much for the call.",

        "Mitch McConnell - the minority leader in the Senate, now the minority leader in the Senate - argued all along that parts of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law were violations of free speech.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's right.",
        "Although it's sort of odd that the back when McCain-Feingold was on the floor, and I watched this, the idea pretty much was that full disclosure was a great thing, and that as long as we knew who was financing these things, this was good.",
        "As things move along, that argument from conservatives gets more nuanced, that full disclosure is good when it's money going to candidates and party committees, but maybe there are some groups that should be able to participate in the political debate without us knowing who they are."

        "And was that part of the Supreme Court decision, or is that part of, well, regulation?",
        "That's it was not part actually, it was not part of Citizens United, clearly, because excuse me they - the justices said in some detail that disclosure's important, that they said we've never had a situation before where corporations are spending money on politics, and we have the ability for instant disclosure on the Internet.",

        "Slander law is not something I know a great deal about.",
        "On the face of it, I'd say that as a candidate for public office, you'd have a hard time making your case.",

        "They're in the crossfire here.",
        "And so the campaign will write that letter.",
        "Then the group will write its letters defending the statements in the ad, and it goes back and forth."
