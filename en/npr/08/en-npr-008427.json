        "Thank you for having me, Neal.",
        "And Ezra, beginning with you, we're not talking about the constitutional basis of the Supreme Court decision anymore.",
        "But you point out Democrats have, as a result of it, been outspent seven-to-one in recent weeks.",
        "How's that changing things?",
        "Well, that comes from a new Washington Post analysis we did I think about a week or two ago, and it's changing things in the way money changes things, right.",
        "And one thing that I think is important here is it doesn't just change things in an election.",
        "A candidate with a lot of money who outspends a candidate with very little money is likely to win.",
        "It changes things in the next election and the one after that, by creating a new normal in which candidates can expect if they cross powerful interests, that the powerful interests can spend an unlimited amount of money to make an example of them.",
        "It makes them much, much, much less likely to cross that interest.",
        "And is it...",
        "So what you're creating is a bigger stick for the most powerful people in America.",
        "And is it your argument that this decision and the new world structurally favors one party over the other?",
        "It is structurally favoring Republicans for now.",
        "Republicans are raising about seven or eight-to-one, although Democrats raised, I believe, more money than Republicans did in 2006.",
        "So this does go back and forth.",
        "What I would say is that structurally, this is a bad thing for citizens.",
        "It is a bad thing for those of us who are not part of large corporations who have tens of millions of dollars to spend in order to push politicians back into line for our preferences."

        "Yeah.",
        "I think that maybe Ezra's not giving quite the complete picture.",
        "While the independent spending does seem, at this point, to favor Republicans, the fact is that at the level of national political parties, the congressional and senatorial campaign committees, the candidates themselves, the Democrats still enjoy a very substantial fundraising edge.",
        "What Citizens United, what speechnow.org, what the current environment permits is it allows independent voices to come into the political process and actually aid challengers that would otherwise be swamped by the, in this case, the incumbent Democrats.",
        "In future years, it may well be independent spending that is helping, you know, Democrats who are helping incumbent Republicans.",
        "So I don't think that it's really accurate to simply say that oh, well, the structure, you know, fundamentally favors Republicans.",
        "And one final thing, you know, there are plenty of voices, fairly powerful voices, on all sides of this.",
        "Ezra talks about, you know, candidates not wanting to cross powerful interests.",
        "Well, the AFL-CIO and the SEIU are - have pledged to spend about $100 million, I think, in this election, which is more than the chamber is talking about, spending about...",
        "Chamber of Commerce.",
        "...yeah, the Chamber of Commerce is talking about spending.",
        "So unless you're going to go to Congress and basically do nothing, you're going to cross either the Chamber of Commerce or the AFL-CIO.",
        "So I simply don't think it's very, you know, realistic to say that candidates are going to shy away from taking positions.",
        "Ezra Klein, it's fair to say, you talked about corporations, unions are included in this, too.",
        "And it goes back to the - back to my analysis.",
        "I mean, I believe my friend here thinks he's disagreeing with me, but I don't believe we are.",
        "He's saying very rich, very powerful interests from both sides will have a much, much large effect on campaigns, and so am I.",
        "I'm saying that that is a bad thing.",
        "Right now, it is favoring Republicans.",
        "In the future, it might favor Democrats, but I don't think it is something we want for our democracy one way or another."

        "What I do think it needs to make us wonder about is whether or not the way we're funding these campaigns works on the base level.",
        "One of the ideas that has gained a lot of currency in recent years is something called small-donor democracy, which is where you set up a fund, and small contributions, $250 contributions and under, from individuals like you and me, would be magnified by this fund.",
        "They would become $500, $750, $1,000 contributions.",
        "And that way, it would become much more viable for an individual to run a challenge or run a campaign based on no union, based on no corporate money.",

        "Generally speaking, you see a real significant reluctance among the American public to see tax dollars flowing directly into the campaigns of politicians.",
        "And, you know, getting back to what Ezra said a little bit earlier, he's talked about the AFL-CIO and corporations as if these are entities that exist on their own.",
        "The AFL-CIO represents millions, if not tens of millions of Americans who happen to be members of unions, or their family members are members of unions.",
