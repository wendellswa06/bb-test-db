        "But if you take that point, and you say these are broad interests working on behalf of the American people, then you have to ask yourself: Why aren't they disclosing it?",
        "Disclosure is voluntary.",
        "There isn't a law against them saying, listen, this is Exxon's ad.",
        "This is the AFL-CIO's ad.",
        "But if, in fact, what they're doing is funneling money through a third party because they don't want to be in front of it, well that probably tells you something, that this is not money that the public, if they heard about where it was coming from, would consider to be their money, would consider to be in their interest.",
        "And so this disclosure element is an important part of this.",
        "Nobody's saying corporations shouldn't be able to spend money on American politics or interests shouldn't be able to.",

        "And one of the things that popped out of these ads - really surprised me - was people resented the anonymity of, you know, a group that they couldn't tell who was behind it.",
