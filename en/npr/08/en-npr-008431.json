        "That's an eternity in the world of particle physics.",

        "But more significantly, he's charged with withholding evidence that was favorable to the players and lying to the court.",
        "One of the things that's happened so far during this hearing has been a lot of discussion about some DNA tests that Nifong had ordered - tests that seemed to support the players' claims of innocence.",

        "That'll happen some time in the next couple of days.",
        "But in the past, he has cited a number of reasons for not turning over the DNA test results sooner, including privacy concerns and also he just talked about the workload that he says he faced as DA, which he said had made it hard to handle a big case like this on a more timely manner.",
        "And in these ethics charges, who actually hears the testimony and ultimately decides whether or not he will face a penalty?",
