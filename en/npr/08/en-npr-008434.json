        "Cruz's campaign started working months ago to make sure its supporters advanced through the complex caucus process.",
        "But Brophy says it's not just organization that gives the Texas senator an advantage here.",
        "The average assembly attendee in Colorado is a conservative.",

        "But two of the names on the slate were not even on the ballot.",
        "And in other districts they didn't even get organized enough to print up a slate.",
        "And so that level of basic disorganization is hurting them on the delegate count."

        "So one of the sort of side benefits of publishing this measurement, even though it's a bit premature in terms of making a real determination, is that these guys contact us and say, oh, yeah, I'm really interested in that.",

        "The way you trap antihydrogen is that it's a little bit magnetic.",
        "You can think of it as kind of a little compass needle that points along the magnetic field that we use to trap it.",
        "It has spin in atomic language, so what we do is shine some microwaves on that atom and flip the spin, turn it around.",
        "And when you do that, it jumps out of the trap, OK?",
        "So the compass needle pointing one way, it wants to be trapped.",
        "If you use the microwaves and flip it, then it goes out and you can detect that.",
        "So that's actually the first ever quantum interaction with an antimatter atom.",

        "So that was also, you know, our main goal in all of this is to study the structure of antihydrogen and compare it to hydrogen.",
        "So that was a big milestone for us to actually make a measurement on, you know, a number, a quantum number associated with an antimatter atom.",
        "So we've had a couple of good years.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Does anybody still have any better idea of where all the antimatter went?",
        "No.",
        "There's no sort of smoking gun theory about that.",
        "So our philosophy is anytime you can get your hands on some antimatter, you should take a really careful look.",
        "And the best way to do that is with atomic physics techniques to look at the spectrum of antihydrogen.",
        "What kind of light does it like to absorb and emit?",
        "Is that the same color of light that hydrogen absorbs and emits?",
        "So also in the meantime, we've built a new machine we call ALPHA-2, which is improved and upgraded, that will allow us to actually shine laser light on trapped antihydrogen.",
        "So when we come back online in 2014, we have a brand-new machine.",
        "We'll have some lasers to shine on it, and it's a really very exciting time for us.",
        "Can you keep it trapped for longer than 16 minutes?",
        "You know, it's not really worth looking because it's long enough.",
        "We showed with the microwave experiment that that was long enough.",
        "I have to tell you, it's an incredibly boring experiment to do.",
        "You know, you trap your antihydrogen.",
        "You wait for 16 minutes and you release it.",
        "You know, go have a coffee or something while you're - it just doesn't tell you anything more that we really need to know right now.",

        "But you're talking to the real deal now, Ira.",

        "That's right.",
        "But what happens if an antihydrogen bumps into something bigger - let's say a carbon atom?",
        "Yeah, well, in fact, what our(ph) antihydrogen atoms bump into when we release them is gold.",
        "The inside of our apparatus is gold-plated, so they're actually hitting gold nuclei.",
        "So what happens is the antiquarks in the antiproton finds some quarks in a gold nucleus and annihilate with those.",
        "The amount of energy released is about the same, right?",
        "You're annihilating the rest mass of the antiproton on the same rest mass of the quarks that make up the nucleus.",

        "Not in any way that you would measure macroscopically, right, but - because we're talking about, we trap one atom at a time, right?",
        "So there's no macroscopic effect that you would be able to measure.",
        "But for us, that's a microscopically violent event, right?",
        "There's a lot of energy released, and we're pretty good at detecting that so we can actually see the energy release when you lose one atom of antihydrogen.",
        "By the way, you couldn't do that with hydrogen.",
        "If hydrogen hits the wall, nothing happens, right?",
        "So this is one way that antimatter is actually fun to work with.",
        "Drive and drivel.",
        "Yeah, what happens is the - it's trapped because of that little magnetic compass needle, if you will, always pointing in the right direction.",
        "If you flip it, it gets shoved out and then it annihilates, and you can see that.",
        "Or when you try to throw it away, it's not there anymore.",
        "That's another way to look at that measurement.",
