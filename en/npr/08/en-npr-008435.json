        "OK.",

        "Do you remember what you said?",
        "Yeah, I said practical applications are science fiction, that we just can't make enough antimatter to be useful.",
        "It would take longer than the age of the universe to accumulate macroscopic amounts of antimatter to make a weapon or a rocket fuel or something like that.",
        "So this is really pure research, right?",
        "We're looking at, you know, one or few atoms at a time.",
        "There's 10 to the 24th atoms in a macroscopic amount of hydrogen or antihydrogen, so we're just nowhere near there.",
        "But it's still a lot of fun.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So the answer to the question of a practical application is still absolutely no.",
        "Yeah, nothing has changed there and...",
        "That's good to hear.",
        "Yeah, you feel safer that way, actually.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We like to hear knowledge for the sake of knowledge.",
        "Now, if you found some antimatter, you know, if someone found some antimatter out in the universe, that would be another interesting story.",
        "Well, if we hear about it, we'll let you know."

        "So we need to reverse the budget sequester that cut $50 billion, and we also, beyond that, we need to start funding a lot more science.",
        "I want to see $1 trillion over the next 10 years.",
        "And while that sounds like a lot of money, it's actually - first, there's a huge return on investment whenever we fund science.",
        "So it's actually, in the (unintelligible) budget deficit, it actually makes sense to spend more money on science because it'll pay itself off.",
        "And then make sure that all across the country, students are learning about evolution, learning about climate change, learning about vaccines, learning about the science they need to know so when they go into the job market, they'll actually go and do good evidence-based science and help our country."
