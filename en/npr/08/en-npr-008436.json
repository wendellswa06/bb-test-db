        "Right.",
        "I think there are sort of two issues here.",

        "The other, where I think the Democratic Party has shifted, say, from Bill Clinton's days - the Democratic Party always wanted to be activists in giving people chances to get into capitalism, to give people - to lower their student loans.",
        "But they used to be more resistant to the idea of actually getting involved in the internal operations of businesses.",
        "We've seen on a broad array of fronts - not only Bernie Sanders, but also Hillary Clinton and, now, Barack Obama getting involved in the internal operations of businesses.",
        "And I think that's a shift for the party.",
        "And yet, this idea of populism doesn't seem limited to one party or another or, frankly, even one country - a similar theme across many European countries as well as in the U.S.",
        "right now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The reason - I don't quite buy the way David framed this because in the case, for example, of the corporate inversions, around the world, as you said Ari, there are a lot of countries saying lots of corporations are finding ways of evading their basic responsibility to pay tax.",
        "And they're saying, no, we can't operate a society or a government if that goes on.",
        "So the populism is not something that just came out of nowhere.",

        "The company was aware of the defect linked to at least 13 fatal crashes.",
        "But one question has not come up at congressional hearings over this matter.",
        "It's the question of whether the federal agency responsible for auto safety actually helped the carmaker to avoid a recall.",

        "He took that mentoring role seriously and was a generous and gracious collaborator.",
        "For those of us who had grown up in the 1950s with some ordinary but pernicious prejudices, Harold and his partner, Bob Harrison, one of my bosses on the Ringling show, also quietly but openly demonstrated the astonishing truth that two men could live together in a stable, happy, productive domestic relationship.",

        "Weedy was a Metropolitan Opera singer, but he had also been a regular at the Radio City Music Hall and a star on Broadway.",
        "That meant Harold had been classically trained and he applied that high level craft and training and technique to popular art.",
        "So when Harold presided over the greatest show on earth, he did it with the same dedication, character and skill that he used when singing in an opera, touring in a Broadway musical, or soloing in church every Sunday.",
