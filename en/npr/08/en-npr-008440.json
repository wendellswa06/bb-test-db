        "Other times they say hey, he doesn't have a Ph.D., he doesn't know what he's talking about.",
        "And so it cuts both ways.",
        "But I am 19.",
        "I can't change that until I grow older.",

        "We're always going to have people who don't understand evidence-based science and are going to try and subvert it, especially in our public sphere.",

        "What is it about science that moves you so much?",
        "I mean, there are so many injustices in the world.",
        "Why focus on science?",
        "Because it's really my generation is going to have to deal with things like climate change.",
        "We heard earlier on the show about how we fight these bacteria that are resistant to our antibiotics.",

        "I would love to have someone - have someone do science to fix that.",

        "So, I mean, my friends think this as normal.",
        "I see them, they know what I'm doing, but it is a lot - I mean, it's a lot of work, but it's work you have to do because I believe it's right.",
        "So I just - I may wake up and go to class and then start writing a piece on why science is important, and that's - it varies by day, but it's all how much can I promote science today."

        "And I would just encourage him first of all to consider maybe changing his major to one of the science majors because we have a shortage of people who graduate from our colleges with bachelors of science degrees.",
        "We have a need for about 120,000 per year but only graduate about 40,000 of them.",
        "And I'd like to also offer that my organization STEMforUS, which is also a new organization which was created to advocate and push for science funding, we've been looking at the fact that the president in his budget has suggested consolidating all of the funding for STEM from the many agencies that currently work on STEM efforts to just three, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Education and the Smithsonian Institute.",

        "I shouldn't be a science major.",
        "But if I can help create the funding, create the education for 1,000 more Nobel laureates, I can do immensely more on that than I can do being a scientist myself.",
        "But on the STEM funding, I think it goes back to the current climate we're in, where it's all about cut, cut, cut.",
        "And we're not thinking about this.",
        "Science offers a return on investment.",

        "This is my last chance to fight this law, fight for what I know is right.",
        "So I stood up, letter campaign to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act, and we just started gathering scientists from across the country to support us.",

        "And it's a place that's seen more than its share of racial pain, including the murder of nine black people by a white supremacist at a South Carolina church in 2015.",
