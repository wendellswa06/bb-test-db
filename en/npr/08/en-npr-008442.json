        "Some companies - it would be more than enough, and some companies - it wouldn't be enough to plug all their wells.",
        "Companies are supposed to pay a second bond when the wells stop producing, but historically, that hasn't always happened.",
        "During the coal-bed methane boom, large companies sold their wells and the responsibility for plugging them to smaller companies that didn't post the second bond before going under.",
        "Watson says the new rule will help avoid a repeat of that situation.",
        "One of the things we probably need to do a better job at is identifying companies that aren't solvent and identify them sooner than we did when the coal-bed play ended.",
        "But that's not easy.",
        "In the recent oil price crash, even some relatively big companies have gone bankrupt.",

        "The scholarship would apply to all students who are in-state residents regardless of family income, and it's being called one of the boldest plans yet to increase access to higher education.",

        "I want to note that your bio says, for example, as governor, Lujan Grisham has implemented a series of evidence-based policies aimed at transforming New Mexico's public education system and, you know, among other things.",
        "So what is the evidence that suggests that this is the right way to go?",
        "Well, actually, thank you for asking that.",
        "There is a ton that shows that, look - if you give college students - and this is also irrespective, right?",
        "- we want returning students to also be able to participate.",
        "If you are really clear about that access, you create an economic engine and future for the state.",
