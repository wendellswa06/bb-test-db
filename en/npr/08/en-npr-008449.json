        "So it was amazing to come out and do that.",
        "Although it was funny, I mean that wasn't my lifelong dream because I didn't even know about that.",
        "So people ask me, they go, was that - well, I mean, this must have been your dream since you were a child.",

        "That's the upgrade.",
