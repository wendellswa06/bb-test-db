        "Well, Somalia's a country the size of Texas.",

        "The rest of the country is split up between clan militias, a few semi-autonomous regional governments, and Islamic insurgents who control the vast portion of south central Somalia.",
        "Now, earlier this year the government had pledged to sweep the militants out of the capital and expand its zone of control.",
        "Why hasn't that happened?",
        "That's what we're all wondering about.",
        "I went to Mogadishu in March, and there was a lot of talk that the government was about to sweep across the capital and take back its territory.",
        "But that never happened.",
        "I think one reason why is there's been a number of defections and there's a lot of bickering and in-fighting among the leaders in the transitional government.",
