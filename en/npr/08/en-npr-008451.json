        "Yes.",
        "They claimed credit for this attack.",
        "And they seem to be getting increasingly bold and ambitious.",
        "In July, the Shabab sent suicide bombers to Uganda, and they attacked a crowd of people watching the World Cup and killed dozens of Ugandan civilians.",
        "They said they did this because they were angry that Uganda had sent peacekeepers to Mogadishu to help the government.",
        "Last December, the Shabab sent a suicide bomber to a medical school graduation, killing a number of students and four government ministers.",

        "And you're also told, instead of screen time, get them reading more, which is all well and good, except that these days, many children do their reading on a screen, which raises some interesting questions about how children read today and what direction things are headed in children's book publishing.",
        "To help us out, we've called Dan Poynter.",
        "He's the author of \"\"The Self-Publishing Manual\"\" and 126 other books.",
        "He says kids are still reading traditional printed books.",
        "But 13 percent of children's book sales are now e-books, and that number is rising.",
        "And by the way, 11 million parents have purchased an e-book and 19.6 million parents plan to buy an e-book.",
        "So the numbers are huge.",
        "Which makes sense, kids like to look at screens.",
        "But that's not the only reason e-books are flooding the market.",

        "Printing and transporting paper is very expensive, and e-books eliminate the expensive four-color printing, the higher quality paper, the ocean shipping, the customs clearance, the inventory, answering the telephone, writing up the orders, picking, packing and shipping and managing all of these functions.",
        "So we eliminate a huge number of costs and the chance that those books won't sell.",

        "And so it's just making lobbyists and the people who are hiring them behave differently and think more creatively or differently about their traditional approaches to lobbying, which, over the years, have focused largely on, you know, trudging up to the Hill and talking to various congressmen.",
