        "And we can try to rely also on individual responsibility or the individual making the right decision.",
        "But the problem is that there are some issues, which are beyond the control of the individual.",
        "To give you an example, when a few - a couple of years ago, the ChoicePoint accident came to be known to the public, ChoicePoint had sold personal information of individual consumers to - annoyingly to a criminal organization.",
        "Well, most of the people whose data had been bridged, didn't even know that ChoicePoint had the data.",
        "In fact, I would assume that they didn't even know what ChoicePoint was, which means that, most of our data is actually outside our control.",
        "So, there is only so much we can do to protect ourselves.",
        "It's more - we need to take a ecosystem try - type of approach to the program.",
        ": How much Dr. - I'm sorry, did you want to jump in there, Danny?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I just wanted to underscore the point that Alessandro made, it's really critical.",
        "We are at the point - if you compare, for example, the way that personal sensitive information is handled relative to the financial system as an example.",
        "The flow of personal information in many ways is becoming like the flow of money around the country and around the world.",
        "Both because it has value as - from the economic perspective, but also because it can cause us harm.",
        "And if you look at the amount of energy and amount of resources that we put into making sure that the financial system is fair, making sure that the right money ends up in the right places, that people's bank accounts don't get magically emptied, we put huge amount of effort into that and we look at it very carefully.",
        "We have measures, it's called accounting, we have measures of whether money has ended up where it ought to end up, and whether the right people have it and - or not.",
        "And I think that as we come to rely more on the online exchange of personal information, we're going to have to get to that point.",
        "Again, we started off the Internet era in many ways with a kind of a libertarian attitude about personal privacy.",
        "And the questions were, what could an individual do to protect it?",
        "We talked a lot about using encryption and about using, you know, strong passwords and all those kinds of things...",
        ": Right, right.",
        "...those are still very important.",
        "But as information flows around, I think we're going to have to supplement that with the sense of what is our, you know, collective responsibility.",
        "What is the responsibility of institutions to make sure that information isn't abused because...",
        ": In other - holding them responsible then, really, for whatever they...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, you know, it's instructive again to look at the State Department example.",
        "What the State Department was able to find was that some employees who weren't authorized to look at data or who you wouldn't expect to look at the same data over and over again in the course of a couple of days - they spotted that kind of anomaly and they were able to take action based on that.",
        "I think that what we're going to have to do in computer science research and in information systems research is get better and better at characterizing, not just who access information but how is it used.",
        "Can we tell the difference between, for example, looking at passenger records of an airplane in order to spot terrorists, which we all probably want to do, versus looking at those same records to figure out whether there's someone on the plane who is late with her parking tickets and should be picked up at the airport."

        "So we have to get better at discriminating different kinds of uses, and on the legal side, on the, kind of, societal level, come to some agreements about what we think are acceptable uses of personal information and what are unacceptable ones.",
        "And then go after - making sure that people are accountable for those kinds of breeches.",
        ": Alessandro, what is to keep a company from doing these bad things that we're talking about?",
        "Some of it - I mean, is it not legal for them to take the data and mine it and do things with it?",
        "Well, as you know, there is a significant difference in how the U.S legal system and the European - the European Union legal system - approaches privacy.",
        "In the E.U., we have a much more regulated approach.",
        "In the U.S it's much more laissez faire.",
        "There are several legislations, but nothing comparable in terms of breadth to the European directive union of privacy.",
        "So, yes, there are some legislation, but many of the things that companies are doing with data are not illegal, they can do them.",
        "Our studies show that consumers, as well as individuals on the Facebook, tend to maintain the default settings.",
        ": So, Emily, then would the rule be if you don't want people to see it, don't post it?",
        "What is acting as a restraint is sometimes the norms of society.",
        "Meaning that, for instance, it is already technologically feasible to provide advertising on a pop-up window on your browser which has your name in it, that's doable.",
        "Companies are not yet doing it, not because it's illegal, but because probably they would trigger consumer concern or even annoy us if they did it so.",
        "To me, the question in the long run is whether these norms of society, which in a way currently are somewhat protecting us, we don't resist under the continuous impact of new privacy invasions as well as new trends towards more personal information revelation online.",
        "Think about, you know, Facebook, MySpace - this continuous trend of revealing more of - more and more about ourselves.",
        "In the long run, the question is as a society, are we becoming less and less concerned about privacy?",
        "Or vice versa, this continuous invasion eventually will trigger a certain...",
        ": Yeah.",

        ": But are people willing to trade the convenience for the privacy, Danny?",
        "You know, I'd like to be, perhaps, overly optimistic and suggest that maybe we don't have to make that trade.",
        "We don't have to trade off all these exciting services that we have on the Web for a sense of privacy.",
        "I think that if you look at what people are concerned about, whether it's access to your passport data or inappropriate use of, say, your Facebook profile, I think what people worry about for the most part is improper use of personal information.",
        "I think that Alessandro is correct that we're getting used to a situation, we're getting accustomed to a situation where a lot more people know a lot more about us.",
        "But in many ways what privacy has always been about, historically, has been making sure that the knowledge that we have about individuals isn't abused, that it's not used to discriminate against us, that it's not used to make institutions - whether government or others - too powerful.",
        "And so, I would like to think that we can have our cake and eat it too, to a large extent, if we can agree to on what those norms are that Alessandro...",

        "Well, we have two choices there, we could say, well, you can't put pictures on Facebook or you have to get someone's permission to attach their name to a picture you've taken.",
        "Or what we could do is evolve towards the point where we have social norms and perhaps even laws that say that you can't use the - a picture of a person, you can't use personal information like that to make a decision about someone's employment.",
        "And in many ways, I think, that if you look at the world offline, we do that today.",

        "And I think that one of the things we need on the Web is a way to reintroduce those kinds of more subtle social norms.",

        "Yes, Alessandro, go ahead.",
        "I think Daniel made two really great points, and I wanted to remark something about - first of all, the value of information for an economist can only be known exposed.",
        "What I mean is that, if certain piece of data about you assumes value depending on the context in which you're using it.",
        "And this is the difficulty we have in handling our personal information.",
        "Because the photo of yourself in a beach in Cancun on Facebook drinking rum and maybe passed out on a beach - when you use it on Facebook and you intend it to be to your peers, to your classmates, and so on and so forth, then it has a certain meaning, it carry a certain signal.",
        "However, it could also be used, as Daniel was mentioning, by your employer.",
        "In that moment, it assumes a completely different signal.",
        "So the value of information cannot be predicting of us, it depends on how it will be used.",
        "And this is related to the challenge we have of transferring our ability to understand what is private and public in the offline world - in face-to-face interaction - transfer this into the online world in which these calculations about how certain information will be used later in time become much more difficult.",
        "Because how do you know whether a photo you post now, 20 years from now will pop up when you're, say, a Supreme Court candidate and somebody will use it against you.",
        ": Mm-hmm.",
        "But some of these, you know, some of these conveniences we have - I'm thinking like Gmail, for example.",
        "Don't you, have a - sort of make a bargain with Gmail?",
        "I'll get - Gmail will give you free mail, but they're able to go through your mail to see where to send the advertisers?",
        "You know, Ira, the bargain is really an interesting one because it's a bargain that actually has some of the kinds of usage limitations that we've been talking about implicit in it.",
        "Yes, there's quite extensive profiling that goes on associated with Gmail.",
        "Yes, Google keeps data about you for a period of time in order to do that profiling.",
        "But there's also some limitations that Google implicitly accepts, and I think people are aware of.",
        "Google doesn't sell that data, as far as we know, to others to market for other purposes or to contact you for other purposes.",
        "So Google - whether it's the right deal or not for everyone is certainly a question.",
        "But I think we have, in a lot of these even in these marketing environments, sort of some implicit boundaries that are really worth preserving and maintaining.",
        ": Alessandro, you get last word today.",
        "Well, these, exactly(ph) for the Gmail case, we have to realize that we make these kind of decisions daily, almost every minute even if we know it or not, because information keeps being disseminated.",
        "And there have been studies, here in CMU and in other places, about this dichotomy between what people say they would do in a certain scenario related to their privacy, and what they actually end up doing.",
