        "This week, Facebook unveiled some changes that let you restrict what you share to different sets of friends, right?",
        "Before you had just one friend, everybody's your friend, and now, we have different sets of friends.",
        "You can group people into, for instance, friends from work or friends from college and only let each - one see certain things.",

        "They thought that the profile was accessible by X people, while in fact we knew because we could check it was accessible by - in all the magnitude(ph), the larger amount of people.",
        "Also, there is what economists called the carousel of options.",
        "When you do too - when you give too many options to individuals, they end up - they tend to make a suboptimal choice, which means that control on your setting is a good thing.",
        "However, too granular control can end up a being a boomerang, because it can end up overtaking the ability of the user to really control his or her privacy.",
        "So, yes, control is good, but don't put all the responsibility on the user, because it is also an important issue what is their default setting of those controls.",

        "And that's one thing I start off the book saying, there's no such thing - if you put anything on the Internet - period, you've lost control over it.",

        "You can guide the site on what you - who you would like to see the information go to or not.",
        "But it is not secure.",
        "And even the terms of use of the Facebook, they come out and say that they're not responsible if it all goes missing.",

        "So there's no question people have to be aware of the risks that they face today on these kinds of - in these kinds of environments.",
        "I think, though, that we should really aspire to do somewhat better than this.",
