        "And I feel that there are lots of different forces in each of us which are pushing in different directions.",
        "All of us have a need to be public and to be recognized and to be known, and social networks like Facebook or MySpace satisfies that purpose.",
        "But the same people, who are posting about themselves, also have a need to be private.",
        "And, it's very complex.",
        "And to give you a sense of the complexity, some of the studies we have done in CMU show that when you - in experimental conditions, when you present information versus money trade-off to people, depending on how you frame the question, whether you frame it as, would you protect your data for X money, versus, would you sell your data for X money, people will make completely different decisions.",
        "So this means that there is an ability to manipulate the valuations of privacy, but that doesn't mean that people don't care.",
        "It means that, it's a very sensitive area in which different forces are at play.",
        "And also for policymaking, we need to try to understand which these forces are.",
