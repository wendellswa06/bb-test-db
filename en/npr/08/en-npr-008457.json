        "So what is going to be your argument, if you don't mind giving us a bit of a preview?",
        "Right.",

        "How would people know Bennett?",
        "I mean, if people are not familiar with the area, or perhaps they don't have kids who are headed to college or young women who are headed for college, how would they know Bennett?",

        "I mean, give us a sense of how people would know Bennett.",
        "Well, Bennet was a part of the civil rights movement.",

        "Bennett's history in terms of social justice dates back to 1937, when they protested the Carolina Theatre.",
        "And then Bennet was also known in 1958.",
        "We hosted Martin Luther King on our campus when other schools turned him away because of potential conflicts at that time.",
        "And then, in 1960, when the North Carolina freshman students sat in at the Woolworth's counter, Bennett women were behind the planning of that event.",
        "And so Bennett's history is rich in social justice and civic engagement, located in Greensboro, N.C.",
        "And in North Carolina, there are 10 HBCUs, and Bennett is the first all-women's institution among the HBCUs - the other one being Spelman.",
        "So Bennett has a rich history of contributions to the Greensboro community and to the U.S.",
        "That was Phyllis Worthy Dawkins, president of Bennett College."
