        "So I think before the writers' strike, it was overboard.",
        "But now, with the writers' strike, I think it gives them this sort of, you know open invitation.",

        "I mean, I keep hearing about Snoop's show which everybody seems to love, which is fascinating to me.",
        "And I think as long as you have those kind of shows where people are tuning in like that, it gives them even more reason to sort of do more and more.",
