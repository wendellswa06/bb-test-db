        "NPR's Maanvi Singh reports.",

        "It's common in Mumbai, where I grew up.",
        "My mother would use young, tender pods to make this delicious lentil stew called sambar.",

        "It used to be our favorite, especially with hot rice and a big dollop of fresh, homemade butter.",

        "I mean, oddly, you fussed over a lot of vegetables.",
        "You never fussed over drumstick sambar, which was very surprising.",
        "It turns out, all that moringa I gorged on as a child might have been healthier than I ever realized.",
        "Jed Fahey at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has been studying this tree for years.",
        "He says it grows wicked fast, it's drought resistant and it makes for good firewood.",
        "But more importantly...",
        "Its leaves are an extraordinarily good source of vitamin A and vitamin C and iron.",
        "The seed pods are also a great source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.",
        "All told, its nutritional value rivals that of milk, yogurt and eggs.",
        "That's why Fahey says its real value lies in its ability to feed poor communities across Asia and Africa, which is where it grows best.",
        "But lately, moringa supplements and energy bars are becoming fashionable in the U.S.",
        "Fahey encourages everyone to try it.",
        "It does taste great, like a green bean but better.",
        "I just think that we should remember that this is essentially a novelty at the moment.",
        "He and other scientists are still looking into its medicinal value.",
        "There's good evidence that moringa has some anti-diabetic and cancer prevention properties, but the research is still in its early stages.",
        "Meanwhile, my mom says, in southern India, some folks have other thoughts."

        "So you have Rick Scott, the Republican, up ahead of Democrat Bill Nelson by .15 percent.",
        "So that's going to head into a hand recount.",
        "According to Florida law, they're not going to, you know, count all of the ballots.",
        "That's not what a manual recount is.",
        "Those ballots are - they're just going to look at the ones where either no candidate was marked or multiple candidates were marked.",
        "And as of now, the deadline to finish that phase of the manual recount is Sunday.",
        "So at this point, you know, (laughter) I would say here you've already got a sense that the manual recount is starting.",
        "And there were a bunch of volunteers just filling the parking lot as I walked out to start that job.",
        "What about the race for governor?",
        "In the governor's race, no further recount has been ordered.",
        "Republican Ron DeSantis has maintained his lead over Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democrat.",
        "And he is above the threshold that would trigger an automatic hand recount.",

        "And then, lastly, in Broward County, we just got a note from my colleague Don Gonyea, who's over there, saying they also seem to (laughter) not have submitted a new number, in part because there was a large discrepancy between the original count and the recount.",
