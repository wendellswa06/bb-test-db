        "It's hard to see when you're in a little bit of pain, but as soon as I got home and I saw that he wasn't reacting to the drugs they are giving him, I was glad to be there.",
        "And I knew I was missing out on a lot of opportunities on the tennis court, and that being an Olympic year, I was going to miss out on the Olympics and all that kind of stuff, but I wouldn't trade that for anything.",
        "No matter what success I have on the tennis court, it doesn't compare to have enough time with my father.",
        "It sounds like this incident really helped you sort of reevaluate the role of tennis in your life.",
        "But I'm wondering if, at any point, you thought about doing something else.",
        "I thought about writing.",
        "And that one of the first - entered my mind to possibly write a book.",
        "But my main goal, when I thought about not playing tennis anymore, was that I was going to go back to Harvard and finish my education and my last few years there, and then figure out if there is anything else that can really take the place the tennis for me in terms of something I love to do and can enjoy throughout the rest of my life.",
        "So what did writing this book really do for you?",
        "Writing this book was actually extremely therapeutic for me because I'm someone that tends to keep things inside a little bit more and to get things out, it made me realize that it doesn't make you any weaker, it doesn't mean you're asking for help, it's just getting things out.",
        "Also, now, you're really at the top of your game in terms of your rankings.",
        "And I was wondering how you feel about your name being linked to someone like Arthur Ashe, a tennis legend who you met as a child?",
        "It's an honor every time I hear it.",
        "It's a reminder that all things you do on the court are to help you get a voice to help others later.",
        "And he garnered such a large voice by being the first African-American to win Wimbledon and win the U.S.",
        "Open.",
        "And for me, that all the things I've done so far, in terms of being an author and all the success I've had on the tennis court are giving me a smaller voice, but still a voice to make a difference, hopefully in cancer research, to help try and (unintelligible) for crippled children and to help inner-city kids learn to play tennis.",
        "So I try to do my best, but I know there's a long way to go between me and Arthur Ashe.",
        "Are there going to be, are we going to see more African-American players in the tennis world?",
        "It seems like it's been a long way between you and Arthur Ashe.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I hope there are going to be more, but it's tough to say.",
        "In terms of America, we're competing with basketball, football, baseball, hockey and there's just so many other sports.",
        "And, now, soccer is going to emerge with David Beckham coming over to the States."

        "It's possible that we're just competing with so many other sports.",
        "But the Williams sisters have done a great job and making it popular.",
        "And I'm doing my best and I hope to have even more success, so there are kids looking up saying that it is still a possibility especially since I started at Harlem Junior Tennis Program and the Williams sisters started in Compton just to show kids that you don't necessarily need to start in a country club.",
        "You can start anywhere and end up at the U.S.",
        "Open.",
        "What kind of role has race played into, you think, when you're in the circuit?",
        "I mean, what is that conversation like around you and I guess how do you feel about that?",
        "Well, I think it's gotten so much better now and I owe a lot to Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe for making it possible for me to go in there and not feel completely like a fish out of water.",
        "I know there are still some people that are stuck in the '60s and have somewhat outdated views of African-Americans, of tennis being a country club sport and should stay all-white or anything like that.",
        "So I know there's just a few people out there, but I feel like they're becoming much, much fewer.",
        "And it's rare that I encounter people like that, so I feel lucky to be alive in the time I am alive.",
        "And not only are you lucky to be healthy and alive, but it seems like you are lucky enough to be on the 2006 People magazine list of sexiest athletes.",
        "And I was wondering if you get concern that your looks are getting more attention than your tennis playing.",
        "No, I'm not too worried about that.",
        "It's, like, I said I got to rid of the dreadlocks and now, I'm just - I don't really do too much to get on that list.",
        "I just - what I've realized now and what I've been told by a lot of the veterans is the more matches you win, the more you'll be on those things.",
        "Well, I'm here to support you.",
        "Are you ready to try?",
        "I certainly am.",
        "And I think if I haven't been winning so many matches like I have, then I probably wouldn't be on those because it makes you somehow more attractive when you're winning, I guess.",
        "But to me, it's just kind of comical.",
        "I guess I still see myself as a five-foot tall kid with the back brace that entered high school.",
        "Well, those days are behind you.",
        "And thank you so much for joining us today to talk about your book.",

        "That's correct.",
        "When you looked at the opportunities that were available for you in corporate America and compare those with what were available through entrepreneurship, it seemed to me an easy decision to go out and try and create my own company, and the wealth that comes with it.",
        "What were you doing in corporate America?",
        "My previous job was with - as a partner of Accenture and Company.",
        "And my role was in strategic services where I gave advice to Fortune 500 companies on how to run their operations better and more efficiently.",
        "So what's your motivation, Al?",
        "Was it that you said, I can do this and I can do it probably better on my own, or was it because you felt that you had gone as far as that corporate opportunity was going to allow you to go?",
        "It was probably more that I saw I could do it on my own and succeed with it.",

        "You are advising others.",
        "You are working for someone else.",
        "In an ownership sort of mentality, you are working for yourself so the fruits of your labor and all of your hard work come to you and you're able to take capital and labor and put those together in a way that gives you a much greater economic power and wealth creation.",
        "And so that appealed to me.",

        "What is their mindset as they come out with that piece of paper?",
        "Is it to start their own business or is it to try to climb the corporate ladder first?",

        "The advantage of being in the corporate world is really understanding how to manage a business better, that hands-on before you actually step out there.",
        "And that helps with the success of many of our entrepreneurs, as well as building that capital.",
        "And one of the challenges of being a black entrepreneur is access to that capital.",
        "So being in the corporate world does give you those advantages.",
        "So most of them were saying, I'm going to step out there, and I'm going to look for that six-figure job.",
        "Short-term, but eventually I want to be my own boss.",
        "Is there, Al, along this line of race and capital, and trying to build a sense of financial security around yourself and your family, when you go out on your own, for those people that I know who have done this, they've had a rude awakening in terms of the quality of life that they're going to lead, even though they have that MBA piece of paper and that they are in charge of their own company.",
