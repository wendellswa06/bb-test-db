        "And he came to think that he had been put by God in the city for a reason; that that was his destiny - was to be there after the storm and make himself useful.",
        "Eventually, Zeitoun is arrested for - allegedly for looting.",
        "He's actually inside one of his own properties when some law enforcement officers come in.",
        "What happens to him at that point?",
        "Well, he and one of his tenants and a friend, and another man, who had been there using the phone, this rental property that he had was one of the few places in the city that had a working landline, so others had been using the phone there, too.",
        "And meanwhile, some law enforcement officers, a New Orleans police officer in particularly, had been casing them and had somehow thought that these four men using this house were involved in some vast looting operation.",
        "And so they broke into the home and arrested all four men and treated them very roughly with, you know, pointing machine guns at their head.",
        "And they were brought to an outdoor prison that had just been built after the storm.",
        "It was nicknamed Camp Greyhound."

        "Now, separately, they're not allowed to touch the fence around them, because if they we're to touch the fence, maybe the guards are afraid of them tipping over the cages or something like that.",
        "So guards with M16s are keeping them from touching the fence.",
        "If anybody touches the fence, they are brought out of the cage, handcuffed, and put face down on the cement and then tear-gassed directly in their face.",
        "They're doused with a bucket of water and then thrown back into the cage.",
        "And so it was very evocative of what we know of the war on terror and Guantanamo Bay.",
        "And there you have Zeitoun and three others that he was arrested with.",
        "They were put in their own separate cage and separated and given special attention.",
        "They were separated because?",
        "Well, we can only assume that this is because they were considered the big fish.",
        "They thought that they were terrorists.",
        "There was some suspicion that they were involved in a larger and possibly terroristic activity.",
        "And after three days at Camp Greyhound, he and hundreds of others were shuttled up on buses to Hunt Correctional Center, a maximum security prison in St. Gabriel, Louisiana.",
        "And there he did three weeks more, all the while denied any phone call or access to a lawyer, and never being told what exactly he was charged with and never seeing a public defender or a judge.",
        "And all the while feeling totally and completely helpless."

        "And FEMA had been folded into Homeland Security in 2003 and the focus and funding of FEMA really changed quite a bit at that point.",
        "A lot of the officers and soldiers that were sent to New Orleans after the storm, given the general political climate and also the images that everyone was seeing on TV, and these misrepresentations of the lawlessness and chaos and looting and murdering happening in the city.",
        "And so many of the National Guardsmen had come back from Iraq and Afghanistan.",

        "That's a good question.",
        "It's a true, many Greeks actually do feel like this government is passing on the hard decisions to them.",
        "They're basically saying, why are you chickening-out when I elected you to make the tough decisions?",
        "But from the government's perspective, what they were trying to do is to improve their negotiating position with the IMF and the eurozone.",
        "They were very unhappy with the insistence to increase hotel taxes and cut pensions, and they said, OK, we've given you everything and you won't even give us a little bit, so we're just going to blow everything up.",
        "The other thing is that the government doesn't feel like they have a popular mandate on austerity and on this bailout, and so what they wanted to do is to ask Greeks to own the reforms and to own even the austerity.",
        "That's the idea of the referendum, but at least in these first few days, it's backfired because European leaders feel blindsided and betrayed, then they already don't trust this government.",

        "They feel the ball is in Greece's court, that Athens has betrayed them basically.",
        "And her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who's with the Social Democratic Party, which in the past has sided with Greece and has often criticized Merkel's demand for austerity measures over stimulus, and he's saying he's just stunned by Athens's behavior, and he fully blames them for the negotiations falling apart.",
        "And at the same time, the German public - which has always been relatively sympathetic - for the first time, a majority are saying, goodbye Greece, you know, get out of the euro, we don't want this anymore.",
        "And it's a bit short-sighted perhaps because there are a lot of economic repercussions - and not just for Greece, but for the eurozone if Greece were to stand out.",
        "And as much as Chancellor Merkel and the other eurozone ministers don't really want Greece to leave, they are answering to their publics now.",
