        "Well, Sarah Jackson, research director at the Art Loss Register, thanks for joining us.",

        "Congressman, thanks for joining us.",
        "Thank you very much for having me today.",
        "A remarkable homecoming that we saw yesterday.",
        "You were there.",
        "Give us a sense of the feeling in the church.",
        "Well, it was unbelievable, extraordinary, a great sense of community, a family gathering.",
        "It was a reunion of the civil rights movement, with many entertainers, political leaders, four president, foreign dignitaries, a first lady of South Africa, several ambassadors, and it was a people's gathering.",
        "It was a people coming together to say goodbye to one of the most beautiful and charming and gifted women of our time.",
        "I was so moved.",
        "At times I cried, at other times I laughed.",
        "It was very hard and very difficult to say goodbye to Coretta Scott King.",
        "Congressman, you had a unique relationship with the two of them, Dr. King being a mentor, someone you looked up to.",
        "And of course, through the years you've become very close with Mrs. King.",
        "On a personal level, talk to me about what you will miss most.",
        "More than anything else, I will miss her late telephone call, late night calls.",
        "She would call me late at night, and we would talk, and especially right after the assassination of Dr. King, because she was planning the Martin Luther King Center.",
        "She would call and we would talk and talk.",
        "And one night she called and talked so long and so late I fell asleep on the telephone, and I heard myself snoring.",
        "And she fell asleep.",
        "And I woke up and I said, Mrs. King, Mrs. King; she was not there.",
        "And we would laugh about it.",
        "But she was so warm.",
        "She would always ask me, how is your mother?",
        "How is your father?",
        "How are your sisters and brothers?",
        "And every birthday, Ed, that I've had for the past 20 years she would send me a birthday card, a note or a signed book.",
        "And my birthday is coming up in about two weeks and I will not get a birthday card from her, and I will not have her to say, how are you doing, John?",
        "I remember during the march from Selma to Montgomery, 40 years ago, when we were walking up Highway 80 between Selma and Montgomery, Mrs. King and Dr. King took the cap off of Dr. King's head and said, John, you've been hurt.",
        "And Dr. King put this cap on my head and Coretta nodded in agreement; she said, you need to wear that cap to protect your head."

        "I can hear the emotion, Congressman, and I've known you and shared these stories for many, many years, but I can feel it today from you.",
        "Let me ask you this, because you were so close to them.",
        "So much has been made of what occurred yesterday and whether the funeral became too politicized.",
        "I'm curious how you saw what went on in relation to that yesterday.",
        "Well, I think what happened was fitting and appropriate.",
        "It was not just a funeral, but it was also an opportunity to say what Coretta Scott King stood for and what her husband stood for, and what they gave so much of their talent and time to build a movement.",
        "And I think the people that spoke, some of the people that spoke especially, President Carter, Rev.",
        "Joseph Lowery, and some others, wanted to restate what Mrs. King was all about.",
        "She was a woman of peace, non-violence and love; and she wanted to look out for those that had been left out and left behind; look out for the poor.",
        "And I think some of the speakers wanted to remind the people that were there in power of what it was all about.",
        "You had the president of the United States, President Bush, and you had the Secretary of State there, Condoleezza Rice, and they needed to get the message, and people around the country needed to get that message, what Coretta Scott King was all about and what Martin Luther King Jr. meant and what the civil rights movements meant and continue to mean.",
        "So those that criticized it for being a stage that others take, I suspect your take would be that Mrs. King understood the importance of getting the word out, and when you have this opportunity, you take it.",
        "Well, Mrs. King would be very pleased and proud of the position and the statements that people made because this was an opportunity to say, once again, to those at the highest level of power, to those that lead this government and the leaders of this government and the leaders in the world, to put back on the American agenda the needs and concerns of all Americans and the citizens of the world.",
        "Congressman, I have to ask you this: We've lost so many giants over the course of this year in particular but over the last few years.",
        "Do you believe that the movement is in good hands, is stable enough with the people who are following these giants?",
        "Well, I--it is my sincere belief and feeling that the movement is in very good hands.",
        "There's a cadre of young people on the move.",
        "Some are elected officials, and others are in the entertainment world and the business.",
        "But I'm not worried.",
        "I'm not over-concerned that we will have people getting out there and doing what I call getting in the way and taking the necessary leadership because they too have been inspired by the work of Mrs. King and Dr. King and others, so you have new leadership at the NAACP at the National Urban League, as SCLC, and you have more than--well, 43 members of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
        "There are many, many local and indigenous leaders that are on the rise.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Lest we forget the gains that we have made so far.",
        "Congressman, I thank you so much.",
        "I know it's a difficult time for you, but we wanted to be able to talk to you because I knew of your relationship with the two of them, and we appreciate your time as always.",
        "Well, thank you very much.",
        "A number of people have gone back and looked at the evidence and discovered that in fact there are a number of very straightforward things about the conduct of those studies that made it likely that the drug would fail when it went into people."

        "Until late last month, Pettyjohn and other workers hadn't seen many delta smelts.",
        "It's a two-inch long endangered fish that smells like a cucumber and only lives in the delta.",
        "Then suddenly they got more than 200 in a week.",
        "Bill Jennings, with the California Sport Fishing Protection Alliance, says the once prevalent smelt are on the precipice of extinction.",
        "They've reached numbers to where we can name them rather than count them.",
        "He and other environmentalists blame the smelts' decline on the havoc caused by pumping so much water to supply farms and cities to the south.",
        "State officials say there are other factors - pesticides and invasive species.",
        "Regardless of the cause, Ryan Broddrick, head of the California Department of Fish and Game, says the state couldn't continue operating the pumps and risk killing more smelt.",
        "Our best information is we have a very low population.",
        "So every one of these fishes is critical."
