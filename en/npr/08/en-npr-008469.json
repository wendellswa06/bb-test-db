        "It was a long shot, and it turns out the odds were worse than he knew.",
        "Most of the experimental ALS drugs had undergone very perfunctory testing in animals and federal health officials didn't realize that.",
        "Story Landis, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes, says her institute plunked down $20 million to test one of these drugs in more than 400 ALS patients.",
        "We moved into a clinical trial based on a preclinical study using a small number of mice, and what we discovered in the trial was that the particular compound was of no benefit to the patients.",
        "So afterward scientists went back to take a second look at the mouse experiments that were the basis for the human study.",
        "The results couldn't be replicated when the study was actually done.",
        "Landis has thought a lot about how these last chance patients ended up in this untenable situation.",
        "There's not one single answer, but she says part of the explanation relates to a growing issue in biomedical science, the mad scramble for scarce research dollars.",
        "The field has become hypercompetitive.",
        "Federal funding for health research has declined by about 20 percent over the past decade when you factor in inflation.",
        "Many excellent grant proposals get turned down, simply because there's not enough money to go around.",
        "So Landis says scientists are tempted to oversell weak results.",
        "Getting a grant requires that you have an exciting story to tell, that you have preliminary data and that you have published.",
        "And in a rush, to be perfectly honest, to get a wonderful story out on the street in a journal, and preferably with some publicity to match, scientists can cut corners.",
        "According to a research paper published earlier this year, corner-cutting turned out to be the rule, rather than the exception in animal studies of ALS.",
        "Stefano Bertuzzi, executive director of the American Society for Cell Biology, says it's partly because there's little reward for scientists to take the time to go back and verify results from other labs."

        "If I have done an experiment and I tried something, and I find out that it doesn't work or it's a negative result of some sort, for the scientific community to know that is very important.",

        "But you know, there's one thing.",
        "We met you at a conference several months ago here in Los Angeles where people with huge budgets for advertising were getting together to talk to TV show producers, and what I learned was that these advertisers - many of them - love sitcoms because they have family values and that's what advertisers want.",
        "They want families to watch TV together, so they love these kinds of shows.",
        "They do love these kinds of shows.",
        "And when you think about it, it is a very small way of looking at what families are.",
        "In reality, families are much more complex, they have much more complex problems.",
        "And dealing with families in dramas often reveals lots of stuff that's comfortable and uncomfortable for advertisers to want to be around environmentally.",
        "Well, are advertisers going to be happy with switching to reality or are they going to look for something else?",
        "First of all, they're not going to have much of a choice.",
