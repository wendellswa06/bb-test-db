        "Goldberg said the award says vastly, vastly, more about the Nobel Committee than it does about Obama.",
        "All Obama has done is offer words the Nobel Committee likes to hear and an image of America they like to see.",
        "So who, in his estimation, should have gotten the prize instead?",
        "Goldberg said, there are real peace activists and dissidents out there whose dungeons will stay just as cold and dark for another year because of this.",
        "Indeed, the news comes during a year when the Iranian people rose up against tyranny and were crushed.",
        "Surely someone in Iran, maybe the Iranian protestors in general, could have benefited more from receiving the prize than a president who, so far, has done virtually nothing concrete for world peace.",
