        "I admire his efforts toward Middle East peace, but the prize seems very premature.",
        "What has he done?",
        "Obama's work on the Middle East, mostly through Senator Mitchell's efforts, are sensible, but haven't produced any results yet.",
        "He goes on to say the president's efforts on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation are important, but they are purely an aspiration.",
        "In other areas, Kristof writes, Obama has done little.",
        "He's been largely absent on Sudan, Congo, Burma and global poverty and health issues and does not have a USAID administrator.",
        "I think he has the right instincts on these issues and expect him to get engaged, Kristof says, but shouldn't the Nobel Peace Prize have a higher bar than high expectations, especially when there are so many people who have worked for years and years on the frontlines, often in difficult situations to make a difference to the most voiceless people in the world?",

        "And giving him that kind of award at this time, to me, it just seems incredibly strategic on their behalf.",
