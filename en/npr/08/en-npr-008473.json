        "Well, coming up with an actual solution or a remedy to ridding the hives of the parasite will be one of the last steps, after really understanding how the parasites behave.",
        "One of the things that we want to look at is if the bees that are actually in inside the hive, if they are becoming parasitized.",
        "If a large number of bees within a hive became parasitized that could likely cause the collapse of a colony.",
        "So, we have a lot of investigation to do as far as what bees within a hive are being parasitized, and what the overall effect is on the hive.",
        "So that's one of the many questions we have left to answer on this new parasite.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It was the opinion of our editorial board, but I did write it.",
        "And the gist of our editorial was basically, as Joe said, he certainly looks like a president.",

        "Felice Belman, what about you?",
        "You know, one thing that changed not just since '06 but, say, in the past 10 years is the growing number of voters who are registered undeclared, which means that in a primary, they can vote on one side or another.",

        "I think that some of the independents, and Felice is right, they're all over the lot, but some of them are looking at Ron Paul, of all people, to form a Libertarian candidate.",
        "I wanted to ask you about Ron Paul, the Libertarian running on the Republican side.",
        "And there's a lot of talk that he could do very well in New Hampshire.",
