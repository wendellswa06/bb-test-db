        "Well, his colleague, this other eminent professor with a brain tumor, eventually committed suicide, we're told - this happened many years ago - under the threat of losing his sense of self gradually, he chose to kill himself.",
        "But there was another student in that class when you heard that story, who objected.",
        "That's right, a guy named Tom(ph) who I didn't really know well.",
        "And I think, you know, all of us have these people in our lives that we don't - wouldn't really call friends, but we know them to say hi to.",
        "We may end up being - maybe end up out to lunch with them in a big group.",
        "And I was astonished about 10 years later when I ran into somebody who said that Tom, this fellow in the class with me, himself had a brain tumor - an inoperable one, and that Tom only had four months to live.",
        "And would suffer the kind of brain loss, the memory loss, excuse me, that - it's the kind of amnesia, as you described it, that we see in soap operas, you suddenly can't remember your past at all.",
        "Right, so neuroscientists call this kind of memory loss retrograde amnesia.",
        "It's where you no longer have memory of your past, but you can still form new memories.",
        "It's a particularly cruel kind of disease or disorder, because you know that you have a tumor, and you know you're dying, and you know that you have no memory.",
        "You went to see him.",
        "I did.",
        "So, you know, the interesting thing about this story is that back when we were students, Tom had objected to our professor's characterization of memory and the self being so intimately linked.",
        "Tom shot up his hand and said, you know, well, that's crazy.",
        "Your self is a lot of things, and your memory has got nothing to do with it.",
        "I went to go visit Tom, although I didn't know him well, when he only had a few months left to live.",
        "And I met him in his apartment, and the first thing he said was, he said: Forgive me for asking this, but I do this with everybody.",
        "He said: Can you tell me your name again and how it is that I know you?",
        "And I found that very chilling, and I said - I told him my name, and I said we'd gone to college together.",
        "And in fact, some years later we ended up working at the same research company in Palo Alto.",
        "And it was this surreal conversation because Tom had no recognition of the events of his life.",
        "He just wanted to gather it all together.",
        "And then the most awkward thing happened.",
        "I mean, picture this.",
        "I don't really - I'd never had a conversation with him over a 10-year period, that lasted longer than a couple of minutes.",
        "And sitting in his apartment, he looked at me, and he said - he asked: So were we friends?",
        "And I just stared at him.",
        "And I started thinking, well, would it be rude if I told him I've never really thought of him as a friend?"

        "I mean, you know, if he's thinking of me as a friend, and I deny it, would that hurt his feelings?",
        "And I'm thinking all of this.",
        "He interrupted my thoughts, and he said: That's OK.",
        "He said: There's this gray area in human relations, right.",
        "We meet people, we see them every day, we say hello, we don't really know them.",
        "And with all of that, he put me at ease.",
        "There was this kindness in him that was really pronounced.",
        "Back in that classroom, what he'd said to the teacher who said loss of memory would erase the sense of identity, the sense of self, he says: No, we have things that are separate from that.",
        "Your tastes are not going to be affected by the loss of your memory.",
        "You're still going to be who you were.",
        "Right, Tom felt that, and back then, it's not what we believed.",
        "Now, neuroscientists have had a lot of cases of this, where we lose our memory for specific events of our lives, we lose the ability to remember oh, I'm somebody who likes chocolate ice cream, I'm somebody who's generous, I'm somebody who's shy.",
        "We don't remember the episodes that give rise to those personality traits, and we may not even remember that we have them, but we still exhibit them.",
        "So what is the relationship between memory and self?",
        "Well Neal, it goes back to John Locke, the philosopher who said our memories of our past are part of what gives us a sense of identity.",
        "Now what do we mean by that?",
        "Well, the University of California Santa Barbara psychologist Stan Klein has distinguished a number of different components of what we mean by self.",
        "And it's a bit confusing, isn't it?",
        "We talk about self-control and self-esteem, self-regulation, self-improvement, self-image.",
        "Well, Klein distinguishes seven components of the self, and I'd like to talk with you about four of them.",
        "OK.",
        "First there's self-awareness.",
        "That's the ability we have to recognize ourselves in a mirror or to recognize the parts of our body and know that they are ours.",
        "And separate from that we have a sense of agency or responsibility.",
        "You recognize that your body belongs to you and that you more or less control it, right.",
        "OK."
