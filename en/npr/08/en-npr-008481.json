        "Well the real question is, will Latinos vote for Barack Obama in the primary?",
        "And the answer is yes.",
        "And based on past elections where African-Americans have won and they've won because they've had a significant share of the Latino electorate.",
        "I can tell you that Dinkins would not be mayor had the Latino electorate had not supported him in New York.",
        "Clearly, the senator would not be Senator - Obama - in Illinois had the Latino electorate not participated and voted for him.",
        "And obviously in Los Angeles, Bradley Texas Kirk (ph) ran for the United States Senate in '06.",
        "He did not win, but 78 percent of the electorate that's Latino supported him.",
        "So I think there's two realities.",
        "One is, are there tensions?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Will the Latino electorate support Senator Obama?",
        "I think so.",
        "Well the question is, will he garner more than what was taken in 2000 and in '04 by the Democrats versus the Republicans?",
        "We think that he will get at least 65 percent of the Latino electorate and the question is, will his message and the resources that he has resonate with the Latino electorate on the fine issues that matter to the Latino community.",
        "Mark, I'm going to get to you in a second, but I know Oscar has something to jump in.",
        "Yeah, Lydia made a very good point, but I think a key thing to remember is in Dallas and Houston you have fairly large black populations that have historically had those as well as Latino.",
        "And the question is, will his message and the resources that he has resonate with the Latino electorate on the five issues that matter to the Latino community?",
        "Mark, I'm going to get to you in a second.",
        "But I know Oscar has something jumping in.",
        "Yeah, Lydia made a very good point.",
        "But I think a key thing to remember is, in Dallas and Houston you have fairly large black populations and have historically had those as well as Latino populations.",
        "So there is a history of communities being aware of each other and knowing each other.",
        "Once you get to San Antonio, where I'm from and where I grew up, from San Antonio to Los Angeles, all those Latino communities have very small black populations until you get to Los Angeles.",
        "And so you have a huge swath of the Southwest where there are populations where the Latino community doesn't know black people as well.",
        "And I think that's a factor a little bit.",
        "Mark, let's turn to the Republican nominee.",
        "You know, we see right now polls are saying that Senator McCain would get roughly 29 percent of the Latino vote, versus Obama getting about 62 percent.",
        "How does that sound to you?",
        "And more than that, you know, whether or not you think those numbers are good, because polls are always polls, how do you think Senator McCain's record plays with different Latino populations?",
        "Well first, in terms of the polling, it sounds like a reasonable number, but I'm not sure we ourselves at the Pew Hispanic Center have not done any recent polling to do a horserace question between McCain and Obama.",
        "We hope to have some numbers on that soon, but not yet.",
        "In terms of how he's done in the primaries, though, he was primarily - most of the states where there was a large enough Latino sample to determine how Latinos voted, he did win the Latino vote.",
        "So for example in Florida, he won 54 percent of the Latino vote.",
        "And so he got the most votes of anybody.",
        "In a place like Arizona, of course, he did very, very well, because he's a senator from Arizona.",
        "So I think that there's some room here for McCain to do well with Latinos and with - particularly with Latino Republican voters.",
        "But I would stress that what we've seen in our own polling is that the last two years, Latinos have begun to change their party allegiance away from the Republican Party and towards the Democratic Party.",
        "In November of - I'm sorry, October of 2007, we found that 57 percent of our poll respondents said they identified as Democrats, whereas only 23 percent identified as Republicans.",
        "So it's going to be interesting to see how well McCain does with Latinos overall."

        "Lydia, I want to play you a little bit of something from the news recently.",
        "Nydia Velazquez is the Democratic congresswoman from Brooklyn.",
        "She represents New York's 12th congressional district, and she's been a strong Clinton supporter.",
        "Here's some of what she had to say last week after Obama clinched the nomination.",
        "Even in the early primaries, to the last primary that was conducted in Puerto Rico, she won overwhelmingly.",

        "In New York, 72 percent.",
        "In Puerto Rico, it was overwhelming.",
        "In Texas.",
        "So something wasn't working or is not working.",
        "And I think that she would be able to help him in that regard.",
        "And so, in that sense, she seems to be advocating - the congresswoman, that is - for an Obama-Clinton ticket.",
        "Do you have any sense of whether that would be viewed as appealing by some of the demographics you track?",
        "Well, the Latino electorate loves the Clintons.",
        "That's why Hillary did so well.",
        "But I think at the end of the day, they're going to be looking at the five issues that matter to them, and I think they equally matter.",
        "Education, jobs, the economy, healthcare, the war.",
        "Eighty-one percent of the Latino electorate five days before the Texas primary overwhelmingly said that they wanted the troops to come home.",
        "Thirty-four percent said that they have someone actively live in Iraq, and so they understand the difference between the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism.",
        "And last but not least, the immigration question as you know.",
        "Latino voters who vote are citizens, so the immigration question frankly has become a litmus test about how they will be governed.",
        "Obama's position in California on the drivers' license and then moving to Texas, saying he would not have a wall, and it would instead be a virtual wall, which all three candidates originally had supported a wall, is a good step forward.",
        "Now on McCain's side, McCain has always had a good history on the immigration issue, but because he has to appeal to the right of his constituency, his base, he's going to more conservative.",
        "And once Latinos understand that he is also Mr. English only, I think even Republicans in Florida who would normally vote for the Republican nominee might hesitate.",
        "So it's going to be an interesting election cycle.",
        "I do anticipate Latinos will come home, either Democrats who vote for the Democratic nominee, and Republicans will consider McCain.",
        "The question is, will they use the resources, the money and the message to take them each to a homerun?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "We're just turning on the gloves right now.",
        "And you have to calibrate it to the user's hands.",
        "For the - for Obama, it's going to have to be more than 65 percent of the Latino electorate in order to stay on game.",
        "And obviously, it is broken down state by state.",
        "The election is won by 270 electoral votes.",
        "Latinos reside in states that make up 222 electoral votes, some of which are influential like New Mexico, and others who are - I'm sorry, decisive like New Mexico or other places like Florida or California or Texas, where we are the deciding vote.",
        "Let me get Oscar in here.",
        "California, of course, one of the big plums.",
        "What do you see ahead for California?",
        "Well, you know, Lydia mentioned that she thought that Obama would get at least 65 percent.",
        "I think the Hispanic vote, the latest Gallup poll said that he's tracking at about 62 percent.",
        "I'm wondering if he actually needs to do much better than that.",
        "I mean, if he's at 65, 62, somewhere in there, that means that McCain is approaching Bush numbers in terms of what he got from the Latino vote, which was 40 percent if not higher.",
        "I think Obama may have to do 75 percent among Latinos, and I don't know if that's possible, but he may need to do that to offset, you know - if he doesn't have Clinton as his running mate, he may need something to offset some of the white voters that he may lose.",
        "Mark, quickly, you know, there was - the whole demographics issue can be played so many ways.",
        "And in some senses, the census results - you know, there was this thing, oh, there's more Latinos than blacks, and there's this rivalry, whether or not it was true or imagined.",
        "Is there any sense that the hopes and dreams of Latinos have been deferred a bit because the focus is on African-Americans this time around?"
