        "They couldn't get their own side together to avoid a primary.",
        "The Democrats were vastly outspent by the Republicans and then turned around and wasted at least $4 million or more picking the candidate when they should have been running with that candidate all the way through.",
        "I think there are some long term lessons here, although I don't quite draw the same conclusions that David does.",
        "I think that the anti-government idea is still very strong and I think liberals have really been too reluctant to just come right out and say they believe in government, they believe government can do good things.",

        "That also includes a willingness to reform government.",

        "But I agree with David on one thing, which is I don't think this is a good preview for November.",

        "Europe's problem is the same as it's been since, you know, 1468: There are too many countries in too small a space.",
        "And you can try to cover that over with a single currency, but if they don't have the same fiscal policies, if they don't have the same values, if they don't have the same rule of law, the political values, it's not going to work.",
        "And essentially they're running into that reality, and we're seeing the Germans not want to subsidize people who haven't done reform.",

        "Should he be taking more of a lead?",
        "Is the U.S.",

        "We don't have a lot of stray money sitting around, as we might have had, say, in 1999 to help them out of their mess.",
        "And so I think we're as involved as we can be.",
        "But when you were listening, we were listening earlier to Eric Cantor and the president, we have two parties living in two completely different economic worlds.",
        "Cantor saying this is all about cutting the debt, and President Obama gave a very nice lecture on Keynesian economics and what happens when every government cuts at the same time."
