        "Well, we are hearing reports of pressure and intimidation ahead of tomorrow's vote.",
        "Have you heard anything about anti-Russian protesters disappearing or being silenced or local journalists being threatened?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That's happening all over.",
        "I've talked to a number of people who say that they now, they go to a pro-Ukrainian meeting, they have to use code words and they have to take different routes home.",
        "They always call home and sometimes they don't make it.",
        "There's been a number of reports of people disappeared, people arrested.",
        "The difference between arrested and disappeared is really whether the authorities admit to it or not.",
        "And interestingly, yesterday, we were at a very large rally of Crimean Tatars who have come out - again, this is a Muslim minority group - they've come out against the referendum.",
        "And they were out in force.",
        "As they were stretched out along the road, there were a number of cars coming by honking, going di-doot, do-doot, you know, in support.",
        "Now, there were a number of cars honking their antagonism as well.",
        "But it felt more like a protest.",
        "It felt more like an expression, which has been sorely lacking in Crimea.",
        "Secretary Kerry has described the referendum tomorrow as a backdoor annexation that would be a breach of international law.",
        "What do you anticipate will happen once the results are announced?",
        "Once the results are announced, and it's fairly expected, according to poll numbers, that people will vote to join Russia.",
        "Now, what does that mean to join Russia?",
        "Well, apparently, according to the new Crimean prime minister, that means that within the year, Crimea will be part of Russia.",
        "How that's going to happen logistically, you know, nobody really knows, because there's a huge number of logistical challenges, but they almost don't matter because it's really a question of what President Putin's going to do.",
        "There have been violent clashes, as you know, Greg, between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian demonstrators in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk in the last couple of days.",
        "What can you tell us about that?",
        "If you talk to some people, they will blame pro-Russian provocateurs that are actually coming in from Russia.",
        "They say that busloads of thugs are really causing this.",
        "Other people dispute that.",
        "And this also could be clashes which are inspired simply by Russia's show of force in Crimea.",
        "And in Kharkov, last night there were two people shot, apparently outside the office of a far-right group.",
        "Look, this is the big fear of this conflict, that it would spread from Crimea.",
        "And the Ukrainian interim president is not dampening those fears.",
        "He says that he looked at the Russian buildup here in Crimea.",
        "He says that Russia is ready to invade Ukraine at any moment.",
        "And when I talked to some soldiers on the border there, they said, yes.",

        "This morning, we're going to bring you everything you need to know about not one, Steve, not one but two different sets of high-stakes negotiations taking place in Washington today.",
        "OK.",
        "Republican and Democratic leaders are meeting to discuss border security.",

        "In other words, will he just settle for China buying more soybeans, or will he insist that China makes these structural changes?",
        "And then, if the Chinese do agree to do that, how do you verify that?",
        "Right.",
        "And, of course, all this is happening against this backdrop of, you know, the Chinese CFO of Huawei was arrested and all this international - or intellectual property theft that you referred to.",
        "I mean, are they - is the U.S.",
        "delegation expecting some kind of win out of this, or is this an incremental development?",
        "Well, nobody says that this will be easy.",
        "The big question about the Huawei indictments is will that become a bargaining chip in these trade talks?",
        "Or to put it another way, how does it not become a bargaining chip?",
