        "And this would be a national health program that would, as she said, replace the private health insurance system.",
        "Here's how she described it.",

        "Well, listen; the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.",
        "So her idea is that everyone gets a Medicare card just like the one that my mother has, and doctors have to sign an agreement each year to be part of the program.",
        "This is the same as when people say single payer."

        "In his proposal, Senator Sanders didn't put in a pay for, but he outlined some options.",
        "He said that overall as a country, we spend $3.2 trillion a year on health care, and that includes Medicare, Medicaid and our private insurance system.",
        "And he says Medicare for all will cost a lot less.",
        "Another analysis I've seen says the federal government will pay $32 trillion over 10 years to pay for Medicare for all.",
        "So the pay-for proposals mostly include maybe a tax increase on employers, similar to Social Security tax.",
        "One proposal is a 4 percent tax on everyone's income.",
        "There's basically tax increases on higher earners.",
        "It's a way of increasing taxes and replacing what we spend right now on health care premiums.",
        "Since then, as Steve noted, though, Kamala Harris' campaign backed down a bit on this and said, wait a second, she also might be willing to consider other more moderate proposals instead of an altogether single-payer system, clearly indicating this is a political bugaboo for Democrats.",
        "It's not like they're all in line for this.",
        "Yeah.",

        "OK, so when you listen to those voices of voters from around the country, what are you hearing?",

        "How do those people try to win over these voters?",
