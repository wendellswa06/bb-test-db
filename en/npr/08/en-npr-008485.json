        "So basically all the things that people wanted under the tree, we were spending money on.",
        "But what's most interesting, I think, is to look at the trends where we're shopping online, because that is both heartening for people and I think troubling for a lot of retailers.",
        "Well, first, when we hear of an increase that's about 15 percent online purchases, what does that translate to in terms of dollars?",
        "Well, basically online sales now make up about six to seven percent of overall retail sales.",
        "So it's still a very small percentage of the pie.",

        "What's extraordinary about it?",
        "Well, what's extraordinary - and there are so many ways to describe it - remarkable, unprecedented - is the fact that you have the head of the executive branch, the president of the United States, being openly critical of one of his Cabinet appointees.",
        "It makes one wonder - it certainly makes me wonder, well, you know, if you believe the attorney general is not stepping up and doing the job right, then why not make a change?",
        "My sense is that this constant criticism of Jeff Sessions, I think, I fear, makes the president look somewhat weak and that, really, if you're so unsatisfied with this performance of his cabinet secretary, then why don't you make a change?",
        "There are obviously good reasons why he shouldn't make a change, in my judgment, which leads me to the conclusion then perhaps it would be best if the president did not make such open critical comments about the attorney general for several reasons, two of them being that - well, I can think of three.",
        "First of all, I think Jeff Sessions, probably more than any other cabinet secretary, has done more to promote the president's policies and priorities in the law enforcement area.",
        "Secondly, Jeff Sessions loves this job and is going to stay in this job and has no intention of quitting.",
        "And I think he's worried about the future of the department and wants to protect the department."

        "Can you remember anything like that?",
        "No.",
        "There may have been private conversations, private criticism by a president and a private response - a strong response by an attorney general, but obviously, this is - this dialogue is very public.",

        "And if, in fact, people believe that the Department of Justice has been politicized, even though the criticism is leveled solely at the leadership - but, you know, it just filters down - I think it does undermine the public's confidence in the entire department.",

        "I think it also is something that may be troubling in terms of job growth, and especially when you look at commercial retail.",
        "Basically what's happened in the real estate sector suggests that perhaps this is still a country that is, quote, \"\"over-stored.\"\" There are chances we're going to see more store closures, as more Americans feel comfortable just doing a lot of their shopping by computer.",
        "Because shopping online employs fewer people on the other end and it requires less high-rent commercial retail space."
