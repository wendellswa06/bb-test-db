        "That's spent on outfitting them, paying them, housing them, protecting them?",
        "Right.",
        "And very little of it is actually pay because their basic pay is actually not included in the war budget.",
        "It is really the cost of supporting our troops there and all the contractor support that goes to help them, to feed them and all of the munitions that get used up, you know, just in fighting the war.",
        "A large region for the difference is that the infrastructure, although it's not great in Iraq, in Afghanistan, it's much, much worse.",

        "The next day, somebody would come back and say, oh, that wasn't 48 people, that was actually 22.",
