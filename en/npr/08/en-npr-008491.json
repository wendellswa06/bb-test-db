        "The most recent and well-documented evidence of this was in 1989, when the exit polls in the Virginia governor's race showed Doug Wilder winning by 10 points.",
        "So as the voters were coming out of the polling places, and they were being asked who they voted for, by a margin of 10 percent they said they supported Doug Wilder."
