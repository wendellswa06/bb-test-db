        "He must not have been clipping into some of the iron rungs.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Well, if you're not a climber, you can use the via ferrata to get high in the mountains.",
        "Basically, you've got this ladder that you're going up.",
        "But typically you have a harness on and a little lanyard, and you clip the lanyard to this iron rung every three or four feet so that if you were to fall, you can't fall to the ground.",
        "But he apparently fell from 60 feet and hit the ground.",
        "So, the actual incident is kind of obscure.",
        "I don't know what happened."
