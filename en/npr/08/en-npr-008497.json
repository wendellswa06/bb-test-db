        "Well, jaywalking is, I think, separate from some of the other policing efforts that have been done.",
        "But one of the things I've said is we can't simply criminalize homelessness.",
        "But we've fought on the streets with - against homeless advocate; a battle that is losing for both of us.",
        "When they win, and we can't clear a sidewalk, no more person has been housed.",
        "So your talking about legal battles between homeless advocates and the LAPD?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We've been sued every single time Los Angeles comes up with a new policy to clear the streets.",
        "And that can be very frustrating for businesses that have, you know, dozens of homeless people camped out.",
        "Advocates have, rightfully so, taken us to court and saying, well, if there's no housing for them, where else do you expect them to be?",
        "We're trying to change that paradigm by saying we will provide that housing and those outreach workers, and then, in turn, it is fair for us to be able to make sure that we have clean rights of way.",
        "Mayor Garcetti, your first term ends in 2017 in two years.",
        "How do you think voters should judge whether or not you've succeeded on this at that point?",
        "Well, you know, I'm wary of trying to declare success on homelessness.",
        "And a lot of people said, hey, as a mayor, don't talk about homelessness, don't take on this challenge.",
        "You can never solve it.",
        "You can never declare victory.",
        "There's no votes there.",
        "People just want the homeless cleaned up and moved from the community.",
        "You know, very complicated things drive people to be homeless.",
        "But if we can say the number is going down, and if we can say that we're housing, permanently, a record number of people, each one of those lives is a life transformed.",
        "And that's well worth the work, and I hope that folks will look at that as the record of what we've accomplished.",
        "That's Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti.",
        "Mayor Garcetti, thanks very much.",
        "You're very welcome.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So that's the mayor's plan, with an emphasis on permanent supportive housing for homeless people in Los Angeles.",

        "He's CEO of Union Rescue Mission, which provides shelter and services on Skid Row.",
        "Reverend Bales, thanks for joining us.",

        "I'm thrilled that we're making a down payment on making a huge difference in homelessness.",
        "And I really heard from him in the interview.",
        "He's decided to ignore those who say don't deal with homelessness.",
        "I'm happy about it.",
        "I just think there needs to be some guidance on encouraging the mayor on how that money is spent.",
        "And what would that guidance be from you?",
        "Well, let's take the $100 million.",
        "I would assert that six years ago when the city shifted all the resources to Housing First and Home for Good, emergency shelters lost support, transitional housing lost support.",
        "And the resources went to the few and housed the few, but they left the many out in the cold.",
        "So I would actually say that my hope is it's going to be a multipronged approach.",
        "And can you talk about what you're seeing with the people you work with right now?",

        "And the police have backed off, and except for serious, violent crime, they hesitate to intervene.",
        "So it's almost impossible for a person in a wheelchair like me to navigate without going into the streets.",
        "You mentioned the fact that you're in a wheelchair.",
        "This is something that's been held up as an example of how bad conditions are on Skid Row.",
        "You developed an infection in your foot.",
        "We visited with you about a year ago, and it's become even worse since then.",
        "Can you tell us how that's gone?",
        "Right.",
        "So what happened is I did a water walk on Skid Row, and I had a wound on my foot, but I had a boot on, so it was somewhat protected.",
        "But I have low immunity because of a kidney transplant.",
        "I did a water walk on, I think, a Thursday or Friday.",
        "By Monday, as I flew out to Raleigh, I couldn't stand in line in the Southwest.",
        "And by the time I arrived home, I had a super-high fever, and I had a blood infection all the way to my waist.",
        "And my doctor quickly said - he asked me where I worked.",
        "I told him, and he said you got this from Skid Row.",
        "Reverend Bales, you've worked on Skid Row for quite a while.",
        "Nearly 11 years, yes.",
        "Yeah, and I'm curious how confident you are that this latest initiative will overcome the impediments that you've seen to fixing this problem."
