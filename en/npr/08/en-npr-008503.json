        "As we mentioned Senators Obama and Clinton spoke this morning at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, the conference being held right down the street from NPR as a matter of fact.",
        "After their speeches the two run into each other backstage, and back on Capitol Hill Senator Obama summed up the conversation they had with NPR's David Welna.",
        "I just spoke to her today, and we're going to be having a conversation in the coming weeks.",
        "I am very confident about how unified the Democratic Party is going to be to win in November.",
        "You know it wasn't a detailed conversation as I said, I am very confident about how we're going to be able to bring this party together.",
        "And David Welna then went on to ask Senator Obama about what's it like to be the first African American presidential candidate of a major party.",
        "Obviously it's an enormous honor.",
        "It's very humbling.",
        "You think about the - all the people who had to knock down barriers for me to walk through this door and the challenges they went through were so much more difficult and so much more severe.",
        "And the risks they took were so much greater.",
        "I've heard from a number of people already that - both black and white that their kids seven, eight, nine years old, take for granted now that of course a black can run for president, of course a woman can run for president.",
        "There's a matter of factness to it that I think bodes well for the future.",
        "And that's Senator Obama in a conversation with NPR's David Welna on Capitol Hill following his speech at the AIPAC conference earlier today, and as he told his conversation with Senator Hillary Clinton who is also in Washington to speak there, and to attend to her day job as a senator from the State of New York.",
        "And Ron Elving that reflection there at the end reminds us just what a historic night it was last night.",
        "Reporters go all through their lives asking the same questions over and over of largely the same people.",
        "And it's rare that you get to ask a question you've never asked before.",
        "But there was a chance for David Welna running into the senator in the hallway to say what does it feel like to be the first African-American nominated for president by a major party.",
        "And he could have just as easily been asking that question of course to Hillary Clinton as the first woman."

        "And fascinating either way.",
        "Nevertheless let's get to the politics of what they were doing this morning, maybe not Senator Clinton so much, but Senator Obama sort of revising his diplomatic plans to speak with Iran.",
        "Yes, and this has been, if you will, a policy in evolution right from the first time that it came up during one of the debates, one of the earliest debates between all the Democratic candidates back when they needed a stage as large as this riser here in the studio, to get all the Democratic candidates for president together back in 2007.",
        "That particular debate, the issue was raised of whether or not you should be negotiating with the heads of countries that have been hostile to the United States, or have had interests perceived to be at odds with ours, or more particular to this case, at odds with those of Israel.",
        "And that would of course include organizations that are outside the regular state structure such as Hamas or Hezbollah, and for any implication to be raised that an American leader, particularly the American president, might sit down with such people or such leaders without the precondition of their agreeing to change their behavior, and specifically their hostile implacable opposition to the State of Israel.",
        "That has been in the past pretty much anathema in American politics.",
        "If you wanted to run for president that was a very risky position to take.",
        "So when Barack Obama took that position last year, Hillary Clinton pounced on him immediately and said she wouldn't be in that ballpark.",
        "And now Senator McCain has pounced on and pounced and pounced and pounced again last night in his speech in Louisiana.",
        "Yes and although the view that Obama took that there should be no one in the United States - no one in the world, that the United States feared to talk to.",
        "Of course he makes reference back to Jack Kennedy saying we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate, he does make reference to that quite often.",
        "And while he has evolved his position, he still basically believes that we should not begin a relationship with anybody in the world no matter how implacable they may seem, by saying we're not going to talk to you.",
        "Let's see if we can get some callers on the line.",
        "We're back to our old number, (800) 989-8255.",

        "Hi, good afternoon Neal.",
        "I've got a question for Mr. Ron Elving.",
        "It's about - I've been hearing a lot on the talk shows and radio talk shows, especially conservative, they're really fainting and fawning over the name of Bobby Jindal.",
        "I just want to ask Ron Elving if - what lawmaking experience or any major accomplishments does this gentleman have for the Republicans to consistently throw out his name out there.",
        "It seems like - are they being hypocrite?",
        "On one side they criticize Obama, but on the same hand they want to top up someone who - that I haven't literally heard of before he run for the governorship.",
        "Well there's one big difference and nobody ever calls and asks for a question for Mr. Rudin, but any Ron?",

        "Bobby Jindal is a phenomenal young man who is just 36 years old, but who has already run the medical and healthcare system for the state of Louisiana, in fact parleying that into becoming the governor of the state of Louisiana.",
        "He first got interested in medical care as an issue when he was a staff member here on the hill and thinking about going to medical school.",
        "He blew off the medical school and decided to go into healthcare policy full time as I say, took over the system in his mid 20s in the State of Louisiana, later on became the head of the university, OSU, big university, big state university in Louisiana, and still as a very young man went on to run for congress in his early 20s and now to be elected governor of Louisiana.",
        "As I say he's exactly 36.",
        "It's been observed that when you put him on the very short list of people that John McCain is considering to be his vice president, he would be the first vice presidential nominee to be exactly half the age of the presidential nominee.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, we would love to hear from FEMA and government, and we would love to hear a good job doing our job, making our job easier because it really feels that we're running a mini-government here.",

        "He has not had the kind of legislative accomplishments let's say, that John McCain has had over a much longer career in Congress, and because during his time in Congress he has not attached his name to any major legislation and he's just taking over now as the governor of Louisiana.",
        "Probably his biggest accomplishment would be the moves that he has made in the direction of eliminating corruption in Louisiana politics.",
        "That's supposed to be a laugh line actually.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "He's tried to begin the process of cleaning up the ethics of much of the governmental structure in Louisiana and that is an Augean task that I think will probably occupy him throughout his governorship.",

        "Let's get a question from here in the Newseum.",
        "Hi my name is Jan Doke (ph), I'm from Portland, Connecticut and I was wondering given Hillary Clinton's broad popularity amongst female voters across the political spectrum, what do you think the odds are that John McCain is going to consider a female for a vice president like for example, Susan Collins of Maine.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, it's a wonderful question, and I think we've heard John McCain already in the last 48 hours reaching out quite directly to women voters.",
        "He has a number of spokespersons, people who are sometimes called surrogates who are also doing this for him.",
        "One is Carly Fiorina who is the former chief executive of Hewlett Packard.",
        "There are some other women who have had top level positions in business, the woman who headed up Ebay for example, tremendously successful self made women who have been campaigning for John McCain."

        "Whether or not he puts a particular woman on his ticket is another question.",
        "I have pushed the idea that he would look at all of the different women senators and some of the women in the House of Representatives, some of the women governors in the Republican party and one of them that he might turn to would be Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas who is by the way by far the most popular politician in Texas, even more so than their president, and has been for a number of years.",
        "Whether or not she's interested in the job, of course, everyone always very shy about saying they're interested in the job and she indicates more of an interest n running for the governorship of Texas.",
        "Susan Collins or for that matter Olympia Snowe, Maine being one of those states that has two women senators, either one of them might be a candidate, might be a strong candidate for vice president.",
        "Generally speaking particularly of a candidate or a nominee comes from a smaller state like Arizona, John McCain, they're looking for a vice presidential running mate from a larger state who might be able to bring them a larger cache of electoral votes should they win or should they be a team, and we'll see if they're looking you know, or seriously considering Maine to be that state.",

        "This is the first time we've had a race so close, so very close, that really down to the last days there were scenarios that you could imagine by which either candidate might win.",
