        "This is the rogue Pakistani scientist who was the source of nuclear weapons information for many people.",
        "Tomorrow, the Department of Veterans Affairs will announce new regulations that will make it easier for military veterans to claim disabilities from post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
        "The current rules have been criticized for being unnecessarily time-consuming and even discriminatory.",
        "Yesterday, President Barack Obama spoke of the new policy in his weekly address.",
        "I don't think our troops on the battlefield should have to keep notes just in case they need to apply for a claim.",

        "He explains some of the changes for us.",
        "Well, I think the most important change is that our veterans are really - they're not going to have to go through this kind of adversarial proving position.",
        "The VA grants disability, but there's quite an elaborate system and program.",
        "To get through it, you have to prove that you were at the place you said you were at, and the things that happened to you really happened.",
        "For many, many veterans, that's relatively easy to do.",
        "But for many of our veterans it's not, particularly if records were lost, if they can't remember certain things.",
        "So this is a very, very big step in really helping veterans get rightfully earned, you know, disability benefits.",
        "How will women veterans be affected?",
        "Because I understand women have a harder time justifying their disability claims."

        "And I think their situation has been more difficult to prove.",
        "So, what does a veteran actually gain once he or she has an approved PTSD disability claim?",
        "Well, you know, the disabilities run all the way from 0 percent to 100 percent.",
        "And there's benefits, there's health care for the 100 percent veteran, which is total and permanent disability.",
        "There's a range of benefits, all the way from school tuition to rehabilitation to - there's just all kinds of things.",

        "In the largest study of its kind scientists tracked about 50,000 women for about a dozen years and they found no evidence that eating a low fat diet is healthier than eating a regular one.",
        "One researcher proclaimed this is the end of the low fat era.",

        "They weren't surprising but I don't think it's necessarily common sense that the less fat you eat the less you weigh or the less disease you're going to have.",
        "I think what's really important is the total number of calories and it's an important message I think we have to be a little more careful about getting across.",
        "Well, I think a lot of people would be surprised to think that a calorie from a doughnut means about the same thing as a calorie from an apple.",
        "Well, not necessarily.",
        "What we know is a calorie is a calorie and the important thing is the total number of calories that you consume.",
        "Now, a gram of fat has about nine calories whereas a gram of protein or carbohydrate has about four calories.",
        "So you can eat a larger volume of let's say the apple as opposed to a high fat food, but the bottom line is it's the total number of calories you consume, the total amount of energy you expend and that's going to determine how much you weigh."

        "Now, this study did not distinguish between so-called good fats and bad fats and I'm wondering are there any studies that do and if their findings contradict the findings of this study?",
        "There are a number of studies that have looked at type of fat and what we know is that saturated and trans-fatty acids will increase LDL cholesterol, which is related to the development of heart disease, whereas poly and mono unsaturated fatty acids will decrease LDL cholesterol level, hence risk of developing heart disease.",

        "Does the Tea Party faction, as you understand it, have a vision for what a victory would look like?",
        "Their victory would be taking over the Republican Party from what they view as the establishment that has gone soft.",
        "They believe that the Republican Party, as it exists - the party of Mitt Romney, the party of John McCain and many others before - is not sufficiently conservative.",
        "They believe that that's why it's not winning national elections, and that the answer is something much more in the Ted Cruz mold: politicians who go to Washington not to be constructive and to compromise, but to burn the place down.",
        "Well, you also write that some hard-line conservatives want to split from the GOP to form their own party, and that being a Tea Party faction.",
        "How realistic and how likely is that?",
        "Well, most political scientists will tell you it's not very realistic for a third party to win elections in the United States.",
        "But in terms of how it could damage the party, even an unsuccessful third-party movement - even something on the scale of, say, a Ralph Nader in 2000 - could have a profound effect on a presidential election.",
        "So, if these self-styled conservatives make good on their threats and actually do secede from the Republican Party, you know, you do have a lot of them really calling the establishment a lot of terrible names and really threatening divorce if they don't get their way.",
        "And if there is that kind of a dramatic rupture, I think this will all play out in the 2016 primaries.",
        "And if they do end up seceding in some way, it would have a pretty major effect on Republicans' chances for national office.",
        "If you had a percentage or if you were betting to actually pull away for a new party, what would you say?",
        "Well, I don't like to make predictions, but I think it is safe to say that this is not a conflict that is going to go away, especially with someone like Ted Cruz being so vocal in Washington.",
        "He's signaled he is not going to back down, and the sort of talk radio cheering on this movement, this conflict that has been sort of a simmering internal matter for the Republican Party up to now is now very much out in the open, very much a sort of hot war, and I think we're going to hear more of it."
