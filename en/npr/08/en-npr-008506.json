        "My biggest concern is that while they say sequestration will stop during a disaster, are they going to be ready in the meantime?",
        "Are they going to have an impact on our National Guard, are they going to impact on our training, things like that?",
        "Florida's National Guard says about half of its 2,000 full-time personnel will have to take four furlough days, mostly likely during hurricane season.",
        "The head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Craig Fugate, says sequestration will cut a billion dollars from his agency's budget.",
        "Fugate spoke at a recent conference of emergency management groups in Ft.",
        "Lauderdale.",
        "And I'm not going to tell you FEMA is going to so more with less money.",
        "What I am going to tell you is we're probably going to do fewer things, but we're going to do them better.",
        "Fugate said, after a disaster, that means not duplicating efforts of the states and the private sector.",
        "After Sandy, for example, when millions were without electricity and gas, it was the power companies and service stations that provided much-needed relief.",
        "FEMA personnel will have to take furlough days this summer - as will employees of the National Weather Service.",
        "Dan Sobien, the head of the union representing National Weather Service workers, says the furloughs come on top of a hiring freeze that has cut the agency's workforce by almost 10 percent.",
        "It has left many offices around the country - not all - but many offices around the country severely understaffed, to the point where some of the functions they do just aren't going to get done.",
        "Miami's National Hurricane Center, for example, is short-staffed in its information technology division - personnel that are vital in getting hurricane forecasts and warnings on the Web and out to the media and the public.",
        "No, I actually think it's a study that was very well done.",
        "I think when it was planned the focus was on the total fat content of the diet and we have our answer.",
        "Since that time we've learned that type of fat and the total number of calories is far more important.",
        "But are you concerned that Americans will just see the headlines today and think well ok, it's ok now to go to McDonald's and gorge on hamburgers and French fries."

        "Well, I think what Americans need to do is really embrace the concept that it's energy balance.",
        "It's the total amount of calories you consume and calories you burn.",
        "And you can have your cake and eat it too.",
        "So, going to McDonald's is not necessarily going to be a good idea if you choose one of the burgers and fries because it's going to be relatively high in saturated and trans-fatty acids and we know that's going to be associated with increased risk of heart disease.",
        "I think what we need to do is make good choices, make the right choices with respect to fat which would mean limit intake of animal fat and hydrogenated fat and that'll take care of the trans and saturated fatty acids and then substitute, don't add, but substitute mono unsaturated and poly unsaturated fatty acids which come from things like canola and corn oil.",
        "And Dr. Lichtenstein I'm wondering, are you going to change your diet at all because of this study?",
        "Well, I've been aware of the research that has been coming out since this study was conceived so I'm consuming a moderate fat diet that's high in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, low fat and nonfat dairy products, fish and lean meat.",
        "So I think I'm going to stick with that and try to keep myself exercising.",
        "So what does that mean for tonight's dinner?",
        "What's on the menu?",
        "Tonight's dinner will probably be salmon and then I think there's going to be some steamed snow peas and then probably sauté that with some fresh spinach and brown rice.",
        "Mm.",
        "That sounds admirably health.",
        "No ice cream?",
        "Not an ice cream person, but I have an outstanding pineapple that's waiting to be consumed.",
        "Ok.",
        "Dr. Alice Lichtenstein is a professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University.",
