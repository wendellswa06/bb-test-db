        "Not only that - Sanders wants to get rid of all out-of-pocket costs - no copays, no bills - sounds very ambitious, also sounds very expensive.",
        "And you would need to raise taxes by a lot to pay for this.",
        "And Sanders himself has said before that this kind of thing can't pass, right?",
