        "And he served one term as a state representative.",
        "Put all that together, what I say is I'm well qualified to be a president of the Navajo Nation.",

        "She points out half the Navajo tribe on and off the reservation doesn't speak the language.",
        "Still, tribal member and social scientist Manley Begay says Deschene may be able to memorize speeches in Navajo, but that isn't good enough.",
        "How you use a Navajo language really is very closely tied to one's heart.",
        "So when you speak in Navajo, you know, you basically see from the heart.",
        "In the primary, 17 people vied for the presidency.",

        "Shirley is fluent in the language and has served in public office for many years, including two terms as Navajo president.",
        "I think it's very important that the presidency serve as a role model and carrying on that way of life and that culture.",
        "If there should be a non-speaking Navajo to take the helm, I'm not exactly sure where that person is going to take us.",

        "Well, there's - it's very difficult, I think, for a lot of people who are in the moment reporting it and certainly for those of us who are sort of watching it and taking it all in to take a step back and to think about, OK, where has this information come from?",
        "And as much as news organizations are trained to do that and try to do that, I think that the natural rapid pace that things are developing at inevitably leads us to having things going on the air or going online that simply aren't true.",
        "And that's been the case, I think, always with big breaking news events.",
        "The difference is that we see these incremental pieces of information and they're put out there completely.",
        "Whereas, before, they might have been held in the newsroom where there wasn't the pressure to get it out every second, every moment because people were waiting on Twitter and other places to get it.",

        "Only the problem is, is that there's very little reward, it would seem, sometimes for waiting.",
        "For journalists, to be striving to get the first little bit of incremental advancement and be always first with that - in the end, it doesn't really pay off.",
        "I wish that the calculation was a little bit different in newsrooms.",
        "I wish that there was that element of restraint a little bit more, because in the long run, you really do win out by being the one, in some cases, who doesn't say anything.",
        "I want to talk a little bit, Craig, about amateur detective work.",
        "Users on reddit and 4chan immediately started to comb through the video to try and identify the suspect.",
        "And then the New York Post did that as well and identified the wrong people with big circles around faces.",
        "What happened there?",
        "The image of those two people was circulated within the law enforcement community as potential people that they wanted to talk to and look into.",
        "But the New York Post took that image, said, OK, well, you know, the law enforcement are circulating this, let's throw this on the cover and let's call them bag men."

        "And there's a feeling, I think, with media today where you can participate, where you can, you know, blog something.",
        "And so in places like reddit and 4chan, for me, I see people wanting to play some kind of a role.",
        "Do you think it was a mistake for the police to ask the public for help in ID'ing the suspects?",
        "I don't think it's ever a mistake for that to be done.",
        "However, perhaps we now need a little bit more focused guidance, a little bit more specific direction of, you know, here's what's helpful and here's what isn't, and here's what's doing something that is going to be useful to the investigation and here is doing something that may actually paint people mistakenly as terrorists.",

        "The first one is that in a breaking news situation, confusion reigns.",
        "It reigns not only for the first few minutes and hours, but it can actually continue on for a period of days.",
        "The second thing is that misinformation spreads the same as accurate information.",
        "I think one of the big things to remember is that it's very easy to hold back.",

        "And, in fact, there's a much more risk if you decide to be a conduit for some of this confusion and misinformation.",

        "What was new about what Amazon did is that traditionally, publishers wouldn't sell new books to used bookstores.",
        "They did it because the used book competes with the new book.",
        "Amazon had such market power that the publishers couldn't refuse to do that, and the result was a world in which Amazon says I'll sell you a new book for $15, buy it back from you tomorrow for $10 and sell it to somebody else for $12.",
        "On that second sale, neither the publisher nor the author makes any royalty.",
        "So it's the - it's what seems to be market efficiency and is, but it's also a sign of market power by the country's leading bookseller who's able to break down restrictions that always existed and put the internet to a use that nobody ever anticipated.",
        "Why do you say this is more likely to affect authors whose sales are more limited than those of a national best-seller author like yourself?",
        "I say that because that's been the market reality.",
