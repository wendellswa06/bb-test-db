        "Here are some statistics from the U.S.",
        "Army Corps of Engineers.",
        "By November 1st, Hurricane Sandy had poured some 600 million gallons of water into the train and auto tunnels of New York.",
        "The corps' pumps can expel 696,000 gallons of water per minute.",
        "To a lot of us, this sounds like a set-up for an algebra problem, but for the Corps of Engineers and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, these have been the measure of real life for the past nearly two weeks.",
        "How are they doing?",
        "Well, joining us now to talk about that, first, are Lieutenant Colonel Michael Clancy, who's deputy commander of the U.S.",
        "Army Corps of Engineers New York District.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And George Kern, who's director of Bridge and Tunnel Operations for the New York City Department of Transportation, which oversees six tunnels and 25 movable bridges across the city.",
        "Welcome to the program, Mr. Kern.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And first for both of you, can we infer from the fact that you both have time to go to our New York bureau and talk about this that the job is successful and perhaps even nearly complete?",
        "Thank you, Robert.",
        "Well, we got the shape and the gravity and some very nice pictures from optimal illumination of the far side, as well as some near side radio sounding.",
        "The thing about the far side is that in order to see into it, you need gravity, and gravity can only be measured when you can track a spacecraft at low altitude over the far side.",
        "This was never possible before the Kaguya mission.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And so, we're getting a good idea from that?",
        "Yes, we are, and I think it's told us that the far side was stronger than the near side and thus probably cooler at a period of time about 3.8 billion years before present, which is when most of the great basins were formed on the moon."

        "Now, a lot of people may not realize that the moon is rotating, and it's rotating in such a way and in synchrony with the Earth so that the far side is always pointing away from the earth, right?",
        "Yes, it's rotating with respect to the sun, but it's tidally locked to face the same face towards Earth, very nearly, throughout the entire month.",
        "When was the last time we took good pictures of the far side of the moon?",
        "Pictures have been taken by Clementine and Galileo in the 1990s.",
        "The Clementine mapper was a technology experiment put together by the DOD, but it gave us the current set of base maps that we're all using.",
        "The Kaguya is going to exceed their resolution by a factor of 10, and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which we're launching in late April or early May, is going to give us half meter per pixel images of several percent of the moon and give us a synoptic view of the whole moon at, I think, 80 meters per pixel.",
        "If we've got some great probes that are orbiting and rolling around the surface of Mars, why are we still looking at the moon?",
        "Well, the moon is like a time capsule of solar system history.",
        "It fills in the gap between the origin of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago and the oldest rocks on Earth, which are about 3.8 billion years old.",
        "This is a period of time that's been completely erased on Earth, and the moon preserves it in more or less pristine shape, a little bit battered.",
        "And it's the calendar by which we date other events in the solar system, since we really don't have any way to inquire about their dates, other than by looking at the cratering history.",
        "Now, but the moon supposedly broke off from Earth, right, some time in its past history?",
        "Thought to have been the product of a collision.",
        "Yeah, but - and that would have been before life formed on earth?",
        "Very much so."

        "Yeah.",
        "So, we're not going to be able to see any remnants of any fossilized life that might have been there?",
        "Long before any bacteria were known to exist.",
        "Will it tell us something about the origins of the solar system by studying the moon?",
        "Yes, it will, because we don't know what the process really was that brought all the planets together in their current shape and distribution.",
        "And we don't know whether this happens the same way in other star systems or whether we're completely unique and we're the only place - not likely the only place where life could have arisen.",
        "Now, there's also - just like we look at - looking for signs of water on Mars, people have always been looking for signs of water on the moon, maybe locked up hidden in some dark places where the sun doesn't shine.",
        "Are we still looking for those signs?",
        "That's one of the thrusts of exploration, because it's a heck of a lot easier to get fuel and sustenance out of water ice that's actually in crystalline form than it is by baking it out of dry rocks.",
        "There is enough hydrogen on the moon and there's enough oxygen on the moon to support exploration and colonization and so forth, but the amount of energy to get it out may be 100 or 1000 times greater than if we can find deposits of ice.",
        "As someone who studies the moon, do you think it's true that we - we've heard this said many times - that we have better maps of the far side of moon than we do of the ocean floor?",
        "Well, I'm glad you asked that question.",
        "If you look at Google Mars and you compare it to Google Ocean, you'll see that in most places in the ocean, really the maps aren't that good, partially because the ocean is covered with water, and it's only through sonar mapping that we can see the ocean bottom with any clarity.",
        "And with gravity, we can see the rest of the ocean bottom but with kind of blurry resolution.",
        "And it's the 90 or 95 percent of the ocean bottom that we don't see that really hurts us.",
        "We run into things down there because we don't know that they're there.",
        "And if you want a quick shovel-ready mission that will improve our knowledge of that, I can suggest something that - just give me a call.",
        "(Laughing) Is it true that you started out life as a marine geophysicist?",
        "That's correct.",
        "It takes about six weeks to go out and map the ocean floor for a week and a half and then get back to port.",
        "And in the process, you cover a teeny tiny area but a fascinating area.",
        "We dredged up things from the bottom that were alive, at least on the bottom.",
        "By the time we got them up, they looked a little strange, but they're unlike anything you've ever seen before."

        "But if you're lower down on the food chain, if you're the midlist or the new author, you're stuck with that 25 percent of the net e-book royalty.",
        "And as the market moves more and more toward e-books, that means that the incomes of midlist and new authors are actually dwindling.",
        "But let me give you another argument.",
        "There's been a lot of push back in the blogosphere about your op-ed piece that says basically, Scott Turow, you're being reactionary, maybe even a bit of a Luddite because at the same time, a lot of people who might not have gotten publishing contracts, especially from the major publishers, have been able to self-publish and make money and content that way.",
        "Right.",
        "And there's not a word in what I published in The New York Times that criticizes this development.",
        "I think it's a great thing that authors have been able to surmount the traditional barriers to publication, some of them quite successfully.",
        "And although I'm a frequent critic of Amazon, I salute them for making it so much easier for people to get published and to sell their books.",

        "What do you hear from younger authors who are getting started?",
        "Are they concerned about making a living as authors, as writers?",
        "Well, there was a young author David Bernstein who was at the annual meeting of the Authors Guild, and he's just published a terrific book about people his age and their impact on the economy.",
        "And David said, you know, the authors I know don't even think of writing books as a principal way to make a living.",
        "It's one avenue to get their name out there, so they get hired as consultants and give talks.",
        "And that's fine for people in the nonfiction world, I guess, but what do you do with a novelist?",
        "I mean, I've had a wonderful career, but I don't fill stadiums to give a reading of my work.",
        "Scott Turow is the author of nine best-selling books and most recently an op-ed in The New York Times called \"\"The Slow Death of the American Author.\"\" Scott, thank you very much for being with us.",
