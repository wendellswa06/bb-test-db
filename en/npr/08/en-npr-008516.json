        "We just showed up, Army Corp of Engineers, we're here to help, but I got to meet guys like George.",
        "You know, I don't think we found a tunnel where they weren't already working when we showed up, we just brought in - like George said, we brought in larger pumps, more equipment to help make it go faster.",
        "Flashing forward a bit, Lieutenant Colonel Clancy, where is all that water now and how contaminated, if at all, was all that water that was down in the tunnels for a while?",
        "You know, Robert, it's actually surprisingly clean because most of the tunnels were evacuated and most of the water we pumped right back to where it came from into New York Harbor.",
        "It was really - just depending upon where we had access to either the sewer system or the harbor.",
        "But we also didn't want to overwhelm the city's sewer system with water that didn't really need to be treated 'cause it really wasn't that dirty.",
        "But we didn't take hard samples, but we took eyeball samples of everything we pumped and there was concern at first, but once we got going, really the water was pretty clean and we were comfortable putting it back into the harbor.",
        "Mr.",
        "Kern, what about the structural damage to the tunnels?",
        "That is, now that the water's out, are there problems that might force repairs and force closures just to get - to make sure there is no lasting damage from Sandy?",
        "Well, structurally, it's very sound, the structure itself.",
        "But all the vital components of - all the electrical and mechanical components are completely destroyed.",

        "Not just water, but you're dealing with large volumes of salt water.",

        "Yes.",
        "It's completely dry and it's fully accessible, you know, throughout the full length of the tube itself.",
        "Well, both of you, having experienced all of this, what would you say the city could possibly do to avoid similar flooding or is it just inevitable if New York City moves so many people by tunnel, whether by cars or trains, a huge storm is going to do this?",
        "And first of all, Lieutenant Colonel Clancy, what would you say?",
        "I think it's going to have to be a variety of things.",
        "You know, I was at the South Ferry subway station the night of the hurricane at high tide and the MTA had boarded it off and put sandbags and it was about three foot high on the water side and it was bone dry on the other side of those sandbags.",
        "So that was a temporary fix, but something maybe a little bit more permanent than that, a little gate we could put on every tunnel.",
        "We could do something much smaller on a local basis for the lower parts of the city that I think could prevent most of the damage that we experienced last week.",
        "And George Kern, do you think of things that the city could or must do if another storm like this might be out there?",
        "When you're talking about trying to protect the tunnel, what our vision is later or down the road is probably making everything that's underground more water tight, more suitable that, you know, it would not be damaged or, you know, really protect our electrical and mechanical equipment.",
        "Water protecting it in some fashion, where water cannot seep into any of the operating components.",
        "I think that would be the safe way to go.",
