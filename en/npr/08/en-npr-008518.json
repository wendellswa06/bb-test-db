        "I mean, he seemed to be giving China praise but also saying that they're taking advantage of the United States.",
        "What do the Chinese make of that?",
        "Well, at the end of the day, he said he doesn't blame China for the trade deficit.",
        "And of course, China doesn't like to be blamed especially by, you know, visitors.",
        "As far as trade deficits are concerned, I think they're perfectly aware that you get trade deficits because you consume more than you produce.",
        "And then you, in the U.S.'s case, borrow from China to make up the difference.",
        "But you know, President Trump really did have some very personal sort of praises for Xi Jinping.",
        "I think the nicest thing he said was - to Xi Jinping - you know, your people are proud of you.",
        "And that's something you might not usually hear from a visiting head of state.",
        "And so - you know, I don't know how sincere they thought it was, but I think it went over well.",
        "Steve, what do you make of this?",
        "Is this President Trump actually putting pressure on China or not?",
        "I think he's sending mixed signals at best, David.",
        "He did say that trade practices between China and the United States are unfair.",
        "But he's also said over the course of this year he'd be happy to - give away the store, in effect - give better trade deals to China if he could just get help with North Korea.",
        "And observers on the outside trying to figure out the Trump administration's strategy are not as certain what that strategy is.",
        "So there has been a wide mixture of remarks from the president, a mixture of results and not a lot of clarity as to how he wants to change the relationship.",
        "Sochi is unique among the cities hosting the Winter Games, because it has the mild climate of a seaside resort, but it's less than an hour away from the snow-capped mountains of the North Caucasus.",
        "But the mountain region is also home to mostly Muslim ethnic groups that have a long history of conflict with Moscow that dates from the colonial battles of the Russian Empire to the Chechen Wars of the past two decades."

        "On a recent trip to Sochi, he also encountered the most low-technology security measure: Patrols of uniformed Cossacks who have the authority to stop visitors and check their identities.",
        "It seems to be the initiative of the local governor to impress the population.",
        "Because, of course, these people seem to be completely untrained to detect or identify terrorists.",
        "And that, says Soldatov, is where the system falls down.",
        "No matter how many troops you deploy, he says, if they don't have training in counter-terrorism, experience in the community and, most importantly, good intelligence about the insurgents, attackers may be able to slip through.",

        "And combine that with the fact that if the rebels can't get to Sochi, then they will try for wherever they can get, because I think they realize that a bomb in Russia proper is much more newsworthy than a bomb in the North Caucasus.",
        "The recent attacks in Volgograd and other cities close to the North Caucasus show that terrorists are ready and able to take their fight elsewhere in Russia.",
        "A big enough tragedy in one of Russia's heartland cities could drain the joy out of Putin's Olympics.",
