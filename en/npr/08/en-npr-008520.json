        "And let's remember, David, Xi Jinping, in his remarks today with President Trump sitting there listening, emphasized - China already buys a lot of things, a lot of cars and other goods, from the United States.",
        "And the implied message there is, you've already got a good trading relationship.",
        "It's fine.",
        "He didn't explicitly say that, but that is what his remarks effectively meant.",
        "Guys, when you get away from the joint appearances by leaders and the cannon fire and the military music, do you get a feel for how people in China view President Trump?",
        "Yeah.",

        "But we also encountered a Chinese woman today who said she likes President Trump because he wants to crack down on Muslims, and she agrees with that sentiment.",
        "Oh, wow - just said that she agrees with that very bluntly.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Anthony, what about Chinese media?",
        "I mean, obviously, I guess very close to the state, which can represent what message the state wants to get out.",

        "OK.",

        "Right in front of us.",

        "And basically, this one, which is on all the major papers today, says what an assiduous and grateful student of Chinese culture the Trumps are, how dazzled by the splendor of Chinese traditional culture they were during their visit to the Forbidden City."
