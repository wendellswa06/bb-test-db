        "And here I am, injured.",
        "Kitchin, who was in his 30s at the time, became a quadriplegic.",

        "More than anything, he wanted to drive again.",
        "He got a minivan with hand controls for the gas and brake.",
        "The only problem was, he's a guy who closely links his identity to his vehicle.",
        "A minivan is kind of the family truckster type of thing, and I didn't want to be the soccer-mom type.",
        "I never really considered myself that.",
        "So he looked around for options.",
        "Honda is working on an Element for people with disabilities, and there's a company in Florida that converts basic pickups.",
        "But Kitchin really wanted a four-wheel drive.",
        "So the former ad exec designed his dream truck in the back of a barn.",

        "Finally, they adapted the steering wheel with extra hand controls."

        "Kitchin uses GMC and Chevy trucks that are built at a nearby plant.",
        "It costs about $25,000 to modify each one - about the same price as modifying a minivan.",
        "Dave Whiston, with Morningstar Research, is a fan of niche automotive markets.",
        "But he cautions that start-ups like this sometimes struggle to keep a strong customer base.",
        "The trick is, you've got to be able to keep your competitors at bay.",
        "And in manufacturing, that's generally very hard to do because almost anyone can get a loan or raise funds somehow, and open up a factory and buy some machinery and hire some workers."
