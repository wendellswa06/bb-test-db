        "The only problem was that Fifth Corps was a tactical unit, trained to fight and defeat Saddam Hussein's army.",
        "Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez was the Fifth Corps commander.",
        "And it was a very conscious decision that was made by General Franks to do that, because in my assessment, he believed that the war was over and that most of the forces would be out by August.",
        "And therefore, he just needed a caretaker headquarters, if you will, on the ground to manage the redeployment of forces.",

        "It led to the enhanced insurgency and to the tremendous instability that we faced in the country.",
        "The decision to place Sanchez's Fifth Corps in charge of Iraq may have been the single biggest military blunder after the fall of Baghdad, according to the Army's new official history of the war.",
        "Tommy Franks was not available for comment.",
        "The book, released today, is based on interviews with 200 senior Army officers involved in the invasion and its aftermath.",
        "It's an attempt to expose the mistakes that were made in the hope that they won't be repeated by future officers.",
        "Retired General Bob Scales, a former Army historian himself, says the book is remarkably candid.",
        "He calls it a chronicle of failure.",
        "The Army's got a strong internal culture of self-criticism.",
        "Hidden from the general population is the passion and often, you know, the vitriol that goes on, particularly among and between officers, particularly general officers, over the conduct of operations.",
        "While the book doesn't single out specific officers for criticism, it's hardly a ringing endorsement of the general officer corps - generals, the report implies, who failed to insist on better post-invasion planning.",
        "Again, here's former Army Vice Chief General Jack Keane."
