        "No, yeah, I definitely would like to do something like that.",

        "It's more about a sort of mental process that he has that allows him to better simulate human behavior.",

        "Okay.",
        "Any particular in your research that stood out for you that you really used a kind of model, any quirks, or…",
        "Well, I mean, I must say that \"\"Dexter,\"\" in terms of anything I encountered, remains sort of singular as a character, as a serial killer, in terms of the responsibility he takes.",
