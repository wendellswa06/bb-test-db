        "Who thought of that?",
        "That was - that's really great.",
        "You know, I'm not sure.",
        "I think Clyde Phillips, one of the show runners along with some of the other creative powers that be on the show came up with the concept of an intro that welcomed you into the day to day of Dexter's world, but also welcomed you into an appreciation for the inherent violence of it.",
        "Really cool.",
        "And Digital Kitchen, I believe, put together the visual.",

        "This is the creepiest shaving I've ever seen in my life.",
        "Yeah, well, you know, I actually - and a part of this was - I wanted Dexter to have sort of cultivated a somewhat disheveled appearance.",
        "He's very aware of the profile he's avoiding, fitting, and I thought that made sense.",
        "And I justified it to the producers saying that, you know, the worst thing for Dexter is to draw his own blood.",
        "So he shaves with something that doesn't require him to shave close to the skin and, I don't know, maybe we see him learning a lesson in the intro because there is blood.",
        "There is blood anyway.",
