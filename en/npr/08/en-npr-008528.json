        "The latest field poll showed that 52 percent of them disapprove of Boxer.",
        "Still, Fiorina trails by a few points in almost every public poll.",
        "So who's going after those undecideds in the middle of the road?",
        "Well, it seems like neither of them, says Jerry Roberts, co-founder of the political website Calbuzz.",
        "This is as clear-cut as any statewide election that I can remember in California on economic issues, on taxation, on cultural issues - just from top to bottom.",
        "All the more reason for Boxer and Fiorina to focus on defining each other's personalities and records.",
