        "And so I went to the trial, and it was one of the first big media trials, and I became obsessed by it only because I wanted to figure out what happened and how these kids - that were very much like my friends from my neighborhoods and stuff - ended up doing something.",

        "It's been 40 years ago.",
        "I taught in prison for a long time; I think that helped a lot.",
        "I got sort of serious about it, as realizing that this was something that had happened, that making any fun of it was certainly very detrimental to not only the relatives of the victims but also the families of the kids that had joined up with them."
