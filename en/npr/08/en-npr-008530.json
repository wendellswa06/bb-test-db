        "And by protecting the sage grouse, they would tangentially protect many other wildlife species.",

        "In the first 20 minutes of walking on his friend's property, just next to a field of sagebrush, we see sage grouse, antelope, lizards and a rabbit.",
        "Wilson says the owner of this land is a rancher and a farmer, what you'd call a land developer.",
        "But he's also a wildlife lover.",
