        "The senior intelligence official says that was to avoid compromising an ongoing investigation.",
        "And a paragraph was added about the various warnings the CIA had provided in the months leading up to the attack.",
        "And at that point, the draft was sent out to other parts of the administration for comment.",
        "Okay.",
        "Sent out to the White House, the State Department, also the FBI.",

        "But the State Department raised a couple of significant objections.",

        "The spokeswoman also complained that a reference to CIA warnings could make it appear the State Department hadn't been paying attention.",
        "And so, by Saturday afternoon, those items had been dropped from the talking points.",
        "And certainly the State Department's complaints were a part of that decision, but a senior intelligence official who briefed reporters said the CIA also agreed in dropping those points.",
        "And in the end, after all of this back and forth, Scott, what ended up evolving was a fairly bland and, it turns out, faulty set of talking points that Susan Rice used on those talk shows.",
        "That's right.",
        "And anyone who's ever tried to write something by committee knows how that can happen.",
        "We should say, however, that there was an alternate set of talking points in these emails that did include a reference to al-Qaida.",
        "And three days after those Sunday talk shows, the director of the administration's counterterrorism center, Matt Olsen, gave this update to Congress.",
        "We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al-Qaida or al-Qaida's affiliates.",
