        "Well, by the rate of fall, you can tell by intensity on Doppler radar.",
        "Once again, thanks to the wonders of computers, we have algorithms that can detect for us the rate of fall of the precipitation based on its intensity - how fast and how strong does the radar return - come back to the radar transmitter so we can do a quick calculation and convert that to inches.",
        "And how much of this is affected by the amount of moisture in the snow, in terms of how much snowfall ultimately piles up?",
        "That is really important, and that's called the snow ratio.",
        "If, just an example, you take an inch of liquid - can't call it rain 'cause we're not turning rain to snow - but just say equivalent of an inch of liquid of water.",
        "At normal ratios, that would produce 10 to 12 inches of snow.",
        "But as the air is colder and the dendritic formation - the actual snowflakes as they begin to form - if it forms in a much colder, dryer environment aloft, what can happen is that ratio can climb to 20 to one, 30 to one, maybe sometimes 40 to one under ideal circumstances.",
        "So given the same amount of liquid, what we have to do is forecast what that ratio will be.",
        "If we have the ratio all wrong, then we're going to be completely wrong on the forecasted snow amount.",
        "The wetter snow would be denser and more compact?",
        "Right, more water in it.",
        "And the dryer snow would be fluffier and would pile up more.",
        "Here's a good example, the big weekend storm.",
        "That was 30 inches of wet snow with high water content in the snowflakes.",
        "When that accumulated, it started compacting.",
        "And because of the amount of water per snowflake, the weight of that 30 inches of snow was much heavier than 30 inches of light, fluffy dry snow.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And having been out there shoveling it, I know.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Right.",
        "I can tell how heavy that was.",
        "Do you think, Doug, that this has all gotten more accurate over time?",
        "I mean, the snowstorm this past weekend, it just seemed like it started exactly when people said it would start.",
        "It ended just about exactly when people said it would end.",
        "And the accumulation was just about spot-on."
