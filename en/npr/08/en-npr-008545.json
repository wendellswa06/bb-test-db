        "You know, you have a little farm and you plant little crops, and its very, very simple.",

        "That's the thing that's happening.",
        "Games are just evolving into like - they're evolving like species, you know, in order to fit into every little niche of our lives.",
        "And when you talk about little niches, I mean, developing a game that is addictive to some people but can be played in 30 seconds at a time, that does seem to fit the way that people are increasingly scattered with their time, doesn't it?",
        "Yes, definitely.",
        "And these Facebook games are very interesting, because almost all of them are completely free to play to get started, but they give you a certain amount of energy, so a certain amount of time you can play each day.",
        "And if you decide you want to play more than that, it's easily done.",
        "You put some money in, and they'll give you more energy.",
        "And on top of that, there's a more complex aspect to this, which is a thing called lead generation.",

        "You get points in the game when you sign up for the credit card.",

        "And one is that it seems that some individual investors and fund managers didn't seem to have much trouble figuring out that something was suspicious here.",
        "They asked Madoff how he was making his money.",

        "They invested in some fund, they were paying a fund manager to manage their money, and basically all those people were doing was handing it on over to Bernard Madoff's firm, and Madoff was doing whatever he wanted with it.",

        "And that's something, I think, seriously to look at.",
        "But I have to say, look, it's first and foremost the responsibility of the private individual in this country to due diligence, and not to turn their money over to people without keeping track of it or watching out what's happening.",

        "Even the people that may have caught onto this scheme and withdrew their money may find that if that has happened in the last six years, they will able to be caught after to get that money back.",
        "Oh, because Madoff was effectively stealing money from other people to pay them their imagined returns.",
        "Right.",
        "And boy wouldn't that be a shocker and a double whammy when, you know, say five years ago, you spent a lot of money, made an examination and came to the conclusion you thought this wasn't a good deal and decided to take your funds out, and did.",
        "And now you've been going on your merry way, investing those for the last five years, to find out that you lose all of that.",
        "That could be a shocker.",
