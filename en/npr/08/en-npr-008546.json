        "Each year on this program, we focus on the films nominated for Best Feature Documentary at the Academy Awards.",
        "Tune in next week to hear interviews with the makers of this year's Oscar nominees.",
        "But I have to confess that the process to select those top five has always been a little murky.",
        "Some argued that the rules allowed a lot of films made for TV to qualify for the top movie award and that the more popular documentaries often got left out.",
        "One of the more vocal critics, Oscar winner and Academy board member Michael Moore, helped to write a new set of rules, and they've proved to be controversial, too.",
        "He and one of his critics will join us in just a minute.",
        "Filmmakers, how will Oscar's new rules on feature documentaries change your business?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",

        "Later in the program, can we really believe what look like some solid economic indicators?",
        "But first, filmmaker and author Michael Moore joins us from our bureau in New York.",
        "And Michael, nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Thank you, Neal, good afternoon.",
        "And what were the problems with the old rules?",
        "The problems with the old rules is that the nominees were being chosen by small committees, and one or two people could block the nomination of a film.",
        "And in a branch that has 160 members, we came to believe that this just wasn't right, that the documentary branch, just like all the other branches, should pick the five nominees.",
        "I mean, the editors, all the editors in their branch, picked best - the five nominees for Best Editor.",
        "The directors do the same, the actors, the writers.",
        "All the other branches except our branch has had this, like, special panel, committee, blue-ribbon thing.",
        "And if - literally if one person didn't like something, they could actually put a stop to even discussing nominating this film."

        "And so this has resulted in, over the years, films like \"\"Hoop Dreams\"\" not even being nominated, great documentary filmmakers like Frederick Wiseman, Albert Maysles, never even being nominated for an Oscar, Errol Morris never being nominated until this past decade.",
        "How is it that America's, you know, greatest documentary filmmakers have never even been nominated for this?",
        "It would be odd.",
        "It would be like as if, you know, for fiction films, if Spielberg or Scorsese had never been nominated.",
        "It would just - people would think this is kind of weird.",
        "And so I got elected to the board of governors of the Academy a couple years ago, and I came in and I said listen, I have an idea here.",
        "I think the solution to this problem is democracy.",
        "We need to have everyone voting.",
        "We need to have everyone's eyes on this.",
        "All 160 members of our branch should vote and pick the five nominees, and then all 6,000 members of the Academy should have - should be voting for what they think is the best documentary.",
        "Every other category the entire Academy votes for, again, best editing, best writing, best makeup, whatever.",
        "But when it comes to documentaries, only sometimes as few as 100 people, sometimes maybe 400, who have these three or four nights available to them in February, who can come and judge the films in a screening room in either Los Angeles or New York - and you have to be there on those nights - they're the only ones that get to vote.",
        "So basically, you know, you don't have all 6,000 members having a chance to have their say.",
        "But the one benefit of the current system is that those who are voting have at least seen the movies.",
        "Well, we believe, and we've set up certain structures within this new rule to make sure that - I mean, we think with 160 people watching, every movie will be seen at least once, and we will be polling our branch members to see, in fact, what they are watching.",
        "And if there are films that we find that no one has watched, then we will ask for volunteers for people to watch these films, to make sure that every film gets watched.",
        "But look, I mean, anytime you introduce a democracy, where you make it accessible and transparent, sometimes it gets a little messy, and sometimes it's not perfect, but that's always far better - it's always better to have, you know, more input than less input.",
        "But some people say these rules in fact will reduce the number of films that are eligible from roughly 100 a year to maybe 60 a year.",
        "In particular, there is concern about one of the rules that you proposed that to qualify, to be considered for the Oscar, a film has to be reviewed by the New York Times or the Los Angeles Times.",
        "Well, the problem here is is that we've had a number of documentaries over the years which were really TV documentaries trying to get an Oscar nomination by what they call four-walling: They buy a screen in some obscure place so that nobody actually comes to see the movie, it runs for seven days, and then that qualifies them."
