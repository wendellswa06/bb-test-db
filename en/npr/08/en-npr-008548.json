        "Search crews have recovered part of the tail section of Air France 447, putting investigators a little closer to understanding what brought down the Airbus as it flew across the Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.",
        "As of this morning, 24 bodies have been recovered of the 228 people onboard.",
        "To help us understand what is known so far, we turn to Chris Yates.",
        "He's the safety and security editor of IHS Jane's Airport Review and he joined us from Manchester, England.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Now, this tail section is a little bit vivid, because you can see Air France in it, as it - you know, you can feel the sense that there's a plane there.",
        "But does it hold anything in it that would get the investigators closer to, say, the black box?",
        "Well, we would hope that that's the case.",
        "Essentially what we're doing at the moment is recovering debris that's floating on the surface of the ocean, including, of course, human remains.",
        "What we saw recovered yesterday was a large piece of that tail section.",
        "But it doesn't in and of itself tell us precisely where the remainder of that tail section or indeed the remainder of the fuselage is, because we're talking essentially about floating debris here.",
        "And as we know, the aircraft went down just over seven days ago, and the currents in the ocean in that part of the world can be quite strong.",
        "So the potential is that that floating debris could have been carried some distance away from the wreckage field on the seabed.",
        "And this is where we need to go now.",
        "This is what we need to find.",
        "We need to locate where those bigger parts of the airplane are to aid us in searching - if there's still life - for the data recorder and the voice recorder.",
        "Now, there's been a fair amount written just lately about the airplane's speed sensors and the possibility that they were giving conflicting readings.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Essentially these are small sensors that, if you will, stick out of the fuselage of the airplane and measure the airflow as it passes over that fuselage.",
        "In the past, there have been instances, particularly on the A330 and the A340, of those sensors becoming blocked by ice at high altitude, therefore giving a certain discrepancy in the readings that the pilot and copilot would see.",
        "And this is just, again, one other piece of information - one sliver of information that we need to be mindful of as we investigate all of the pieces of information to determine what might have caused this tragic crash.",
        "So simply put, still a long way to go to figure this out."

        "We have currently 24 human - sets of human remains, and we have everything to play for before we can determine what is the cause.",
        "And I would stress also that we can't rule out anything at this stage -anything from an act of terrorism through to a computer systems failure onboard the airplane.",

        "It was not in an alternative space.",
        "These were real, live movie theaters, and already the New York Times have refused to cover those particular films.",
        "So we already have a disjuncture between what is the editorial policy of the New York Times and an experience which allowed filmmakers at no small cost to themselves and to their distributors and to their producers and to their financiers, many of whom, you're right, were television, but when you look at the economics of making documentary films, a filmmaker has to resort - and I know you probably don't - but many filmmakers have to resort to some television money.",
        "That puts the filmmaker in what is, you know, frequently a Faustian bargain with, you know, the television broadcaster, and they are going to want to take it to television.",
        "So you've got a number of problems here, but many of which that will exclude many worthy documentary films from being seen both in a theater and also being considered by the Oscar.",
