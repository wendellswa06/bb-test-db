        "Here is a film that almost no distributor is going to take any kind of risk on; the amount of money that it would recoup at the box office would be very, very small.",
        "And so maybe this film is absolutely brilliant.",
        "If it had been - if it were selected by one of the - you know, by DocuWeeks or one of the other, you know, sort of, you know, HBO or whatever, and they could put it into New York for that week, it would not be reviewed by the New York Times.",
        "But, you know, that $20,000 you think is that much, but, you know, with production costs being what they are today, it is a portion of the budget, and people pay that fee.",
        "But so here is a film that would probably not, you know, (unintelligible) much box office at all.",
        "Nobody - no distributor would be willing to take the risk on it because of the - it would not be able to recoup, and it would not be eligible for the Oscar.",
        "So I would say that it is just this kind of maybe gem in the rough that will not be seen by your - you know, the 60 films that are now going to be eligible because they are supported by the mini-majors that are exactly why we should not have this new system.",
        "Michael, quickly?",
        "I think, Neal, the real discussion we should be having, and I think this caller points out what the problem is, is that we need a better distribution system for documentaries.",

        "I'm mainly concerned with the fact that when we say that these are the five nominees of the documentary branch, everybody in the documentary branch has been able to vote on it.",
        "And as I pointed out in the beginning, if you don't think there's something wrong with the system that has cut out Frederick Wiseman, the Maysles brothers, Errol Morris until recently, \"\"Hoop Dreams,\"\" there's clearly something wrong here, and that's because it's been a close-knit thing where it's not been accessible to the entire branch and the entire Academy to vote for.",

        "Pennebaker or Albert Maysles, none of whom, as you say, have ever been nominated, certainly not have won, what you see is a disparity between what people go to, you know, and see in the movie theater and the way that the Academy has traditionally voted.",
        "So the question is not, you know, why - and look, this is in some ways this has all been brought about because \"\"Hoop Dreams\"\" did not get nominated, and again Steve James was again, you know, kind of cut out of the process with \"\"The Interrupters.\"\" So that has kind of sparked this new sort of query.",

        "A&E has done it.",
        "Discovery has done it.",
