        "Hi, yeah, I'm kind of tweaking my initial question a little bit based on recent discussion that you all have had.",
        "I think that part of the problem is that our distribution has changed.",
        "You know, it used to be that we would only see documentaries on PBS, and obviously PBS has systems in place to fund that documentary filmmaking.",
        "Now, we obviously have the cable outlets, which you all have discussed some, and increasingly we have consumers consuming film, including documentary film, on demand through a variety of different sources.",
        "So I think that you all are making some inroads in the process of evaluating documentaries that are Oscar worthy.",
        "But I'm not quite sure that you're done yet because I think we need to think about the consumption end, and it sounds like from both of you, you're interested in having consumers, you know, see and be exposed to more documentaries.",
        "As a filmmaker, you know, I would put earning an Oscar or an Oscar nomination above earning an Emmy, and I hate to, you know, hurt any Emmy Academy people out there, hurt their feelings, but, you know, we have more opportunities for funding and for distribution on television now, which makes the benchmark of, you know, having that theatrical release very, very difficult - from a filmmaker's perspective - to be able to have.",
        "And we've got historical data that supports this.",
        "You mentioned a number of filmmakers that haven't been nominated.",
        "It makes it very difficult for the films to be seen and embraced and considered for, you know, an award.",
        "And that is exactly the problem, is that, frequently, that's where documentary filmmaking - filmmakers get their money.",
        "But is this..."

        "On PBS.",
        "...on PBS, and that that has - that then hampers the ability of a filmmaker to have control over his or her own product.",
        "And so what this young woman is saying is exactly the problem.",
        "But the difference is, you know, historically, it used to be that the best documentaries, the highest-caliber documentaries were things that were distributed via PBS.",
        "Now, filmmakers, you know, they've got better equipment.",
        "There are more sources for funding.",
        "You don't necessarily have to go that route.",
        "So we've got some high - very high-caliber documentaries that are being independently produced and that are being independently distributed, or not getting distribution at all.",
        "Plus we have new distribution outlets for them.",
        "And so I'm not sure that the rules are, you know, right now, really prepared for where we are now and where we're going to be just a couple of years in the future.",

        "I think the Academy believes that it exists to support and promote the theatrical experience of people going to the movies in movie theaters.",
        "But the question is: How do you get it into the movie theater if you are not allowed to have - if you're not allowed to work through some of these more alternative systems, or through four-walling, as you say?",
        "But listen, they can...",
        "But if you make a deal with a broadcaster, aren't you making a deal to be a broadcast movie?",

        "So take a look at even - OK, \"\"Man on\"\" - last year, \"\"Inside Job\"\" did $4 million, which was a lot, obviously.",

        "And, you know, and I think it's really important when you're trying to challenge these big institutions like BP and all this other stuff with - if you're making a brave film, you're going to be doing those things, you know, to diversify, first and foremost, the people that are going to be voting in - on these films, whether they're going to be accepted.",
        "And then the second thing is if you're being funded by, you know, a TV organization, then, you know, they're - those people do have a say in how the film's done.",
        "And I think that, you know, by being able to be in festivals and possibly get momentum behind you, I just feel like diversification of the people that vote on it is really important, and the theater allows you to do that.",
        "And, you know, it's like, for my film, you know, I don't have the resources that even a TV organization had.",
        "I mean, I literally lived with the people of the Gulf and filmed this thing.",
        "And we had a huge response, but, you know, how can I compete against people who were down there and had $100,000 to shoot?",
        "And I just learned, like, you know, taking the money out of the equation - especially for documentaries that are trying to be brave - and challenge these things is important.",
        "Right.",
        "And sometimes when you take that money, like, from, say, PBS, and you're doing a film about an oil company's evil ways, you're taking - it's hard to get that money from a network that depends, often, on those oil companies sponsoring their programs.",
        "So, you know, Neal, if you and I owned a TV network, and let's say Nina or somebody came to us with a documentary idea and we liked it and we gave her the money for it, but then she said to us, yeah, but, you know, I don't really - you know - I mean, TV's OK, but I really think that this, you know, this should have, you know, a theatrical release and - I mean, it's kind of a slap in the face to the TV network to say that.",
        "I mean, that - the TV networks have been great about funding documentaries.",
        "And to act like TV is bad, I mean, TV is always going to reach more people than the movie theatres.",
        "So I would not put down the whole - the TV experience.",

        "There's an award system for the movies.",
        "And my goal is to get more people into the movie theaters and more documentaries into these movie theaters.",
        "That is priority one."
