        "But we move on, topic number two.",
        "California and Colorado prison officials are using an innovative marketing campaign to reduce overcrowded cells.",
        "They are encouraging inmates to transfer to prisons in other parts of the country through a type of infomercial.",
        "Now hear me on this.",
        "In one ad, a felon now housed in Tennessee says - and this is a quote - \"\"you get 79 channels here, including ESPN.\"\" End quote.",
        "Another one says, and here's another quote, \"\"they talk to us like humans, not like animals.\"\" As part of the recruitment drive, folks, wardens are screening to film while reminding prisoners of the violent, overcrowded, racially-charged conditions they face in places like California.",
        "So what was your first reaction when you heard about this, Laura?",
        "Well, the humans quote really blew me away.",
        "So I guess the California prison system is finally acknowledging, along with a lot of other prison systems that should be acknowledging, that they don't treat their inmates like humans.",
        "And if they wanted to be treated like humans, they need to move to another state.",
        "I think that's a really profound statement.",
        "And all the discussion about changing - moving folks out of the prisons system to relieve the overcrowding, they talked about a lot about overcrowding but they didn't talk about any other conditions that need to be addressed.",
        "I would like to see these prison systems address those conditions, which are not just about overcrowding.",
        "They're about horrifically poor management, allowing gangs and other criminal elements to run these prisons.",
        "One of the interesting things about why they say that some prisons are reluctant to voluntarily move is because there's so much gang intimidation.",
        "The gangs don't want their turfs being broken up by these moves.",
        "That is a profound problem that the state of California should be addressing.",
        "Well, Michael Meyers, is this a civil rights issue?",
        "Civil rights issue.",
        "This isn't - look.",
        "This is an issue of people's rights while they're in prison.",
        "So here you are, quote, unquote, \"\"this is a civil rights issue.\"\" But look.",
        "It's not just 79 channels that are going to get people to move out of California prisons.",
        "I mean, there are a lot of those inmates who don't want to leave their lovers behind - their lovers in prison, their lovers outside of prison, and they do have lovers in prison.",
        "How - and by the way, how long does it take to build the prison building?",
        "You know, this enormous amount of time - it takes years to get modern, decent prisons - if you can have a decent prison - maybe it's a job for the Donald, Donald Trump.",
        "Well…",
        "And maybe we ought to just ask the question, are there too many people in prison?",
        "And people who don't need to be in prison, who have not been convicted, for example, of violent crimes - rapists, murderers, people like that - muggers.",
        "They belong in prison.",
        "But there maybe people in prison who don't - who should be out on parole, or probation, as opposed to parole.",
        "And people should be under supervision, but not in prison.",
        "So…"

        "And I'll direct to Bob Meadows, because it seems to me, Bob, one of the issues about building prisons is where to build them.",
        "And people don't want prisons in their own backyards.",
        "A lot of people don't, but some communities do because this brings jobs.",
        "I mean, this is a super industry in the United States.",
        "California was at almost $12 billion that are earmarked toward prison building and reform right now.",
        "That is a big business, and there are communities I know that invite prisons because, like I said, it brings economy.",
        "It boosts the economy and things like that.",
        "And one thing we have to remember about this is the reason California and Colorado are doing this is because a federal judge has told them your prisons are too overcrowded, you have to ease them.",
        "You have to ease the situation.",
        "So they have to come up with something.",
        "And I admit, you know, it sounds that whole ESPN thing, and, you know, the guards treat us and so on, walking by with smaller guards.",

        "What does it matter which state they're in as long as they're in a humane environment?",
        "And it sounds like the places that they're talking about, saying they maybe more humane than they are.",
