        "As part of voluntary integration, Nguni's parents enrolled their 9-year-old son in an all-white elementary school in Malvern, Arkansas.",
        "Here, he remembers his first day.",
        "But before we play that, here's a warning: This piece contains language that will offend some listeners.",
        "We were getting ready for school and I remember my mother was buttoning my top button on my shirt.",
        "And she must have noticed something was wrong with me and she asked me what was wrong.",
        "And I told her that I was scared.",
        "I was afraid.",
        "And she said, of what?",
        "And I said well, suppose one of them called me (bleep).",
        "And she said, look, if a kid called you (bleep), I want you to go and tell the teacher.",
        "We went to school.",
        "This was the third grade and the first, recess came and the boys had a football.",
        "And they were throwing it back to each other.",
        "And they would call, like, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby and they'd throw him the ball in; Johnny, Johnny, Johnny and they'd throw him the ball in, and I would call them and they wouldn't throw me the ball.",
        "So at - after one point, you know, I stopped calling, you know?",
        "I'm just standing and watching.",
        "And one of them missed the ball and it came close to me, and I picked up the ball and I'm - waited for someone to call me so that I could be a part of the game, you know?",
        "And one of the kids ran over and he said, give me the ball, and he snatched the ball from me and he said (bleep) -like that.",
        "So I went and told the teacher, and she went over to the little boy and she said - I can see it just like it was yesterday - she said, did you say that, wagging her finger right at him.",
        "He didn't lie.",
        "He said, yes, he said it.",
        "And she told him, I'm - as I stood there she said, listen, I don't ever want to hear you say that again.",
        "At this point, I'm feeling pretty good, you know?",
        "I've been vindicated.",
        "Then she said, he can't help it that he was a born a little (bleep).",
        "And it's just by the grace of God that you wasn't born a little (bleep).",
        "Now, at the age of 9 years old, it was, like, thank you, I think.",
        "In her mind, she did what she thought was right.",
        "In the little boy's mind, he had been chastised.",
        "He didn't go away, you know, happy.",
        "He went away quite contrite.",
        "She had bawled him out."

        "I think one of the biggest mistakes we make as single mamas is we harbor a lot of bitterness against our ex.",

        "I mean when you think about the African-American community and you look at just the statistics.",
        "I mean the National Center for Health Statistics in 2004 reported that 69.3 percent of all African-American women giving birth that year were unmarried.",
        "So we're talking about most African-American homes.",
        "Most African-American homes are headed by these single moms who need help, but more often than not they're looking to their own families where maybe they didn't have the help that they needed.",
        "I mean these are cycles that are repeating and we really don't know where to go.",
        "And so often the first time we're getting help is when something goes wrong and we're going to a psychologist.",
        "Let me jump in to ask this: How big a factor is the father's new marriage and new family, if that's the case, in dealing with the single mother and his child with her?",
        "It's a factor to the extent that the mother - and single mamas listen to me here when I say this - to the point where the mother makes it an issue.",
        "A child is going to feel jealous, a child is going to feel that am I going to be left out?",
        "But it's up to the mother to make that child understand that you are loved, you are loved by me, you are loved by your dad so that everybody is loving the child and the child understands that this is not less, this is more for him.",
        "And then if the father in his new relationship or new marriage ends up having more children, the same thing.",
        "But if you're creating issues and your kid's coming home and you're saying, oh well, you know, did your dad give her this and you're creating those kinds of problems, all you're doing is you're giving your kid more issues to have to deal with."

        "I talk about old-fashioned things like rent parties.",
        "A rent party where let's say that your talent is poetry.",

        "Well, you know, Tony, I think in a world where all things are equal, that question wouldn't even have to be asked, but unfortunately we don't live in that world.",

        "And they feel like, you know, there's nobody who's really kind an advocate for them.",

        "Don't be afraid that maybe too much time has passed or that there's too much bitterness that has developed maybe between you and the child's mother.",
        "Your kids need you.",
        "Your boys need you, but your girls need you too.",
        "Because you better believe that when girls are out there making bad choices, that has to do with self-esteem and there's nothing like a father to help a child develop his or her self-esteem.",
