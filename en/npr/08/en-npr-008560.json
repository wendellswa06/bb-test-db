        "It's unfortunate that that's what politics has become.",
        "But I don't let the game of politics influence what I say and who I will become, because in that way, this process would eat you up and spit you out, and then you look up and you won't know who you are.",
        "Barack and I made a promise to ourselves that in the end of this, no matter what the outcome, when we looked at each other in the eye, we would still be able to recognize one another.",
        "And I still recognize him.",
        "He is the same man I fell in love with 19 year ago, and I believe he can say the same thing about me.",

        "It's to the tune of a Sam Cooke song, don't know much about history, don't know much about the economy, and they're talking about John McCain in this ad.",
        "And Barack Obama, throughout the campaign, has said that he would rise about the old politics, that he wouldn't engage in the old politics of cynicism.",
        "Yet I hear quite a bit of cynicism in that ad.",
        "I think Barack has done a phenomenal job of staying above the fray.",
        "I mean, this has been a 19-month battle, and we still live in a political climate.",
        "I think that you don't get the level of inspiration that you're seeing on the ground with this campaign, you don't get folks who are engaging in politics for the first time.",
        "We've got so many young people engaged.",
        "Folks are not doing this because they're cynical or believe that Barack is a cynical candidate.",

        "When you're working with a vulnerable population, you can't really just put nurses on the end of a phone and have them case manage through that sort of outreach.",

        "And with that, Dr. Anderson considers the state's 5 percent savings goal realistic.",
        "I think particularly the companies who do this oftentimes go, quote, \"\"at risk,\"\" and if they don't get the savings, then they also give up their profit, and so I think that they're starting at a level they pretty much feel they can achieve or they're not going to put themselves at that much risk, and so I think these are doable.",
        "Texas is one of just eight states implementing anything like this plan, according to McKesson.",
