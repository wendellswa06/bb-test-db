        "It's sort of a stressful maneuver.",
        "Or they'll turn to - they have sort of what's called a dedicated, left-turn phase.",
        "This is when you have the green arrow that allows only you to make a left turn.",
        "This is sort of better for the driver, but it's worse for the intersection as a whole, because every time you give that special phase, you're taking away from all the other motions in that intersection.",
        "So a left turn phase is incredibly inefficient in the eyes of engineers.",
        "Oh, so it makes you have to just sit there and wait forever and ever and ever for the person to make a left turn.",
        "And if they're texting or on the phone and don't see it and don't make the turn while the green light's there, you have to wait for a whole another cycle to go through.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Or several cycles.",
        "And then just to complicate things further, you know, by the time that left - that green left arrow turns yellow and then red, they even have to build in a few extra seconds, what's called the clearance phase, to make sure every driver has gotten out of the middle of that intersection.",
        "The clearance phase has only gotten longer as drivers sort of seem to increasingly test those red lights.",
        "And so you have to wait for the intersection to clear, which is, again, adds time.",
        "So you have the idea, right?",
        "You have the idea for us?",
        "Well - now this is, of course, is not my idea, and it only applies in certain situations.",
        "But it's one of the more, let's say, innovative and experimental ideas out there, and it's basically called the diverging diamond interchange.",
        "And this is the sort of thing, it's like - it's a bit - trying to explain it in words is sort of like trying to describe to someone how to tie a complicated knot.",
        "I mean, it's better sort of seen, but I'll give it a go.",
        "Imagine that you're on sort of a north-south arterial road, like in a suburban environment, and you're crossing over a highway, interstate highway, and you want to take - that runs east-west.",
        "So you're going north.",
        "You want to go west.",
        "You need to take a left turn to get onto that intersection.",
        "In a normal sort of situation, you would go over the interstate and probably have a green arrow - wait for that green arrow to have to take a left turn across those lanes of traffic."
