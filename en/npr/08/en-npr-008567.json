        "Well, you know, it is confusing to describe.",

        "And there's no left-hand turn.",

        "You build up a muscle memory of how to drive.",
        "You're suddenly asking someone to go on what they think of as the wrong side of traffic.",
        "So before this first interchange was rolled out, it was tested in driving simulators for a number of years from the Federal Highway Administration.",
        "And, you know, they find that with proper signage, you know, people can get it.",
        "Just sort of show them what to do.",
        "And people always will say, you know, well, this looks so complicated.",

        "And a regular sort of four-way intersection may, you know, look simple.",
        "But that simplicity, you know, sort of masks something which is going on there, which is that drivers often sort of let their guard down when they're going through that.",
        "And this is why roundabouts are sort of a safer solution because - precisely because it feels a little bit more risky.",
        "You have to do a little bit more negotiating on your own.",
        "You're a little bit more vigilant.",
        "And, in a four-way intersection, if you have a green light, your mind sort of shuts off and you're not really looking for hazards from the side or someone who might have run a red light.",

        "And we're talking about a new way to make a left turn.",

        "Do you, Tom?",
        "Yes.",
        "But I fear that to try to describe the difference between those two would take us into probably another show and a level of complexity.",
        "But one difference is, as I understand it, this diverging diamond interchange is what's known as a two-phase system - seen, again, we're already getting into a complexity here.",
        "Let's just say that the diverging diamond has been shown in studies to be more efficient and has a better safety record, also a bit cheaper to install than a single-point.",
        "This is an important consideration when designing these large interchanges, especially over bridges.",
        "You're looking to save as much money as possible and the divergent - diverging diamond has been shown to be about half the cost of traditional diamond interchanges and other types of intersections.",
        "So just another thing to keep in mind.",
        "But I fear we will lose even more listeners if we go into a...",
        "If we go into that.",
        "I'm going to ask you in a moment about the design that we were talking about, because it seems to me that it would work better in rural or suburban areas than it would in downtown Detroit or Manhattan or Los Angeles or even here in the District.",
        "The single, biggest part of my left turn strategy is using my blinker.",
        "This comes from Jeff Arnold.",
        "The next part of my strategy involves watching the traffic flow and looking for turn alternatives.",
        "Ideally, I'll make my left at a light, even if that means turning left a couple of blocks before or after my actual intended turn.",
        "If no light is available, then I'll look for a break in the traffic which will let me turn across multiple lanes, a block or two before or after where I actually want to turn."
