        "It's - and it's certainly worked out with the number of contracts and designs that you have now created.",
        "What is so different about what you did and what you do in your designs now compared to the camouflage of 10 years ago?",
        "Well, early on in the research side of coming up with Jordan's camouflage, I had read that fractals - which are repeating geometric shapes found in nature - would be the ultimate camouflage to put into a camouflage pattern.",
        "These are patterns that your brain and subconscious identify, catalog.",
        "And then the next time you go into that environment, it ignores all these typical shapes that it sees in the background.",
        "And so if you can incorporate those shapes in that environment, you're going to have the adversary glance over your particular camouflage over one of the previous existing camouflages.",
        "And so I was able to actually create algorithms within the program.",
        "So the programs that we use are very specialized with our company that'll bring in these fractals.",
        "And we've now got, I think, 13 different algorithms that we can factor into any particular pattern to come up with a better pattern over what we had previously done."

        "Yeah.",
        "You can - when you design camouflage, you can put the appearance of three-dimensional backgrounds within the camouflage itself.",

        "And then they've asked for a fourth pattern which would be for their gear, which is typically made on more expensive material.",

        "I mean that seems like the U.S.",
        "Army would want the camouflage to match where they anticipate it being used.",
        "Well, they do, and that's why they've come out with this new solicitation.",
        "But the one that they're currently using was meant as an all terrain to work in all environments.",
        "And they found through the research that it doesn't work in any of the environments that they've tested it in.",
        "It actually performed so poorly, it was in the bottom 10 of the four backgrounds that they tested it in."
