        "I mean, it seems like it would be very difficult to come with a standard - to come up with a standardized camouflage, because our military is stationed all over the world and no one place looks like another.",
        "Well, it is, and there are limitations in the way they put forward this solicitation for the design parameters.",
        "We need - they're looking for something that will identify a U.S.",
        "soldier.",
        "So the desert and the woodland patterns and the transitional all need to look very similar in the pattern makeup.",
        "The colors can change.",
        "But that's a limitation that we don't like working with because we can do a better job if we don't have those handcuffs on when we're designing.",

        "So there's always limitations in all programs that we deal with out there.",
        "No country is the same as another one with what they require.",
        "Some - often they're looking for something that looks very similar to what they previously wore.",
        "In the case of Afghanistan, they were looking for something different than what all the coalition troops were using out there.",
        "It became very dangerous if they would match those coalition troops.",
        "And so their camouflage may not be very effective in the daytime there.",
        "But at the time when the solicitation came out, most of the combat by the Afghan National Army was being done at nighttime.",
        "And so they wanted something that was very effective at night.",
        "And the camouflage that they're using now, called our Spec4ce Forest Pattern, actually has a range of about five yards at nighttime without night vision goggles.",
        "It blends right in with the background.",
        "And so it does offer them some protection in the day.",
        "And now, of course, they're taking over for security throughout the country.",
        "It may be something that they have to reconsider, the coloration that they've used, because they're now fighting in both day and night.",

        "That's actually an excellent point.",
        "That's a very good point.",
        "I was in Air Force Air National Guard when General McPeak decreed that all Air Force personnel would wear camouflage.",
        "Well, it went from $6 a uniform to $60 for a uniform for this camo.",
        "And this was for people that were working on Air Force flight lines.",
        "They were working behind the lines, so to speak.",
        "And you know, everybody, you know, now wears camo - but with these expensive uniforms.",
        "But there's really - how many people actually need camo to work, you know, to be a frontline soldier?",
        "Jay, thank you so much for the call.",
        "Let's bring that question to Guy.",
        "What Jay is saying is that this is really expensive.",

        "Some of the latest - one of your latest products is actually creating a lot of buzz in the military material community.",
        "You call is SMARTCAMO.",
        "What is that?",
        "SMARTCAMO is a material that can actually change color from a woodland coloration, so you have a camouflage that starts off in the woodland.",
        "And it can actually transition to a desert or transitional or even a very bright colored camouflage that would work well in winter conditions.",
        "And so what we want to offer is something that provides the soldier or the item that we're trying to protect, whether it be a tank or aircraft, the ability to not just have the static camouflage on it, but be able to adapt to the surroundings as it moves through from one environment to another.",
        "And for a rapid deployment force, this becomes very effective for them to carry as little weight as possible.",

        "But tell us a little bit about this study.",
        "What were you looking at?",
        "What were you trying to compare in terms of age length or longevity?",
        "Well, the reason that we wanted to do this was because it's long been suspected that humans were pretty unique in their aging patterns.",
        "That's a natural thing to suppose when you compare humans to almost any other animal that we sort of have ready access to because we obviously live so much longer than most of them.",
        "But what we had never really had available was a reasonably large set of other species of animals that are pretty closely related to humans, like primates are.",
        "And so our dataset really offered an opportunity to do that.",
        "We particularly looked at two different ways of measuring aging, or I should say two different measures that contribute to aging.",
        "One is what we call the initial mortality rate.",
        "It's the rate at which animals are dying when they enter adulthood, that initial mortality rate at adulthood, which varies.",
        "In some species, it's higher; in some species, it's lower.",
        "But it sort of sets the pace of aging, if you will.",
        "And then the other thing we looked at was the rate at which the probability of dying increases as a function of age.",
        "So those are the two metrics we looked at.",
        "Well, do - I mean, I presume that all primates don't enter adulthood at the same relative age.",
        "Or do they?",
        "That's right.",
        "No, no, they don't.",
        "Every species has its own life-history pattern, and every species reaches adulthood at a different age.",
        "Nonetheless, the rate of mortality at the onset of adulthood is one of the metrics that sort of sets the pattern of mortality throughout the lifespan.",

        "It's considered an important component of aging.",
        "Huh.",
        "So where do these statistics come from?",
        "I mean, you say you have these datasets.",
        "How have they been collected?",
        "Well, so that's one of the really exciting and special things about our dataset.",
        "We had seven different groups of researchers come together for this study, each of whom have been watching primates in the wild for at least 25 years.",
        "That literally means day in, day out, somebody's in the field watching every animal in the study population and collecting data on how long they lived.",
        "Gosh, can we get together and start comparing these data across these very diverse primates - two South American species, one Madagascan species and several African species - and really look at comparative mortality patterns in a way that had never been done before.",
        "Right.",
        "And, I mean, so how - the differences, then, are not explained by some sort of internal clock ticking at a different rate, or at least that's what your data seems to be showing.",
        "Well, I don't know if I'm going to give an opinion about the internal clock.",
        "I think that what our data show is that there is a lot of similarity in those two basic aging metrics across all these different primates.",
        "And humans are not outliers.",
        "So many factors.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We did say if people are doing food events associated with it, that it should be as local as possible and also themed to the book.",
        "In fact, if you look at human females, they pretty much cluster right in there with a couple of other species of primates, and it's hard to differentiate, statistically, the human data from the data on other primates.",
        "If you look at human males, human males do age more slowly than other primates, which is interesting because if we just consider humans, we think of males as aging more rapidly than women, and we think of men as living shorter lives than women."
