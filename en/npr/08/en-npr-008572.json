        "But if you compare men to other male primates, human males are actually aging more slowly than other male primates.",

        "It's a small difference.",
        "It's a significant difference, but it's a small difference in men.",
        "And in women, it's actually not statistically significantly different in either metric.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, so in the overall primate dataset, we found pretty clear evidence that males live shorter lives than females.",

        "It's been known from a number of other species in the last few years, actually.",
        "People have started to compile these kinds of data on other wild animals.",
        "And there's pretty good evidence that in species that are monogamous, where males don't compete intensively for access to each mating opportunity, male and female mortality patterns are more similar to each other than they are in species where males compete intensively for access to reproductive opportunities, in polygynous species.",
        "Wait, wait.",

        "They just got disease, or they died in childbirth or childhood diseases, and that throws off the statistics.",

        "OK.",
        "Well, what do you think?",
        "I mean, we are sort of talking, Dr. Alberts, about the difference between lifespan and aging, I guess.",
        "Well, yeah, I'm actually going to respond to Glen's question, which I think is a really interesting and important one, by saying that it's a really hotly debated question whether or not prehistoric humans had lifespans that look like our lifespans.",
        "And many people say not possible, they must have died at a much younger age.",
        "It's unthinkable that we had anybody living to the age of 80, say, in prehistoric times.",
        "And the fact is that the data are not in yet on that.",
        "I think that eventually we will be able to have large enough sample sizes of skeletons that we can age, that we can estimate the ages at death for, to get a really good answer to that question.",
        "But at the moment, it's pretty speculative, much as it's been speculative that humans age differently than other primates until this dataset became available."

        "I'm not going to speculate about that.",

        "It's very hard to get high-quality DNA from wild primates because they don't give up their DNA that easily.",
        "And it's pretty challenging to get those kinds of samples.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "However, what evidence there is suggests pretty clearly that primates, like all animals, as far as we know, have the same problem with telomeres that humans have, which is that they shorten with age.",
        "It's a fascinating field, and I thank you so much for staying up and -OK, sorry, we just - we have time I guess for one more quick question.",
        "Why are these - I mean, you mentioned that DNA was hard to get a hold of.",
        "Why so?",
        "I mean, you don't need very much to be able to do some sampling.",
        "Well, that's true, but you have to get tissue from the animals to do it, and many primates are endangered, which means that it's very difficult to get permission to dart them or immobilize them in order to get tissue.",
        "Even if you can get permission, it could be logistically challenging to dart an animal that lives in the trees.",
        "Increasingly, actually, a lot of primate biologists are using fecal samples, dung samples, to get low-quality DNA that you can nonetheless do a lot of work with if you try really hard.",
        "OK, well, I'm sorry.",
