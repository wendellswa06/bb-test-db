        "Hmm.",

        "Right.",
        "And on the other side of the wall, things are pretty unregulated, down at the bottom of the heap, as they usually are.",
        "And we do have a very idealistic green religious group growing vegetables and bees on rooftops.",
        "And there's evolved there a whole theology and their own set of hymns and rules.",

        "And over decades, it was taken up by children.",
        "And students at Cambridge, Oxford and MIT took over tiddlywinks in the mid-1950s, drawing contestants from the kind of math and engineering prodigies who probably didn't want to wring their heads playing football.",
        "The object of the game is to sink the most winks.",
        "That's called potting.",
        "It's basically two things - the pressure for the distance, and you got to cut the section of arc between in the cup."

        "Piddle is when you are on top of another wink and you choose - it's in relation to a pile, and you try and squeeze that wink out from under everything else.",
        "It's a very fairly gentle, delicate, high-precision shot.",

        "Tiddlywinks is fun to watch.",
        "There's something lovely in the flight and tumble of a well-shot wink.",
        "The game is quicker than baseball, easier to follow than hockey, and if you want a beer, you don't have to pay $10.",
