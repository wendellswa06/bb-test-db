        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...expedition should be run.",
        "A few years ago a scientist came out with a research paper looking backwards on the winter, that winter of 1911, and she wrote that, you know, we can't blame it all on Scott because the records show that was an incredibly brutal winter in Antarctica that year.",
        "And he also went late enough that would push him closer to that winter, didn't he?",
        "He went a few weeks after...",
        "Yes...",
        "... Amundsen had started.",
        "The important thing to realize about Antarctica is that it doesn't have seasons in the same sense that we have...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...in the Northern Hemisphere.",
        "There's a cold season and then a very much colder season.",
        "The cold season, otherwise summer, lasts in a way that the average human would react to for maybe three months, four months at the outside, and it's bounded on either side by terrifically cold temperatures.",
        "What Scott's problem was, as you just said, Ira, was that he started late.",
        "He started in November.",
        "Amundsen started two weeks earlier than that.",
        "And Amundsen was back at his base camp 99 days later.",
        "He was therefore out during the maximum summer period, before any problems of scurvy or whatnot could show up.",
        "Scott was out at least 150 days before finally dying.",
        "And he was in that period, at the end of March, beginning of April, where the transition between anything resembling summer and active winter comes on very strong."

        "What's the ultimate irony of this is that the losers, Scott and his party, they perished out there on the ice, never made it back, they would become the legend, the folk hero myth of the British Empire, where the winner, Amundsen, as you point out in your book, the victor - he faced severe financial problems and - and as you write, become one of the most unhappiest men in the world, never receiving the recognition from the British Empire that he really thought he deserved.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, you have to bear in mind, this is Britain against Scandinavia.",
        "I assure you, in Norway right now, Amundsen is the hero and Scott is the bumbler.",
        "The important thing to realize, I think, about Amundsen was that he was - he was very single-minded.",
        "You have to be if you're going to be successful at this line of work.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It wasn't that Scott was not interested in being first at the pole, but he had other kinds of things that he wanted to have accomplished.",
        "He wanted, for example, both of his expeditions to be regarded as primarily scientific in intent, whereas Amundsen was only interested in the brass rings, because that's what brought in the book contracts and the speaking engagements and so forth, which is how he made his money.",
        "And with Scott, consequently, he spent a lot of treasure in ensuring that he had scientists out on the ice doing the work that they eventually in some cases became quite famous for.",
        "And this is something that should not be lost sight of, even though we see the Scott expedition as being eventually a tragedy.",
        "It wasn't from a scientific perspective.",
        "There was a lot of information and data gathered on both the discovery and the Terra Nova expedition, the second expedition on which he died, that sort of set the stage for all later Antarctic scientific work that continues right up to the present.",

        "He was part of a team that reenacted the Amundsen-Scott journey for a BBC documentary called \"\"Blizzard\"\" in 2006.",
        "And for 72 days he used the same kind of skis Amundsen used.",
        "He wore the same kind of sealskin clothing.",
        "He ate the same type of rations.",
        "He joins us by phone from Chicago.",

        "Now, you didn't do this in Antarctica, did you?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And did you actually climb up the 10,000 feet that these other two teams had to go from sea level to the South Pole, which is so high above, you know - it's altitude sickness.",
        "Did you have that also to contend with in Greenland?",
        "Our expedition actually started on the ice cap around 7,000 feet and then we went through the mountains to mimic Amundsen's route, which is roughly 1,400 miles, and then we ended up - yes, at 10,000 feet on the ice cap.",
        "And the Greenland ice cap and Antarctic ice cap are different in some ways but, by and large, an ice cap is an ice cap.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And did they suffer the same fate, your two teams?",
        "Yes, they did.",
        "In fact, the modern Amundsen team, which I was a dog musher on, we finished the expedition in 72 days, which is a good deal faster than Amundsen did.",
        "And the modern British team struggled mightily and they were pulled off the ice after 99 days.",
        "And I believe their pace was a good bit behind Robert Falcon Scott's original pace, which was an incredible pace for the work that he was doing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "The skis were fantastic, eight-foot wooden skis.",
        "It's just quite a bit heavier and it takes a little bit more on expedition maintenance.",

        "And the same routine, same exact diet and menu every day.",
        "And you are unable to leave on a polar expedition.",
        "So it takes a lot of mental energy to stay focused and to kind of not panic because it is a claustrophobic feeling because you cannot control all your circumstances.",
        "You can't go inside to the warm fire and warm up.",
        "You have to warm yourself up.",
        "That was one of my experiences when I was at the pole in 1979, was just looking out from horizon to horizon and there's no place to go.",
