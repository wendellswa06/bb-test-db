        "For example, interest on IRS debt that's outstanding is compounded daily and is charged on the interest rates, the federal short rate, plus three percent.",
        "I can see so many people taking this credit forgetting that they took it, sell their house in a couple of years, forget that they owe the government five or 6,000 dollars, and then get a tax bill with all the penalties on top of it."
