        "And I'll tell you, big harm is being done in Washington, because what we're showing people in Washington, our politicians, our bureaucrats -what we're showing them is that courage is going to be punished dearly.",

        "Well, thank you.",
        "Yes.",
        "I find it interesting that on the one end, the United Auto Workers were forced to make major concessions which - to General Motors in return for bailout money from Congress, and the UAW represents private contracts.",
        "But on the other hand, we have the Justice Department and the Treasury Department wringing its hands and saying, oh, there's nothing we can do about these executives.",
        "Well, I think that's just hogwash.",
        "I'd say that there are two options: One is to force AIG to declare bankruptcy, in which case then they would have - the government would have the right to go in and renegotiate those contracts with those senior executives.",
        "Or B, do nothing, that is - by nothing, I say refuse to let them have the money and tell these corporate thieves to come get it if they think they can.",
        "The money, I believe, most of it, if not all of it, Tom, was mailed out on Friday.",
        "But to his larger point, Charles Calomiris, people say, look, the UAW had to renegotiate its contracts.",
        "What about these guys?",
        "It's a great question.",
        "And I very much support, in general, and in the case of the UAW, I supported the idea that bankruptcy is the only way for us to go forward.",
        "And so the question is: Why is that that we haven't used bankruptcy more?",
        "Well, we did use it in on case.",
        "We used it in Lehman.",
        "Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy.",
        "And what people are learning from that is that because we don't have a good bankruptcy process tailored for these kinds of financial institutions, that bankruptcy process is going to take years to resolve.",
        "It's going to involve all sorts of very timely - time consuming and costly controversies across borders of different countries.",
        "So one of the things to bear in mind is that while it's not really practical for us to do that in the case of AIG right now, there are things that the government is saying that are kind of consistent with the caller's point.",
        "Number one: We're trying to figure out if we can carve out and sell pieces of AIG, make it a less complex organization and work this out, sort of as if we're in a bankruptcy process.",
        "In fact, we're almost in a bankruptcy process.",
        "The government owns 80 percent of stock.",
        "The government's really calling the tune here.",
        "The government's changed the senior management.",
        "That hasn't happened yet at General Motors, I don't believe.",
        "So, you know, we've actually put AIG through a process which is not legally bankruptcy, but it's very similar.",
        "Furthermore, the administration, it appears, is going to support the Federal Reserve's proposal that we create a new bankruptcy process, effectively something called a bridge bank process - a pre-package bridge bank, to be more specific - for financial institutions going forward so that we do have an orderly way the wrest control from management and to resolve these problems without the same kinds of incentive problems that the caller's worried about.",
        "So the caller is on track, but what he's missing is that really AIG is already in, effectively, a bankruptcy situation.",
        "Eighty percent of its owners are the government.",
        "Management's already been replaced."
