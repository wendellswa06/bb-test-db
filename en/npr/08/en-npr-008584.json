        "And then several of us went home and realized there ought to be a way to make that coherent, into a laser, and we did it.",
        "And - but I'm the guy that was crazy enough to make my own homemade alloy, which a lot of people didn't think would work, and shift it up to where the eye could see.",
        "And that's the whole basis of it.",
        "Ah, did you - why did it take 50 years?",
        "Well because these crystal systems are complicated, how to grow them is complicated.",
        "There are wrong methods and arguments about right ways to proceed, and it just - it's a zig-zag process.",
        "You make a bad move, and then you're going to make another move to find your way, and it just took a long while to get there.",
        "And you had to - as you made progress, you're shifting into more complicated crystals as you go higher in the Periodic Table of the Elements to get the lighter elements that will shift you to higher energy and to shift the color from red to orange to yellow to green and then blue.",
        "And still, green and yellow still a problem, but, well, we're learning.",
        "We're getting there.",
        "Oh, and one other thing I should mention.",
        "If you study this carefully, you find this is an ultimate lamp.",
        "It's right in the current path that the light is being generated.",
        "It's not some kind of secondary process where you heat up something or have a gas discharge, and then the energy is shifted to some other process, and then finally you get light.",
        "No, no, this is right in the current path from one terminal to the other, right in that path is the process that generates the light.",
        "It's an ultimate lamp.",
        "Is that why it works so efficiently?",
        "Yes, and that's why you know that as we get smarter and smarter dealing with complicated materials and get to where we're going, the only loss will be ultimately just ohmic loss, resistive loss because when you move charge you're going to get some resistance, and that's going to be lost.",
        "Do you still have that first...",
        "Yes, yes, in fact three weeks ago, General Electric came here because they now realize that this is coming with a vehemence and changing - that all the lighting is going to be this.",
        "And of course they've got a lot of pride in this, and they could use it for their purposes."

        "So they came here and filmed one morning.",
        "I was pretty rough on them, in a sense, because I said I'm not going to do anything special for you guys.",
        "I believe in you, I've worked with you and all that, but just come in here with your stuff and film.",
        "And so it's in my drawer here.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "It's going to be - you're not giving it to the Smithsonian or anybody like...",
        "Hey, Ira, it's a tiny little crystal, and it's hard to believe that a tiny little crystal, you tickle it with a current, and wham, it'll blind you.",
        "In other words - I don't really don't know what ought to be done.",
        "You know, John Bardeen didn't give his first transistor box to the Smithsonian.",
        "It's here in a museum, and I don't know.",
        "That's an interesting question: Where should things like that go?",
        "But were you worried when this little thing gave off some light that it might blind you?",
        "I mean, you didn't know what would happen.",
        "Yes, yes, but then an expert in light, Zernike, a famous name, started in Europe, his son came from Connecticut, from Perkin-Elmer to see my first lasers, this red stuff, at GE in Syracuse, and I said: Watch out, Frits, you're going to hurt your eye.",
        "And he laughed, and he said no, Nick, since it's visible, and the way this thing has a pattern, I can come into it from the edge, and I can tell right away when I'm overloading my eye.",
        "So if you're experienced, you won't hurt yourself.",
        "But it's true that if you don't know what you're doing, yes, a laser can hurt your eye.",
        "Didn't you also invent the laser diode that's in all the CD, the DVD players?",
        "That was the basis for this.",
        "It's everywhere."

        "And in the group I was in at GE, they give you share stock and a little bit of cash so you can pay the IRS because it would be unseemly to get - to have to pay for something that's a gift that's considered income.",
        "So where did you enjoy - or compare the places where you worked.",
        "You worked with John Bardeen in the invention of the transistor at Bell, and now you worked at...",
        "No, no, I worked with John, he had already come here, and I worked with John, and then I went to Bell and worked with John Moll and then later was in the Army in a group they won't let me talk about too much, it was an intelligence group in Japan.",
        "And then when I got out, I was six years at GE, and that's where this happened.",
        "And then I had a fantastic colleague there, Bob Hall.",
        "Bob's getting a little bit old, but he was a stalwart figure.",
        "He would've been the next Nobel Prize I would've given in the semiconductor field."

        "Yes, yes, and incidentally, I'm with some very good people now, and we've converted the transistor into a laser.",
        "In other words, we've got a transistor that's still a transistor, but it's also putting out a laser signal.",
        "And I'd like to live a little bit longer, and I'm beginning to get a little bit frail, and boy, there's a lot of fun stuff to do yet.",

        "Yes, yes.",

        "It - his transistors are the fastest transistors on Earth, hundreds of gigahertz, and there's a lost signal in there that's important to the operation of the transistor, and it turns out it's not generating heat, it's generating light, and you can arrange it inside to help it a little bit and turn that light into coherent light.",
        "So now there's a coherent electrical signal and a coherent optical signal, and this is going to be the basis of some fantastic chip, and boy, I'd like to see some of that.",
        "But I don't - it's going to take a long time, Ira, because these are complicated things to do and complicated to make, and well, it just takes a while to learn it all.",

        "Well, I think all of us knew yes, it's a light emitter, but we had bitter arguments with various people about which crystals, how to do this and all that.",
        "And I feel good because I was on the right side with the kind of crystal I was doing and in fact told the Reader's Digest writer back then that this is the basis to go in the direction of LEDs in the practical world.",
        "And in the February 1963 Reader's Digest, you'll find that he quotes me for that.",
        "So I'm taking a little bit of credit, but I didn't - I did only a piece.",
        "The other folks added a lot to it, including students, my students.",

        "Now you may find some further versions of it, but you're never going to exceed it, because in principle, this thing can be 100 percent efficient, 100 percent conversion of electrical energy to light energy.",
        "Wow.",
        "There's some practicalities like the ohmic loss, the heat loss from current.",
        "Right, but 100 - well, you mean 99.999..."
