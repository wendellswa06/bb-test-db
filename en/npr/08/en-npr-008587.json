        "But, you know, there is - there's been a sense that something like this might happen.",
        "But this was the first.",

        "So I think, you know, we will see.",
        "In time, we will find out how much will change, if anything, but (unintelligible).",
        "But what about the increase in immigrants?",

        "They wanted to slim things down.",
        "And so they pared it down to the camouflage uniform that you wear in combat and in garrison, as well, and then the blue service uniform.",
        "And that was supposed to be for formal events and for official events.",
        "And they're looking toward bringing the pinks and greens back because the sergeant major of the Army and some other senior officials feel like the ASU is very formal.",

        "Business casual, if you will.",
        "Yes - something that would be your business suit.",
        "And then the casual part of it would be you can take the jacket off, and there's a short-sleeve, button-up shirt underneath.",
        "There have been prototypes developed of these new uniforms.",
        "And they've made some adaptations from what the originals look like.",
        "Tell me about that.",
        "So they started out with sort of just a straight jacket that kind of hit at the hip.",
        "And the feedback was that soldiers really wanted a slightly longer jacket, like, almost, you know, like, a little bit of a skirt coming out from the hip and then a belt.",
        "The belt was really important.",
        "So the latest update of that has the belt added.",
        "And then the women also said they wanted their jacket to look like that.",
        "They wanted to wear a male tie, which is unusual.",
        "Usually women wear, like, kind of a little crosshatch-looking tie.",
        "But they wanted to wear a long, male tie.",
        "And they wanted a pencil skirt."
