        "She knew perhaps as soon as the Indiana, North Carolina primaries, back a couple of months earlier, that there would not be a chance for her to catch him and pledge delegates, and she was relying entirely on persuading a big majority of the superdelegates to come to her standard and leave Barack Obama.",

        "Maybe Hillary Clinton will be back proving you can go all the way to the White House in 2012, or 2016, maybe she will be on the ballot this time.",

        "And are those people, some of those people, going to be unable or unwilling to vote for Barack Obama even if they are Democrats or Democrat-leaning?",
        "I think it is quite possible some of them will be unable to transfer the kind of enthusiasm and loyalty that they had to Hillary Clinton to anyone else, at any time.",
        "But with respect to this specific presidential election in November, I think Hillary Clinton herself said it best when she mentioned two words on Saturday, Supreme Court.",
        "If you care about the issues that have motivated a lot of people in the women's movement, if you care about issues that have motivated a lot of people in the gay rights movement, you are going to have to take a long, hard look at your choice in November and ask, who is going to appoint justices to replace some of the justices on the court who have been on my side of those issues?",

        "And he raised more largely by motivating people through the internet, not just by going out and getting the maximum donation, 2,300 dollars for the primaries, from the maximum number of people, as Hillary Clinton did, but by getting some of those, yes, some of the 2,300 dollar ones, but also getting tens of thousands, and then eventually hundreds of thousands of smaller contributions, so that in the end he had 1.5 million contributors.",

        "That's correct, and it's very critical to separate this or distinguish it from a free market because free market's been tried elsewhere in the world and they failed.",
        "And I think that the only way this will work is with a very carefully regulated market.",
        "And how would somebody get compensated for, well, a kidney?",

        "And then, the kidneys would get allocated just as we allocate deceased donor kidneys, so that every one on the list would have the opportunity to be transplanted.",
