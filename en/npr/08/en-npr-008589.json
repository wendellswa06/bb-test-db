        "So, for example, I think that we need to provide health insurance for all donors, so health insurance could be part of the package.",

        "Well, defend the system that allows for people to die at all.",

        "So that's the first important element to bring to attention.",
        "But the premise or contention that the system of a regulated market might impact significantly those that are dying on the list necessitates an assessment of those who indeed are dying on the list.",
        "There's a substantial proportion of those who die on the list, who may be dying inactive, not able to receive an organ.",
        "And I don't have the data for this, but one might speculate about their suitability for transplantation.",
        "So the premise that people are dying on the list and would - that would be solved by a market - may not hold if individuals are never to receive an offer.",
        "I also want to say something regarding the issues that Dr. Matas has brought forward that we do agree, and that is in the system that we currently have which is relying about half of the donation experience in the United States, it being live donors, we both agree that the care of the live donors can be substantially improved in follow up.",

        "So the premise that people are dying and would be solved necessarily by a compensated package of a cash payment may not be a reality when we examine carefully those who are dying on the list and the suitability of the individuals who are dying.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's one important point to make.",

        "Short of actual cash money.",
        "Short of actual cash money, Neal, because once you introduce cash money, you don't - I know that Dr. Matas is well intentioned by saying that this would be a regulated market, but that's not the reality of what exists in the rest of the world.",

        "The reality of it is when you look at living donor results, which is what we're talking about today, and with our screening techniques, there is not much difference between one organ and another.",
        "And it would be very easy to set a fixed compensation prize in the United States and limit the market to the United States or a geographic area where we can ensure protection of the donors.",
        "So the fact that unregulated markets have failed elsewhere is really not a condemnation of anything other than unregulated markets.",

        "People dying on our waiting list are often young, they're often easy to find a kidney for, and they've just been waiting a long time.",
        "Everybody who goes on the list is a transplant candidate when they go on the list.",

        "And they rejected it because as I'm - quoting them now, \"\"because they're incompatible with the fundamental values and norms that govern transplantation, and because international markets and organs from living individuals appear to involve the exploitation of impoverished people.",
