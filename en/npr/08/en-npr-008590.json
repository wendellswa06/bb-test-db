        "So we're able to, to some extent, regulate this, but I think the question would be would we then have a system of compensation for deceased donor organs?",
        "And although I'm not opposed to it, it's a different proposal than what we're putting on the table today.",
        "After all, when you're talking about living donors, the compensation would actually go directly to the donor.",

        "So I'm kind of on defense on the whole thing, but I feel like hearing my sister's stories that, you know, that's more scary to me than anything else is that what will happen medically, doctors taking candidates for kidneys that shouldn't be candidates or something.",
