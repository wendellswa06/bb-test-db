        "So Joey, if you'd gone ahead with that idea of selling your kidney in the past, you would have been assessed.",
        "Well, the fact is I wouldn't have been able to because my kidney function was even reduced back then not to my knowledge.",
        "But this kidney disease could have been arrested to the point where I actually still could have had some usable function.",

        "This seems to me to be getting awfully close to paying for organs.",
        "Dr. Delmonico, is that the top of the slippery slope?",
        "No, I don't see that as the same at all.",
        "It's a non-fungible benefit of sort in which there can be a reward for an individual to be a donor to make certain that they have ample time to recover and return to work.",
        "I don't see that as the issue.",
        "What I see as a concern is that once you introduce cash payments, you have no justification to fix that.",

        "Well, of course, paid time off is a benefit as is where other states have tax deductions.",
        "And the reason to limit this is because we can provide health care and long-term follow-up if we limit this to a specific country.",
        "If you make a global market, you can't provide health care and long-term follow-up and that's why I am only proposing a very limited, regulated market within this country.",

        "So there will be some people phasing past him a little bit, and some people just coming in to their first appreciation.",

        "So first of all, has her essential concession speech changed the outlook, at all, on whether or not she could be the V.P.?",
        "Ultimately no. Ultimately, that is a decision that he has to make on the basis of what he thinks is best for his presidency, and the campaign to get there.",
        "He has appointed three people who are going to vet candidates and give him a recommendation.",
        "And he wants to give them weeks in which to operate.",
        "But there was a period of time last week, right after the last primary and before her concession speech, in which a tremendous force was building within the body politic of her supporters, essentially demanding that being as how they have tied essentially, and the popular vote, and she was not far behind in pledged delegates, he really had to put her on the ticket, he really had no choice.",
        "And that I think has receded.",
        "Now, what about Bill?",
        "There are some - we talked last week on the show about whether or not Bill Clinton would even be welcomed back into Sylvia's, the big, you know soul food restaurant in Harlem.",

        "Bill Clinton is an incredible campaigner, and he could be an incredible asset.",

        "We do.",
        "Because this is the biggest game, this is the big casino, and he is, as you say, a great campaigner and a great player.",
        "He's going to want to be out there pushing, in the end he's going to be out there pushing for the Democratic candidate.",
        "And yes, I think he has experienced some resentment of Barack Obama.",
        "He keeps referring to him as that young man, this young man and so on.",
        "Clearly, Bill Clinton enjoyed being the top dog and he had envisioned a kind of return to power through his wife's election as president.",
        "That's all been interrupted now and he's going to have to sort it out, he's going to have to come to terms with his feelings.",
        "He's have to decide that he wants to get back into Sylvia's.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "As is Hillary, even if she isn't on the ticket, and by the way one reason she might not be on the ticket would be because of the difficulty of dealing with Bill.",

        "Usually we see the two parties do equally well among the very wealthy who can give the maximum.",

        "With a million and a half people out there who have not maxed out, who can give again and give again and many more people who could be at it, some people think he'll have three million contributors by November.",
        "And that means that even if they are given on average a rather small amount of money, it's going to be an enormous war chest, the likes of which neither party has ever seen for a non-incumbent presidential candidate, and which the Democrats have never seen for a president or a non-incumbent candidate.",
        "So this is just going to change that whole kind of logic that we've had in the past, and I think in the end Barack Obama will refuse public financing and say, I've got my own system that's just as public and just as little-guy oriented.",
        "Very quickly, what about feet on the street, grass roots mobilizers, Democrats or Republicans ahead?",
