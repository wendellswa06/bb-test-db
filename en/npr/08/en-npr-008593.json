        "No one ever talked with Edelman about these potential complications, or how to avoid them.",
        "As a result, he now suffers from eye and kidney disease.",
        "Because of his experience when he was younger, Edelman became a doctor and diabetes specialist.",
        "He works at the University of California, San Diego.",
        "Dr. Edelman says the fragmented care he experienced when he was younger can be blamed on the healthcare system as a whole.",

        "I've gone through hell and back with my insurance company, getting approval for this continuous glucose monitor, which is FDA approved.",

        "So, dread doesn't really sound like a problem that economists would be interested in, but, in fact, it is really a very interesting problem.",
        "And it impacts our decisions because, as you point out, when you're doing things, or specifically, when you're waiting for things that you know are unpleasant, the feeling of dread can sometimes be so overpowering that the waiting is the worst part, and you may actually end up doing things that you might not do otherwise.",
        "So, for example, in our study, we were studying the effect of pain and how that causes the feeling of dread.",
        "And one thing that's very peculiar about pain is, obviously, you want to get rid of the shock as quickly as possible, in terms of how the voltage is.",
        "So, basically, what we did was we had participants undergoing brain imaging, and what we did was we wired up their feet with a little electrode and we administered small electric shocks.",
        "Now, nobody likes these electric shocks and what we were interested in is what it's like to wait for them.",

        "Some people really hate this, and, basically, what they're telling us is, you know, I really hate waiting and, you know, I would actually rather take a larger shock than wait any further for this.",

        "What parts of the brain seem to be turned on or active or what, when this feeling is experienced?",
