        "My blood was infected in my whole body, which caused my foot to swell, and there was pain and everything else.",
        "Doctors tried to avoid it, but McGill's toe had to be amputated.",
        "And, with it, a lot of natural padding on the bottom of his foot was also removed.",

        "I'm going to use a little bigger needle than I normally use, because we're going to go in and...",
        "At Chicago's Rosalind Franklin University Hospital, McGill's doctor, Stephanie Wu, injects his foot with silicone, to help build up the padding and reduce the pressure on his foot.",
        "But McGill's still in pain.",
        "Surgery would help, but he can't afford it.",
        "A 675 dollar custom-made shoe could stabilize his foot, but he can't afford that, either.",
        "After McGill maxed out on his hospital bills, his insurer dropped his coverage.",

        "So how did this happen?",
        "When did you see the little guy?",
        "Well, we want to know two things.",
        "The first thing is we want to understand what dread is and, like you pointed out, it's very hard to know that simply by asking people, because it's a vague emotion.",
        "So, by using brain imaging, we can understand what dread is by where in the brain it manifests itself.",
        "So the way we did that is we focus on a network of areas known as the pain matrix, because, after all, people, in this case, are waiting for something painful.",
        "Now, pain is interesting, because it's not something that's just a matter of hurting.",
        "I mean, pain is actually comprised of things like how hard a person is stimulated, whether it's scratching, or whether it's a burn, how hot or how hard.",
        "These things affect you.",
        "But it's also affected by things like attention and by things like emotion.",
        "And all of these things augment or increase the amount of pain that a person experiences.",
        "Now, we can map these different functions onto parts of the brain, and by looking at what happens in these different parts of the brain while a person is waiting for something unpleasant, we can see what aspect of this phenomena, whether it's attention or emotion or something else that gives rise to dread.",
        "And the punchline?",
        "Well, the punchline is that dread is not something as simple as fear or anxiety, as you might think.",
        "It actually has a lot to do with the attention that you devote to the part of the body that's about to be hurt.",
        "And the way we know that is because, in the group of people we studied, there were basically mild versions of it, and there were extreme versions of it; and these extreme dreaders, as we called them, were people who couldn't stand to wait so much that they just were willing to take, actually, a more painful shock rather than wait for a less painful one, which is, on the surface, quite illogical.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, that's an interesting set of circumstances and we have a lot of people waiting to ask questions about it.",

        "Landon, welcome to Science Friday.",
        "Hello?",

        "No. No. Still white-knuckle flier.",
        "Okay, so there is dread in anticipation and then, at least, fear during.",
        "What would you say about that Gregory Berns?",
        "Well, those are a combination of emotions I think going on, and that's a really good example of how feelings of dread and anxiety make us do things that we really think are illogical.",
        "Because I'm assuming that you have to fly or you would like to fly places rather than drive.",
        "I'd like to fly, but the last time I tried, I purchased the tickets and then ended up having to cancel it because I could not bring myself to get on the plane.",
        "Wow.",
        "Yes, that sounds like a pretty severe case of dread and anxiety.",
        "Now, what our findings suggest about that is one of the key aspects about dread, that I don't think we fully appreciated before, was the effect of attention.",
        "So one of the things that I think can be helpful in these circumstances is distraction.",
        "Because when you're sitting there in the airport or whether you're driving to the airport, I mean, you're really only thinking about one thing and that is getting on the plane.",
        "And we can assume that, if you distract yourself, or at least try to distract yourself, it will probably decrease the dread.",
        "Well, I've found that if I take music with me or something else to listen to for the length of the flight, and I sort of gauge that, that this is a two-hour flight so I need two hours of music, I use that as sort of a helpful distraction.",
        "And I also use different homeopathy remedies to sort of calm that anxiety.",
        "Robert, it's an interesting problem, but I like this idea, Greg Berns--and thanks for your call, Robert--I like this idea of distraction, but at some point, your attention tends to wander back to the thing you're dreading."
