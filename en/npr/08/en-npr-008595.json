        "I had a question--I had read a book, \"\"Poe's Heart and the Mountain Climber,\"\" where it talks specifically about fear and anxiety and the difference.",
        "And you're talking, today, about pain and dread.",
        "And I was wondering if you could elaborate more on--are these the same thing, just looked at in different angles?",
        "Or are they very specifically different: anxiety versus dread, fear versus pain.",
        "They sound like kind of different sides f the same thing.",
        "That's an excellent question, and I get asked this a lot.",
        "Now, I--just try to imagine what this experiment is like so--we have people lying on their back in an MRI scanner and we have electrodes on their foot.",
        "And they've already experienced it, because we gave them test shocks.",
        "And, basically, what it feels like is a sharp needle jab.",
        "Now, what's actually happening is we give them a signal at the beginning of each trial that says you have to wait anywhere from, say, one second to almost 30 seconds.",
        "Now, I think what's happening, and I can vouch for this, having done the experiment myself, is that it's not so much the fear of the pain in this case, it's just that you just can't stand waiting for it.",
        "And it's the waiting itself that's the thing that people want to avoid.",
        "And that's, I think, what we're talking about here with dread.",
        "Because people aren't afraid of the pain, per se, it's more like they're afraid of the waiting; and it's the case that you build these things up in your mind that are so much greater than the actual event itself, that the shock or the pain actually provides relief from dread.",
        "So I think it is a little bit different than fear or anxiety, because the people aren't afraid and they're not really even anxious, I think, by the same kind of definition.",
        "It's really almost a, it's like an, oh my God, do I have to wait for this thing?",
        "Just get it over with.",
        "And that's a little bit different.",
        "Is that clear, Mark?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "And if I understand, then the person going, say, to get a shot, the dread would occur when they actually sit down in the chair, whereas the anxiety is more about going to the doctor in general.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "It could be--it could be both.",
        "I think what we noticed in this experiment is that a piece of information, and it's hard to know because we're being bombarded with things like this, but it was actually the information that we gave to the person that said you're going to be shocked and you have to wait this long, which is what triggers this dread response.",
        "So the example of the doctor is--you kind of--there could be several phases where you experience dread: one is when you make the appointment, one is when you get in the car, and then one is when you're sitting in the office.",
        "And kind of--each one of these gives like a little bump in your dread response.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Mark, thanks for that call.",
        "And we're talking with Gregory Berns, who's performed this really interesting experiment that attempts to get at where in the brain this feeling that we're all familiar with, called dread, comes from."

        "I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Dr.",
        "Berns, I want to ask a question that's always bothered me.",
        "And that is, this notion that--tell me first of all, what exactly--when these people get into these brain scanners, what are--what's being measured in this scan?",
        "That's an excellent question, Joe.",
        "Basically, what we're doing is taking movies of the brain.",
        "And what the measurement itself is, is actually blood flow.",
        "It turns out that the brain is kind of like a muscle that, when certain parts are being used, they recruit more blood to it because they're using oxygen and their metabolism is increasing and so they need more blood.",
        "And that is, in fact, what we're measuring.",
        "I see.",
        "But--so just to follow that example.",
        "The thing that's always bothered me is if you say, okay, a muscle needs more energy, well, you can see that because someone runs or they lift weights or something like that, but it seems to me that there's, somewhere there's a leap of faith to say, okay, this brain muscle is doing something, but what it's related to may be dread or it may be, you know, when you experience these feelings of dread you simultaneously experience feelings of ennui, in another, you know, something like that.",
        "And so it seems to me very hard to know what this extra blood flow, in this particular case, actually signifies.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, that's what--one thing we've learned about the brain is that if you have, kind of a pet emotion, whether it's dread or fear or love or happiness, it's almost certainly the case that you can't point to one single region and say, aha!",
        "That's the part of the brain that does that.",
        "So one thing that we've learned is that all of these functions, whether they're things like attention or emotions, are generally accomplished by a network of regions.",
        "And so, since these are networks, they can be kind of put together in different ways to accomplish the functions.",
        "Now, I think we've gotten more sophisticated with brain imaging these days and it's not simply that we're just saying, well, this part of the brain is more active or it's not.",
        "In fact, what we did was actually looked at the time course of that activity and its relationship to the specific events in our experiment.",
        "And we have some theory to go on here.",
        "Actually, as economic theory, strangely enough, that--there are a few theories out there that predict what happens while people are waiting for things.",
        "And it's quite perverse, because waiting is not really an event, it's just a state of mind.",
        "Right.",
        "So, you back home?",

        "And so we're specifically looking for patterns of activity that followed a particular time course; namely one that was highest when we presented the cue that said you have to wait, and then actually declined as the shock approached.",
        "So this is different than anxiety, because anxiety would be expected to grow as the shock approached in time.",
        "But dread is something different, because you can actually see it in people when they're doing this.",
        "It's when they get shocked they actually breathe a sigh of relief.",
