        "Fortier, right in your ballpark here.",
        "Yes.",

        "Some of them have great clinical evidence to support their use.",
        "In horses, there's not a great amount of literature to support the use of lasers, but there are many, many single-case reports like you're describing.",
        "Thank you.",
        "If I were to go into your surgery lab, where you do your surgery in your operating room, would it look like a place that a human might be having surgery?",
        "Do you have a nurse, assistants, you know, anesthesiologist, things like that?",
        "It looks exactly like that.",
        "I think the biggest difference is that one, it's all women.",
        "So usually the anesthesiologist, the anesthesia resident, the student, me, the nurse, it's women across the board.",
        "So that a little bit different, especially in orthopedics.",
        "Because?",
        "Because something like 85 percent of the veterinary classes are women, and still - and it's probably close to that in human medicine, as well, but in orthopedics, it's still a male-dominated field.",
        "So it looks exactly like that.",
        "When we do have surgeons come from hospital for special surgery, we do a lot of collaborative with them on animal-modeled diseases.",
        "And their biggest comment is that, you know, if you were going to get operated, I'd say okay, jump up here, and then inhale this gas three times, and you're going to go to sleep.",
        "To put a horse under anesthesia, it takes five or six people.",
        "It's very, very labor intensive to put them under anesthesia and then hoist them up and get them onto the table.",
        "So it's more the labor, but the equipment for the anesthesia, the equipment for the surgery, the techniques are all identical.",
        "Now, Dr. Gill, when you go out to the farm and work on a cow, same thing happens, right?",
        "Well, actually, we do perform several types of surgeries on cows.",
        "You have a big clean room?",
        "You bring the cow into the operating theater?",
        "I'm usually swatting flies, trying to keep them out of my incision, actually."

        "So they're not coming to your office.",
        "No, no, if we - they are somewhat limited, but we do abdominal surgery.",
        "We do C-sections on the farm.",
        "I'll tell you, it is a little bit like medicine must have been back in the 1800s, I guess, because if I have a C-section, for instance, what'll happen is I will pick one of the farmhands who's willing to help.",
        "I'll show him how to scrub.",
        "I'll put his gloves on.",
        "I'll tell him not to touch anything until I tell him, and we prep the cow, and away we go.",

        "Right there in the barn, set up a straw bale for our surgery table, and if we're fortunate, we may have enough light.",
        "If we're not, then we just go.",
        "That's because your cow is more of a commodity than…",
        "Well, the other thing, too, there are large-animal veterinary clinics in the country where they will truck in cows.",
        "Obviously, Cornell has a great facility for trucking in dairy cattle, and if it's something more - if it's an intestinal surgery or something that I think needs to be - have a little more skill, we'll refer those to Cornell.",
        "But the thing is, dairy producers are busy folks.",
        "They've got a lot on their plate.",

        "No, a big part of what we do in the dairy business is cows, like any mammal, produce - they start to lactate and produce milk after they've had a baby.",
        "So a cow has to have a calf in order to make milk.",
        "And so financially, it's very, very important for the producer to get these cows bred and then re-bred after they've calved.",
        "And so we go out on a regular basis and do reproductive exams on the cattle, diagnose pregnancies, and when cattle are not pregnant try to figure out why they're not getting pregnant.",
        "And so you're palpating the uterus?",
        "I'm actually doing a palpation of the cervix, the uterus, the ovaries.",
        "We can even guesstimate somewhat what the structures on the ovaries are.",
        "We do also, for many of our herds, use ultrasound so we can actually see.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "No, I think a lot of people in the audience have taken animals to veterinarians, at least their pets from home, and so, you know…",
        "What's - it's not cheap now to do any of these surgeries on animals, is it?",
        "It's not because owners expect good care for their animals.",
        "They expect high-quality care, and high-quality care is expensive."
