        "Yes.",
        "It's a multifactorial reason.",

        "Also most of students graduate with a huge debt, about $80 to $100,000 in student loans, before they complete four years of bachelor degree and then four years of veterinary education.",
        "So many of them elect to going to a small-animal practice that is a little more profitable than going to large-animal practice.",
        "And so, the is a shortage of large-animal veterinarians and, as you say, particularly in New York, to that point that we have authorized Canadian veterinarians to come in to the upper-tier counties and practice their medicine in New York.",

        "And in those cases, we veterinarians need to work with entomologists and ecologists to really understand all the cycle of these diseases transmitted by arthropods.",
