        "Could you understand how the symbolism of a vote like this might feel like progress?",

        "Is that an accurate rendering of what's going on right now?",
        "Is his view of Israel correct?",
        "It is, in the current context, Israel is surrounded by neighbors, minus Jordan, that are more or less hostile, just as Palestinian children grow up feeling that they don't have the opportunity for charting their own future that they want and deserve.",

        "NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has more on yesterday's ruling.",
        "By a 5-4 vote, the Court struck down the District of Columbia's ban on handguns, declaring for the first time that the Constitution protects not just gun ownership connected with military service, but private gun ownership for self defense.",
        "Writing for the court majority, Justice Antonin Scalia said handguns are the preferred weapons for self defense, because in his words, a handgun can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police.",

        "Nor should it cast doubt on laws banning guns in places like schools or government buildings, or laws that impose conditions and qualifications on the sale of guns.",
