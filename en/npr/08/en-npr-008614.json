        "Here's NPR's Peter Overby with a look at that controversy.",
        "McCain has always said that his letters to the FCC had just one purpose, to push the commissioners to get on the ball and do something.",
        "He said it in 2000.",
        "I would do the same thing again at almost any time.",
        "And he said it this week.",
        "That's the key to it.",
        "The key to it is that I said just make a judgment.",
        "The deal involved three broadcasters.",
        "Pittsburgh Public Television, WQED, would sell one of its two stations to Cornerstone, a Christian broadcaster; and Cornerstone would transfer its Pittsburgh station to Paxson Communications, which was shopping for a Pittsburgh outlet.",
        "McCain chaired the Senate Commerce committee, which oversees the FCC.",
        "Lowell Bud Paxson, of Paxson Communications, had made his fortune by founding the Home Shopping Network.",
        "In 1998 and '99, Paxson, his family, company executives and law firm gave McCain at least $30,000.",
        "He also helped McCain raise money.",
        "approve the license transfers, reject them, or kill them by not acting.",
        "That's because the three broadcasters had set a deadline.",
        "Washington lobbyist Lanny Davis was working for WQED.",
        "Cornerstone would walk away from the deal unless it was approved by a certain date.",
        "That upset date, as it's known in the trade, was December 31st, 1999, so when the broadcast lobbyists were reaching out to McCain, community activists in Pittsburgh were trying to run out the clock."

        "We did not ask him to intervene and move the FCC to make a decision.",

        "Lanny Davis was there and remembers making a proposal.",

        "For conservatives, it was pretty close to the best of times, and for liberals it was pretty close to the worst.",
        "Although Roberts and Alito both promised that their confirmation hearings to honor precedent whenever possible, in their first full term together, they effectively reversed a number of key precedents - in each case, by a five-to-four vote.",
        "The court upheld the federal law banning so-called partial birth abortions, though it has struck down a nearly identical state law just seven years ago.",

        "I simply limited the earlier decision to its facts, or I refused to extend the earlier decision.",
        "The court was more polarize than at any time in recent memory, with fully one-third of the court's decisions reached by a five-to-four vote.",
        "And the liberals spoke with an unusually unified voice in dissent.",
        "As Justice Stephen Bryer put it in the school desegregation cases, it is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much.",

        "No justice has had so strong an influence on a Supreme Court term in at least 40 years.",

        "This faux-judicial restraint, said, Scalia is judicial obfuscation.",

        "It's as if Justices Scalia and Thomas would like to come in and blow things up.",

        "Part of what you're seeing may be that he finds Roberts and Alito less scary than Justices Scalia and Thomas, because they aren't bomb throwers.",
