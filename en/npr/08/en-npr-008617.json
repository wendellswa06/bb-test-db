        "Well, fishermen throughout that area knew that there were populations of cod that either currently spawned along the coast or used to.",

        "But if you had income other than W-2 income from an employer - say you had a side job, a gig job driving for one of the car services on the side - you're going to have to fill out one, two, maybe three forms.",
        "So it's a little more complicated.",
        "But they say it was a tradeoff to get us to a lower tax rate and broader tax - income tax brackets.",
        "So most of us end up paying less tax in the end."
