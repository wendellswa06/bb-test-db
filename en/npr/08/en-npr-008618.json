        "So I decided that all the pictures would be the little boxes of little fragments of what I remember.",
        "And then I would have these larger pictures.",
        "They - telling what I was hoping for and what would be the whole sort of picture of the time.",
        "And so the little pictures from the beginning, I knew I want it to have in black and white with just little sparkles of red because I feel like Prague and Czechoslovakia and that time was so black - '50s, red flags and red stars everywhere."
