        "And what the gas industry has to do is convince people to lease their land -and there's usually cash offer for a signing bonus and a percentage of the gas that they pull out - in order to turn their area into an industrial drilling zone.",
        "So you know, what - this is, I think, a tough sell for the natural gas industry.",
        "But they have been ramming this project through in 34 states.",
        "And it's causing a lot of havoc and a lot of people getting severe environmental damage, health damage, property value damage.",
        "And so natural gas is promoting itself as this clean fuel source.",
        "But the untold story which we go into in \"\"Gasland,\"\" and it's a trip all across the America, is that this form of drilling, onshore, is incredibly problematic and it's inherently contaminating.",
        "And, you know, it's a proposition - I don't know how many people would want to live in the oil fields of Saudi Arabia.",
        "But certainly, you know, that is what is on the table here for huge areas of New York State, 50 percent of New York State, three quarters of Pennsylvania.",

        "They say outrageous things.",
        "You know, the gas industry has been exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act, which is the act that monitors an underground injection of toxic chemicals.",
        "And this form of drilling, fracking, injects toxic chemicals underneath the ground.",
        "But in 2005, the Bush-Cheney administration, in their energy bill passed by the U.S.",
        "Congress, exempted fracking from that law specifically.",
        "And when that happened, then you see the drilling explode all across the United States, because these companies no longer have to report the chemicals and the toxins.",
        "And these are neurotoxins and carcinogens that are actually going into the water table and being injected by the millions of gallons to do this fracking process.",
        "So they come out and say, well, we're not exempt from Safe Drinking Water Act, even though you can actually just look up the law.",
        "And I think that the purpose of this is to try to create a controversy or to create doubt on what is a very sincere and honest project that's been thoroughly researched and vetted, you know, to take potshots at it.",

        "This is the kind of industry that we're dealing with.",
        "It's very bullying.",
        "It's very aggressive.",
        "So I think, to a degree what it's doing, not only creating, you know, more publicity for the film, but it's also showing their tactics, which is that they're completely in denial of these thousands of cases of contamination across the country.",
        "They continue to promote this as a great thing, as a boon for, you know, the places where they're proposing the drillings, there's no possible risk to water supply, even though Mayor Bloomberg issued a report just last year that said this was a catastrophic risk to the New York City watershed.",
        "And they are very, very powerful and they like to push people around.",
