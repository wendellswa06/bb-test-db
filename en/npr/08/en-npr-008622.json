        "The obvious connection among the people targeted is that so far, at least, they're all high-profile Democrats.",
        "Have authorities said anything about that link, the Democratic link?",
        "The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have not commented on that, no. It's very much the early stages of this investigation.",
        "But New York's Democratic mayor and governor did.",
        "They both called for a cooling of political rhetoric in this kind of a tense time.",
        "Senior Republicans in Congress did as well.",
        "And then, of course, the White House - the president, Trump, was briefed on this.",

        "I think it was a significant event.",

        "Medication is right for some people, but there are a lot of people who have depression who can be and are effectively treated without medication.",
        "These drugs suffered a setback recently during highly publicized FDA hearings on their possible link to suicidal thoughts.",
        "Have the drugs recovered from that?",
        "What we've seen is a significant reduction in the use of these medications for children and adolescents.",
        "So, depending on the study you look at, there has been a reduction of between 20 percent and a third in the number of prescriptions for kids under 18.",
        "For adults we've seen less of a change, maybe more of a leveling off.",
        "But of significant concern is we've also seen an increase in the adolescent suicide rate for the first time since the early 1990s.",
        "So my concern as a psychiatrist is that there are now a lot of kids in particular who aren't getting the effective and appropriate treatment that they need.",

        "How are these drugs evolving and what are the newest versions of antidepressants, what are they like?",

        "So if they're unable to process that, it becomes very overwhelming and hence the trauma sets in.",
        "And a lot of the ability for them to develop the capacity to deal with that trauma and to cope in many ways, you know, is largely dependent on the ability of the parent to cope, regulate, and soothe themselves in addition to the child.",

        "Well, the trauma has just been enormous, you know, from the hurricane and from the flood and being uprooted; the loss of homes, the loss of possessions, clothes; being in shelters, shipped to shel--just enormous losses.",

        "That is, there's going to be sadness.",
        "I think probably many of them are still in a state of shock and a state of numbness.",
        "And what happens sometimes with the children and even adults, a reason why they may not be reacting now, is they kind of detach themselves and dissociate themselves from it as a kind of protection for the emotions, so that some of the trauma and the anxiety and stress reactions may appear later.",
        "That is, they can appear two months later, a month later, and sometimes years later...",
        "Yeah.",

        "Another thing I'm concerned about is that it's very good that the people are welcoming them--that's very, very, very important.",
