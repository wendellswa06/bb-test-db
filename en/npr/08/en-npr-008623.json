        "Well, we currently have Child Protective Services staff in all of the major shelters in Texas working alongside of the Red Cross volunteers and the FEMA staff.",
        "And we're certainly making sure, as we have conversations with families and do some of the assessments that we've done in the shelters, that we're referring them to the appropriate resources that hopefully will help to bring back some form of normalcy in their lives.",
        "We have actually set up crisis counseling services for the families and children because it is true that these children look to their parents for support.",
        "And we have witnessed parents breaking down emotionally, late at night often, and the children witnessing that.",
        "And, again, sometimes we do look at children and think that they are resilient and can handle this, but we've certainly communicated with our staff the understanding that these children need counseling as well as parents.",
        "We meet daily in our agency with our executive team just to review where we are and what efforts we are doing to make sure that we are doing within the scope of our agency those things that we can to support families and children.",
        "We have facilitated reunification of 136 children.",
        "We know that it is important for these children to be with their family or with relatives that they know at this time because they have lost so much and experienced so much as a result of Katrina.",
        "And many of them have seen their family members die.",
        "So we're really focusing on maintaining the family.",
        "We're participating in these Angel Flights, where they're bringing children in or bringing families in to be reunited.",
        "And we're making every effort not to remove children and place them in our foster care system.",
        "And that has been minimum in Texas, and it's generally been in response to serious illness or mental breakdowns by the parents.",
        "And so our effort here--we think that what we can do for families and children is to keep them together and to refer them to those resources that will help them to become stronger.",
        "There are tons of beauty salons in Los Angeles but only one that answers the phone like this.",
        "Jinnie English, how do you deal with a kid who--and there are, unfortunately, too many of those in this situation who, indeed, have lost a close family member, perhaps even both parents.",
        "And many of them, quite frankly, are not facing the idea of going to a relative.",
        "As we heard just from Ms. James a moment ago, they have to now find themselves in foster care.",
        "How do you tell a kid that, you know, `Within 24 hours, your entire life changes,' and have them be as satisfied that the rest of their life will be OK?",
        "Well, a big part of that, Ed--and that's a great question, because that will come up time and time again as a result of this particular hurricane and this event.",
        "And in many ways kids know something is going on.",
        "And in addition, many kids also know that something bad has happened.",
        "It becomes a matter of remaining hopeful and understanding that this is a horrible thing that's happened, allowing them to grieve, allowing them to mourn, allowing them that time and that space to do the business of processing what that is going to mean to them in a way that makes sense to them, in a way that allows them to have meaning.",
        "And there are many ways to give respect to what it is that they're feeling, because, you know, a lot of times what we'll see is because people are afraid of what will happen to the child or how the child will respond, they really withhold and don't allow the child to process that grief.",
        "And it's a legitimate grief.",
        "So if we're looking to not have any type--or looking to minimize, I should say, any type of emotional backlash from the child, you know, months, years down the road, it's really about allowing them to have that space now and to regulate them because they're going to be disappointed, they're going to be angry, they're going to be hurt, they're going to be very sad.",
        "Those are normal things.",
        "Those are healthy things.",
        "To try to terminate or really cut off that process prematurely is extremely detrimental to the child and to the ability that they will have to process later emotional pain and to be able to regulate those normal things that happen to people as times goes on and as they get older.",
        "So that's going to be extremely key when we're talking about helping children who have lost parents.",
        "Dr.",
        "Poussaint, what about the older child, one who can intellectualize much of this better?",
        "Is it harder on them?",
        "Well, I think if, you know, they're older children, they can understand it and put it in some kind of perspective.",
        "But no, they're going to be traumatized, too, the preadolescents and the adolescents.",
        "And frequently, they may show a lot of their trauma and their grief and their despair in irritability, in withdrawal, in poor school performance, in acting out, maybe even resorting to tranquilizers like drugs and alcohol sometimes to try to make themselves feel better.",
        "But chances are that frequently they may show a lot of their upset by being irritable.",
        "But it's very important, since they understand these things, that the opportunities be there for them to talk some of these things out with themselves and with other people as well.",
        "Sometimes, though, teen-agers will try to deal with it again almost by denial, by being very flip--kind of `I'm getting through this and I can deal with this and, you know, big deal,' and so on.",
        "And I don't think that parents should force them to talk if they don't want to, but I think they should leave it open--that is, the counselors and other people--to be able to talk.",
        "The other thing I'm concerned about, particularly here, Ed, is that, you know, polls showed, I think, in CNN and Gallup Poll that 72 percent of the black people down there felt that, or in the country felt that, Bush didn't care about black people.",
        "Remember, these families and children and teen-agers were stranded for many, many days, and that creates a feeling of abandonment by the entire society.",
        "And if their parents were feeling that they were abandoned because they were black, this has to be transmitted or was transmitted to the children, particularly adolescents, but even the younger children.",
        "And I wonder what part that is going to play in their sense of safety and security and even feeling like they're worth something, you know, as a human being...",
        "Yeah."

        "...if they feel that in some way this situation was caused in part by the fact that the country did not come to their aid because they were black and poor.",
        "You know, Jinnie English, pick up on that point, because Dr. Poussaint beat me to my next question, and that is whether or not we are going to see a group of people who already, to a great degree, felt disenfranchised utilize this as the ability to say, `See?",
        "You didn't care.'",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, he raised an excellent point.",
        "I mean, that is one of those million-dollar questions that we will not have the answer to until, you now, it arises and it starts to manifest itself.",
        "The bottom line, I think, with a lot of that, where we're talking about transmuting, you know, or transferring over information from one generation to another about a belief system or about a feeling, that is extremely powerful.",
        "So it will become, I think, difficult to reach some of the people, some of the children, some of the parents because they are so angry, to the point that many of them are probably enraged with the fact that, you know, people died or people were left and abandoned for really illegitimate reasons.",
        "So we are going to have to look at how are we going to address that, how are we going to deal with that pain, and that legitimate pain, from their perspective?",
        "Because to say that that's not true does nothing more than to fuel that belief system because now you are pretty much reducing or negating what it is their experience has been, and it really cuts short that conversation that one could have with them in really trying to understand and then moving forward in a productive way everyone.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So when you're talking about dealing with the kids, the question becomes, how do you explain to the kids in a way that allows them to have an open mind about `These are some people who probably thought that way, here are a huge group of other people who don't'?",
        "And how do you allow them...",
