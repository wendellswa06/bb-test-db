        "Christine Wiedinmyer is a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.",
        "Prescribed burning, if it's done correctly, you only burn the understory and you leave a lot of trees living, and therefore, they can continue to sequester carbon, as opposed to a large wildfire that wipes everything out.",
        "But one nagging question has been which puts more carbon up into the atmosphere, a series of small, prescribed burns or the occasional big wildfire?",
        "So, Wiedinmyer developed a computer model to calculate that, using the record of both kinds of fires in the western U.S.",
        "from 2001 to 2008.",
        "She published the results in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.",
        "Although the numbers are rough, the outcome is clear: prescribed fires do emit carbon but much less than the wildfires they prevent.",
        "We could reduce the emissions from wildfires by as much as 25 percent.",
        "And fires emit a significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere."
