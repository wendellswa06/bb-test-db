        "Not everyone is thrilled with the president's proposal about community college, and his critics aren't just the usual suspects.",
        "Joining me to discuss this is the CEO of the UNCF, formerly the United Negro College Fund, Dr. Michael Lomax.",
        "Welcome to the program, Dr. Lomax.",
        "Thank you very much, Mr. Siegel.",
        "And what's wrong with the president's proposal?",
        "Well, I think the president's proposals is a bit of a blunt instrument, when we really need to be much more laser-focused in making choices about where to support students most effectively to ensure that the lowest income students are able to get to and to complete college.",
        "And community college is one of those opportunities for sure.",
        "But what we know about community college is that the lowest income and students of color who are the first generation in their families to the college don't fare well in community college.",
        "Our view is that the real engine for ensuring that more low-income students in need are able to get to and through college is really to invest further in Pell Grants, because those are grants which the students can take to any institution that they think is the right one for them.",
        "But first, when we think of an entitlement to two years of post-secondary education, which is what free community college offer would be, I guess it would be analogous to the entitlement to 12 years of public education.",
        "We don't means test high school.",
        "Even if poorer children fare worse in the 11th and 12th grades, we don't say those who could afford private school have to pay for it.",
        "But we also don't invest in additional private school opportunities for well-off students.",
        "Right now, the average family income of a community college student is about $60,000 a year, well above the poverty rate.",
        "The president's program will support students with family incomes up to $200,000 a year.",
        "And what we know about higher education in this country is that, right now, high-income students are graduating at about 70 percent and low-income students, regardless of the institution they attend, are graduating at about 9 percent average.",
        "But isn't part of the distinction here that community colleges - yes, to some extent they're a stepping stone into a four year college program, but they're our apprenticeship programs.",
        "They're our vocational educational programs.",
        "They're where you can get trained for a skilled job in ways that we wouldn't expect.",
        "Four year colleges or universities should be doing that.",
        "And we're seeing a renaissance at community colleges, and they are providing, you know, middle-skill opportunities.",
        "But, again, where they're having the most success is not with the lowest income students, not with students who have not gotten a good K-12 education, they're doing well middle income and above students.",
        "One argument for having very broad eligibility is that programs that everybody benefits from - social security, Medicare - are hugely popular programs.",
        "And that kind of assistance to people is never challenged politically.",
        "Programs that are targeted for the poor are challenged all the time.",
        "And if you want a popular benefit, make it available to a broader number of people."

        "The Pell Grant has been, for generations now, a universally applauded support for the lowest income college aspirants in our society.",
        "Further investing in the buying power of the Pell Grant will achieve much greater results for individual students and for the nation than focusing on one category of institution and giving broad entitlement to all the students who attend that institution, even those who do not have a financial need.",

        "Because some people tried to follow it by eating steak and whipped cream and cheese, and that has nutritionists concerned.",
        "The second diet is the Zone Diet, which is an interesting balance of 40-30-30: 40 percent carb, 30 protein, 30 fat.",
        "Thirty fat is pretty typical of what people say, but 40 percent carb is low and 30 percent protein is high.",
        "So that's another challenge to the national recommendations.",
        "Now Ornish Diet is a largely vegetarian diet.",
        "It's 10 percent fat, which is extremely low.",
        "And if a typical protein intake is 15 to 20 percent calories, that leaves 70 to 75 percent from carb, which is completely the opposite end of the spectrum.",
        "So it's interesting that these diet plans are so completely different and have challenged the national guidelines, saying this is a better way to do it with not much data to look and compare.",
        "And your study showed the winner was?"

        "Well, I think this has been exaggerated tremendously in the press.",
        "The modest winner was the group that got assigned to Atkins.",
        "Probably the more informative result from this is how difficult it was for real-life people to take these books and follow them for a whole year.",
        "Now actually they each had a leg up because for eight weeks a dietician helped them once a week for an hour to understand the books, cover to cover.",
        "And then they were left for 10 months on their own to follow them as best they could.",
        "So it is true that at the end Atkins had an average 10-pound weight loss compared to 3.5 for Zone and about five for LEARN and Ornish.",
        "That's twice the weight loss, isn't it?",
        "That is, but it's modest.",
        "These women were 15 to 100 pounds overweight.",
        "Now on the other hand, even with modest weight loss in all four groups, their blood pressure got better, their cholesterol got better, their insulin got better.",
        "So it is really nice to know that if you are overweight, you don't have to lose 50 pounds to see these benefits.",
        "They happen right away.",
        "You can get some good clinical benefits right away.",
        "Of the things that were statistically significant at the end of the 12 months, Atkins did better than just one of the groups on HDL cholesterol, better than just one of groups on triglycerides, and better than all three of the groups on blood pressure.",
        "But the results and the differences weren't astounding.",
        "This isn't the solution to the obesity epidemic.",
        "One of the really interesting findings was that at the end of the 12 months the Ornish folks, who were supposed to be at 10 percent fat, were at 30 percent fat.",
        "So they didn't stay on the diet?",
        "And that's real-life situation.",
        "So I know the author of these have been called and asked to comment, and they said this isn't fair, they didn't follow our diets.",
        "And there might have been two ways to do this.",
        "You could have fed people all the food to make sure they ate the diets exactly as the authors prescribed.",
        "That's one research question.",
        "Ours was, if you give these popular diets that are out in the popular press challenging national recommendations and you ask hundreds of women to try to follow them after being randomly assigned, how did they do a year later.",
        "And either the diets are hard to follow, or they are confusing to read or something, or there's too many other environmental factors getting in the way of people trying to follow the diets.",

        "Why did you leave out, for example, Weight Watchers or something like that?",
        "Well interestingly in the beginning we wrestled with what that intermediate group should be between Zone and Ornish, something that more closely followed the food pyramid, and Weight Watchers would've been great if they had a book.",

        "And there was no difference in the small amount of increase they all experienced, and that's a hugely important point, Ira, is this is really just a dietary component and needs to be placed in the hugely larger context of exercise and other lifestyle factors."
