        "Well, the majority of an average person's diet comes from carbohydrates, and in the last couple decades the proportion of those carbohydrates coming from snacks and soda pop and junk carbohydrates has continued to increase.",
        "It might be that a simple message of low-carb would get a bigger bang for the buck.",
        "My only fear is that it'll fall short and be oversimplified just like low-fat was.",
        "And while trying to follow low-carb you'll get the steak and the brie and you'll completely mess that one up, too.",
        "So you have to pay attention here about what kind of message that you're sending.",
        "Yeah, so the scientists can agree on yes, low simple carbs and five colors a day of vegetables and fruits, and unsaturated fats and lots of fiber.",
        "And I think we don't do a great job of trying to communicate that simplistically to the average person who's trying to follow 10 things at once and isn't actually sure where all those nutrients come from.",
        "They don't buy nutrients; they buy food.",
        "So how can we give them simpler, clearer messages to help them cut back on the calories and pick foods that are satiating?",

        "So the next study would be quality fats and quality proteins and quality carbs, and it would be low-fat or low-carb or low-protein, and do them head to head when all the nutrient sources come from unsaturated fats: the veggies, the avocados, the fish oil.",
