        "The Sound Editing award represents the job of a sound supervisor, who's responsible for selecting the sounds, interacting with the director and editor on their goals for the sounds in the early phases of the process, right after principal photography takes place.",
        "They're responsible for overseeing the crews that record the sounds in the field or get them from a library, and then synchronize those sounds with the picture.",
        "And then the sound supervisor is an integral part of the team in the sound-mixing process when the final mix takes place because they're familiar with where all the sounds are.",
