        "Now, the executive order doesn't precisely define what is national security, what is damage, but never mind that.",
        "The president has also delegated the authority to classify to a couple of dozen agency heads, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, many others.",
        "They in turn have delegated that authority to some 4,000 individuals within the executive branch.",

        "In this case, that process was not effective.",
