        "Certainly.",

        "In the Department of Defense, there's a concept we term essential elements or friendly information.",
        "And what makes it difficult is that a particular segment or item of information in and of itself may not be significant.",
        "But if your potential adversary can collect enough of those small pieces of information, you can, you know, like a puzzle, eventually you start to see the big picture.",
        "And so I'm not a classifier, but I can sympathize a bit with the difficulty of being one because it's a big grey area to decide just how far somebody should go in order to protect a small, apparently, in and of itself, insignificant piece of information.",
        "I'll let you and your guests comment on that.",

        "What do you mean...?",
        "I mean, just, what is the check on people who refuse to declassify something just to cover up something that's embarrassing, as opposed to sensitive, or something that just shows ineptitude as opposed to something that's truly relevant to national security?",
        "I mean, I know a lot of the people now, because a lot of them are retired people who do declassification, and I don't think they look at it from the perspective of covering up.",
        "You know, from my perspective as an intelligence officer, I was much more interested in getting information out and having a discussion of it than covering up.",
        "I think that's just kind of more a myth.",
        "Certainly there are things, there are probably people who would like information not to be revealed, it might reflect on them.",
        "But, you know, I don't think that's an intelligence officer's perspective at all.",
        "What, Mr. Kerr, do you have a perspective on Steven Aftergood's question earlier about, raising questions about, you know, why he can get access to budget information from recent years, '97 and '98, but can't get budget information from 20 or 30 years ago.",
        "Do you have a perspective on why that might be so?",
        "You know, from my, I don't what the current, I know they're more and more relaxed about budget information.",

        "Yes, well I worked for the National Security Agency for 27 years and I worked on both the security and intelligence sides of the agency.",
        "And I just wanted to quickly add that I relate to the comments that are being made in relation to things being over-classified.",
        "The agencies do tend to be -- I mean, one of my favorite questions in a meeting was, why is this document classified or why is this document classified to a given level.",
        "And, I guess, my question would be more general.",

        "There are times when information is kind of automatically classified because that's what was on some of the original source documents.",

        "What sources and methods are we trying to protect?",
        "And could we do it at another classification?",
        "A lot of things can be done at the unclassified level and that's one of my, one of the arguments I'd make about the president and his statement about this argument about whether he leaked information on a national estimate.",
        "Most of the key judgments in that national estimate, and I've done a survey of all of that reporting on the estimate, and most of those in fact were not sensitive judgments, sensitive information, they were important judgments.",
        "But there was very little real information that needed to be protected in those key judgments.",
        "Now deep down inside the document there were references to how we knew that information.",

        "I think of the rights as being those kind of set forth in our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and I think we assert rights, sometimes, that are maybe more privileges than rights.",

        "intelligence agencies by impeding information sharing, and helped set the stage for 9/11.",

        "Do you think that...",
        "I don't, I mean I understand the point that they're making and I would argue, I think, that while that may have been a factor in some cases, the far more important factor was the relationships among the organizations and the bureaucratic relationships.",
        "Not that information could not move, not that the classification was too high for the people to know about it, but that information didn't move easily and from fairly logical reasons, some of it, was prohibited from moving.",
        "Trying to move intelligence into the law enforcement area is even today a great difficulty, you know, several years after 9/11.",

        "Mr. Aftergood, we have a query by e-mail from James in South Bend, and he would like you to talk about the story about an effort to reclassify previously public documents at the National Archives.",
        "And the writer would like to know is that common, and what is the point of this, and were these documents initially released in error and there was an effort made to reverse an error, or is there some other judgment at work?",
        "Steven Aftergood?",
        "Well, we're still learning some of these details, but essentially, government agencies, including the Air Force, CIA, DIA, Defense Intelligence Agency, contend that certain information of theirs was inadvertently disclosed in the declassification process, and they have been working, in secret, at the National Archives to try to recover that information.",
        "It's a particularly interesting story because in many cases the documents that they are working to recover are already in the public domain, in one case the document has been published in a State Department volume.",
        "And it gives us a rare opportunity to examine a document that the government says is currently and properly classified.",
        "And what we find is that in many cases, that claim seems absurd.",
        "What did the CIA think about what China might do during the Korean War?",
        "Do we really think that that is something that needs to be secretly withdrawn from the National Archives?",
        "It strikes many people, I think, as nonsense.",

        "Mike, what's your question?",
        "Hi, guys.",
        "Great conversation today.",
        "Wondering about the panelists' view on the question as to whether or not those classifying information are doing it with the express intent to scope the public opinion based upon their own desires, or the political, socioeconomic?",
        "Just wanted to sort of try to refocus the discussion back on that point, because I think as a citizen, the most concerning aspect is, are we getting access to the information that we as citizens deserve, being the fundamental building blocks of a democracy?",
        "Mike, it sounds like you're near an airport or on a highway, so I'm going to mute your mike and take your answer that way.",
        "Thank you for calling.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Mr.",
        "Kerr, you had started our discussion by saying that the, often times officials do want information to reach the public domain.",

        "In my judgment, that was always, one, impossible because I didn't understand the winds well enough, and two, the one part of the process that I had some control on was the integrity of the process.",

        "Well, if we talk about whether it is classified or declassified, it is certainly declassified by the administration to use in support of their policy.",
        "But you know, again, I would argue that that should not surprise anybody because the intelligence was done in support of the creation of policy, hopefully good policy.",

        "It wouldn't be surprising if they did so.",
