        "That's because television remains by far the biggest guaranteed aggregator of eyeballs.",
        "And while lots of players, from companies like Amazon.com to high school kids in a garage, are trying to come up with a big Internet hit, CBS's Kramer says the networks are the only ones positioned to play the game consistently.",
        "So, Kramer figures, the networks will continue to dominate, and he thinks their Web sites will dominate too.",

        "Israel has always been a contentious and raucous society, but the Gaza pullout has deepened its divisions perhaps like nothing else in decades.",

        "It is boosting tremendously terrorism.",
