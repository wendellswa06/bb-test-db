        "Although we do have some students who are very sensitive to the past and understand its implications to the future.",
        "When we have the memorial on campus, there can be upwards of a couple of hundred students who are involved in the walk and in the candlelight commemoration, but, you know, that's part of our task as educators, candidly, to connect what's happened in the past with what needs to happen and will happen in the future.",
        "What of the idea of cultivating a relationship between students and police?",
        "Obviously, it's a different day, different tone, different tenor, and relationships across the board in this country are better usually with the university police and students.",

        "Certainly a lesson about, you know, what can happen if there is a lack of understanding on any level.",
        "You know, most of what happened in the '70s happened at least at Jackson State because there was a street that ran through campus that white citizens drove through in order to get to work and racial epithets went back and forth between the students and the residents of Jackson.",
        "It was a little thing like that that ended up in two deaths, and I guess the lesson to be learned is that little things can end up in very bad ways if we're not conscious each and every moment of what we do and why and how we do it.",
