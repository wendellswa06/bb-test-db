        "It's in our language now, you know.",

        "The translation is slow going because Hayton and Savage are working with a vocabulary that's decidedly not 21st century.",

        "Gary Holton is a linguistics professor at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.",
        "He says translating election materials is particularly daunting because, culturally, the Gwich'in language can't describe the very concept of elections.",
        "If you were going to set out to design a language that was as different from English as possible, you would probably come up with something like Gwich'in.",
        "If they can't find a word in Gwich'in, translators often decide to stick with the English term.",
        "Ordinarily, a dedicated language agency would discuss how best to create new terms, but no such group exists in Alaska.",
        "Nonetheless, Holton says this kind of work could help add new vocabulary to the language.",
        "I think the best outcome could be that this election ballot translation process actually encourages more of that in other communities.",
        "While the translations into Yup'ik and Gwich'in are a huge undertaking for Alaska's Division of Elections, it could help save two dying languages.",
        "Adding modern concepts to languages that are thousands of years old is something Marilyn Savage never really considered, but she understands the necessity.",
        "I always thought our language was for - you know, from people from ancient times and that it was just their day-to-day language for day-to-day living.",
        "Now we're in a century that's pretty high-tech.",
        "It's unclear how many of Alaska's 300 native Gwich'in speakers or the state's 10,000 native Yup'ik speakers might head to the polls in November, but for those who do, it will be the first time they'll have the opportunity to vote in their native languages.",
