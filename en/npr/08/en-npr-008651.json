        "That happens at my house too.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean the CIA has become a machine for killing in many ways.",
        "The counterterrorism center has become in many ways the sort of beating heart of the agency that does manhunting.",
        "And the drone operations are something that two successive White Houses have embraced.",
        "You could argue the current administration, the Obama administration, has embraced it even more than its predecessor.",
        "And these questions of should the CIA stay in the killing business, should they be focused on drone strikes, and - or should that be something that the military should do - it is something that is unresolved but is certainly being discussed.",
        "Well, has this focus on counterterrorism in recent years, does that mean that the agency has so many fewer spies that it doesn't really function very well as a spy agency?",
        "I'm just thinking now of the Arab Spring, which really no one predicted, but which you would have hoped America's intelligence agency, the CIA, would have known something about or be able to predict somewhat.",
        "One of the things I write about in the book is how behind the curve the CIA was on the Arab Spring.",
        "And this caused a lot of frustration at the White House, where the CIA was incapable of sort of getting a grasp on these revolts.",
        "And this is a big concern, not only in the CIA but in the White House, other parts of the American government, that the traditional missions of the CIA are being atrophied, or are atrophying, because of this intense focus on manhunting.",
        "Just finally - where do you see the CIA going next with this secret war?",
        "Well, one of the interesting things that's playing out now is that John Brennan, who was President Obama's top counterterrorism adviser, now is the CIA director, has made it clear to some degree in his congressional hearing that he does have concerns about the direction of the CIA, that it should not be focusing on traditional military activities.",
        "That being said, John Brennan has also been at the center, over the last four years, of this escalation of drone strikes.",
        "But now that he's out at Langley - and he is a CIA veteran - it will be interesting to see if he does try to reign it in.",
        "There's some evidence that he's trying to do that, but I think this is something that could take years.",
        "And even if you were to, tomorrow, say, OK, the CIA is out of the killing business, we have a whole generation of CIA officers who came in since 9/11 who have learned manhunting and killing, and it's not so easy to retrain people in traditional spy missions.",
        "So this is really something that will take a long time even if the CIA were to end it tomorrow.",
        "Mark Mazzetti is national security correspondent for the New York Times, and his new book is \"\"The Way of the Knife: The CIA, a Secret Army and a War at the Ends of the Earth.\"\" It's out today.",

        "Thanks so much for having me."
