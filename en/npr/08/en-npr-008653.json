        "Ninety-nine percent of that re-paving work is done, but Seyfarth says one important part of the reconstruction is going much more slowly: cleaning out the drainage system beneath the road.",

        "As one worker is lowered down into each manhole on the highway, another feeds him a hose carrying high-pressure water to flush into the drainage pipes.",
