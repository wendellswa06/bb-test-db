        "The particular racially insensitive issues at Missouri and those that have produced protests at other colleges have nothing to do with sport.",

        "No, what Missouri proves again is that college sports is really just about power.",
        "This rare time it was the players who were able to use it, but so long as lots of African-Americans are brought on campus, mostly just to stock the revenue teams, then, I'm sorry.",
