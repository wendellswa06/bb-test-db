        "By sending a computer instruction to do just that.",
        "Exactly, through cyber means, and, you know, it's now been reported that Stuxnet was an attack, sponsored by the U.S.",
        "and Israel, a cyber attack that caused Iranian centrifuges to spin in a way that would destroy them.",
        "Yeah, and this cybersecurity legislative proposal, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, was really addressed at this third category of attacks.",
        "I mean, it really wasn't focused on crime or espionage; it was focused on protecting the nation's infrastructure, right?",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I think it was sold that way because that's the sexy - that's the thing that gets people's attention.",
        "But I think the espionage piece was as big a part of it.",
        "There were two major aspects to this bill.",
        "There was a standard aspect that would create - first it was mandatory, then it scaled back to voluntary standards to shore up networks for these critical infrastructure companies.",
        "There was also an information-sharing provision, though, that would have allowed the government to share classified information with companies and companies to share certain data with the government.",
        "And that, you know, intelligence officials have said, would allow them to better stop even the cyber espionage kind of attack.",
        "And what was the history of this?",
        "I mean, the administration, I remember, put forward its own legislative proposal more than a year ago.",
        "There's already been a bill passed in the House.",
        "What's been the evolution of the legislative thinking and the legislative action in this area?",
        "Right, the administration did put out a proposal that did track pretty closely with what ended up being the Senate proposal.",
        "The House, which is controlled by the Republicans, passed a bill that was information-sharing only.",
        "You know, they're - no regulation at all.",
        "And this issue has really run into sort of the anti-regulatory wave in the Republican Party and the business community even when the regulation became voluntary.",
        "So that's how it evolved.",
        "You know, the Senate bill started out with mandatory provisions.",
        "It wasn't like the government was going to say these are the standards, though.",
        "There were going to be industry groups that would get together and craft standards that everyone could agree on to improve network security."

        "But those companies would then be forced to comply with those security standards.",
        "That was the original Senate proposal.",
        "But then realizing that it wasn't going to get any Republican support, its backers scaled it back and said OK, we'll make these standards voluntary.",
        "But even that was - that could not get the support of the U.S.",
        "Chamber of Commerce or most Republicans in the end.",
        "Most Republicans, and what was the - what was the nature of the debate?",
        "Was it a vigorous debate in the Senate over this?",
        "Did it sort of line up along kind of traditional partisan lines?",
        "It struck me - it was a vigorous debate, but it also was the kind of debate where senators were making speeches on other issues, too.",
        "So it almost - they were going through the motions, in some sense, knowing it wasn't going to pass.",
        "But the Republicans stuck to the line of, you know, this is big-government regulation, we don't - the government - and the intellectual argument for this is technology standards are changing so fast, you can't set up a regulation that's going to adequately capture and protect what's happening in the industry.",
        "Now one other thing, Ken, we've been talking about the big business versus security debate here, but there is also a privacy issue, because we're talking here about the government getting information or having access to information for the benefit of promoting cybersecurity, and that did raise some privacy issues for people, didn't it?",
        "It absolutely did, and in fact the House bill, as it stood, was opposed by the White House on those grounds, and the White House and privacy groups argued that it was sharing too much information with the government.",
        "The Senate negotiated with privacy groups like the ACLU and the Center for Democracy and Technology and got their acquiescence to - and part of it was agreeing that DHS, rather than the National Security Agency, which is the Pentagon's spying arm, after all, would be the entity that would receive the shared information.",
        "And what is the - I mean, we talked about General Alexander and other national security leaders who are not political at all endorsing this legislation, saying it's key to U.S.",
        "national security.",
        "What's been the Romney campaign's view of this issue?",
        "You know, I have not heard the Romney campaign express a view.",
        "Senators who are supporting Romney opposed this legislation and, you know, privately Republican aides said hey, Alexander's a sitting member of the Obama administration, what do you expect him to say, which - it was sort of extraordinary.",
        "But, you know, there are some former officials who are backing Romney, like Mike Chertoff, a former Homeland Security secretary, who endorsed this bill wholeheartedly.",
        "And what are we going to see next?",
        "I mean, Congress is in recess now, but I'm assuming there'll be more legislative activity on this front."

        "Thanks for being with us, Ken.",
        "Thanks for having me, Tom.",

        "How did you and your group feel about this last proposal in its modified form, which did, as Ken Dilanian said, include some compromises?",
        "We wrote a letter to the Senate saying that we thought that this proposal definitely was moving in the right direction.",
        "I think that Ken's description that mandatory standards set by the government probably just don't work in as dynamic and fast-moving a space as cybersecurity.",
        "So what we have, at the Internet Security Alliance, always maintained is that we need to shift to a more modern approach to cybersecurity where we would infuse the market with the sorts of incentives that would help the private sector develop and input these improved security devices, and that's actually what we saw with the latest provision.",
        "And it wasn't just the Republicans who were pushing in this way.",
        "There was a bipartisan group of moderate liberal Democrats - people like Senator Whitehouse and Senator Blumenthal and Senator Coombs from Delaware - all of whom were saying we have to move away from this government-centric regulatory model and move towards a more incentive-based model, and I think that's where we'll probably pick up probably in the next Congress on this.",
        "One other point I want to mention really quickly, and Ken is exactly right about this, there's actually lots of provisions of the cybersecurity bill, not just information sharing but so called FISMA reforms that deal with federal networks, education awareness programs.",
        "There's a whole bunch of really good legislation that is embraced by the business community, embraced by Democrats, embraced by Republicans."

        "No one had seen this latest proposal until the very last week of July, as Congress was ready to go out for their August recess.",
        "We had never seen the language at all, never been subject of any Senate hearing or gone through any committee for a markup.",
        "As we said, we thought this was moving in the right direction, but there were a lot of questions that were unanswered by this.",
        "How do we set up the economics so that we have the financing to upgrade the SCADA systems - the so-called SCADA systems - that are used to protect our critical infrastructure?",

        "Senator McCain and all of his colleagues were against this bill because it was anti-security.",
        "What this bill did - yes, there was consultation initially, in the early stages of the bill, with the private sector, but then it turned over the final decision as to where the - what the standards and practices would be to a group of political appointees, people like the secretary of commerce and secretary of DHS who had no real knowledge of cybersecurity.",
        "As Ken pointed out in the first segment, we have had a tremendous increase in critical infrastructure cyberattacks, 17 times according to General Alexander in the last couple years, and we've never had any of these catastrophes that are alluded to in the president's op-ed.",
        "So Larry, do you think this is - these guys are being alarmist?",
        "Do you think this threat is sort of overhyped?",
        "I was disturbed by some of the rhetoric on the Senate floor.",
        "My guess is that some of the things that was being said on the Senate floor went beyond what the actual briefings were, and I thought that that was counterproductive.",
        "The people who have been fighting this, the generals in the field of cybersecurity, are the people in the private sector, critical infrastructure, who are fighting these attacks on a daily basis.",
        "These are the people who need to be making the final decisions with regard to security standards and practices, not a group of political appointees.",
        "Now, if we can evolve a system that does that and provides them with the tools, both technical and economic - and Jim Lewis is going to be on in a couple minutes, a study that his own organization, CSIS, did a couple years ago said the principal problem with cybersecurity in critical infrastructure is not technical, it is cost.",
        "And the Senate bill did nothing to address the fundamental cost issues that we have to deal with here.",
        "And that's what the IS Alliance has said we need to do.",
