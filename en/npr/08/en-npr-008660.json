        "All right, Larry.",
        "You know, one of the analogies that's made in this regard is the standard that all car manufacturers have to include seatbelts for the purpose of safety.",
        "Now, manufacturers weren't doing that on their own.",
        "It took a sort of a regulation to ensure that seatbelts are included in all cars.",
        "What's the - you know, why isn't there sort of an argument here for a similar standard to be applied against industries that hold the nation's infrastructure in their hands?",
        "There is no analogy whatsoever between seatbelts and cybersecurity.",
        "Seatbelts technology hasn't change in 30 years.",
        "Cybersecurity technology changes constantly.",
        "The problem with seatbelts and car design in the '60s is that the cars weren't designed properly.",
        "The problem with cybersecurity is that - it's not the systems aren't designed properly, it's that they are under attack.",
        "They're under attack because all of the incentives favor the attackers.",
        "Attacks are cheap, easy and profitable.",
        "Defense is a generation behind the attacker.",
        "You can't show return on investment to what you've prevented, and frankly law enforcement's virtually nonexistent.",
        "What we have to do is alter the incentive models.",
        "If you come up with a cybersecurity standard, a seatbelt standard, if you will, for cybersecurity, it will be outmoded before it is - before the ink is dry on the paper.",
        "The attackers will look at it, and we've now given them exactly the target to attack.",
        "We need a much different model.",
        "Digitalization changes everything.",
        "We need to invest our new system, our digital systems with the appropriate economics to generate increased security.",
        "Currently, all the economics motivate lack of security: cloud computing, mobile devices, these long international supply chains.",
        "Organizations, including the federal government, use these because they are so economically compelling.",
        "But they make the systems much less secure, so while we do need to deal with the technology, we also need to deal with the economics.",
        "Let's bring some listeners into the conversation now, Larry.",
        "First, Mick(ph) is on the line.",
        "I think, Mick, you're calling us from Columbus, Ohio.",
        "Good afternoon, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "As he goes down the hill.",
        "And it's really a pretty elegant, little design, I thought.",
        "Hi, thanks.",
        "One of the things that I'm greatly concerned about is not an economics and cost issue.",
        "I'm a security researcher.",
        "I've worked for top five financial institutions.",
        "The problem that I have with the federal government is they will have no problem asking us for evidence of cyber-attacks, of different nefarious things that people are doing, and we will gladly hand over relevant log information, but then we never hear from them.",
        "And when we do ask for information with - regarding, you know, pending threats and what's out there on the landscape, we get only the vaguest of responses.",
        "We need to get more granular information, get actionable information and have it be a two-way street.",
        "Currently, the government is like a black hole with that sort of stuff, and I'd love to hear your talk on that."

        "OK, quick answer, Larry, and then we're going to give the ball to Jim Lewis.",
        "He's absolutely right.",
        "The so-called public-private partnership has been primarily a one-way partnership where the federal government asks and is not giving back.",
        "Now, we're pretty encouraged by some of the new people over at DHS that they seem to be waking up to this, but absolutely correct, we do not get actionable information.",
        "We don't get timely information.",
        "We give, we do not receive back on the private sector, and that must be rectified.",
        "OK, Larry Clinton, president of the Internet Security Alliance, he joined us from member station WMFE in Orlando.",
        "Thank you very much, Larry, for joining TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "My pleasure, Tom.",

        "Thanks very much for having me.",
        "So I don't know if you - how much have you heard of Larry Clinton's explanation for why his organization and companies, like-minded companies oppose this proposal.",
        "You've been following this legislative debate, the activity around cybersecurity for a long time.",
        "What's your feeling this week, a week after this latest, watered-down bill failed to pass the Senate?",
        "Yeah, is anybody surprised that this Congress couldn't deliver anything?",
        "Well, it's upsetting, of course, because the implications are if they can't deliver on something as basic as this, what about budget or any of the other big issues we face?",
        "You've heard a lot of excuses as to why this wasn't a good bill.",
        "Most of them were just, you know, made up to block doing anything.",
        "And that's kind of where we are at the moment.",
        "We don't want to do anything.",
        "Well, let's just talk for a minute about this, what seems to be the big issue here, at least as explained by Larry Clinton, and he says that, you know, you're requiring companies to do things, you're putting in place a kind of a compliance mentality, and you're not providing market incentives to get companies to do the right thing.",
        "Well, unfortunately, that's wrong on two counts.",
        "This isn't a compliance mentality.",
        "It set performance standards, outcomes, and said here are things that you need to do to make your network more secure.",
        "We don't care how you do them.",
        "We just want you to certify once year that you've done something.",
        "And the second one is incentives.",
        "At the end of the day, there's only one kind of incentive, and that's money, right?",
        "And I don't know if we need to say tax breaks or direct cash payments or cost recoupment, but that's the kind of thing we're talking about is for companies to do what needs to be done to make America safer.",
        "We're going to have to pay them."

        "And I'm not entirely comfortable with that, because I'm not clear to me - it's not clear to me that we're talking about much of an additional expense.",
        "The standards are there.",
        "They're in the bill.",
        "This wouldn't have been hard to do.",
        "Well, Jim, what is the vulnerability of the American companies that - that provide the critical infrastructure, services and assets in this country?",
        "How vulnerable are they to cyber attack, and how much of a difference would forcing them to adhere to certain standards really make?",
        "You know, we don't have a good handle on that because companies don't admit when they're hacked.",
        "We do know that most of the companies that have been looked at turned out to be vulnerable to disruption, but you could easily have someone, you know, at some time soon - and we don't know when - turn off electrical power, disrupt the water supply.",
        "The potential for disruption is growing, and we don't have a good handle on it.",
        "People are not doing the right things when they're inspected, and that's why there's a vulnerability.",
        "Well, you say people are not doing the right things when they're inspected.",
        "Just elaborate on what you mean by that.",
        "Well, DHS has something called the Industrial Control Systems CERT, and they've looked at a number of critical infrastructure companies.",
        "In every one, you know, no company is deliberately doing the wrong things, but what you find is since they don't have a good idea of what the standards are, since they don't make cyber security a priority, you can find vulnerabilities in almost every one we looked at; even simple things like do you have your wireless networks connected to your control systems?",
        "Do you still rely on passwords?",
        "There's a lot of things we could do that aren't being done, and that's where we're getting stuck.",

        "Your comment or question?",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "I've been building automated machinery for about 15 years, and I don't think people really understand how broad an impact this has on our world.",
        "You know, everything from our generators, you know, right down to machinery that, you know, unloads plastic parts are all controlled by these controllers.",
        "And it's not uncommon at all in our industry for us to log in from a remote location and operate that machinery.",
        "And in the case of something, for instance, like, you know, a generator or a power grid, I can flip a valve and shut it down or blow it up.",
        "And there is no real emphasis on the security.",
        "You know, as a matter of reference, all of our prisons are controlled by these, you know, by PLCs.",
        "And if somebody knew what they were doing, it would be really not a problem at all to go open all the cells.",
        "She'll need to rely on Congress for funding.",
        "Despite Clinton's strong climate stance, energy policy has become a wedge issue among liberals, with some calling for a total end to fossil fuel production.",
        "While she has softened her support of fracking, there's also the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline, which has sparked protests across the country.",
        "Clinton hasn't yet taken a position.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Marie Cusick.",
        "Well, Miguel, what you're talking about is exactly the kind of problem that Jim Lewis and others have called attention to, and it's, I guess, really underscores the need for some kind of cyber security proposal.",
        "That's what we're talking about.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "So I do need to get you, Jim, to deal with this issue.",
        "Now, Miguel certainly raised the point that this is a serious concern and a real danger, but we've also heard that there's been a lot of hype, you know, some of these scenarios that are thrown out there about trains derailing and toxic clouds and things blowing up."

        "You know, there are a lot of people that say that, you know, that this is all hype.",

        "Didn't it, Jim?",
        "Well, it turned out that that was exactly the sort of problem we're talking about.",
        "There is hype, no doubt about it.",
        "That water system wasn't hacked, but someone was able to call in from Russia and take control of that facility.",
        "That's not something you want to do, and that's a sign of weak authentication, of poor security.",
        "The idea that you could have someone call in from Russia - and by the way, the Russians probably recorded everything in that call, including the passwords - that doesn't make me feel comfortable about us being secure.",
        "So you do feel and we're talking here - we're primarily talking about the prospect of an attack on infrastructure.",
        "Leaving aside everything that's going on in the espionage area, you do feel that the nation's infrastructure, at this current moment, could be attacked either by an adversary or by a terrorist group with devastating consequences?",
        "Let's get that clear.",
        "Right now, there are several states, some of which that don't like us, that could disrupt critical infrastructure.",
        "And, you know, it's - people know what this is like.",
        "If you've lived through a blackout, if you saw the stock market disruption last week, that's the kind of thing we're talking about.",
        "The fact that it's not going to be catastrophic doesn't mean we should welcome it, however.",
        "One of the things that worries a lot of people is the growing capability of what we call non state actors, the terrorist groups, anarchists, you know, and the private hackers who have a grudge to launch these kinds of damaging attacks.",
        "So one of the reasons we hope we could get legislation in place is that we could get ahead of the curve, and before we saw something bad happens make a reasonable effort to make our infrastructure more secure.",
        "Reasonable effort.",
        "What's the minimum that's required that you would support, Jim?",
        "There's NSA, the National Security Agency, and NIST, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, have come up with some basic standards, pretty simple stuff that are steps people can take that will reduce vulnerability in a measureable way.",
        "When I say measureable, we can count the success rate of opponents and the success rate falls by about 80 percent for penetration.",
        "So we know what to do.",
        "We're just not willing to do it.",
        "Very quickly, Jim, in what little time that remains here, is there something that the White House, that the federal government could do without congressional action to improve cyber security?",
        "Yeah.",

        "It just said the agency should use their existing authorities to put in place mandatory standards for cyber security.",
