        "That helps everybody there.",
        "For the Republicans, on the other hand, the striking thing about speeches by especially Chris Christie but also Marco Rubio was their implied message I'm the guy you should be looking at next time.",

        "It is true.",
        "And just by the sheer demographics of the presidential race this year, the Republicans have recognized, number one, that Mitt Romney has been behind in almost all the tracking polls so far this year; and number two, the demographics where they are at the greatest disadvantage are among women, blacks and Latinos."

        "So I wonder if in some ways, this issue of outside money has been overstated.",
        "Perhaps it has been, but I think there's an aspect to this, which may be even more important.",
        "The presidential race has been surprisingly stable over the past year or so - the popularity polls.",
        "We don't know what's going to happen two months from now, but so far, it's been surprisingly stable despite this huge influx of money.",
        "Where it could make a huge difference is at the congressional level, both in the House, which Republicans will probably still hold, and in the Senate, where control is up for grabs, and at state legislatures, too, which have such an important ripple effect.",

        "It is true that even before Donald Trump, Democrats have won states equaling 242 electoral votes in each of the last six elections.",
        "And Republicans have only won states in each of the last six elections equaling 102 electoral votes.",
        "You only need 270 to win, so Democrats have a big edge there.",
        "And in terms of key demographic groups, Donald Trump is polling 85 to 15 percent negative with Hispanics.",
        "That's much worse than Mitt Romney.",
        "We know that this year's electorate will be less white and more Hispanic than the 2012 electorate.",
        "Democrats think Donald Trump will be a motivator not just for his own white, non-college-educated base, but for their base, with minorities and women, particularly college-educated women."
