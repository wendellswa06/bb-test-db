        "One of the things that the Obama plan does that - it's obviously going to get a lot of attention, is that the lower group of schools, the constant underperformers, instead of giving them tutoring or allowing parents to move kids out of those schools to other schools, what the administration is proposing is basically letting some of those teachers go, changing that school.",

        "I think that's absolutely fine and dandy, and I support those notions.",

        "It gives states considerably more flexibility on how to make that judgment.",
        "What do you think of that?",
        "Well, the important thing to know about testing is that it's worthless if they're not valid and reliable and comparable-type measures.",
        "So long as those criteria are accommodated, I'm a big proponent of the notion of what gets measured, gets done, and I think rounding out assessment systems with other subjects makes sense.",
        "What about the notion of teaching to the test, which has always been one of the big, big criticisms of No Child Left Behind?",
        "Right.",
        "But really, you know, there's really nothing pedagogically flawed about teaching to a test, as long as what the test is measuring is what you want the kids to know."
