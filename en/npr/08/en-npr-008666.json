        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "And it took about six months to kind of fade into view over that.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And he got to New York, and he was listening to a lot of AM radio, and he was just amazed at the amount of just kind of crazy ranting that was going on on the radio.",
        "And so, initially, he was so amazed with it, he started - he said, oh, I have to tape this one guy who's ranting because this is so crazy, and I'll never hear it again.",
        "And then he realized that...",
        "(Laughing) It was all over the place.",
        "...the supply of craziness was basically infinite.",
        "But he started taping all these voices, and it was preachers, it was radicals, people just kind of losing their minds on the air and shock jocks and all this kind of stuff.",
        "And at a certain point, he was beginning this collaboration with David Byrne, and he started to think that maybe these little kind of samples that he made of these radio things could be put into a new context, kind of ported over from one purpose and brought over into a new environment and turned kind of against all odds into music.",
        "And that became kind of the sampling style that defined that record, which then had a huge impact on Public Enemy's \"\"It Takes a Nation of Millions,\"\" which was, you know, one of the defining kind of sonic experiences of that entire decade.",

        "And it's that pattern of borrowing and remixing that defines so much of great ideas in culture and in science and in technology."

        "Can you explain?",
        "You know, this is kind of a metaphor that I use from software in a way, that people build on software platforms so that somebody invents the Internet, and then somebody can build the web on top of the Internet, and somebody then can build Twitter on top of the web.",
        "And what makes it so powerful is that these platforms are beneath us that support what we do.",

        "After looking at all these inventors and all these ideas throughout history, were you able to sort of determine whether the best ideas come as a result of market forces or does innovation come when it's motivated by something else, like the greater good?",
        "I think what I found is that while it's true that market forces have driven a lot of innovation, which is kind of the conventional wisdom about this, that if you look at the long view, the good ideas that underlie most of the great, you know, kind of changes in our society that have driven progress, more often than not actually have roots in the open kind of information commons of the university or the British coffeehouse or hobbyists or people kind of working outside of market pressures.",
        "And it's precisely because in those environments, ideas are free to connect with each other and build on top of each other without having to worry about the restrictions of intellectual property law or, you know, closed proprietary labs.",

        "Well, we started out by recruiting adults and had them fill out an online questionnaire that essentially asked them to tell us what their socio-economic status was.",
        "Now, when we brought them into the lab, we said: You're going to play a game in which you're given 10 credits, which are going to be equal to cash at the end of the experiment, and we're interested in knowing how many of those credits you want to give, if any, to a partner that you'll never meet and who'll never meet you.",
        "Now, you knew, obviously, the socio-economic backgrounds of all these people.",
        "What did you find?",
        "So interestingly and possibly counter-intuitively, we found that people who were actually ranking themselves as relative high in their socio-economic status were less inclined to give points away than were people who ranked themselves as relatively lower in social class.",
        "So essentially, people who have more, or who identify themselves as having more, were or tended to give less in this just very simple task of generosity toward a stranger.",

        "I mean, was it a significant difference?",
        "It was, absolutely.",
        "It was a statistically significant difference, and what we found was that the lower-class people, or the relatively lower-class individuals, were inclined to give away 44 percent more of their points or their credits.",
        "Forty-four percent more."
