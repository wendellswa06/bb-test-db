        "In which sense?",

        "For too long, the Gulf Coast Claims Facility wasn't sufficient transparent.",
        "We didn't have local people in 35 claims offices in the Gulf, so people couldn't walk in and talk with somebody about this.",
        "In some cases, we have provided inconsistent treatment of similar claimants, not often but in some.",
        "And we've taken steps to try and correct these problems.",
        "And you now have 35 offices.",
        "Obviously, there's a large number of people who work for you.",
        "Oh, that's about 3,500 people that are employed.",
        "We inherited 2,500 people when BP gave up the claims process and turned it over to us last August.",
        "And we want to get callers on the line with you, but there are -one more thing to clarify.",
        "There are two categories of claims: One was the emergency claims that were done early on, and those are different from the settlements that we're talking about now.",
        "That's correct.",
        "From August to November, we paid 168,000 people, $2.6 billion in emergency payments to get them over the hump.",
        "Since November 23rd, we've paid about $1.3 billion to 300,000 claimants' claims, which have been presented to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility.",
        "And the second category is the one where, if you accept this payment, you are waiving your right for a lawsuit later."

        "Now that we've moved into the final payment process, we filed, gave sufficient documentations, 300 pages of documentation, then got a final payment offer that was for four out of the eight months.",
        "When we called to find out why they didn't use all eight months, they said we hadn't submitted documentation for the other four.",
        "I then - were able to show them that I had submitted it on February 14.",
        "They said, whoops, we found it.",
        "Now we'll re-review it.",
