        "Let's begin by reminding listeners a little bit about Wendy Davis.",
        "She rose to prominence, got lots of publicity nationally after her 11-hour filibuster of one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the nation.",
        "That filibuster helped launch her candidacy for governor.",
        "But she has had a rough start to her campaign, hasn't she?",
        "She really has.",
        "I mean, Davis has stumbled out of the starting blocks, no question, with the assist with the Dallas Morning News.",
        "For those who don't know, let me give a little background about Wendy.",
        "She grew up poor, got married and pregnant as a teenager, ended up in a mobile home.",
        "But she was always smart, and eventually get turned her life around.",
        "She got divorced, went to community college, eventually married a successful Ft.",
        "Worth lawyer and went to TCU, and ultimately Harvard Law.",
        "And not surprisingly, her campaign for governor has led with this story, which was great, until a reporter for the Dallas Morning News discovered some discrepancies.",
        "For example, although Davis had claimed she'd gotten divorced at age 19, the truth was she only separated then and didn't actually divorce until she was 21.",
        "And while she did live in a mobile home, it was really only for a few months.",
        "And while Davis said that she kind of put herself through college and Harvard Law, in fact, her second husband helped.",
        "I mean, this was not earthshaking stuff, but the Davis campaign compounded the damage by insisting that this was, like, dirty politics by the Abbott campaign, bringing this up to the Dallas Morning News.",
        "And the story stretched on for weeks, so long, that it began raising questions about, you know, Wendy Davis's campaign's competence.",
        "And that became a story about Wendy Davis, not rags to success.",
        "Of course, she also had raised a lot of money.",
        "So, what?",
        "Were people starting to say, can she make it work?",
        "Well, they were wondering, you know, this was really a little pothole in the road.",
        "For her to have face-planted so completely right out of the box, Democrats around the country began to get very worried.",
        "Now, her Republican opponent, Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, he seemed to be having smooth sailing, until then he got engulfed in controversy.",
        "So he can't get sick.",
        "It can't appear that he's weak.",
        "And Chavez, to be sure, is a man with incredible energy and stamina.",
        "And he has a taste for theatrics.",
        "So now he's back.",
        "And tomorrow, he'll possibly be front and center presiding over the bicentennial celebrations.",
        "And what impact will his return have now on the government?",
        "Well, I think it's too early to say.",
        "Some allies of the government are already attacking the opposition.",
        "Some of those opposition politicians had demanded that the government transfer power to the vice president.",
        "They said that that would be in line with the constitution.",
        "And also, remember, there's a presidential election next year.",
        "So I suspect that they'll be made to pay for that, for those comments."
