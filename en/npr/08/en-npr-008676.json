        "Has that construction stopped?",
        "Is it going ahead?",
        "What's going on?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: Yeah, there always there seems to be some construction-related news going on from time to time.",
        "I believe the latest is that the federal government has not been able to provide all the money that's necessary to get the especially something called a virtual fence off the ground.",
        "And so, I'm not exactly sure on the latest, but its always kind of stopping and starting, but it's always, it's always in the back of at least the state politicians' minds.",
        "Tony, you had another comment?",
        "Well, my comment is, is I could see that this bill here is going to move the federal government to do something, and it has to be action by both parties.",
        "You can't make this political in order to capture the Latino vote because our porous borders is making our country vulnerable to people of other countries to use those ways of getting in here.",
        "And if we can't secure our borders, we can't secure our country.",
        "Tony, thanks very much for that, we appreciate it.",
        "Can I just say one thing to what Tony just said is that that's exactly what we heard in the beginning of the show.",
        "When Governor Brewer signed the measure, she said it's decades of inaction by Washington.",
        "So I think as -President Obama has said this is a misguided bill.",
        "It may finally cause Washington to realize that we can't have 50 state legislatures forming foreign policy like this.",
        "Tony, I'm sorry, I cut you off.",
        "You were going to say?",
        "Yes, can I make one more comment?",
        "If you would make it quickly."

        "And it's an underclass of people, and here in Florida we see it a lot, especially in Amacoli(ph), that - that has to stop.",
        "All right, Tony.",
        "That is legalized slavery of this generation.",
        "And it's only because our politicians are not doing the work, the hard work of making decisions and implementing them.",
        "Tony, thank you very much, we appreciate it.",
        "He was also talking about Democrats politicizing this to score points with Hispanic voters, and that's one issue.",
        "But isn't it fair to say Republicans are politicizing it, too, to score points with their political base for the upcoming primaries?",
        "Well, perhaps yes, and I think that something that Peter O'Dowd said earlier, talking about Latino strength in Arizona, when you think of Hispanic voting population strength, it's California, New Mexico, Texas but less so in Arizona.",
        "They're less organized in Arizona, and I suspect one of the reasons Republicans were so for this bill was they feared they did not fear any kind of retribution.",

        "Mr.",

        "But there are some provisions in there for people providing emergency service, public safety and public health services.",
        "So I don't believe in that situation, there would be a problem.",

        "I'm not Latino.",
        "We go to Arizona to visit my sister-in-law.",

        "If he gets pulled over without some kind of passport, does he get hauled in somewhere until he can get someone to get him papers?",
        "What is...",
        "Peter O'Dowd, is a driver's license enough, or do you have to have something more than that?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: Yeah, good question.",
        "Again, people are really afraid about that, and what we're hearing is that, you know, let's say you're here legally in the state.",
        "If you have every right to be here, it's not you can say so, and if you don't have your driver's license, the police say that they can put your name and your date of birth into the computer and check it out to make sure that you belong here.",
        "And if you're a U.S.",
        "citizen, you dont have to have anything on you.",
        "It's just a matter if you're not here legally, and you don't have the papers, and you're asked for them, and you lie, then you're in big trouble.",
        "Right, but two people driving down the road, one is not a citizen, one is, they're both brown, but the one who is a citizen isn't used to carrying papers.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: Right, so but in that situation, unless the officer has some reason to believe that you are an illegal immigrant and you have you know, you can't just use the color of your skin, according to this law, to ask you for your papers, though.",
        "So you know, maybe..."

        "Again, what's new?",
        "It would be nice to change some of the immigration laws, but threatening to enforce the ones we already have does not seem outrageous to me.",
        "Well, as I understand it, Peter O'Dowd, the difference is, this is local authorities and state authorities taking on what has generally been, has always been regarded as federal authority.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: Right, so it's a federal crime to cross into the country illegally, but that's kind of where the states jurisdiction stops or doesn't really apply.",
        "So now the state is taking control into its hands and saying you are now committing a state crime.",
        "What's the difference?",
        "You know, on a practical level, I'm not really sure, except for the state is, you know, making a stand, it seems.",
        "Also that part that requires law authorities to demand identification papers from people they believe to be here illegally.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: And that's the most controversial part of the bill, yeah.",
        "Which oh, by the way, I should add, before, and this was the sponsor of the bill said before this law, many communities in Arizona created safe havens or what they called sanctuary cities.",
        "So now, he's given the police the power, the bill has given the police the power, you know, to ask those questions, takes the handcuffs off, as they like to say, and it allows police to ask those questions, which they weren't allowed to ask before.",

        "And what it's going to do to our already bankrupt state, in a state with budget woes that everybody likes to blame Hispanics for, is it's going to make things worse in regards to immigrants or folks of brown color like myself who are already skeptical of the authorities here and in our city.",

        "Carlos, thanks very much.",

        "Do they worry that they're going to stop having communications with, you know, people providing information on crimes in the Hispanic community?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: Well, it depends on which police you talk to.",

        "As it is now, some people in the heavily minority neighborhoods say that they have a good working relationship with the police, but they worry that will change.",
        "If you talk to other police agencies across the state - kind of just like I said, depends on who you talk to.",
        "Others say, absolutely - no one is going to voluntarily bring the police into their neighborhoods if you fear getting deported.",
