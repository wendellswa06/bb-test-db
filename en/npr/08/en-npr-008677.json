        "Absolutely.",
        "As a matter of fact, that's one of the biggest fears about a law like this is that there are state legislators in other states with similar problems.",

        "But there other states and the lawmakers who have been pushing for this.",
        "And they feel that unless Washington acts, unless Congress acts, there will be 49 more states, you know, pushing for this kind of legislation.",
        "David, thanks very much.",
        "And I guess my - specifically, the states that don't have as much - that aren't border states, but it's going to be like a bandwagon for them to jump on that...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...for states that be - are kind of inclined in that way.",
        "And I'll listen to the rest of your comments off the line.",
        "All right, David.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "And that's where you get to the legal issue.",
        "And this is, as we mentioned earlier, almost certain to be in federal court before it takes effect in 90 days.",
        "And I wonder, Peter O'Dowd, have you talked with legal scholars there in Arizona?",
        "What do they say its prospects are?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'DOWD: I have.",
        "Just this morning, I talked to a constitutional lawyer who says he thinks that the challenges have a pretty good chance in court.",
        "There's a couple of things that they think that they can work on here.",
        "Number one is federalism.",
        "The argument from some of these lawsuits is that, absolutely, 100 percent, the federal government has control over immigration law.",
        "And in this case, Arizona is trying to hijack that to actually try and control the way the federal government enforces immigration law.",
        "So that's the number one."

        "So there are - and I'm not a legal scholar myself, but - so it's the Fourth Amendment there that seems to be causing some skepticism.",
        "Ken?",

        "And while Jan Brewer said, look, you know, this is not something I would have liked to have passed - and Jan Brewer is not one of those fire breathing, right-wing Republicans, but she knows that something is not working in her state, and perhaps this will get the incentive to Washington to wake up."
