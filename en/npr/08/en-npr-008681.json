        "And none of these factors were significantly different between the two groups.",
        "So what's at play here?",
        "Well, Scheer, who studies chronobiology, or how time influences biology, says recent animal studies have shown that the timing of eating can have a powerful influence on metabolism and weight regulation.",
        "This new study, he says, is among the first to suggest that this may also be true in people.",
        "Only in recent years are we starting to try to tease apart what the underlying mechanisms might be.",
        "In the study, the people who ate late and didn't lose as much weight also tended to skip breakfast, or eat just a little in the morning.",
        "And Scheer says that since eating seems to send a signal to our body clocks, it could be that when people delay eating until late in the day, things get out of whack.",
        "The master clock in the brain is no longer in sync with the mini-clocks in the cells of the body that regulate metabolism.",
        "When the timing of meals doesn't match with the sleep-wake cycle well, there is a disconnect between the different clocks that we have in basically all the cells in our body.",
        "And with this disconnect, the complex systems that regulate weight don't work as well.",
        "Now, not everyone is convinced by the findings of the study.",
        "Madelyn Fernstrom of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center says she's skeptical that the timing of meals alone can influence weight so significantly.",
        "Clearly, there is something biological about this whole cascade.",
        "But I think there's a lot of other unanswered questions.",
        "For instance, could it be that the amount of food at breakfast rather than the timing of lunch or dinner makes a difference?",
        "It's not clear.",
        "She says the more we learn about the many factors that may influence weight, it's important for dieters not to lose sight of the big picture.",
        "The greater importance is what you are eating.",
        "You need to eat fewer calories and move more.",
        "Which is, of course, something that you likely already know.",
