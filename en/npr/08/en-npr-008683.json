        "This fall, in an interview with a French magazine, Philip Roth announced his retirement.",
        "I no longer have the stamina to endure the frustration,\"\" he explained.",
        "Instead, he's been entertaining friends, playing with his iPhone, and eating meals prepared by a personal chef.",
        "Few writers have done more to earn their retirements, and I wish him well.",
        "But I also expect a new novel from him no later than, say, the fall of 2014.",
        "It isn't that I question the sincerity of his intention to retire.",
        "What I question is whether he - the part of him that gives interviews, anyway - really has the final say in the matter.",
        "Writers are notoriously unreliable, when it comes to their future plans.",

        "It isn't only on the page that writers tend to fictionalize.",
        "They aren't - I don't think - being deliberately deceptive.",
        "There are plenty of times in a typical writing day when retirement seems, even to someone much younger than 80, like the sweetest imaginable relief.",
        "But fiction emanates from an organ every bit as mysterious, and as much beyond conscious control, as the liver.",
        "The actual work of being a writer - the generation of plots and characters, the resolving of tangled chapter transitions - goes on while you sleep or shower, or walk the dog.",
        "You might as well announce your retirement from metabolizing sugar.",
        "President Bush says he is optimistic about tomorrow's Middle East summit in Annapolis.",
        "The leaders of Israel and the Palestinian authority will be there, along with representatives of dozens of other countries.",
        "The optimism that Mr. Bush expressed today has not been heard very often in advance of this meeting.",
        "The real history, according to the president, is that Iraq was a threat that had to be confronted in a post-9/11 world and that both parties accepted the administration's case for war.",
        "One key element of that case was the suggestion that Saddam had or would soon have the deadliest weapons imaginable.",
        "In the six months leading up to the war, the president and other top administration officials used stark language to help Americans imagine the dangers.",
        "Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun, that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud.",
        "We know he's been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons, and we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons.",
        "We don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.",
        "There was widespread belief that Iraq did have biological and chemical weapons, but less confidence on the nuclear question.",
        "There were deep divisions in the US intelligence community over the issue.",

        "The administration tried to bolster its case by making a connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda, which implied a connection to the 9/11 attacks.",

        "We've learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making, in poisons and deadly gases.",
        "That information came from a captured al-Qaeda operative named Iman Al-Sheik al-Libby(ph).",
        "Eight months before President Bush made that speech, the Defense Intelligence Agency issued a report saying that information from al-Libby could not be trusted.",
        "Other informants were also ultimately discredited.",
        "Take the case of a man code-named Curveball, an Iraqi who defected to Germany in 1999 and lived under the control of that country's intelligence service.",
        "When Secretary of State Colin Powell went to the United Nations in February of 2003, six weeks before the war began, some of the key elements in his controversial presentation were the result of information provided by Curveball.",
        "Powell offered this assurance that day.",
        "(Soundbite of speech, 2003)",
        "My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources.",
        "These are not assertions.",

        "He says Powell went to then-CIA Director George Tenet in advance to make sure everything in that presentation was accurate.",

        "`Yes, Mr. Secretary.",

        "Slowly, the absolute certainty the administration displayed going into the war began to dissolve, as neither al-Qaeda links, nor weapons of mass destruction were found.",
        "George Tenet, former CIA director, was left trying to explain what went wrong.",
        "The question being asked about Iraq in the starkest terms is: Were we right or were we wrong?",
        "In the intelligence business, you are almost never completely wrong or completely right.",
        "All of this has contributed to the credibility problems the administration is dealing with today on the issue of the war.",
        "A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll says that 57 percent of Americans believe that the president did deliberately mislead them in making the case for war.",
        "Some critics say the administration manipulated intelligence outright, focusing only on things that supported its position, while burying conflicting data.",

        "And Graham says Congress did not have access to anywhere near the amount of raw data that the president has, and the quality of that intelligence is now a major part of the fight between the White House and Democrats on the Hill.",
