        "Eric Johnson of Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business has studied Mattel for years.",
        "He says in this recall and the one two weeks ago, they did the right thing.",
        "In fact for years, Johnson and others have held up Mattel as a model corporate citizen, meticulous in its commitment to safety.",
        "Mattel is really one of the best and, you know, they have been in China a long time, they have deep experience, they run their own factories there.",
        "It's ironic that we're talking about them and actually gives me concern for what we will be talking about this fall for the many toy companies that don't have nearly the experience they do.",
        "Johnson says Mattel might be punished for doing the right thing.",
        "By so aggressively testing its products and announcing bad results, Mattel might draw attention to itself.",
        "Other companies with unsafe products but less aggressive testing might never have to face such a crisis.",
        "This week's other recall involves toothpaste.",
        "Kathie De Voe, the president of Gilchrist & Soames, says her company also diligently began testing the moment she heard from the FDA that some Chinese-made toothpaste contained diethylene glycol or DEG, a kind of anti-freeze.",
        "The company tested the toothpaste they import from China and at first, all the tests showed no contamination.",
        "So we were absolutely thrilled.",
        "However, we kept pulling additional samples and it wasn't until the fifth batch that we saw a test come through that show traces of DEG.",
        "The company stopped shipping all of its toothpaste to hotels in June.",
        "Both Mattel and Gilchrist & Soames say they will continue to import products from China, though they will add more scrutiny.",
        "Mattel's Bob Eckert.",
        "Most of the world's toys are made in China today and most of the recalls are announced with toys made in China today.",
        "If you go back in previous years when toys were made in different markets, you would see recalls coming from those markets.",
        "Eckert says he doesn't yet know how the recall will impact Christmas sales.",

        "There was no confusion.",
        "There was absolutely no confusion.",
        "The message that we carried from Prime Minister Olmert was the exact message that he gave us.",
        "He is a man of peace, and he expressed to us that we should express to the president of Syria his interest in going to the negotiating table, but not until Syria took steps to stop its support for Hamas and Hezbollah.",

        "He claims, I didn't read it carefully enough to notice that it didn't mention friendly-fire.",

        "Could Pat Tillman still have received the Silver Star even if General McChrystal came out right away and said this was a friendly-fire incident and we're going to give him the Silver Star?",

        "Why would they do that?",
        "Well, because this was April 2004.",
