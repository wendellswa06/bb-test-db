        "But the prime minister of Israel's office issued a clarification, a denial, in effect, because according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the other day, the statement from the prime minister's office - from Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office - said that Olmert had told Pelosi that Israel continued to regard Syria, quote, \"\"as part of the axis of evil and a party encouraging terrorism in the entire Middle East.\"\" If I heard you, you didn't - you don't recall him saying that in your conversation.",
        "No. What he told us was that - the thrust of his statement is that Israel is prepared to go to the negotiating table.",

        "We didn't go to the press and say what we did there, but their office put out the message that they had asked us to take this message to the Syrians.",
        "And whatever press they heard about the visit may not have been satisfactory to them, so they may want to clarify it for that purpose.",
        "But there was no clarification needed in terms of what (unintelligible) our message was.",
        "Can you tell us, in Saudi Arabia, what did you hear from the Saudis about the House Democrats' preference and your preference for the U.S.",
        "to start withdrawing from Iraq next year?",
        "Well, we - in our meeting in Saudi Arabia, they're really more related to the purpose of our trip.",

        "What we went to the Middle East was to convey a message of the - but where we are in agreement with the president.",

        "In our general debate there and we had met with him for three hours.",
        "And from - certainly the issue of troops going in and out of Syria into Iraq is part of the concern we have with Syria, and we expressed that to him.",
        "In his response, he had some opinions about Iraq, but again, it was related to the subjects that we went there to talk to him about."

        "Fitzgerald basically goes over the same material again and again, repeatedly giving Libby a chance to change his testimony, remember events differently.",
        "And Libby sticks to his story.",
        "He says in the week following the publication of former ambassador Joseph Wilson's op-ed in The New York Times accusing the administration of twisting intelligence, he, Libby, had forgotten that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA and that he didn't disclose that information to reporters, because as far as he was concerned, he didn't know that information.",
        "And just to bring us up here, Libby's story is that he actually learned the information from Tim Russert of NBC on July 10th or 11th, four or five days after Wilson's op-ed appeared.",
        "That's right.",
        "Libby says he called Russert to complain about Chris Matthews, also of NBC, and that Russert said he couldn't do much about Matthews and that Russert then pivoted in the conversation and asked did you know that Ambassador Wilson's wife works at the CIA?",
        "And Libby said he was, quote, \"\"taken aback by that statement\"\" and said no, I don't know that because he thought this was something that he was learning for the firs time, and then Libby quoted Russert as saying, \"\"Yeah, all the reporters know it."

        "He has an underlined copy of Wilson's op-ed permanently affixed to his desk.",
