        "But something was missing.",
        "They didn't have a principal called John Serio.",
        "Right.",

        "Parents knew they might have to do without Hannan's famed sports fields and its new arts building, but they wanted Serio back.",
        "Then, you know, Mr. Serio started getting phone calls from other students that were elsewhere in Louisiana and Texas and Alabama, saying, well if Hannan's going to open up, we're coming back.",
        "So the Archdiocese opened their ears, you know, and said, hey, you know, these people want this school back.",
        "But it wasn't easy.",
        "They kept saying, no, no, no, no, for a long time."

        "What defines this school is the mission of this school, and the philosophy of this school, which is old fashioned values.",
        "There are consequences for bad decisions.",
        "Serio says he's as surprised as anyone the school has returned.",
        "When he saw the remains of the old building after the flood, he was convinced it was all over.",
        "When I got in, it was absolute devastation.",
        "There was not one item that I picked up and saved in my office.",
        "And, we couldn't even get through the rest of the school.",
        "We couldn't get through it.",
        "It was too crushed.",
        "The building was crushed.",
        "Since the storm, the Archdiocese has made a commitment to welcome all children who want to come, whether they can afford it or not.",
        "We've had non-Catholic students in this school for 20 years.",
        "I've never had a non-Catholic parent ever come up and say, my kid is uncomfortable, my child is uncomfortable.",
        "We've had non-Catholic students that got the medallion at graduation for having the highest average in religion.",
        "Serio is disappointed about one thing.",
        "He doesn't like the cramped trailer they use as a cafeteria, where some kids have to squat on the floor to eat the fast food that's being brought in.",
        "He says, the old campus had a beautiful courtyard, where everyone gathered for an hour-long lunch break.",

        "He is.",

        "Okay, this is an easy recipe.",
        "You only need two ingredients.",
        "One ingredient is common, ordinary table sugar, which you'll have in your kitchen, and the other is potassium nitrate, which you would know as saltpeter.",
        "You can't go to the grocery store and say, oh, I'd like to pick up some potassium nitrate, but you can go to a Lowe's or a Home Depot or any supply store like that and pick up stump remover, and stump remover is pure potassium nitrate.",
        "And what you do is you get out a saucepan.",
        "You put three tablespoons of the potassium nitrate into the pan with two tablespoons of the sugar.",
        "You stir it up over medium heat until it's mixed together.",
        "You don't want to go on high heat, or then it would turn into one of those experiments you don't want to do where the fire department comes and the smoke alarm goes off.",
        "But generally speaking, you can just stir until it's integrated and melted, drop it onto a cookie sheet or some foil, take it outside and light it.",
        "You'll get purple fire.",
        "You'll get smoke.",
        "It's easy and safe.",
        "Wow, that's a good one, pretty simple ingredients we can get anywhere.",
        "Bill Gurstelle, my favorite project from \"\"Backyard Ballistics\"\" is the spud gun.",
        "It's a potato shooter.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Well, a spud gun, sometimes called a starch shooter or a - you know, potato cannon.",
        "It's got a lot of different names, and it's been around since, well I don't know, like ever since PVC pipe was invented, but it's a simple device.",
        "It's constructed, as I said, from PVC pipe and PVC pipe fittings.",
        "You basically put a potato in one end, and you put hairspray in the other because hairspray has a lot of hydrocarbons, (unintelligible), and if you can figure out a way to put, make a spark in the combustion chamber, the potato issues from the muzzle with great velocity and a lot of noise.",
        "It's a pretty cool thing to behold.",
        "Theo Gray, you have two different ways of making ice cream in your book.",
        "Yes.",
        "So you can do it with liquid nitrogen, or you can do it with a fire extinguisher.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Personally, I find the liquid-nitrogen ice cream tastes a lot better, and it's particularly easy to do, as long as you have a source of liquid nitrogen.",
        "Basically, all you do is just mix up your favorite ice-cream recipe.",
        "You can use any, you know, any recipe you find as long as it doesn't have alcohol in it.",
        "And then sort of pour in liquid nitrogen and keep stirring until it's turned into ice cream, which is usually 20 or 30 seconds later.",
        "The reason you don't want alcohol is because that can depress the freezing point to the point where your ice cream actually gets so cold that it's dangerous without having turned solid yet.",
        "And that's really - it's a very good grade of ice cream.",
        "It's delicious.",
        "It's smooth and creamy because it freezes so fast that crystals are very small.",
        "The only catch is you need to find something that's got some liquid nitrogen in it.",
        "If you don't own your own dewar, that usually means finding somebody at a university or a medical office somewhere that keeps a tank of it around and inviting them to your picnic."
