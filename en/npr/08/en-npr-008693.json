        "Yeah.",
        "There's a lot of things you can do with that one too, but…",
        "Well, it's actually not unlike the recipe we just heard about for smoke bombs.",
        "You know, I did that experiment as a way of illustrating the importance of oxidizers, you know, as one of my columns.",
        "The point being that if you have a powerful enough oxidizer like, you know, potassium chlorate or perchlorate or ammonium nitrate or any one of these standard sort of oxidizers that one uses, you can burn almost anything with it.",
        "It doesn't really matter, almost any kind of organic matter will work.",
        "I originally was going to use a Snickers bar, but I kind of was worried that if I didn't chop the nuts up very finely, they would clog the nozzle.",
        "So I decided, you know, an Oreo filling was a nice, good, sort of creamy material that I could use as - just as an illustration of how the fuel is relatively unimportant compared to the oxidizer.",

        "In fact, there's people who have shot rockets, you know, quite high up in the air based on sugar propellants.",

        "That's another one where you go to your kitchen for the ingredients.",
        "This one's even easier.",
        "You just need powdered sugar and baking soda, and you can make your own black snake, which is a firework that you would put on a fire-safe surface and light with a lighter, and it makes a black column that grows out, and it's great fun.",
        "And it's non-toxic in this version, although the ones that you buy might contain things that you wouldn't want to eat or have kids play with, but what you do as you take, say, four teaspoons of powdered sugar and maybe one teaspoon of baking soda.",
        "You mix that up and you set that in a depression in some dirt or some sand.",
        "You can pour a fuel on that like alcohol.",
        "You could pour Vodka on it.",
        "You could pour kerosene, whatever you think you can ignite.",

        "But basically you take a sheet - a full sheet of newspaper and you kind of fold the four corners together so it looks like pillow, okay.",
        "And then you either put a staple or piece of tape at the (unintelligible) where they come together and (unintelligible) Now, you get three friends to help you.",
        "You each take a match and you light the pointy corner of the kite, this pillow, and as the, you know, the newspaper catches fire and it heats up the air inside this paper kite, and if it's a cool night - now, I have to tell people all the time (unintelligible) cool night because the whole thing is based on buoyancy.",
        "The hot air inside the kite is lighter than the cool air outside the kite so the whole thing rises.",
        "And when it does rise, Ira, into the night, it's (unintelligible) glowing kite.",

        "And because the hydrogen is very light, sort of Hindenburg-like, the bubbles eventually detach themselves and float up into the air.",
        "And then you chase after them with the candle at the end of a long stick.",
        "With pure hydrogen, you get really beautiful sort of jellyfish-like shapes out of fire.",
