        "You just scrape the gunpowder onto a plate.",
        "You take a two inch piece of scotch tape or masking tape and you pick up the gunpowder with that, and it will stick.",
        "And this is a - what makes this safe is you can only get so much gunpowder to stick onto your piece of tape.",
        "So you're not going to make an M80 and blow your finger off with this.",
        "But you put a little fuse that you got from a fireworks store or you could take a little roll of toilet paper, you roll that up and tape the whole thing up to make your own little firecracker shape.",

        "The dangerous part is the fuse.",
        "If you're making your own homemade fuse, you're not sure if it's burning so there's a little bit of a risk of getting a pop before you're ready.",
        "But otherwise it's safe and it's fun.",
        "You get a big pop.",
