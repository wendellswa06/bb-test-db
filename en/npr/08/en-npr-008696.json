        "They no longer can keep that covered up.",
        "The fact is that many of the greatest players of this generation have used substances, and probably many more will be revealed to have used them.",
        "And then the Hall of Fame has to make a decision, and so does baseball: Do they want to go out of business?",
        "Do they want to make the point that their players are fakes and phonies, and that the game is fake?",
        "Or do they want to admit that, as it did in the - change from the dead ball to the live ball, or after racial integration in 1947, or after the end of the reserve clause, baseball lives in the world?",
