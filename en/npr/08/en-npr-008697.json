        "She's written about this in a new book called \"\"Living Among Headstones.\"\" Shannon Applegate joined me from the grounds of the Applegate Pioneer Cemetery.",
        "The most prominent feature of our cemetery are these extraordinary old trees.",
        "Some of them are about 200 years old.",
        "There are port orchard cedars and incense cedars, huge madrones with very reddish trunks, just a lovely canopy of trees and a lot of birds.",
