        "But I know so many people that love old cemeteries and just come into them and look around and let their imaginations go and end up telling me often about some little cemetery--maybe in Colorado on their grandmother's place or, you know, someplace in Pennsylvania or Vermont--that every time they go back home, they search out and they stand there among the stones.",

        "In fact, he got 46.2 percent.",
        "That's much better than the polls had been saying and a remarkable performance given that he has no big party behind him, he had very little access to TV advertising, and he spent three weeks of the campaign in hospital after being stabbed and severely injured at a political rally.",
        "But he fought hard, especially on social media, and now he's in a strong position to go on and possibly win.",
        "Well, he's in a strong position to win, actually.",

        "Given that blogs are blowing up and many young Americans prefer Jon Stewart's fake news over the real thing, it seems at first glance that Gore might be on to something.",
        "But it's hard to imagine `Al Gore' and `hip' in the same sentence.",
        "Anytime I hear some middle-aged person talk about creating what young people want or need, I cringe.",
        "What young people want is for older people to leave them alone.",
