        "Is there any indication that at this point, the president and the Muslim Brotherhood will reconsider?",
        "So far we're not seeing indications of that.",
        "Of course, as you mentioned, yesterday, the president's spokesman kind of came out and tried to explain the decrees.",
        "One of the decrees basically said, any law or decision I make from now until the constitution is written or a parliament is in place has - there is no way to challenge it in courts.",
        "He said, actually that's limited to sovereign act.",
        "What sovereign acts mean, though, is so vague and unclear.",
        "And it really didn't appease his opposition.",
        "And so far, we're really not seeing them back off.",
        "In fact, when we called members of the Muslim Brotherhood, allies of the president today, they said, yes, the numbers are big out and square, but we canceled our protest to make sure there was no bloodshed.",
        "And we believe those are all supporters or in cahoots with members of the former regime.",
        "They did cancel what was, I guess, a counter-demonstration, and there could have been a serious situation had that gone ahead.",
        "They canceled their protest in the capital, but we did see pretty large protest in support of the Muslim Brotherhood outside of the capital.",
        "So in the capital, the only people we saw in the streets today were, as I said, opponents of Mohammed Morsi.",
        "And many of the people we spoke to today were from the - I would describe the political, secular, liberal elite of the country.",
        "Of course, it was a cross-section.",
        "There were hundreds of thousands of people out there, but it didn't seem to be all of Egypt.",
        "And it's really on - it really feels that the nation is very divided about what to do and how to react to Morsi's decree.",
        "Some people do support them.",
        "And so where do we go from here?",
        "One of the things that happened after the decree was issued is the stock market plunged.",
        "Well, at this point, we'll have to see.",
        "I mean, these huge numbers came out tonight.",
        "It's unclear if the president will have a new reaction to this, but in their mind, they have to push forward.",
        "They're going to get a constitution out even if it does lack some legitimacy internationally and domestically because of what's happened with these decrees, because of the walkouts that have come out.",
        "…vehement in his remarks about the United States on this.",
        "Why would not the logic of mutual, assured destruction and deterrence work with a nuclear Iran in the same way that it worked with those nuclear powers?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And a lot of his political opponents, people that were unable, you know, Mohammed Morsi was elected also very - by a very slim margin of the population.",
        "So you're seeing former presidential candidates like Amr Moussa, once the foreign minister here, once the head of the Arab League, Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel laureate.",
        "Those people are really capitalizing on this real anger towards Mohammed Morsi and possibly rejuvenating their political careers.",
        "So we'll really have to see.",
        "We're seeing a very divided nation, and many people are very worried about what will happen next."

        "There is, as you mentioned, it is an Islamist victory in those elections, but it was not just the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "A big fraction of that was Salafis, who are even more extreme.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The Muslim Brotherhood sort of propagate themselves as moderate Islamist, the open Islamist.",
        "And the Salafis are much more literal in their interpretation of Islam; very, very conservative.",
        "And so far we're seeing them, at least in this moment, aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood on this decision.",
        "This is a decision, they say, that will get the constitution through, that will give us the parliament with legislative powers.",
        "One thing we can't forget is what - Mohammed Morsi was quite powerful already.",
        "When he ousted the military leaders and took legislative power from them because there was no parliament and they had it, he became both the president and the parliament.",
        "So now, he's both the president and the parliament, and nothing he decides can technically be challenged in court.",
        "It'll have to remain to be seen if the idea that he talks about, the sovereign acts he decides are not challengeable, if there is a difference between a sovereign act and another act.",
        "Again, the legal language is so vague that people don't trust him, don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "Another issue a lot of people point out is that the Muslim Brotherhood has made many promises over this transitional period that they didn't keep.",
        "They said, we'd only run for about 30 percent of the parliament seats.",
        "They ran for much more.",
        "And they won about almost 50 percent of that parliament that's now dissolved.",
        "They said, we don't want to run for president.",
        "We don't want to run the country.",
        "And not only did they break that promise, but they ran two candidates.",
        "And one of them is now president.",
        "So people say, OK, he says we'll take - I'm taking this power temporarily, don't worry, I just need to get things back on track.",
        "But they say, how can we know?",
        "How can we trust him that he'll really return these powers to other branches so he will have checked power again?",
        "There will be checks and balances.",
        "You mentioned his removal of the military leadership that had taken over after Mr. Mubarak was removed from power.",
        "They, in fact, removed Mr. Mubarak from power.",
        "What about the army?",
        "Well, at this point, they are really not in the picture of this fight.",
        "They're behind the scenes.",
        "As you mentioned, by a similar decree in August, he made quite a wildly popular move and ousted the top generals, forced them into retirement and did a shakeup of the leadership.",
        "In exchange, most likely, they got promises about the economic privileges that they have, and they've been largely quiet on this issue.",
        "So as - if the Islamists, if the Muslim Brotherhood and the Salafis end up writing the constitution, if the liberals, the seculars, as you call them, and the minorities, the Copts, for example, don't participate, will there be any functional difference if the president gets powers through a constitutional process?",
        "Well, that remains to be seen.",
        "We don't have a constitution right now.",
        "They would like to model it off - when you talk to the Muslim Brotherhood, they would like to model it off the French system where the president does have broad power as well as a parliament.",
        "The bigger issue is that most people aren't thinking about the constitution.",
        "They're thinking about very basic things.",
        "There's a problem with the economy.",
        "There's high unemployment.",
        "Just a few weeks ago, there was a horrific bus accident with a train in which children were killed, and they're saying, get past this stuff, this stuff that won't affect my life so you can reform the transportation ministry, the interior ministry, deal with our economy.",
        "And I think a lot of people think that way.",
        "And so when they see Morsi making a decision that he says will put the country on a path of progress, allow him to make the reforms that he's promised and never delivered, it's kind of a popular decision among some people."

        "I mean, we reached an understanding with the leaders of the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War that it's simply wasn't worth it to risk or get into nuclear conflict.",

        "So now, we have economic sanctions.",
        "If that doesn't work, we really have to consider military action to stop them from doing it, perhaps by striking the bases around Tehran where we know they are training these Iraqi terrorists who go back to kill Americans.",
        "It's a much more complicated situation with regard to the nuclear weapons and I think if we act seriously and strongly in regard to Iranian expansionism, they will take more seriously opposition to their development of nuclear weapons and hopefully, we will never have to carry out military action to stop Iran's nuclear program.",
        "Well, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, thank you very much for talking with us."
