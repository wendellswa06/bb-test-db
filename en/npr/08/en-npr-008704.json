        "So, it was like hard for me to like handle it.",
        "And nobody ever told me like, oh people will get shot when you move out here.",
        "Oh, you're going to have to worry about gangs, and you can't dress the way you used to dress and stuff like that.",
        "So, I never knew.",
        "Ana?",
        "I would've - back then I would have wanted someone to tell me, but I wouldn't want them to sugarcoat it for me.",

        "Marisol, is this helpful to you?",
        "Yes it is because what she said, not to sugarcoat it, exactly.",
        "I try to let the children - well, give the children an awareness.",
        "I tried to build their awareness for down the road as they go to the higher grades, kindergarten, first grade, third grade because some of these children might have brothers and sisters or cousins that are in gangs and they might think they're cool by standing in the corner 'cause one of my little boys, some of those boys are cool and I should know, they are not cool because they hurt people and they make people sad, mommies and daddies become very sad if they shoot someone with a gun or they use an - like one of my little boys, they can use knives too, teacher.",
        "And I said, that's right and I think it's just being able to talk to them at their level of understanding.",
        "The guns and the gang bangers fighting, and gangs bring sadness to families because if you get involved in a gang, someone can get hurt because there is gang violence.",
        "Or guns, if a relative has a gun in the home or for safety reasons, like one of my little boys said, his uncle has a gun for safety reasons, but what about them going and touching it by accident because they don't know that it's - they know that it's real but sometimes they, you know, video games and everything, they're, oh, I can touch it, you know, I can shoot it, and then I won't die.",

        "They know what it is, but they don't know why.",
        "Ana, is gangs - are gangs, the number one problem in terms of your safety, do you feel getting to and from school and being at school.",
        "That's one of the main things and just another thing, it's the community because a lot of people that go to the South Central schools, they often have to walk their way to school.",
        "And a lot of times, they see, of course, gangs and drug dealers and all that stuff.",
        "So, it's really unsafe for them to go school and then walk back home or take the bus.",

        "What do you do?",

        "I'm like, OK, I can't just detach myself from that, I can't just ignore it because in doing so, it's like being in denial that all this is actually happening.",
        "Same for you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Like I said earlier about having to ride the bus.",

        "I mean, four years and eight months ago, I testified before the same body, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and said that, if President Bush has his way and has his own set of military commission trials without congressional authorization, the result will be no convictions and the Supreme Court overturning President Bush's decision.",

        "And, for our core values, embodied in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, our system of existing military law, to be followed, before kind of striking out and making radical changes which is what the administration has sought.",
        "What you also heard in today's hearing, is the American spirit of debate.",
        "The Senators are very divided on this issue, do you think in the end, that Congress will come up with a system that will ultimately give your client what he's been seeking - a fair trial?",
        "Well, that's the Supreme Court's mandate, that a fair trial be given.",
        "And it turns out that there is a system on the books that provides that fair trial now, as the Supreme Court said, and that's called a Court Martial.",
        "Congress, in 1916, passed a law that said that trials of terrorism suspects can take place in these Courts Martial, and they're on the books now and we've used them hundreds of times in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "And if we use them now, we can get those fair trials.",
        "If we adopt the Bush Administration's solution, as some new fangled system, the result is going to be a whole bunch more litigation right now, tied up in courts for years, again, and perhaps again, a reversal by the Supreme Court if these policies are adopted, of not really having fair trials.",
        "So it seems to me, as Senator Graham said, let's work with the existing system instead of junking it.",
        "I'd also like to get your thoughts on this announcement from the White House.",
        "As we reported, the White House announced that Article Three of the Geneva Convention applies to your client and many other detainees, how does that change your legal strategy?"
