        "This trip comes at a time when the U.S.",
        "and Europe are stressing diplomatic solutions to some vexing problems: the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and the escalating violence in Middle East.",

        "What's the agenda for the president there?",
        "Well, the president always likes to go to places that were once under the rule of Communism and talk about democracy.",
        "And the former East Germany certainly provides him an opportunity to do that.",
        "But this visit is really all about the new and very real friendship between President Bush and the new German Chancellor Merkel.",
        "And Renee, I have to tell you, to help cement the friendship Mr. Bush was presented with the traditional and ceremonial barrel of herring during a welcome ceremony in Stralsund today.",
        "It was a small barrel.",
        "I'm not sure when any one last presented you with a barrel of herring as a gift, but the president was most appreciative today.",
        "And really, let me add, Merkel - Chancellor Merkel can really be seen as the president's best new friend on the continent, given the pending departure of Tony Blair in Britain and the recent departure of Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, both very close allies.",
        "The White House now views Germany as a very critical component of U.S.-European relations.",
        "This, of course, visit in East Germany comes in advance of the G8 Summit in Russia.",

        "That's when Mr. Bush declared that he looked into Putin's eyes and had gotten a sense of his soul.",

        "It's a system known as return-free filing, and the very idea is pitting taxpayer advocates against tax preparation companies.",
        "With return-free filing, the government tells you what it thinks you owe in taxes, and then you make changes as you see fit.",
