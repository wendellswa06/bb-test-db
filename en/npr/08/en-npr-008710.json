        "She was really being facetious with me.",
        "She leaned over and she said, hi, I'm Dinah Washington and I'm a singer.",
        "And everybody in the dressing room laughed and I said, well, I'm Patti Austin and I'm a singer too.",
        "And everybody just kind of looked at me like Scooby Doo, particularly my parents who were like what is she doing?",

        "And I said, okay.",
        "And totally fearless and precautious, and her musical director walked by the door and she stopped him and said, this is Patti Austin and she's a singer and she's going to sing on the next show.",
        "And he leaned over and he continued being facetious, and said, what are you going to sing?",
        "I said, Teach Me Tonight.",
        "So everybody started laughing and he said, yeah, what key do you sing it in?",
        "And I said, B-flat.",
        "Oh my.",
        "Because at that time I knew more about music than I knew about reading words.",
        "Because I would sit with my dad when he would practice for hours and he would show me what every note meant, and he'd put a metronome on and he'd make me keep time with the metronome and he'd play notes and have me sing them back.",
        "And so Dinah calls me onstage and I go out to sing the song and the band starts playing the intro, and the musical director forgot to tell them that I was doing it in a different key and so I stopped them.",
        "I said, you guys are in the wrong key.",
        "And the audience went wild.",
        "Oh, gosh.",
        "And they started the song up again in the right key and I sang the song in the right key, and everybody loved it and I ran off the stage and into the arms of Sammy Davis Jr., who was waiting on his knees.",
        "So I thought he was actually my height.",
        "And I ran to him, and he almost was my height actually at that time.",
        "And he grabbed me and picked me up and said, oh my God, you've got to do my show next week.",

        "We don't know much about where the fourth person was from.",
        "We don't know anything about that.",
        "The BBC is reporting that the men were born and raised in Britain, but that hasn't been confirmed.",
        "We know that according to the police they came down early on the morning of July 7th, and after the explosions, one of them was reported missing by his family.",
        "Is it fair to leap to the conclusion perhaps that these four men were in Leeds and drove to the train and then took the train to London?"

        "Yes, the police have basically told us that they carried out a controlled explosion at a car.",

        "They haven't told us much more than that, why they were interested in this, you know, why they carried out an explosion.",

        "That was about 20 minutes before the explosions went off.",
        "So the inference you can take is that they met there and separated, went on to different trains and that's when the explosions took place.",
