        "We're looking at the major breakthrough today announced by British police in London into the investigation of the bombings that happened there last Thursday.",
        "Police are investigating whether four attackers died in last week's explosions.",
        "They say they have strong evidence to support the idea that at least one of them did.",
        "One suspect has been arrested after a series of raids in the city of Leeds about 185 miles north of London.",
        "If you have a question about these new developments, our number is (800) 989-8255; (800) 989-TALK.",
        "E-mail us, totn@npr.org.",
        "Peter Bergen, we know nothing about the identity of these four men who've been identified on this closed-circuit television camera outside of King's Cross, of course, one of the stations that was bombed.",
        "There's another side of the investigation and that's looking into the explosives, the bombs themselves.",
        "Right.",
        "Clearly, you know, the explosions happened within 50 seconds of each other, three of the explosions, and they were also--the British are reporting that they were military-style explosives.",
        "So this wasn't stuff that was assembled, you know, from stuff that you get off of the shelf at the gardening shop.",
        "This was something more sophisticated.",
        "Very high-powered explosives, less than 10 pounds of it in each of these bombs, yet, clearly they caused major damage.",
        "I'm reading that AP is reporting that 15 percent of the residents of Leeds are Pakistani and come from a particular area near Islamabad.",
        "If indeed it turns out, as I think it's probable, that these guys who they've identified as the bombers are first- or second-generation Pakistani, that would lead me in the direction of they're maybe gaining experience with Kashmiri militant groups in Pakistan.",
        "The British Home Office estimates that several hundred Brits have gone and fought or trained in Kashmir and a further several hundred have gone and fought or trained in Afghanistan.",
        "And certainly these Kashmiri militant groups are the sort of groups that would have experience with the sort of more military-style explosives since they are conducting, you know, a pretty active insurgency against the Indian presence in Kashmir.",
        "Are we then still talking about al-Qaeda as the principal suspect in these explosions or is perhaps the net now widening?",
        "Well, if it turns out that it's more in the Kashmiri militant groups, these groups have strong ties to al-Qaeda.",
        "They've shared training camps in the past, but they do have obviously a separate agenda.",
        "They're more focused on Kashmir, but clearly the guys who did this have, if not they're members of al-Qaeda, they've certainly sort of bought into the al-Qaeda ideology and, you know, mounted an attack against Britain because of its presence in Iraq and because of its support for the United States and because they regard the British as, you know, too close to the United States and want to sort of protest that, I would imagine.",
        "I think it's going to get, you know, a lot less gentle.",
        "I mean, the British have done a tremendous job.",
        "You know, historically they've broken up a number of plots since 9/11.",
        "This one--why this one fell through the net is going to be a very interesting question to find out.",
        "We had been asking the questions.",
        "Until now, we had no answers, but we've been asking the questions whether this was a group that had come in from outside of Britain like the 9/11 bombers came into this country or a homegrown terrorist cell.",
        "Is it possible that it's a combination of both, that maybe the person who manufactured what police are describing, at least according to the report I read today in The New York Times, as a very sophisticated series of bombs--one of them may have come in from overseas to help other people?",
        "It's quite possible.",
        "I mean, you may remember last year, Neal, that British police arrested a Pakistani guy who was a sort of a computer expert based on some information that they derived from another arrest in Pakistan.",
        "So if somebody came from outside, likely they would have come from Pakistan, and if--we've also seen that--you know, you may also remember that there was a guy called Al Britani who was arrested last year.",
        "He was casing an American financial institution, you know?",
        "He is a Hindu convert to Islam, and I think he's also sort of emblematic to the fact that, you know, sort of the Indian subcontinent and Britain and the traffic between the two places has resulted in people being trained in the subcontinent and then trying to undertake acts of terrorism both in Britain and also in the United States."

        "Let's get some callers on the line, (800) 989-8255 and we'll begin with Gary.",
        "Gary calling from Memphis.",
        "Hey, Neal, great show.",
        "Thank you.",
        "My question is before the London bombings, how much evidence was there of consistent violent rhetoric as preached by some of the Islamic leaders in and around London?",
        "Well, there were certainly--I mean, there's two clerics that leap to mind.",
        "I mean, of course, there are, you know, I imagine thousands of Muslim clerics in the United Kingdom who don't preach anything other than that Islam as a religion of peace, but there are at least a couple that leap to mind.",
        "Abu Hamza al-Masri, who ran the Finsbury Park Mosque, where Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, worshipped and also Zacarias Moussaoui, who's pled guilty to try to attack the White House now.",
        "He is a very incendiary figure who was actually going to go on trial right around the time these bombs blew up.",
        "He's an Egyptian.",
        "He was--the people in the mosque of the Finsbury Park Mosque actually sort of rejected him at a certain point.",
        "Some of it is now being taken over by a much more moderate group of people, but certainly his rhetoric has led to people conducting attempted terrorist attacks in Yemen.",
        "We've also seen another guy called Sheik Omar Bakri Muhammad who is a Syrian who's associated--who by his own admission was sort of a spiritual mentor to the two British second-generation middle-class guys who I mentioned earlier in the program who conducted a suicide attack in Israel in 2003.",
        "So certainly there are these clerics.",
        "There are not a huge number of them.",
        "Unfortunately, they've been quite influential amongst impressionable young men who feel that somehow that they're not appreciated or somehow they've been alienated in British society and they have to make some sort of protest.",
        "I mean, is there anything the British government can do for preaching a message of violence and hatred against the British government?",
        "I mean, aren't there laws against that?",
        "I mean...",
        "Well, in Abu Ham's case, he's actually been tried on a charge of incitement to racial hatred which is a crime in England.",
        "It would not--because of the First Amendment in the United States, it would not necessarily be a crime here.",
        "So they are taking a more proactive stance.",
        "They've had, I think, even before the London bombing--I think after the London bombing, they'll start looking at other people like Sheik Omar Bakri Muhammad, who as yet faces no criminal charges.",
        "It just seems like specific, you know, speeches of violence--I mean, I realize hatred is a very indistinguishable thing.",
        "I mean, somebody can preach hatred and they're just preaching something from the Bible.",
        "Perhaps it can be perceived that way, but when you start saying, `You've got to commit jihad,' and we define jihad as violence, that to me is a threat and should be dealt with legally by the government.",
        "Well, as I indicated, there is a sort of legal dimension to the case against Abu Ham based on incitement to racial hatred, but the other thing which the French are doing interestingly enough, they're licensing Muslim clerics.",
        "So to become a cleric in France, you have to get a government sort of seal of approval.",
        "I'm not advocating that position.",
        "I'm just saying that's how the French have dealt with it."

        "Indeed.",
        "And it's sort of incomprehensible.",
        "Obviously, once the shock and grief are past, I mean, the same process that happened in this country will happen in Britain.",
        "I mean, there will be calls for an inquiry into this.",
        "The fact that the terror alert was--they have seven grades of terror alert, unlike the four ones we have here in this country, and it went down a notch.",
        "And I think that's going to be a big question particularly in light of the fact that the G8 Summit is precisely the kind of symbolic event...",
        "Right.",
        "...you know, jihadist terrorists would want to kind of interfere with.",
        "So there will be an inquiry just as there was in 9/11, just as there was after the Madrid attacks, and I think that will be a central question."

        "Well, Neal, it all started around about 11 hours ago now at 6:30 this morning UK time.",
        "Anti-terror police were called to five addresses in Leeds and the surrounding area--one area of Leeds known as Beeston, another area of Leeds known as Holbeck and just a few short miles away two houses in Dewsbury.",
        "Then a little afterwards, they raided a house at Colwyn Road in Beeston and they sealed off that area.",
        "A number of cars also were sealed off as well including two Mercedes and a red Volkswagen.",
        "They were parked directly outside the house.",

        "And then they burst into one home in particular.",

        "The military were called into the house and a controlled explosion was carried out at the property.",
        "Now police have been very reluctant to tell us what's actually been going on at that property, but what we do know is that specialist forensic officers have been called into all five of these houses after they got specialist search warrants.",
        "They applied to the courts here in the UK and they got specialist search warrants to search these five properties, and they're currently looking through the houses to see if they can find anything which might help in the investigation into the terror attacks on London.",
        "We're also just hearing from police sources that explosive material has just been found at one of the addresses in Leeds, and police are telling us that it's a significant amount of explosive material has been found at one of the addresses they've been looking at in Leeds today.",
        "So again you're reporting that police are now saying--or police sources are now saying they have found explosives in one of these houses?",
        "Yes, that's right.",

        "We're hearing now from police sources that the person arrested is related to one of the suspected bombers, and sources also said it's very likely that the three men whose belongings were found at the crime scenes are also dead.",
        "Yes.",
        "What more do we know about these people, who they are, where they're from, other than from these neighborhoods in Leeds?",
        "Well, police are trying to establish exactly that.",
        "What they're saying at the moment is that they suspect that three of these people from Leeds traveled down to London last Thursday, the day of the bombings, and possibly met up with each other.",
        "As the forensic examination of the sites on the Tube and also at the exploded bus in London continues, they found evidence, forensic evidence which has led the police to come to these houses in West Yorkshire in Leeds today to make--and this is what they've resulted--this is what's resulted from their investigations, the person being arrested.",
