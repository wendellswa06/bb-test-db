        "In the United States that's correct, yeah, and it would be almost impossible in our system, where we don't have individual filing like they do in the U.K.",
        "So your return, if you're married, depends on your income and your spouse's income.",
        "It would be really difficult to have exact withholding.",

        "Sure, so return-free tax filing, it sounds like you have already sort of discussed the basics, but essentially it would allow the IRS to offer certain taxpayers with simple tax situations the option to get a prefilled tax return using information the government already receives.",
        "Taxpayers could then review, sign it and send in for free.",

        "And he was coming at it from a very different point of view, from having kind of done the numbers of what it would cost the IRS and whether this would really be cost-effective.",

        "The GAO, which is the Government Accountability Office, later studied this in the late '90s and said wait, actually we could save some money if we did this, you know, if all taxpayers eligible used it, because we would get more accurate returns, we would have less audits, and, you know, the e-filing rates might also go up.",

        "They're people who have extremely complicated returns, the most complicated people use preparers.",

        "So there's a lot of people that just don't want to deal with a tax return, and they go to a preparer.",

        "I mean, there's the possibility that people who don't have a really high financial literacy are being overcharged?",
