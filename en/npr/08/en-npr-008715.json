        "But what if the government prepared your return for you, and you just checked it over, made changes and then submitted it?",
        "That was called return-free filing.",
        "It could be a voluntary option for taxpayers, but it's not yet.",
        "And a new piece from ProPublica says one reason for that is Intuit, the company that makes TurboTax, has fought it.",
        "Liz Day from ProPublica is here today.",
        "And Intuit has actually responded to ProPublica's reporting in an email, explaining its position.",
        "And I quote here from that statement: Relying on an actual withholding or government reconciliation tax system, eliminating or curtailing citizen participation in the taxation process, has far-reaching implications for accuracy in public tax expenditures, which are often targeted by policymakers to those lower and middle-income citizens with the simplest returns.",
        "This in turn has implications for accuracy and fairness in taxation itself.",
        "And Intuit continues: This is not about Intuit, although some work very hard to make it appear that way.",
        "This is about a basic belief that taxpayers deserve the right to voluntary compliance so they can keep more of their hard-earned money.",
        "What have you learned about doing your taxes, about when it's time to call in professional help?",

        "Who knew that taxes could be so passionate, right?",
        "Let me get your view of return-free filing.",
        "Right now, as I understand it, it's being proposed as a voluntary thing, that people could choose to do it either this way or the old way, right?",
        "Right, there's a - there seems like there's a lot of misinformation floating around about this.",
        "And the statement that you read from Intuit is a perfect example of that.",

        "They mention taxpayers' right to voluntary compliance.",

        "And we look at it, we can contest it, and then if it's OK, we pay it.",
        "All the return-free filing system is suggesting is that we do the same thing on taxes.",
        "Now, it's...",
        "It would be helpful to people if the IRS simply summarized the information that they already had about the taxpayer and sent it to the taxpayer.",
        "It doesn't violate anybody's rights, it doesn't stop anybody from doing their own tax return if they want to.",
        "It's simply a way of economizing on information and giving the taxpayer essentially a running start in filling out their tax forms.",
        "OK, so let me go back to Liz Day, since Intuit was basically responding to ProPublica's reporting here.",
        "Why does Intuit or anyone else who's lobbying against return-free filing, or arguing against it, why would they do that?",
        "What's the motivation behind not offering this as an option?",
        "Well, it would - many Americans could opt to use this method and no longer use, say, TurboTax or H&R Block or, you know, the tax guy up the street.",
        "So it would take out a good chunk of business from the private sector.",
        "So you know, some advocates say that, you know, that's one reason it's being opposed.",
        "Another argument that, you know, Intuit made in that statement is that citizens who use this method could end up paying more in taxes, and that's an argument shared by Grover Norquist, who's also opposed to return-free filing, who, you know, essentially says there's a conflict of interest if the IRS is both the tax preparer and the collector and that they would err on the side of overstating how much you owe in taxes versus...",
        "Grover Norquist is, of course, the president of Americans for Tax Reform.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yes, and that, you know, Americans could end up paying more in taxes, though, you know, it's important to keep in mind this is a voluntary system.",
        "You would get the return, you would review it, you would make sure it's correct, and you know, you could also choose not to use it."

        "Well, the answer is it wouldn't - that simple.",
        "You say it would not work?",
        "It would not because the biggest thing in tax preparing is collecting information you need to supply to the IRS, and a lot of this is based on self-reporting.",
        "The IRS just doesn't know it for a self-employed person.",
        "They don't have the matching documents.",

        "I'm just pointing out it wouldn't work for this person.",
        "OK, but do you think it should be offered as an option for people?",
        "Well, I think this is a cost-benefit thing, and this has been made to sound like, I think, you know, you've heard wrong arguments by some people who exaggerate how much this would save, and you hear other wrong arguments by TurboTax or Grover Norquist that say that somehow it's an assault on personal freedom, which it isn't.",
        "Is this something, given a very pressed revenue service and one which is having a hard time doing the tasks it's supposed to do, to take on something which is really fairly complicated?",
        "Because you've got to consider the timing in which they get the information and then how long it takes them to get the information to the taxpayer.",

        "But what would the credit care system...",
        "And - but there are 50 million taxpayers who are in situations where it would work.",
        "And I don't think we should let what we can't do, which is solve the problem of all several hundred million taxpayers, get in the way of the things that that we actually can do, which is simplify and provide good government for tens of millions, probably 50 million, taxpayers who are in relatively simple situations where we could offer this service.",
