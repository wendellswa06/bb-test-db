        "Well, let me bring then to you, William Gale, the argument that that some are making which is that the current system in someway victimizes some taxpayers who end up paying for tax preparation when they don't need to.",
        "What's your response to that?",
        "I don't know of any evidence for or against that.",

        "Typically, if you - yeah.",

        "And then last year, I had H&R Block do it again, and both times, they were going to chare me over $150 for their services and actually found me a much larger return than what I had by doing it myself through the online service, and the online service costs me $15.",

        "Now, you're going to pay an alternative - another alternative 28 percent maximum rate or if you're really rich, a Buffett tax.",
        "You know, they're always layering some different new thing you have to do.",
        "New provisions and new things.",
