        "Well, you know, if you get a result back of - let's say you have a genetic marker for a disease that might put you at increased risk for a disease, but you may or may not get it, that might end up just causing a lot of anxiety.",
        "It might end up prompting you to get a lot of follow-up tests.",

        "They're very specific.",

        "But, actually, one point you just raised is actually another important issue here, is that there's only something like 3,000 genetic counselors in the entire United States.",
        "I was going to ask: Genetic counselor, what is that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So if lots and lots of people started getting their entire genetic sequences spelled out, they'd need a lot of help in interpreting and understanding that data, and we just don't have, you know, the genetic counselors available to do that.",

        "These are people who are specially trained in this field to - they understand the science.",

        "So I went through the process, and on the BRCA2 gene, there was a minor defect, and it wasn't the typical breast cancer, ovarian thing.",
        "It was a very rare defect that wasn't seen in the gene population very much, because most fetuses that had that miscarried.",
        "And so what did that tell him and you about your cancer?",
