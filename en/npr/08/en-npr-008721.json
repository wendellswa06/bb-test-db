        "So I think we view it not as something where there's a particular question, but the advantage of looking at the entire genome is that you can find out what - almost what questions should I ask.",
        "You don't have to have a specific question before looking.",
        "You can, in fact, look across the entire genome and say: Is there anything there that I ought to know about?",
        "And for full disclosure, I have been involved in my career in the industry of the companies that make equipment for DNA analysis, and so once this finally became possible in 2009, I felt I'd been waiting for 25 years to do this.",
        "It's a fantastic opportunity, and we stepped forward and had our family be sequenced.",
        "Did you get some kind of a discount?",
        "No.",
        "Actually, it was much more expensive than it is today, but I think we felt it was worthwhile, and it's been a great learning experience.",
        "We are, in fact, still learning from it.",
        "We did find some things that were immediately practically useful, however, and we've talked about some of those publicly.",
        "The - there tend to be three main categories of information that can gleaned from the genome.",
        "One would have to do with rare, purely genetic diseases, things like cystic fibrosis and whether you might be predisposed to those.",
        "The second would be to do with what are considered more complex diseases that might involve many genes, but also a lot of environmental factors, things like heart disease and cancer.",
        "And the third category has to do with drug metabolism because individuals' response to medicines tends to be different, because the genes that contribute to the metabolism of those drugs in your body can be different from person to person, and therefore the dose that's appropriate or even which drug you should take can differ from person to person based on their genetics.",
        "And that's an important area, and we actually learn some things about that from our genome that help guide us, actually, away from medicines that were proposed for various things that turned out to be inappropriate (technical difficulties).",
        "And I've read, in fact, in a story about your family that blood clots, that was one of the things that you found out about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We actually knew about the blood clots beforehand.",
        "We viewed it as just one example.",
        "I actually originally found out about the blood clotting well before we had our genomes sequenced.",
        "But it was based on having a medical event due to the blood clots, which I felt like if I had been able to have my genome sequenced prior to that time, you know, I didn't necessarily know there was any reason to think about blood clots.",
        "But if I'd seen the data in my genome before that actually happened, I would have probably been able to take actions that might well have avoided that.",
        "Blood clotting is something that's affected by a lot of environmental factors, including specifically the foods that you eat.",
        "So, for example, foods which are very high in Vitamin K, things like spinach or miso soup, tend to be things that if the amount of those foods that you eat goes up and down from day to day, then you can be changing your blood clotting level quite substantially, and you have to be careful about that.",
        "So if I had just known that ahead of time, I probably wouldn't have had to have a blood clot.",
        "But my - part of (technical difficulties) was not so much about the blood clotting itself, but whether there were other things where we also didn't know about it because we'd never been able to look.",
        "So now that we were able to look at the entire genome, it gave us that view to see: Are there other things, essentially, that we just haven't run into yet?",
        "And I'd say most of it was, in fact, very reassuring."

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that's the big question is, you know, as this starts to become more common, you know, it's going to - even at a cheaper price, it's going to start to add up, and the question is: Is it going to end up doing more benefits than harms?",
