        "So when I heard this news, my first thought is, well, of course.",
        "Given the bizarre way that the Cavaliers lost the NBA finals, maybe LeBron just said, enough of Cleveland, enough of these teammates.",
        "(Laughter) Yeah.",
        "Losing 4-0 to Golden State was not a pretty thing, obviously.",
        "But, you know, Steve, the Lakers aren't the place to go to challenge Golden State right away because the Lakers, they have a young roster and no other major stars at this point.",
        "But, you know, this appears to be a move for basketball and for life.",
        "And in that sense, this makes sense.",
        "James knows the Lakers are going to try to build a powerful team around him in the next couple of years.",
        "Plus, he has two homes in LA.",
        "He has serious business and entertainment ambitions for the future, and LA's a pretty good place to be if you want all that to flourish.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, now, this is not something that James has not done before.",
        "He left Cleveland once before and made people very angry when he went down to Miami.",
        "How are people responding this time around?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "Of course, the decision - a bungled reality TV moment.",
        "It was met with widespread anger, as you say - jersey burning in Cleveland.",
        "Fans really felt betrayed.",
        "This time, he did it the right way.",
        "On Instagram, he thanked the people of northeast Ohio, quote, \"\"for an incredible four seasons,\"\" saying this will always be home.",
        "And for Cavs fans, the four years after he returned to Cleveland from Miami were incredible - four-straight NBA Finals and the team's first-ever title in 2016.",
        "So to answer your question, because of that, the early reports out of northeast Ohio are that people are responding much more charitably.",
        "They are sad but thankful LeBron James delivered on his promise of bringing the city a championship.",
        "And that includes Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, who put out a nasty statement when James left Cleveland the first time.",
        "This time, he thanked James for giving Cleveland its, quote, \"\"precious moment.",
        "Although Cleveland still has to do without LeBron.",

        "You're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, the tragic thing here - and this is the crisis that we find ourselves in in St. Louis - is that communities need police; especially communities with high crime, like many of our communities do have it in St. Louis.",
        "We need police.",
        "And an order for police to be effective they need the trust of the community.",
        "And so what I feel like is we have not acted quick enough.",
        "That in fact we had an opportunity over this fall and winter to do a lot of this hard work before we get into what is traditionally the high crime times of spring and summer.",
        "And it's been warm here for a couple of days and we've already seen a very high spike in crime, including the tragic death of a 5-year-old boy.",
        "So we've got a lot of work to do and we need to get to the business of doing it very quickly.",
        "How has the protest movement changed - maybe in terms of what its objectives are - and are there different factions now?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Nationally, and even locally, we sometimes just put everybody in the same group as just protesters, but there are a lot of different people out there for a lot of different reasons.",
        "And the vast majority of folks have been peaceful.",
        "We did see back in August and in November, and then again this week, some people engage in violence.",

        "There are a lot of struggles.",
        "And we've decided to stick it out and try to improve our community.",

        "He is, as we see, our timeline of when we really need to see real progress.",
