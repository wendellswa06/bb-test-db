        "That is a tad unrealistic.",
        "LeBron James is one of the greats, but as we found out last month against Golden State, he can't win a title by himself.",
        "The interesting part, Steve - this contract is a long one by today's superstar standards.",
        "It's a four-year contract, meaning he's giving the Lakers time to build around him, if not for this upcoming season then surely the season after, when a bunch of great players will be free agents and available to team up with James in LA.",
        "And I'm sure they'll be eager to do so."
