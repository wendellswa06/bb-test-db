        "Hmm.",
        "There was a backlash to this in 1946, 1947 in Britain.",
        "Well, it was very interesting to listen to that, because when she talked about picking locks and that sort of thing, it sounded like the description of a drug addict's behavior.",
        "And I think when you are a compulsive overeater, as I was for much of my life, it does feel somewhat like you're battling a drug addiction.",
        "You don't always feel like you're in full control.",
        "You're just so tempted and seduced by the substance, that even as it's making you miserable in various ways - including, in my case, going up at one point to a 42-inch waistline - you seem powerless to resist it.",

        "Yeah, and I don't mean to make light of that term.",
        "But when I was very young, for about a year, my mother said whenever she would deny me something, particularly food, I would get so upset I would throw up.",
        "And I relate that story in the book in a somewhat humorous way as a bit of foreshadowing, because much later in life, in college, I actually spent a period throwing up my meals by design as a way of keeping weight off and being able to eat more.",
        "I mean, my whole story as rendered in the book is about trying for way too long to find cheats and easy fixes and magic bullets for keeping weight off.",
        "And what I learned in the end and what enabled me to commit to a life of professional eating and not get heavy again was that the only thing that works is discipline, moderation, good rhythm, you know, a kind of common sense approach to food.",
        "But it took you a long time to get there.",
        "I wonder what was the thing that finally tipped you over and made you think that whatever it may be, I have to find some livable solution.",

        "It was just taking - you know, it was one of those moments where I realized, well, I'm losing out on an enormous amount of my life by being in prison like this.",

        "And that adjusts your thinking in a very key way.",
        "And that kind of was the discovery that you made, that you could do that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think it was keeping that weight off in Italy, learning to eat in a joyous but not compulsive way that convinced me I'd solved a lot of my problem and could actually take a job like restaurant critic and be healthy and steady in my eating in it.",

        "I mean, as a compulsive overeater, how did you develop taste buds and the traits to become a good food critic?",
        "You know, I was very curious about that, as well, because unlike a person who compulsively overeats wonderful food, of the sort of food that your grandmother served you, you would eat anything, everything.",
        "I would.",
        "But the key thing that you just mentioned was there was a lot of wonderful food in the mix.",
        "I mean, given my druthers, I would overeat wonderful food over bad food.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I just had periods where I was not sufficiently discriminating.",
        "But no, I mean, part of my obsession with and just love of eating extended to great restaurants whenever I would travel, and I was fortunate enough to do a lot of it.",
        "I would immediately hunt out the good food.",
        "And so by the time I was asked to be restaurant critic, I had a pretty broad frame of culinary reference.",
        "And part of that was traveling for the New York Times.",
        "Before Frank Bruni was the restaurant critic for The New York Times, he was a reporter and covered - well, I was fascinated to think that you were hunting for the very best restaurants - and what city was it in Turkey that you mention in the book?",

        "I would be looking for the best hummus and the best shawarma whenever I was in the Middle East.",
        "You know, never mind if I were there for bombings, I had falafel in mind, you know.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But the other thing, of course, is that you would - what you had not yet learned was how not to eat all of it.",
        "You know, that is a lifelong education.",
        "I wish I had figured out some of the things I figured out late a lot earlier because I think I could have reclaimed some years of my life that were very sad.",
        "But I did eventually realize that if I stopped a kind of embrace-avoid approach to food, if I stopped a binge-purge mechanism and just accepted food into my life in a very steady way, it wouldn't undo me the way it had in the past.",
        "Mike, thanks very much for calling.",
        "We have also got a call - here's somebody who I guess is a sort of a soulmate of sorts, Ruth in Tempe, Arizona.",
        "Ruth, you had a similar experience to Frank Bruni's?",
        "Yeah, very similar.",
        "I have struggled with food my entire life.",
        "It's very much - I just wanted to echo, it's very much an addiction and an addictive problem, that it's - you know, I don't want to belittle people who - or you know, the struggle that people who struggle with alcohol and drugs go through, but of course you can't give up food.",
        "So that makes it much more difficult, in a way.",
        "You know, Ruth makes a great point.",
        "One of the - when I was getting some early reaction to the book, one of the quotes I got in that I use on the back cover, it was from Augusten Burroughs, and he made the very good point that this is a kind of addiction like no other because what you tell an alcoholic or what you tell a cocaine addict is don't ever go near that again.",
        "You can't say that to the compulsive eater because food is the very source of our survival, and that lends this particular battle, I think, a kind of nuance and subtlety that is its own - that are its own challenge, you know.",
        "But now, Ruth, you said that you were a - you traveled to France, or you moved to France, and that helped you?",
        "Yeah, I lived in France for a year, and I worked as a nanny, and I was in charge of all the cooking, and it changed my entire life, and it also - I mean, the French are obsessed with food.",
        "They just absolutely love it, and it gave me a way of incorporating food into my life."

        "So I just - I also wanted to say that it's kind of amazing to hear your story and then also to hear people call in, because when my mother - when I was little and my mother went to the doctor and she was just completely at a loss as to what to do…",

        "At age six it was homemade chocolate sauce, and then there's this loving, loving description of what homemade chocolate sauce made by your mother is; and at age seven you found quiche, and that - you didn't particularly like the pastry, but you liked everything else about it.",
