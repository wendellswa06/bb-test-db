        "Age eight, lamb chops - musky, gamey lamb chops.",
        "Mom served them to us for dinner at the table in the Soundview kitchen about once every three weeks.",
        "I ate not just the meat but also the marrow inside the sectioned bone in some chops and, best of all, the curls and strips of fat at the edges of the meat.",
        "My brothers Mark and Harry winced when I did that and merely picked at their own chops, wishing aloud that it were steak night or hamburger night or pork-chop night.",
        "We were a meaty family, the chops, strips, patties and roasts filling a separate freezer in the garage.",
        "Wherever we lived, we had a separate freezer in the garage.",
        "Mom was puzzled by and censorious of families who didn't.",
        "How could they be sure to have enough kinds and cuts of meat on hand, enough varieties of ice cream to choose from?",
        "Was that really any way to live?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Now, the idea of you at the age of eight crunching on lamb bones, did your family ever feel - I mean, did your mother ever look at you and think this could get to be a problem?",
        "She absolutely did, and that's why - and she was a loving, loving mother who wanted to figure out a way to help me because she could see that it was exacting a cost.",
        "People would - my friends, even at the age of seven and eight, would tease that my initials, FB, must stand for fat boy.",
        "Wow.",
        "And so what she did in trying to find some way to help me lose weight while not, you know, while kind of working with this enormous appetite was she put me on the Atkins diet right when it came out.",
        "So I was probably one of the earliest adherents of no-carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate eating.",
        "Now, your mother's - but I suppose it's also probably fair to say that your mother's interest in diets and in sort of ways of fad diets and diet books and so forth was - sort of fed your own concern with finding a shortcut to not being fat.",
        "You know, the example I saw from her, and I don't think it was something she was doing deliberately, but it's maybe something for all of us to think, you know, keep in mind as we deal with children, but you know, I watched her do a diet that involved air-popped popcorn.",
        "You know, I watched her do the grapefruit diet.",
        "I watched her do - I mean all of those things, and the thinking behind those diets was that there was some holy grail of weight loss.",
        "I've come to the conclusion, after a roller-coaster life that finally has ended in a happy and trim place, that there is no one holy grail of weight loss.",
        "It's about a steady monitoring of your portions and a commitment to exercise.",
        "It's that old energy-in, energy-out calorie counting."

        "I do.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "I have had an eating disorder for 20 years, and I found that and was told that if I stayed away from certain foods, trigger foods, that binge-purge process would be easier for me.",
        "I was wondering if you still have trigger foods that you still can't eat to this day that put you into that binge-purge, compulsive attitude.",
        "I have foods that I don't know that I'd say they put me into a binge-purge cycle again, but I have foods that, for whatever reason, I have no restraint around.",
        "You will never, ever open my cupboard and find peanut butter in there.",
        "Oh, now, let me interrupt you and ask you read to us from Page 111, the Kryptonite section.",
        "Well, this is when I discovered cold noodles in sesame paste, which you find in most Chinese takeout and delivery places in New York, and as I say here, the dish looked like spaghetti sauced with peanut butter.",
        "It tasted like that too, and if chemists had gone into a laboratory to hatch a calorie-ridden Kryptonite just for me, this is precisely what they would have come up with, a sort of pasta, my vulnerability to which was encoded in my genes, smothered with an analog to peanut butter, my vulnerability to which was documented by a trail of empty jars in the cupboards and waste bins of my childhood.",
        "So that - I would think of all of the things that I read about in your book that your ate, and they were considerable…",
        "There's a lot of eating in the book, isn't there?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "There is.",
        "That was one of the things that got you.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "You know, but I think we all have - those of us are food lovers and those of us who are vulnerable to consumption and excess, we all have certain things that are more difficult to control than others, and so to get back to the caller's question, I do think it's really important to know where your vulnerabilities are and to try to construct an eating life and a life that keeps you away from those places and those triggers and those pitfalls."

        "Rebecca?",
        "Hello, thank you for taking my call.",
        "Yes, well, first of all, I just think it's amazing to hear about your book, Mr. Bruni.",
        "I'm really a big fan, but one of the things that I think is really interesting that you've talked about is how your experience in Italy changed your relationship with food.",
        "And I come from a large Italian-American family.",
        "There are pictures of me still in my diapers, standing on kitchen chairs in the kitchen with my grandmother, helping her to make spaghetti sauce.",
        "And I very much come from a background of food lovers, and I've found, since I've been married to a wonderful man of German descent, not to position the Germans against the Italians in their approach to food, but I find that his relationship with food is completely different than mine.",
        "I am a, you know, I come from a background where, you know, dinner can take four hours, and it's, you know, very, you know, much prepared with love, and I'm a huge foodie myself.",
        "I'm a devout baker of artisan breads and love food.",
        "This time of the year it's like crack going to the farmer's markets and seeing all these amazing new vegetables that are coming in in the harvest season.",
        "My husband is very much a utilitarian food person, like…",
        "Open a can of tuna fish, and that'll do it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Well…",
        "So I just think that - yeah, exactly, that sort of relationship where I think that if you're a food lover, I mean, I wouldn't say that I've ever struggled with my weight.",
        "My husband, on the other hand, has definitely struggled with his weight, and having been married for a little over a year now, and having dated for eight years, that's one of the big things that I see as a difference in terms of why maybe I haven't struggled with my weight and why I think he has, is that he can just go to, like, the fast-food place and get the hamburger, and that's satisfying to him because at a point he gets full, whereas myself, I couldn't imagine doing that.",
        "If I'm going to invest 800 calories, I want it to be in something delicious, so…",
        "Well, you sound like a much more conscious and aware eater, and that can also mean, you know, a much healthier eater, you know, because you're actually thinking hard about what you're eating.",
        "And I think part of what I learned and what I describe in the book is that if you do - an earlier caller talked about channeling your obsession.",
        "If you do channel your obsession the way that you have, into the quality of what you're eating, the variety of what you're eating, it can be extremely healthy, and a love of food does not have to land you in a bad place at all."

        "I knew quite well the heavy workouts that we used to get on the swim team, and I'm curious to know about how much did you use athleticism and working out to counterbalance your addiction and need for food, because I certainly remember finishing those morning and afternoon practices, two-a-days, just totally exhausted.",
        "So I'm just very curious about how athleticism and working out has worked its way into your relationship with food.",

        "Getting up at 4:00 in the morning, I might add.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I mean that essentially kind of - that got rid of the problem for me for a while.",
        "I mean, I was a heedless and reckless eater, but there was so much exercise going on, an amount that could never be sustained later in life, that I didn't have to deal with my consumption problems or work on my willpower.",
        "This was Loomis High School, is that right?",
        "It was a school called Loomis Chaffee in Windsor, Connecticut.",
        "And one of the reasons, I think, my period of bulimia came right when I went to college is because I gave up swimming, and I was very conscious of the fact that now I had to find some other solution to this big appetite because the one thing I never, ever, you know, buckled down and did was dealt with the appetite itself.",
        "I was always looking for, you know, something that would solve it for me, be it Atkins, be it four hours a day of swimming or be it throwing out meals.",

        "Yeah.",
        "No, exercise has really saved me.",
        "And I came to the conclusion about, you know, seven years ago - which is when I finally got myself on the straight and narrow-ish - that I could only restrain my eating so much during the day.",
