        "One is to protect employers' profits by reducing claims and put money back in the pockets of the insurance companies and employers.",

        "Blank says the Social Security numbers might be used for identity theft, credit fraud, avoiding liens or hiding assets.",
        "And the law requires employers, insurance companies and his agency to respond.",

        "There's quite a lot of other circumstances why people use fake names and IDs and Social Security numbers.",
        "It's not always an immigration issue.",
        "But it mostly is by far.",
        "State records analyzed by NPR and ProPublica show nearly 800 cases investigated under this law.",
        "Almost all involve undocumented immigrants with Hispanic surnames.",
        "Only six cases do not - just six.",

        "Undocumented workers need Social Security numbers to get jobs, so Carter wonders why some employers don't thoroughly check those numbers before workers' comp claims are filed.",
