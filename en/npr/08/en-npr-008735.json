        "The people will learn, yes, fraud has taken place.",
        "It has been corrected, and I think that the turnout will be - the turnout of the people was lower mainly because of the lack of faith of the process.",
        "If indeed the election commissions and complaints commissions together do declare the need for a runoff, does that put you in a much better position to form some sort of unity government?",
        "Yes, I think in a situation where Mr. Karzai would have been announced a winner, that would have meant much more than winning one person.",
        "That would have meant that fraud will be ignored.",
        "But in a situation that fraud will be hardly taken care of, then that, I think, creates new realities on the ground.",
        "And one of those new realities is that, in your opinion, that the process worked, to a degree.",
        "That is, fraud was attended to.",

        "If, in fact, you believe that the government, the Karzai government is sincere in tackling these very big problems that have - it has not tackled in the past five years, would there be role in particular that would allow you to have a powerful hand tackling corruption, tackling inefficiency and actually making things work for Afghans?",

        "The specifics of it will depend on the military assessments of the generals on the ground, but I can say that a critical partner, which can reach out to some people, a surge in the number of forces at this stage will enable Afghanistan and the international community to create a situation where the trend, which is a deteriorating one in terms of security and stability, would be stopped.",
