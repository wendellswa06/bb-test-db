        "We're back with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.",
        "I'm Guy Raz.",
        "It's been 40 years since the invention of what we now know as the Internet.",
        "And over the last few weeks, we've been exploring the people and ideas behind the network.",
        "It's our series The Net at 40.",
        "Now, when you type a Web address, say, my personal favorite npr.org, you should thank a man named Paul Mockapetris for making it all so easy.",
        "Dr. Mockapetris developed a system that associates a string of numbers with a name.",
        "For instance, the IP address of npr.org is this: 216.35.221.77.",
        "You can type either one into your Internet browser and get NPR's Web site, but it's much easier to remember npr.org.",
        "It's called DNS � the domain name system � and Dr. Mockapetris joins me from Paris.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Dr.",
        "Mockapetris, how did you come up with this idea?",
        "I mean, were you asked to do it?",
        "I was actually given the job of taking five different proposals and harmonizing them together.",
        "And nobody noticed that I did something completely different.",
        "When was this?",
        "The system was first used in 1983 and I think was in production use in about 1986 or so.",
        "In the early days, we have a lot of freedom to experiment with it.",
        "So, the system was recognizable as we know it in '83.",
        "And before that, you had worked on something called the ARPANET, which we've talked about on this program, this sort of computer-to-computer network -the first computer-to-computer network that was created at the Pentagon in the late '60s."

        "You know, I tend to think of that as sort of the dinosaur age.",
        "And 1983 was the year that we had a big change-over to IP, TCP, and DNS and all of these new protocols.",
        "It was sort of the start of mammals on the Internet.",
        "It was a very heady time because people basically took the experience they had of the ARPANET and just completely redid everything with a clean sheet of paper.",
        "So, until that point, if you wanted to communicate with another computer, you had to be part of the same network.",
        "It was almost as if, if you spoke English, you could only speak to other English speakers.",
        "The Internet enabled people who spoke several different languages to communicate.",
        "Or another way to think about it is is that it might be the difference between different airlines and buses and boats and so forth.",
        "With the Internet, you can get up, take the first part of your communication over a wireless network, like the bus, and then you can go to an airport and get on a long-haul network and then get off and take a train at the other end.",
        "The whole idea is is it made all of these different ways of transporting data work just as we would expect you to be able to take a trip on a conventional transport system.",
        "And because of those changes, you had to come up with this domain name system, right?",
        "Well, everybody that wants to play on the networker, whether it's to have an email address or to connect to computer, needs a name for that.",
        "And I foresaw at the time that there might be 50 million of those one day.",
        "And so we designed to meet that goal, or at least that's the goal that I had in mind when I did it.",
        "Now, today, things have grown to probably several billion different names.",
        "'Cause, remember, it's not just machines; it's also individual email addresses or any of the identifiers.",
        "So, will we reach a point when it's saturated, when the system that you created can no longer handle the amount of names?",
        "Well, if you think of it as sort of geography, there's only so much beachfront land that you can find but there is an awful lot of addresses still.",
        "And the same thing is true with domain names.",
        "Some people argue that the ones that they really want are already taken.",
        "But if you're willing to settle for a second or third choice, there's probably more domain names than there are people on Earth, phone numbers, automobiles and pets put together.",
        "Do you remember the first domain name that you made?",
        "Well, I was doing the work at ISI, so I'm sure it was isi.edu.",
        "That was part of the University of Southern California."

        "Yeah, it's pretty good.",
        "I mean, it certainly - it's not a surprise, because we know Apple is able to sort of create this buzz around new products and, you know, in a crazy way, get people to buy products that they haven't even seen or haven't even had a chance to touch.",
        "No other company in the technology business, really, can do that.",
        "But I - when I heard the number today, I wasn't really surprised, because people seemed extremely enthusiastic about it beforehand.",
        "Well, let's see if some of those enthusiasts are on the line.",

        "It - I picked it up first thing Saturday morning, and it's been hard for me to even put it down, to be completely honest.",
        "What do you most like about it?",
        "I would say the ease of use, its size, and it basically means I don't have to travel with my laptop for work anymore.",
        "This has really made - it's going to make things a lot easier for me, kind of in that regard.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "Farhad was saying in his review that if you had to write a long report or something like that - it's fine to respond to email and that sort of thing, but that virtual keyboard is kind of a problem if you need to type a lot.",
        "Sure, I can understand that.",
        "But, you know, for, you know, for someone in my position, it's going to work great because, you know, I don't really write a lot of reports on the road, I just need being in touch with clients and coworkers and that sort of thing.",
        "And, you know, the long battery life, it's really something else.",
        "I mean, I've charged it once, and its far exceeded my expectations as far as the battery goes.",
        "So it now means I can watch an entire movie on an airplane while travelling or, you know, use the apps without having to worry about the battery going dead on a flight, which is really nice.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Farhad, the complaints - this is the first device that Apple has made where I'm not hearing a complaint about the battery.",
        "It's true.",
        "The battery life, you know, for most gadgets, the company has advertised the battery life and it's extremely - it's pretty much unlikely, you'll never get that advertised battery life.",
        "But for the iPad, everyone I've heard has said that, you know, it exceeds the advertised battery life of 10 hours.",
        "So - and I think I found that, too.",
        "I haven't had to charge it at all since I got it on Saturday.",
        "So I think, you know, this is one area where everyone is surprised.",
        "One thing I will add is, you know, I put this in the hands of my four-year-old niece yesterday and just gave her a little bit of guidance.",
        "And within probably half an hour, she was navigating it by herself.",
        "We downloaded the Labyrinth game.",
        "And she was playing it all by herself, and she would - could hardly put it down.",
        "So, you know, it's - you can see where the ease of use of the iPad is really going to be a selling point for a lot of younger users, as well as a lot of probably older users that don't need the functions of a complete computer.",
        "Chris, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate the review."
