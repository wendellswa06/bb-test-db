        "Yes, yes.",
        "Bye-bye.",
        "You said the ease of use, you agreed with that, Farhad, and indeed, that - even if you've never used an iPhone, it's quite similar to that, you'd figure it out in 30 seconds.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think this is the one of the major breakthroughs.",
        "Apple has managed to create kind of a fully functional computer here that is extremely easy to pick up.",
        "I mean, all of the kind of frustrations that we're used to with our computers, with our desktop and laptop computers, things like knowing where a file is or having to back up, back it up, all your data, having to save files and worrying about viruses and things like that, none of that, you know, is a worry on the iPad.",
        "And, you know, this could be, I think, kind of a metaphor or a way for us to have easier computers, even desktop computers, they might work in this, you know, easy-to-use way.",

        "It's really just a large iPhone, so it still suffers in the same limitations.",
        "You know, it doesn't support Flash, and the majority of the Web sites and videos that you find online are Flash-based.",
        "And it's not going to replace a laptop or a Web browser or anything like that."

        "It is.",
        "Now, there is a special function just for YouTube where you can you watch YouTube videos.",
        "But almost any other site that you go to that has Flash, you get a little blue box.",
        "And, you know, a lot of sites that are (unintelligible) just do not look very good on an iPad.",
        "Farhad, this has been one of the criticisms - not just Jim is complaining about his.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And in my browsing of the Web, I noticed, you know, I did notice that there were some sites that, you know, you couldn't use all of their functions because it doesn't run Flash.",
        "But there are number of sites that have already kind of accommodated this.",
        "The New York Times' video kind of all works on the iPad and various other sites have released, you know, iPad-only applications.",
        "So, for example, I was able to watch streaming movies from Netflix on the device, even though it - that kind of thing won't work on the iPhone or other, you know, other appliance-type machines like this.",
        "So I...",
        "Yeah but...",
        "...you know, I think that it's a worry right now and - but I imagine that over time, we'll get more and more Web sites that will be able to work on the iPad.",

        "You know, I have another criticism, if I could.",
        "The actual shape of the iPad, the back has a very slight curve to it.",

        "And, you know, if they included rubber feet or something, that'd be fine, but of course that's not as cool as the slick device that they came up with, so...",
        "I noticed that, too, and the way I solved that was using the - a case for it that Apple sells separately for $40, which I thought made it much more usable and easier to handle.",
        "And presumably, somebody else will manufacture something quite similar for less than $40 quite soon.",
        "Yes.",

        "Yep, it works with that.",
