        "I, you know, I dont disagree.",
        "I think that's true, and we saw that with the iPhone, too.",
        "I mean, it was released for sort of specific tasks, but they have, you know, an app store available for both devices.",
        "And that gives these devices all kinds of new functions and kind of lets them do things that none of us have imagined yet.",
        "So I imagine that'll be true.",

        "I don't know if it's the last Steve Jobs' product.",
        "But I will say -I do think that it's going to change the tablet PC market.",
        "I mean, we're already seeing it happening.",
        "A lot of other manufacturers have announced plans to release devices like this.",
        "And if this device is popular, which it seems like it's going to be.",
        "I mean, there's obviously a market here and other companies are going to rush in, you know, which has happened with phones.",
        "After Apple released the iPhone, weve seen a number of smart phones, touch screen smart phones and also happened with the iPod.",
        "So that's kind of the general trend.",
        "There are some online reviewers who have been less than enthusiastic.",
        "The - quote one, this is the Old Choir Seecha(ph) - I hope I'm not mispronouncing that too bad - who said the iPad actively resist the urges of people to make things.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that criticism is, I suppose, based on this fact that there's not a great keyboard in it and the device is meant mostly for kind of watching things or reading things.",
        "I think it's valid up to a point, although as your caller mentioned, some people will imagine great uses for it.",
        "And there are forms of creativity on here that are available that you can't really - that aren't easy to do on your desktop computer, like there's a painting application where you can paint with your fingers.",
        "And an artist has actually used that application to create cover - paintings that ended up as the cover image for The New Yorker magazine.",
        "So people can do great things on this.",
        "So I disagree that it sort of actively resists the urges of creative people.",

        "Hi, guys.",
        "I'm a teacher and - elementary school, specifically.",
        "And I bought an iPad on the day it came out.",
        "And the first thing that comes to my mind is how much this is going to be used - how well this can be used in the classroom, especially for elementary school kids.",
        "Because, you know, in high school, in the middle school, laptops are very prevalent.",
        "But in elementary school, they really need a focus on manipulatives."

        "And just think about how textbooks can be used and be read on an iPad and how well they can be updated instead of having to buy an $80 textbook every time you need to update a textbook, you can actually just download a new version of the textbook onto the iPad.",
        "And I think that this can be a great tool for teachers, not just in elementary school classrooms, but primarily because of the fact that kids need that hands-on interactivity.",
        "At 500 bucks a pop, though, at minimum, that's going to be an expensive tool.",
        "Of course.",
        "So, you know, youre looking for a school - a classroom that has a lot of funds available.",
        "But in the same perspective, like, if they were to be able to get this out for classrooms, it could just revolutionize classrooms in general.",
        "And Rachel, did you have to wait on line for yours?",

        "And I can't explain why we live this way.",
        "We do it every day.",
        "His songs are soft, too, mostly delicate '70s folk tunes with sensitive, earnest lyrics.",
        "But Dennen's soulful vocal delivery and some sly, understated funky grooves keep the whole thing from turning into Dan Fogelberg or Bread.",
        "Here's Brett with just bass and drums at a recent session we recorded at NPR West's studios."
