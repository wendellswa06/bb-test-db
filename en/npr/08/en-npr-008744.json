        "He says as GM, Ford, and Chrysler face the brink of collapse, union leaders have decided on three main concessions.",
        "One, UAW bargaining teams will meet with representatives from the carmakers to discuss changes to the current contract.",
        "Two, the union will allow the companies to delay their payments to the new health care trust fund.",
        "And three, the union will eliminate a controversial program known as the jobs bank.",
        "During hearings two weeks ago on Capitol Hill, lawmakers blasted the idea of a jobs bank where workers are paid to do basically nothing.",
        "Gettelfinger says the issue got in the way of carmakers' efforts to receive government loans.",
        "It's a lightning rod.",
        "It's a soundbite.",
        "But it takes away the focus of what the real issue is here.",
        "And the real issue is the backbone of America, an industry that does more for the economy than any other industry and quite frankly made the middle class what it is today.",
        "Many union members would argue that the UAW was only able to do that by fighting and even shedding its workers blood over decades to try to win good wages and benefits.",
        "Gettelfinger says today's UAW hasn't gotten credit for just how much it's given back to help the three Detroit car companies.",
        "The word \"\"concessions,\"\" I used to cringe at that word.",
        "But now why hide from it?",
        "That's what we did.",
        "But the concessions approved in recent contracts with the carmakers did not come easy.",
        "The UAW is a democratically run organization, so any changes to the contracts have to be approved by a majority of the unions' membership.",
        "And while union leaders say more concessions are called for, not everyone in the union is sold on the idea.",
        "If the UAW makes further concessions, it may momentarily resolve the issue.",

        "Frank Hammer is a retired GM worker.",
        "He says further concessions will hurt autoworkers, and the pain will trickle through the economy.",
        "And even UAW President Ron Gettelfinger seems to acknowledge that the concessions are more about pleasing members of Congress who are unsure about supporting the auto industry than they are about actually helping the car companies.",
        "Gettelfinger says he believes that the UAW contracts approved last year already make the Detroit car companies competitive with Toyota and Honda when it comes to labor costs.",
        "To be honest with you, right now if a UAW membership went into these facilities and worked for nothing, according to our research department, it would not help the companies that much.",
        "Unless California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger intervenes, Stanley \"\"Tookie\"\" Williams will be executed on December 13th.",
        "Williams is the co-founder of the Crips street gang.",
        "Twenty-five years ago, he was convicted of four murders in Los Angeles and sentenced to die.",
        "But in San Quentin Prison, he spoke out against gangs, wrote prize-winning children's books, and was nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize.",
        "Commentary Earl Ofari Hutchinson says these are only a few reasons why Williams' sentence should be commuted.",
        "Stanley \"\"Tookie\"\" Williams has languished on death row for nearly a quarter of a century.",
        "He contends that he got a bad shake.",
        "A mostly white jury convicted him, he had a sub-par legal defense, the case against him was based largely on testimony from jailhouse informants.",
        "This is why Williams has adamantly refused to apologize or express remorse for the slayings.",
        "He says he didn't do it.",
        "His lawyers claim that police investigators either botched or deliberately tampered with ballistics and crime scene evidence.",

        "California's one of 14 states where governors have sole authority to commute a condemned killer's sentence, but that would buck precedent.",
        "In the nearly four decades since Ronald Reagan granted clemency to a brain-damaged death row inmate, no California governor has waived the death sentence.",
        "And Reagan took action only because the latest scientific test to determine brain damage was not available at the time of the condemned killer's trial.",

        "Schwarzenegger, unlike former Governor Gray Davis, has also shown flexibility when it comes to prisoner issues.",
        "He has approved paroles for convicted murderers who had shown by word and deed that hard work and a clean record count.",
        "Playing hardball now with prisoners who have turned their lives around would be a bad public policy shift.",
        "Further, clemency is not the same as freedom.",
        "Williams will likely spend the rest of his days in prison.",
        "That effectively eliminates the remote possibility that he could ever pose a threat to anyone on the streets.",
        "The Williams case is unique.",
        "If Schwarzenegger grants him clemency, it won't set a frightening precedent that other condemned killers will cavalierly be let off the hook.",
        "It will simply be recognition that a prisoner who has shown that he can be a model and productive citizen will not be denied a second chance to do even more good for society.",

        "Michael Reed, do you believe that to be the case?",
        "I think that you have to look at the current environment in the larger context of the economy in general.",
        "I don't think you can simply look at the bankruptcy system and say that the bankruptcy system is the reason why these things are happening.",
        "The bankruptcy system really is the court of last resort for American business.",
        "But the bankruptcy court is where America's economic problems end up when other forces in the economy, such as the price of oil, 9/11--factors over which businesses have no control--bring about financial failure."
