        "neighborhood dominated by a street gang called White Fence, Boxer's target was David Gallegos, a renegade Mexican Mafia member who was not kicking back money or drugs to his mafia brothers.",
        "Boxer allegedly put five bullets in Gallegos' head, execution style.",
        "Enriquez was finally arrested.",
        "Prosecutors wanted the death penalty but they settled on two life sentences after Enriquez agreed to plead guilty.",
        "In 1993, the state sent him to Pelican Bay State Prison on California's remote north coast.",
        "Because he was a member of a prison gang, Enriquez was locked in a windowless isolation cell in the Security Housing Unit, or SHU.",
        "There, inmates spend 24 hours a day alone without seeing the outside world, except on television.",
        "I just want to write and tell you about Pelican Bay.",
        "Kaiser Permanente delivers some of the highest-quality mental health care in California and in the country.",
        "That said, we absolutely want to get better, and, really, the only way we can do that is by working together.",
        "So we need our therapists and psychologists and others to be working with us and constructively on how to get better and not walking away from patients and being gone for seven days.",
        "But it's not just the union saying there's a problem at Kaiser.",
        "In 2013, the state of California fined Kaiser $4 million, finding that some of these problems - like the long wait times and discouraging people from seeking costly individual therapy - violated federal and state laws about mental health care.",
        "April Dembosky, of member station KQED, has been following the story.",
        "She says even though Kaiser paid the fine last September, the union is still not happy.",
        "What the union is pointing out is - they're arguing that Kaiser has simply shifted resources.",
        "So that fine was directed mainly at initial visits.",
        "So people who called in for the first time saying they wanted to get an appointment, arguing that they had to wait an unreasonably long period of time.",
        "And so what the union is saying is, well, now you can call and you'll get that initial appointment in a reasonable period of time, but good luck with a follow-up appointment.",
        "They're saying people are still being made to wait two, four, six weeks.",
        "Kaiser, again, disagree with this characterization.",
        "You know, April, it feels like, gosh, you know, for decades we've been having this debate in America about needing to provide more mental health care services to people and people to provide them quickly.",
        "How do you see what's happening here with Kaiser fitting into that debate?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "I think what might be happening here is a result of some of those former advocacy campaigns that are aimed at reducing stigma around mental health services.",
        "So in the past, the fear was that people who had problems weren't coming forward because they didn't want to admit that they had a problem because they were afraid of being judged for having a problem.",
        "And so one theory is that some of that work around stigma has really worked, and people are coming forward.",
        "And so, in my reporting I'm seeing this come up in several other venues, not just at Kaiser.",
        "The University of California system is undergoing a review of its mental health services right now.",
        "They've been finding that students who come in at the beginning of the semester asking for help with some depression and anxiety can't get seen until finals time, you know, when they're at a crisis.",
        "So this is something that is impacting not just Kaiser.",
        "It's certainly an issue that's coming up in other health care systems.",
        "And one other theory is that we're seeing a shortage of mental health professionals, that there aren't enough professionals being graduated from schools, not enough people completing the long licensing process that are needed to meet this demand."

        "But the Supreme Court saw it differently.",
        "Instead of seeing Aereo as a company that supplied remote DVRs, it saw the company more like cable TV, which must pay a licensing fee to broadcasters, like ABC and CBS, to rebroadcast their programming over the cable line.",
