        "The Branch Davidians are making a comeback.",
        "The sect became infamous in 1993 when federal agents raided their compound to try to arrest David Koresh and some of his followers on gun charges.",
        "What ensued was a 51-day siege that ended with the deaths of more than 80 members of the sect and four federal agents, and also left the Branch Davidian compound in flames.",
        "As NPR's Dina Temple Raston reports, the group has resurrected itself from the ashes of the siege with a new leader and new confrontations.",
        "No signs mark the way to the Branch Davidian community on Mount Carmel but tourists find it anyway.",
        "The home of the Branch Davidians sits just 10 miles outside of Waco in central Texas - off Farm Road 2491 and Double EE Ranch.",
        "Charles Pace is the new leader of the group, and he watches tourists walk around the ruins.",
        "I believe that the Holy Spirit leads them here.",
        "They come here to learn something and they will take whatever they came to learn - take it with them.",
        "But they are coming to find out what in the world did happen here.",
        "I want to know.",
        "I want to know if this was really true - and if it was true, why did this happen?",
        "And that gives me a chance to explain it to them.",
        "This was a judgment of God.",
        "A harsh judgment indeed.",
        "My children are still finding bullets and spent casings here, still.",
        "There isn't much for the visitors to see.",
        "After the fire, government bulldozers came in and razed what was left of the buildings.",
        "There's only the vague outline of a foundation, a swimming pool filled with brackish water, and a grove of crape myrtle trees, each marked with a marble stone inscribed with the name of a Davidian who died in the siege.",
        "But even that grove has been a source of conflict.",
        "Last year, Pace chopped down David Koresh's tree.",
        "To honor him, David Koresh, in this way would be an abomination to God.",
        "So God told me to take his stone marker and break it up in pieces and to chop his tree down.",
        "I'd like to show it to you if you want.",
        "Right, let's see here.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)",

        "She lived on Mount Carmel for 40 years and left after the siege.",
        "When I visit at her home, she removes a Ziploc bag from a closet and carefully extracts a painting of Koresh's face.",
        "It is hand painted on the front of a T-shirt.",

        "So the idea is all right, so we can build tall buildings, we can build bridges that stretch clear across the water.",
        "We can do all these things...",
        "The other interesting fact is that Ryan very carefully says that the plant is locked up.",
        "He doesn't say it was shut down.",
        "That's because this plant is on standby status, which means it could be reopened if GM productions gets to the right level.",
        "And it hasn't gotten to that point, which is why the Ryan people say it's defensible to say that somehow Obama has some responsibility for the status of this plant.",
        "But in terms of the plant closing in 2008, that took place under the previous administration.",
        "Exactly and that's why this is the kind of thing where we'd give one or two Pinocchio's, because it's a politician kind of misleading listeners with what they choose to leave out, as opposed to what they say.",
        "In his speech, Paul Ryan also repeated what's been a recurring theme from this campaign - that the Obama administration took money out of Medicare to pay for the healthcare overhaul.",
        "Let's take a listen.",
        "Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars funneled out of Medicare by President Obama."

        "And both parties use the federal budget to mislead people, particularly when they talk about cuts to Medicare.",
        "The fact is, is that under the Obama health care plan, Medicare spending goes up year after year.",
        "The so-called cuts are a trim in anticipated spending over a 10-year period.",
        "In fact, Paul Ryan uses the same spending cuts to fund his reform of Medicare that Democrats oppose.",
        "And, as you point out in your column, these cuts are cuts to providers.",
        "They're not cuts to the beneficiaries themselves.",
        "That's right.",

        "Obama would like to use it for the health care plan.",

        "So we've been very concerned about the human rights situation there.",
        "And, of course, about what that means for these diamonds reaching international markets.",
        "And I know that Mugabe's government would argue that any action it's taken is to protect its interest and stop illegal mining.",

        "You have to question it.",
        "You have to wonder whether the way to deal with informal minors is by killing them.",
        "Obviously, the answer for us would be that it's not.",
        "The other ironic bit of information in this whole story is that a couple of years ago when these diamond fields were discovered, the government took them over from another foreign company that held the rights to the fields initially, and the government essentially invited citizens in to come and pan for diamonds because they knew that that was the only way they could have the capacity to get the diamonds out of the ground.",
        "So, you have the government inviting people in a few years ago, and now cracking down on minors."
