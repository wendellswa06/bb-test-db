        "Zimbabwe, of course, would like to be able to sell these diamonds and profit from them.",
        "There is the Kimberley Process.",
        "This is the international process for certifying diamonds as being conflict free, and that's the meeting that you were at recently where government officials, human rights group, diamond producers all participate.",
        "What happened at that recent meeting?",
        "We had an impasse.",
        "We had a situation where consensus was not reached to allow Zimbabwe to export diamonds from Marange.",
        "So the outcome of that is that Zimbabwe is not allowed to export.",
        "Now I understand Zimbabwe is threatening to go ahead and sell its diamonds whether or not it gets approval from the Kimberley Process.",
        "Can it go ahead and just do that?",
        "Zimbabwe did threaten at the meeting in Tel Aviv to reinterpret the decision of the meeting and decide that the Kimberley Process had allowed it to export diamonds.",
        "They haven't yet started exporting.",
        "We don't know whether they will or not, and we very much hope that the government of Zimbabwe will respect the decision taken by the Kimberley Process and will not defy it.",
        "Well, because I suppose at stake here is what happens in Zimbabwe, but also the fate of the Kimberley Process itself.",
        "If it's setting rules that can't be enforced for its members, does that weaken the process overall?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It calls into question the integrity of the Kimberley Process, its credibility in the eyes of consumers, and it sends a terrible message to all the other countries that are trying to implement the minimum requirements and the rules.",
        "It basically sends the message that if you don't follow the rules, that's okay.",
        "(Soundbite of song \"\"I Asked When\"\")",
        "(Singing) I saw bridges stretching out across the water and towers pushing taller...",
        "Following a conversation with the Branch Davidian isn't easy.",
        "They preach a mixture of interpretations from the Book of Revelations and conspiracy theory.",
        "Pace says the government attacked Mount Carmel because Koresh's followers had discovered a secret plan - to arm the gangs in the nation's prisons so they could be used to enforce martial law.",
        "Pace said the government wanted to cover up their plot.",
        "With that in mind, it isn't too surprising that when the Texas Department of Transportation announced that it would build a super highway that might run right through Mount Carmel, the Branch Davidians saw conspiracy written all over it."

        "It's going to miss the neighbor's house over there, but it's going to go right through our property.",
        "And I think that was pretty strategic.",
        "The Metropolitan Planning Organization in Waco confirmed that the 77 acres that make up Mount Carmel are included in a study for the road - although the Branch Davidians are hardly alone.",
        "The Trans-Texas Corridor would gobble up more than a half-million acres of private property under something called eminent domain, which allows the government to seize land for the public good.",
        "Still, the news of the highway plays into the Branch Davidians' worst fears.",
        "Byron Sage, the FBI's chief negotiator during the 1993 siege knows the group well.",
        "This type of a project could easily play into some of that paranoia even though, you know, hopefully they'll be able to check public records and so forth to determine that it wasn't specifically diverted to go through their property.",
        "But the public records, which show the highway banking left when it gets close to Waco, only seem to confirm Charles Pace's belief that this highway is another test for the Branch Davidians.",
        "This is where the Lord puts an end to it.",
        "He's going to judge this nation once and for all.",
        "And this is where the judgment begins, right here.",
        "And that's why we were judged here, the government is going to be judged here too.",
        "That's what God is saying.",

        "Whether that judgment has to include violence is unclear.",

        "Are they dangerous?",
        "I don't personally feel based upon the limited knowledge that I have, that the current group would be characterized as, quote, \"\"dangerous\"\" but there are individuals that may well seize upon the notoriety of the group based upon this tragedy in 1993 to kind of try to get their 15 minutes of fame at the expense of others.",
        "The FBI declined to be interviewed on tape for this story, although they did say they weren't keeping any special eye on the Branch Davidians.",
        "That won't happen unless they see signs of criminal activity.",
        "Earlier this month, the Texas legislature passed a bill that would put a two-year moratorium on the awarding of contracts for the highway project.",
        "Governor Rick Perry said he will veto the moratorium.",
        "But for the Branch Davidians, the bill might be a reprieve.",

        "rules, regulations and executive orders on everything from meat packing to the importation of exotic pets.",
        "We were wondering how bureaucrats and citizens got through life before there was a Federal Register to consult.",
        "We were confused.",
        "We weren't sure what the regulations were that were in effect.",
        "That's Ray Mosley, director of the Federal Register.",
        "I asked him how the Federal Register was born.",
        "In 1934 there was a famous case called the Hot Oil Case in which the government confused the oil companies as to what its rules were that were in effect and ended up prosecuting some of the oil companies, and they came to find out that the provision under which they were prosecuting them for was not in effect.",
        "And this case ultimately ended up in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court threw it out and that became the impetus for the Federal Register.",
        "So inside the government at that time, nobody really knew what was going on?",
        "The left hand and the right hand were doing completely different things?",
        "It certainly appears that way today.",
        "I think that since there was no central body that was compiling these rules or keeping track of them, it was easy for the Secretary in Interior to issue something and then for the President in an executive order to also issue something, and the two were uncoordinated, and that's basically what got us to this hot oil case.",
        "When this got to the Supreme Court I understand that Justice Louis Brandeis was very irritated by the whole thing.",
        "Indeed he was, and I think he was something of a mastermind behind this, because he had been advocating the creation of a publication like the Federal Register for many years.",
        "He had already foreseen the problems that the public faced and I think he made it a point when the case was argued before him to question the Justice Department quite closely and quite explicitly such that the Justice Department attorney who was representing the case before the Supreme Court did not have enough time to argue the merits of the case.",
        "He ended up talking for about an hour just answering questions as to why the rule that was in effect, or was not in effect, could not be found."

        "The key issue here, or one of the key issues would be: How do you define what counts as a conflict diamond or a blood diamond, as they're sometimes known?",

        "There is a debate around definition.",
        "The definition used by the United Nations and, by extension, the Kimberley Process, is very narrow and points to conflict diamonds being diamonds mined and sold by rebel groups, so, you know, non-state, armed actors.",
