        "I was laying on the ground on my side, sleeping, and I noticed how quiet it was, and then I turned over--rolled over to the other side so my other ear was exposed, and then I heard crickets.",
        "The ear that was not hearing the crickets was actually hearing a ringing tone in the same high range.",
        "His brain was suppressing both sounds in that ear.",
        "But once I heard it then I realized that I did have tinnitus.",

        "Violinist Sandy Yamamoto says so far the response has been strong, if varied.",
        "Some people really like it.",
        "Other people are really distracted by the fact that there's this A going through the whole piece.",

        "But for many others, the sound doesn't go away.",
        "Tinnitus that is bothersome to the point of being noticed and as being part of their everyday life, certainly you're looking at 10 million Americans.",
        "But this figure is a little bit misleading in that some people can have tinnitus and not really mention it to anyone.",
        "So it's sometimes called the invisible handicap.",
        "It's there, but people kind of grit and bear it.",
        "And composer Davids says he's glad the performances of the piece so far have helped make tinnitus more understandable to those who don't have it.",
        "I've had a couple of, you know, husbands come up to me and say that they can finally show their wives what it is that they're experiencing in their mind, in their ears, and they've never been able to explain it before but now they can, because their wives sat in the audience and listened to the work and they have, you know, a little window into what it's like.",
        "This is the 10th anniversary season for the Miro Quartet and on the same concerts with \"\"Tinnitus Quartet\"\" they play two other works written by composers coping with hearing difficulties.",

        "And although it can't be known for certain if Smetana had tinnitus as he was losing his hearing, the string quartet he wrote called \"\"From My Life\"\" famously depicts the moment he realized that he was going deaf with a note that sounds like ringing in an ear.",

        "After discovering his tinnitus while camping that day, Brent Michael Davids learned more about the sometimes counterintuitive ways the brain copes with hearing disorders.",

        "Audiologist Dr. Marshall Chasin says, whether it's sounds of nature or white noise or even just an audio boost from a hearing aid, outside sounds can help lessen the effect of the phantom sounds the brain is producing.",
        "Masking of tinnitus is something that has been the mainstay of our clinical approach for, oh, for 35, 40 years anyway.",
        "We do know that external or extraneous sounds can cover over or mask the tinnitus and people are much less bothered by these external sounds.",
        "Scott, thank you and see you back in Washington.",
        "Miro cellist Joshua Gindele says that the audience revels in the long silence that follows the piece, waiting to applaud, feeling as though when the tone ends a weight has been lifted from them.",
        "Hearing silence after this, you know--20 minutes of hearing this tone is really poignant for me.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "And it really does give me an idea and, really, I do value my ability to hear so much more when I finally get silence at the end of the work."
