        "Anything that could fall into the category of gender-based discrimination and sexual violence is something that Title IX is also sort of the umbrella federal law over.",
        "From what I've read, some of the men say that the reason that they want to undertake this kind of lawsuit is because when you have a judgment against you under Title IX, it can have ramifications for the rest of your life.",

        "I mean, that is one thing they're saying.",

        "That being said, I definitely think that what these men are saying is we didn't get a fair shot.",
        "The process wasn't fair.",
        "And sometimes, what they're also asking through these lawsuits is for the federal courts to step in and change the results or order the school to conduct the investigation in a different way.",
        "And that's part of what some of these class actions are asking for.",
        "But what is likely to happen if the men succeed and these lawsuits gain class-action status?",
        "I mean, could it upend how these cases are treated?",
        "I mean, if they did gain class-action status, which I personally think is pretty steep thing for them to get, I think that it could result in a lot of these either being kicked back to the school and these students and the survivors having to go through all of this again, and it also has a wider reaching impact as far as what students who are going through these circumstances see and think as far as reporting.",
