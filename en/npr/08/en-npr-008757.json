        "The city of New York has received 68,000 doses so far.",
        "To put that in perspective, that would barely vaccinate the people who attended Bruce Springsteen show last night at Giants Stadium.",

        "That's really not very much to be able to handle what maybe a very large crowd.",

        "It's put off school immunization until they have enough to do the roughly one million schoolchildren in the city.",
        "You might think a city like New York could throw it's weight around since it had a major outbreak of swine flu in the spring, but it doesn't work that way.",
        "The CDC is distributing the vaccine based on population.",
        "New York City has 2.7 percent of the population of the United States, and that's exactly the percentage of the vaccine it gets when the stuff becomes available.",
        "That leaves health departments with a dilemma: How do you start to push for mass immunization when the supply isn't there yet?",
        "Jeffrey Levi, director of the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health, says they have to carefully match supply and demand.",
        "We have this two-edged concern, one is that we'll throw party and everyone comes at the same time or we've thrown the party and not enough people come."
