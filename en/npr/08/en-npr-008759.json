        "For example, when these companies do promise their employees a certain dollar amount per hour worked, for example, they don't necessarily put the money into the defined benefit plan.",

        "I don't disagree that the social covenant, the economic covenant that was made between workers and businesses 30, 40, 50 years ago, has not been honored.",
        "And that's a reality that gets reflected not only in Chapter 11, but throughout the American economy in general.",
        "But the other thing I want to note is there has been a new bankruptcy bill passed, as I'm sure you've heard, and some of the provisions of that bill that are getting the most notoriety are provisions that, quite frankly, are not very friendly to lower-income Americans.",
        "But, interestingly, there are a few provisions of that new bill that are relevant to the discussion that we're having, and I want to mention them.",
        "There is a provision in the new bill that's going to make it a lot harder for former executives and new executives of companies in Chapter 11 to receive huge bonuses.",
        "There's really going to be a cutback on that.",
        "There's also a provision I think that was primarily--possibly prompted by the Polaroid situation that is going to permit the bankruptcy court to go back and reinstate a retirement benefit plan that was terminated within 180 days prior to the bankruptcy filing.",
        "So Congress did hear some of the justified complaints of the working community in the wake of situations such as Polaroid.",
        "All right.",
        "Ms Sedhom, with literally 30 seconds, give me something to look forward to for these folks.",
        "Something to look forward to.",
