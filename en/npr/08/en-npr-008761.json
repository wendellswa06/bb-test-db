        "In retrospect, what Neil Armstrong accomplished all those years ago is scarcely less astonishing now than it was when he stepped out onto the moon.",
        "He would've been the first to say that he was just one member of a big team, that the hard work and genius of many others made it possible for him to climb down the ladder of the lunar lander one slow step at a time as the world held its breath.",
        "Over the past couple of days, that world has remembered Neil Armstrong, the test pilot, the engineer, the jet fighter pilot, the astronaut, the hero.",
        "And, yes, he would flinch from that last word.",
        "But to many, he defined it.",
        "In the British newspaper The Guardian, Amy Teitel ended her column with this: We are, by nature, curious beings with a thirst for knowledge of the world around us.",
        "Armstrong has inspired those who watched his first steps on the moon and those who read about him in school books 10, 20 and 30 years later.",
        "It's up to the historians now to preserve Armstrong's legacy so that others can experience that same moment of wonder when they read about the moon landing for the first time because Armstrong will always be the first man to walk on the moon, and he will always embody the spirit of Apollo.",
        "We'd like to hear about your Neal Armstrong moment today.",

        "I was one month shy of 5 years old when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.",
        "It's my first memory in life.",
        "From that day on, whenever someone asks what I wanted to be when I grew up, I replied an astronaut.",
        "Forty years later, I still dream of going to space, and my appreciation of astronomy and our place in the universe was born watching men walk on the moon.",
        "It may have been a small step, but it was a giant leap for my imagination and dreams.",
        "Godspeed, Neil Armstrong.",
        "Godspeed.",
        "And let's get Jay on the line, Jay with us from Pleasanton in California.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thank you.",
        "A thought occurred to me.",
        "I was 14 years old when we stayed up late that night and watched them land on the moon.",
        "And a thought occurred to me this week when he died that I hadn't thought of before.",
        "We remember people from history, from a century or two ago, but very few people in history remember it a thousand years later.",
        "You know, it occurred to me that of all the people that I shared the planet with in my lifetime, Neil Armstrong seems to be the one sure lock to be still a household name a thousand years from now.",
        "He's the first of our species to step on another world, and I think that makes you a lock to be remembered a thousand years from now whenever humanity is then.",
        "It's an interesting way to think about it.",
        "A person we shared the planet with who's going to be remembered a thousand years from now.",
        "That's got to be a really short list.",
        "Only one I could even think of was Einstein, but I don't know if he's a lock.",
        "But Armstrong is a lock.",
        "It's easy to imagine countries or capital cities on Mars named Armstrong someday, you know?",
        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Here's an email that we have from Nazren(ph) in Cincinnati.",
        "I was a kid growing in Kabul, Afghanistan.",
        "I clearly remember that day when my mom told us that President Kennedy's dream became a reality.",
        "The news of the first man landing touched us all, even in a little known place at that time, Kabul.",
        "Now I live in the state of Ohio and graduated from the University of Cincinnati where Mr. Armstrong once taught.",
        "Let's go to next Leslie, and Leslie on the line with us from Little Rock."

        "So very shy about that.",
        "And what he really liked to talk about apparently, and which I did talk to him about a bit - was his days as an F-15 test pilot.",
        "Those were the romantic moments for him.",

        "Well, the alternatives for the government are even less attractive, according to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who unveiled the plan today.",

        "Simon Critchley joins us from our New York bureau.",
        "What is your fascination with death, and the death of these philosophers?",
        "The issue, really - what the book is about is the ancient wisdom that to philosophize is to learn how to die.",
        "Philosophy begins with the death, the death of Socrates, but he goes to his death with equanimity - without fear.",
        "And the key thing is that philosophy can allow you to overcome the fear of death without requiring a belief in the afterlife, a sort of longing for immortality.",

        "That's something to be celebrated.",
