        "Blagojevich says he's going to hold on to his seat and may actually talk to the people of Illinois as soon as today.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "I mean, there've been rumors about - Lisa Madigan even mentioned, the Attorney General, mentioned on Meet the Press last Sunday that there are rumors that he might resign, but obviously that is not happening and that's why the state legislature voted to convene in an impeachment panel yesterday.",
        "They had - they voted yesterday unanimously.",
        "They had some kind of meetings, and they're meeting again today.",
        "And the lawyers for Blagojevich are there, and they tried to say, well, this state legislator should not be a part of the impeachment panel, because he or she has already come out decided on impeachment or made comments about impeachment, but everything that the Blagojevich lawyer tried to do has been ruled out of order.",
        "It's just interesting what's going to happen because, ultimately, what the Republicans clearly like and what Dick Durbin, the Democratic Senator, mentioned early, although he's not talking about it anymore, is that they would love to take the power of a special election, take the power of appointing an ex-senator to replace Barack Obama away from the governor and have a special election.",
        "Of course, the Republicans would like that, because then they would have a chance of winning it, whereas by appointment, since the official in Illinois is a Democrat, they would not have that opportunity.",
        "That seems to be drifting away from the Republicans' grasp.",
        "Democrats are talking less and less about a special election, and it looks like that whoever it will be, perhaps Pat Quinn the Lieutenat Governor, if Blagojevich is removed, he may make that appointment.",
        "In the meantime, the Republicans are running ads blasting the Democrats for refusing to abide by democracy and giving the voters of Illinois the chance of electing the next senator.",
        "Well, I mean, the law in Illinois, as in 33 other states, gives the governor the right to appoint a successor in a Senate vacancy but, given the complete lack of ethics going on, the lack of trust among voters, what's going on in Illinois, perhaps a special election would not be the worst thing in the world.",
        "But of course, if the Republicans have a choice, they would absolutely choose that over Pat Quinn having that decision.",
        "And then there is a new Senate seat that's open when earlier today President-elect Barack Obama announced that Ken Salazar, the Democratic senator from Colorado, he hopes will serve as the next Secretary of the Interior."
