        "Though Warner/McCain/Graham bill will probably be brought out sometime in the mid part of this week - today, tomorrow - we'll see some version of that.",
        "And they would very much like to have some kind of a committee action on that and the House - excuse me, in the Senate Armed Service Committee, which Warner chairs, and then bring that to the floor of the Senate.",
        "But as you mentioned earlier, the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, has already agreed to bring the White House version - matching up with the House - out on the floor on it's own without any kind of committee action and insist on a vote on that."
