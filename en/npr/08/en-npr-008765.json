        "So that will mean procedurally that the trio will have to try to amend what the president wants on the floor, which would be a little tougher.",
        "But they may have the votes with the Democrats and perhaps as many as nine Republicans on their side to actually do that.",
        "Then we'd have the Senate and the House on different pages.",
        "Okay, a couple of things.",
        "One to catch up, you're saying that there is going to be independent - likely to be independent judicial review.",
        "Just where exactly it is - whether it's in the armed - in civilian courts, or military courts remains to be seen.",
        "The other question here is on the timing.",
        "And again, the president wants all this to happen now.",
        "But you're talking about an argument so far, that's within the Republican Party.",
        "The Democrats, are they supporting the Warner, McCain and Lindsey Graham bill?",
        "Yes, they're quite grateful to have something that is an alternative to the president's proposal, which many of them have serious misgivings about, but which is not in and of itself a Democratic alternative.",
        "In other words, something that has a chance of having enough votes from the Republican side to actually prevail, at least in the Senate.",
        "Of course, that doesn't resolve the contradictions that they'll have with the House.",
        "It doesn't resolve the differences between the two chambers.",
        "That will have to be done by a conference committee between the two chambers.",
        "And then that would all have to come back to be voted on one more time, before they actually get out of town in October.",
        "And that sounds like a set of pretty high hurdles to pass before all of this can happen in a relatively limited time frame.",
        "But they can do it if they really want to and if the pressure from the White House remains as strong as we expect it to.",
        "And - and this is critical -if public opinion continues to support the idea that we should go forward with the White House's version of what military commissions, military tribunals should do.",
        "And what evidence is there that public opinion does support that?",
        "Well, I think it's safe to say that people want to see Khalid Sheikh Mohammed brought to justice.",
        "They want to see other people that they associate with 9/11 brought to justice.",
        "As long as the president can say the mastermind of 9/11, it's clear that people are going to support that idea.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, you're on the air, Les.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "When you get down into such kinds of questions as who might be tried in the future, or let's say whether or not evidence that could have been induced by means of torture can me admitted - when you get down to how do you prosecute the kind of abuse that we saw at Abu Ghraib and some of the other issues that are around the edges of this particular controversy, then I think you get more of a division of public opinion."

        "Mm hmm.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "Why don't we stick to Congress and the Guantanamo detainees?",
        "There was a point there about immunity for CIA agents and others who have questioned and used what the president described as alternative methods on prisoners.",
        "That's right.",
        "The administration wants whatever the Congress passes with respect to these issues to include a number of things that don't go directly to the trial of these immediate detainees.",
        "One of them is the proposal that no American personnel could be prosecuted for the way they may have abused or alleged to have abused detainees such as the Abu Ghraib situation.",
        "And that would be a question of a court applying a standard, quote, \"shocks the conscience.",
        "If the treatment shocks the conscience, then that could be prosecuted.",

        "There was a thought perhaps that we could even have a committee hearing today and deliberation on the bill, so it would seem to me that there is a significant possibility of votes in the next several weeks.",
        "And so the timeframe that the president proposed before Congress rises to go campaign for reelection - most of them - you think that's realistic?",
        "Well, I think what he's done is began a very deliberate debate/discussion, and the question is can we come to principled agreements and then move forward to debate on the floor?",
        "I don't see this as simply - at least hope not - rushing to judgment.",

        "Well, no. There is still proposals - discussions going on, but there's some basic points of disagreement.",
        "One is that the president's proposal would not allow both sides to see all the evidence.",
        "That seems to raise very fundamental questions about the fairness of any trial.",
        "Two, there's the issue of the use of hearsay testimonies from other evidentiary rules.",
        "One of, I think, the touchstones of this whole debate has to be not only will this be effective in prosecuting the detainees in Guantanamo, but if this method is used against the Americans who are in custody of other powers, would we judge it to be fair?",
        "Good.",
        "I travel a lot and, Neal, I enjoy the program driving down the road.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And I think in response to that, the military lawyers who testified just a few days ago - the army, air force and marine lawyers, navy lawyers - all essentially said that they would be very much more comfortable with the rules of procedure closer to what Senator Warner, McCain and Lindsey Graham are talking about."

        "What is the question here is how they can be punished and what means?",

        "And what about the use of evidence collected under coercion?",
        "Well, that again goes to the whole issue of what would we tolerate if an American was in this type of situation - custody of a foreign power?",
