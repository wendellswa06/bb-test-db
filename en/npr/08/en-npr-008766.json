        "And what about his political motives?",
        "He's running for president.",
        "Well, I'm sure there's several motivations, and I think - not only he's running for president, but he's also trying to do the will of the president.",
        "He's not the only senator running for president, either.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "And so that might deem it at this moment more compelling than his plans for '08.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And Senator Reed, we'll let you go, but I wanted to ask you one more question.",
        "You're talking about - effectively, you say the United States is going to be able to hold these men as long as they represent a threat to the country, which is - let's say, just a very, very long time, if not forever.",
        "Are we really talking about the death penalty here?",
        "That could be the penalty for people who are convicted of very serious crimes under these procedures.",
        "Is that what we're discussing?",
        "Well, if someone was essentially convicted under these procedures under certain crimes which the death penalty attaches, they could be - after due process - sentenced to death.",
        "And that sentence could be carried out.",
        "But that cannot be done unless there is a legitimate tribunal that will weigh the evidence and impose a punishment.",
        "Senator Reed, thanks very much for your time.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.",

        "Abe Sofaer, what do you think of the president's proposal?",
        "Does the White House have a stronger legal case if it has the same procedure the Supreme Court says was unconstitutional, but it's approved by Congress?",
        "Well, that's a loaded question.",
        "They don't have the same procedure that was struck down by the court.",
        "This is a radically different proposal than what the president had wanted to do unilaterally or under the claim of the general resolution.",
        "This is a very carefully thought out proposal.",
        "It is extremely detailed and very fair in most respects, if not all.",
        "I'm distressed as I sit here and listen to people say, for example, that evidence as a result of torture can be admitted, that there are no appeals to the civil courts -things like that that are just completely wrong.",
        "The bill excludes evidence as a result of torture, and it does permit an appeal to the civil courts.",
        "So…",
        "By the president's definition, torture has never been used.",
        "Well, it's got nothing to do with the president's definition now.",
        "The president, in fact, has adopted in this bill the definition that I advanced, that Senator McCain adopted and put in the law, and he wants that definition of cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment put into this bill.",
        "There's nothing wrong with that.",
        "That's what Congress wanted.",
        "That's what everyone associated with the torture convention agreed was the intended meaning of those words, and now all of a sudden people are making a big deal out of it because the president has adopted it.",
        "It's absurd to me, frankly.",
        "And I don't think it does a service to the nation to be leaving so many things in the public's mind as uncertain when in fact they are certain.",
        "And these points have been accepted by the president, and this bill does protect people from those kinds of problems.",
        "As we understand it, the president's proposal, though, would create situations where the defendant might not hear all of the evidence introduced against him."

        "That's true.",
        "And I think people should think very carefully about requiring every single bit of evidence to be revealed to the defendant in these very special kinds of cases.",
        "First, let me tell you the general principle that we will be subjected to the same kind of rule in proceedings in foreign countries and that that represents reciprocity is a distortion of the meaning of reciprocity in international law.",
        "The people that we are trying here are people that have no sovereign country, that they are illegal combatants.",
        "And the people with whom we will have a reciprocity issue of that sort are states that have signed onto the Geneva Conventions and that are not going to deprive our troops of the same protections we will not deprive their soldiers of.",
        "So the reciprocity in international law is a reciprocity between states.",
        "And we are not going to deprive the soldiers of a state that don't qualify as people who are essentially terrorists of their rights.",
        "So the reciprocity point is just baseless, utterly baseless.",
        "David Price, do you agree?",
        "Well, Neal, actually what I was thinking a little bit more about was when Mr. Sofaer was talking about that people need to think long and hard before we disclose every piece of evidence to one of these accused individuals.",
        "And the distinction between disclosing every piece of evidence versus disclosing every piece of evidence that's going to be used against that person at a tribunal.",
        "And there're clearly, in many cases, will be pieces of evidence that a government does not use in a trial against an accused person.",
        "But in terms of the evidence that is going to be used against that person in a tribunal, I think that Brigadier General Walker - the staff judge advocate for the Marine Corps - said it best in his testimony just the other day before Congress when he stated that he's not aware of any situation in the world where there's a system of jurisprudence recognized by civilized people where an individual that can be tried without and convicted without seeing the evidence against him.",
        "And I don't think the United States needs to become the first in that scenario.",
        "So I'm very troubled by the prospect of taking someone to a tribunal, a court martial, a commission or whatever you want to call it, and using evidence against them that they are not permitted to have access to.",
        "Based on your reading of the Hamdan decision, David Price, would you think that this would pass Supreme Court review?",
        "I would hope not.",
        "Would you think so, Abe Sofaer?"

        "I certainly think it will.",
        "When you read the law properly, you see that there is a very limited right in the government to ask the military judge who presides over these tribunals to consider deleting only those portions of a statement of a witness that might reveal some very sensitive piece of classified information.",
        "And that limited right, if it will not be within the power of the prosecutor or the president, it'll be within the power of the military judge in the commission.",
        "And for example, if a defendant wants to know who was it that testified that I was at a critical meeting that called for the blowing up of, you know, 3,000 Americans and we have a source who tells us that he was at the meeting, you can tell that defendant that someone has said that you were at the meeting.",
        "You can tell his lawyer who that someone was.",
        "You can tell the military judge who that someone was.",
        "But why do you - you have to allow a presiding military judge to make a judgment.",

        "Finally, we've got a cooperating person right in the midst of al-Qaida, and we want to out him or basically release this person.",
        "It just doesn't make any sense to me to bind your hands in advance and not permit a fair-minded process to proceed.",
        "Would not that, David Price, raise questions about being allowed to confront your accuser?",
        "The question I have - I have a retired lieutenant colonel Marine Corps father and also a retired warrant officer brother, Marine Corps, and we have these discussions a lot.",
        "And when you talk about Gitmo, go back to A Few Good Men and you have the base scene when Jack Nicholson says you don't want to know the truth.",
        "I, Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, swear that as president of Republic of Zimbabwe...",
        "Well, Sofaer - I mean, Neal, Mr. Sofaer makes two points that need to be addressed.",
        "One is the proposed legislation does provide that the military defense counsel will have access to all classified information.",
        "However, for a civilian defense counsel - who can only try to be involved in the prosecution of the case if they have obtained the necessary clearances - it provides that the civilian counsel can also be precluded from having access to that information.",
        "So that's a distinction that needs to be brought out.",
        "So it's really not making sure that the entire defense side has access to the information.",
        "Another point is that if you have a particular case where the disclosure of that type of information is so significant, we do not have the same speedy trial protections here that we would have in our either military court martial system or through the federal civilian trials.",
        "So it is permissible for the government, if they need to, to delay the trial or this tribunal or commission for some period of time.",
        "It may also be possible that they could obtain the conviction without the disclosure of that particular piece or those pieces of information.",
        "Again, we're talking about the distinction between information that's going to be used to convict a person who may receive the death penalty.",
        "And I agree with Brigadier General Walker.",
        "We do not, as Americans, want to be the first system that endorses that as a method of prosecution."

        "And I just want to say that the Bush administration plan does actually allow for the use of coerced testimony as long as the judge in the tribunal rules that the evidence is probative.",
        "Is that accurate?",
        "Yes, there are two separate issues.",
