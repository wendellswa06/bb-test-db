        "I guess we're back to what is the meaning of is, Neal.",
        "Another interesting aspect about that, however, is the proposed legislation would decriminalize the use of these coercive, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment by our civilian interrogators, while at the same time making those offenses for which these accused individuals could be convicted.",

        "The Bush administration was wrong in adopting a meaning of inhumane, cruel and degrading treatment.",
        "That not only interpreted it consistent with our cruel and unusual clause - which this law does and which is perfectly appropriate - but refused to apply it overseas to our interrogators overseas.",
        "And that is a big mistake and it exposed our people to criminal prosecution under out laws.",

        "But I think we all should acknowledge that at the very outset five years ago that that was not the presumption.",
