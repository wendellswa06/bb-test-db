        "Right.",
        "We don't know the complete story of how the cub was found, but a shepherd did finally, when he was probably less than two months old, in a region of Pakistan called the Naltar Valley, and took care of him for a short period of time before realizing that he really didn't have the expertise and ability, financial ability, to care for Leo, and so he turned him -",
        "Is it unusual for you to get a snow leopard from the wild like this?",
        "I mean, are most of them -",
        "To take a snow leopard from the wild?",
        "Yes, it's actually quite unusual.",
        "The vast majority of all mammals in zoos are those that are captive-bred, and our reasons for taking Leo were essentially three-fold.",
        "One, we wanted to provide for the welfare of this cub.",
        "There, at the present time, is not an adequate facility in Pakistan for snow leopards, so we wanted to provide a good home for Leo.",
        "It was also an opportunity for us to enhance the genetic diversity of the snow leopard population in North American zoos, which is managed cooperatively by the zoos that do keep the species in North America.",
        "And the third reason?",
        "Well, it was a chance to strengthen the bonds between the Wildlife Conservation Society, which is our parent organization, and various Pakistani wildlife agencies.",
        "We already have programs in Pakistan, but this just enabled us to form another link.",

        "Something that might not be obvious from the outside is that as you come up to these executions, there's a flurry of legal stays that are trying to be placed by the prisoner's lawyer.",
        "So the death warrant runs out at midnight, so the process must begin by midnight.",
        "And so we had stays up until the last minute until around 11:30.",
        "And at 11:30, we heard that the execution would go through for Ledell Lee.",
        "The fact that this went ahead without incident, does that weaken the case that there's a problem with the three-drug cocktail?",
        "Yeah, so that's a complicated question.",
        "So the three-drug cocktail involves a first drug, midazolam, which is supposed to sedate.",
        "But the second drug is a paralytic.",
        "And then the third drug is potassium chloride, which people have described as fire running through the veins.",
        "So the controversial part of this is that midazolam isn't really an anesthetic.",
        "It's in the same category as valium.",
        "It potentially could not work to actually sedate the prisoner, and they would feel the painful effects of the second and the third drug.",

        "He was the consummate professional engineer, a self-described geek, who always said that his achievement was the product of many minds and strong wills.",
        "He was instinctively self-effacing, as his recollections nearby show.",
        "If he receded from public view after Apollo 11, it was to minimize any chance that history's focus would shift away from NASA's achievement on that mission.",
        "This is a moment when some are inclined to say, they don't make them like that anymore, but they do still make them like that if only we have the wit to find and support them.",
        "Neil Armstrong's death at age 82 is an occasion to elevate again in the public eye the personal values that he represented: excellence, fortitude, worthy dreams and personal humility.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, he was - and I think that's another thing that's really admirable about Armstrong is he never tried to take advantage of what he had done to keep the spotlight on himself or to enrich his family or to, you know, make a gain in his life.",
        "He lived a, you know, a kind of quiet life, and certainly, he could have made another choice, but he let his achievement speak for itself.",

        "Here's a excerpt: Before, during and after that epochal journey, Armstrong came across as something of an enigma to global media anxious to make him the brightest star on Earth.",
        "This was going to be tough.",
        "Rather than having the jaunty wit of a Wally Schirra, the affable magnetism of a John Glenn or the flinty swagger of a Chuck Yeager, Neil Armstrong came across as nothing more than the earnest, no-nonsense engineer he actually was.",
        "No artifice, no flash, no, well, frankly, no star power to think of.",
        "Armstrong taught at Cincinnati for eight years after - before leaving in 1979, characteristically without explanation.",
        "He was hardly a recluse afterward, though he maintained a relatively low profile, lower, anyway, than you'd expect for the first man on the moon.",
        "He sat on boards of banks and corporations and served on various commissions, including the one investigating the 1986 Challenger disaster.",
        "That panel included another space pioneer, Sally Ride, who died little more than a month ago.",
        "Still, by his ninth decade on planet Earth, Armstrong seemed to be more relaxed in public and generally more visible than he used to be.",
        "If anything, his time hugging the corners of fame made him seem even more admirable as a man who refused to sell himself or his legacy out no matter what temptations were available in a celebrity-crazed culture.",
        "For one spellbinding week 43 summers ago, Neil Armstrong did something that once seemed unimaginable.",
        "Since then, he lived his wife - life in a way that now seems improbable.",
        "At age of 14, Neil deGrasse Tyson, now the director of New York's Hayden Planetarium, met Neil Armstrong.",
        "Both were passengers aboard the SS Canberra, an ocean liner, when they went to see a total solar eclipse in 1973.",
        "For me, what matters there is he's an American icon because he embodied all of our dreams of what it is to explore.",
        "And since we haven't been back to the moon in 40 years, for me, part of me died with him because he's - the dream hasn't been sustained and that worries me greatly about the future of our space-faring nation."
