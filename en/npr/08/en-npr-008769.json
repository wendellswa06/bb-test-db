        "In Time.com, Jeffrey Kluger recalled Armstrong's preternatural calm in several incidents involving test aircraft, jet fighter planes and space capsules, some of which nearly killed him.",
        "It was the lunar module Eagle that nearly took out Armstrong the final time when he and Buzz Aldrin were making their final approach to their Tranquility Base landing site on July 20, 1969.",
        "Tranquility Base had been extensively mapped by unmanned orbiters.",
        "And while NASA knew the eyesight of the orbiters was not sharp enough to resolve objects as small as boulders, they reckoned they could recognize a boulder field when they saw one from the surrounding topography.",
        "So the Lunar Excursion Module's, LEM's computer was supposed to handle the actual landing, which it did just fine, until Armstrong and Aldrin were making their final approach when the warning panel flashed what was called a 1202 alarm and then a 1201, both indicating that the system was overloaded and could process no more.",
        "The LEM by then was exceedingly low on fuel.",
        "And if the needle hit empty, there'd be no running on residue sloshing in the tank that motorists call fumes and astronauts call blowdown.",
        "Empty meant empty and that meant shutdown.",
        "And then, of course, the boulders appeared all over the prime landing zone were massive rocks impossible to navigate and deadly to try even to approach.",
        "Armstrong took the stick from the harried computer, tilted the half-upright LEM into a head-forward lean and flew in the flat across the boulder field, finally touching down on a spot of soil that had been wholly unremarkable for the entire 4 billion years of the moon's existence and would now become the most powerfully evocative patch of real estate in all of human history.",
        "There were, NASA later calculated, about 30 seconds of fuel left in the tank.",
        "Jeffrey Kluger also recalled a visit to U.S.",
        "troops in the Middle East with Apollo astronauts.",
        "One evening during the Middle East tour, all the astronauts were onstage before an audience of service members young enough to be their grandchildren.",
        "During the question-and-answer session, one soldier asked Armstrong if he wouldn't mind taking the mike and, well, saying the words, the words, those one-small-step words.",
        "I winced and I suspect Lovell and Cernan did too.",
        "This was dog-and-pony stuff of the highest order.",
        "Armstrong just smiled and reached for the mike.",
        "His hand seemed shaky and his voice was weak, not the clear Midwestern tones that were spoken in 1969 that had been heard and heard and heard ever since.",
        "But he spoke the words all the same, and the audience roared, and the applause rained down.",
        "And it was just the coolest and grandest and finest thing you could ever hope to see.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NEWS)",
        "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.",
        "So safe commander is Commander Armstrong and thank you.",

        "It's a pleasure to be here.",
        "What's so stressful about this work that so many pilots leave do you think?",
        "What makes the work hard and the reason we have 240 people leaving each year - some are for family reasons, some are just because they've reached what they believe is a logical end of their time in the service.",
        "And other times it's because they're just flat tired, Scott.",
        "A typical person doing this mission over the last seven or eight years has worked either six or seven days a week, 12 hours a day.",
        "And that one or two day break at the end of it is really not enough time to take care of that family and the rest of your life.",

        "The difficult thing is living in the present.",
        "Hmm.",
