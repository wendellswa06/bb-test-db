        "The next question is, if you go in and have a cap, what's the most effective, what's the most efficient way of limiting costs and getting the reductions as quickly as possible?",
        "And experience has shown quite often that the way to do that is let the marketplace figure it out.",
        "And the way you harness the power of the marketplace is by allowing a commodity to be traded.",
        "In this case, you would trade carbon emissions across emitters and people who can save emissions and that's what - that's the trade part.",
        "That's the carbon trading part.",
        "So, only to just see if I can tweak(ph) - tease(ph) this out a little bit.",
        "If I make cleans(ph), if I - in fact, really - let's say, I'm a power plant and I put clean, carbon-free emissions, I could have credits for those that I can now swap, right, with someone who might not be so clean and sell them for money?",
        "That's right.",
        "Think about it as two power plants.",
        "They both have the same cap.",
        "One power plant - your power plant is really smart.",
        "And if - you figure out a way to lower your emissions even below - further than below your cap, I'm not so smart, I'm going to have to give you money to make up that difference.",
        "So we reward innovation.",
        "Now how do you know that this will work better than mandatory - just caps system?",
        "Well, I think the only way to do a cap system is allow for trading.",
        "The reason it works better is because it gives rewards to people to go beyond the limit.",
        "Suppose we're - again, we're two power plants.",
        "And you have your allowance and I have my allowance.",
        "If we can't trade, all I want to do in my power plant, all you're going to do in your power plant is get to the allowance.",
        "You're not going to do anything more than that.",
        "On the other hand, if you know, you can make money by coming up with a new technology that's going to get your further down the road, you're going to do it.",
        "I'm going to try to do it, too.",
        "Everybody's going to try to it and you're going to spark innovation.",
        "Now, this is something because the earth doesn't care where the CO2 is coming form.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "The earth could do it any - you could trade international.",
        "That's right.",
        "You can trade internationally.",
        "For example, a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the world are coming from burning tropical rainforests.",
        "Power plants could pay tropical rainforest countries to slow the rate of deforestation, save that precious resource and get relatively cheap benefits in terms of, in terms of lowering their emissions and everybody wins.",

        "Healthy cattle don't put out as much methane.",
        "Could you do that with farmers?",
        "Also, with cap-and-trade...",
        "You could.",
        "In fact, if you have what we call carbon offsets, where you allow for people to figure out ways of lowering emissions even though they don't have enough part of the emission scenario, they don't have allowances.",
        "They can sell those as credits.",
        "So for example, if I'm a hog farmer, and I know the waste - that you might not want to think about exactly what that is...",
        "Right.",
        "...but the manure gives off methane.",
        "I can figure out a way to capture that methane, use that as a credit and sell it to a power plant to make up for their emissions.",
        "So there's all sorts of opportunities for people to figure out ways to prevent emissions from natural systems, to enhance the uptake of greenhouse gases in natural systems like farms and forests and use those as offsets to sell to emitters.",

        "Well, this is definitely on their radar screen.",
        "There are several bills in Washington that are - have been proposed and are being considered, and a number of those have in them a cap, a real cap on emissions that allow for carbon trading, different limitations on that carbon trading.",
        "And I think it remains to be seen what comes out.",
        "From my point of view, the question is not whether we're going to have climate legislation in the United States; I think we're clearly going to.",
        "Whether that legislation is going to be meaningful.",
        "And meaningful legislation will have a real cap on emissions that requires a decrease in emissions over time and that will have the flexibility that we need to allow for carbon trading.",

        "...did it not?",
        "We had a cap-and-trade system put in place with the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments for acid rain that involved a cap on sulfur oxide emissions over time and trading among power plants.",
        "At the time it was put in place, there was a lot of criticism - it wasn't going to work, it will be too expensive.",
        "We met the targets ahead of time, at about one-third the cost.",
        "And because we had that trading, there were all sorts of incentives for power plants to figure out cheap ways of lowering their sulfur oxide emissions, and it turned out to be much less expensive than had been originally predicted.",
        "You can buy.",
        "You can sell.",
        "We also did trading, some limited trading in lowering CFC emissions for the stratospheric ozone depletion process problem, and there was some trading in lowering lead in gasoline as well.",

        "The way you would apply the cap is just upstream, a high upstream in the process as possible so we wouldn't be applying the cap to individuals.",

        "The way you make sure it's actually making a difference, it turns out that for most of the greenhouse gas emissions, which is carbon dioxide, it's a no-brainer.",
        "How much gasoline you use, how much coal you use, how much natural gas you use immediately tells us how much CO2 gets into the atmosphere because we know the carbon content of those fuels.",
