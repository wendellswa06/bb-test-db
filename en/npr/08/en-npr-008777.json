        "Well, I would agree that a decentralized system might be good for us to have, but absent a federal policy on climate, we're not going to get the kind of cuts in emissions we need to have.",

        "So the question is how best can you get those technologies developed and implemented?",
        "One approach is like the Manhattan Project approach.",

        "There are a lot of problems with that.",
        "I don't know that anybody is smart enough to know which technology is going to be the best technology, and I wonder if everybody thinks that the folks in Washington had a big pot of money they would spend it in a rational way.",
        "Another way to do it is to let the marketplace figure out the best technologies.",
        "The amount of money in the marketplace is so much larger than the government has.",
        "If you do a cap-and-trade system, what happens is the marketplace is energized to develop those technologies because there's a profit to be made by making those technologies work.",

        "Can we have enough credits possible in the whole country to overcome the amount of pollution that they're going to be putting in to the air?",

        "In the final analysis, the United States is the larger emitter of greenhouse gases and historically the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from us is much larger than anybody else.",
        "So I think it's somewhat disingenuous of us to say we need to do something about this but we're not going to do anything until you guys do something.",

        "Well, it's a great idea.",
        "And the fact is in a cap-and-trade system everybody has the opportunity to figure out a clever way to lower their emissions, going beyond what they have - normally have to do, and they can try to sell it.",
        "So if you guys - suppose a whole bunch of you can figure out some clever way to lower emissions; you can bundle all of that as a credit and go to a power company and say - if you can validate that it actually exists and register that as an offset...",
        "But that's where - well, that's where the federal government could step in and say if you drive, if you buy - you know, they already give you a credit for let's say a hybrid car; they say if you drive that X number of miles, you've eliminated X number of tons of emissions.",
        "Well, without getting into the specifics..."
