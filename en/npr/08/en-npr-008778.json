        "Hi.",
        "My question was: Is there any significant opposition to the cap-and-trade system?",
        "Well, I don't want to tell you about that, but I think that there's some folks who favor a - what we call a carbon tax.",
        "That you would simply place a tax on emissions rather than cap emissions and allow for trading.",
        "And my feeling about a tax is there are varieties of disadvantages, one of them being it's a political non-starter in Washington.",
        "But the problem with the tax is it doesn't guarantee what the emissions will be.",
        "There's no environmental certainty.",
        "And given the seriousness of the climate problem, I think the number one thing we need to know is that emissions are going to go down the amount we need to have them go down, so I would not favor tax for a variety of reasons, including that reason.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you for taking my question.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Let's stay in California and this time go to San Jose.",

        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "My question is related to net metering through PG&E.",
        "I'm a photovoltaic generator.",
        "I have solar cells on my property and I generated about three times what I use in order to offset my carbon from car driving.",
        "And - but at the same time I get no benefit directly from PG&E for that.",
        "Basically they take the electricity and basically get the offsets without any value.",
        "If you want to drive - if this were to be driven down to the individual basis and there was a value in generating excess what you use on your own property, it would be a huge windfall for the California - in California the legislature doesn't allow PG&E or doesn't require PG&E to pay in excess if they receive free electricity from generators.",
        "So if you were to reverse that, the state of California could very quickly be -have all the offsets you could imagine from individual generators, the small photovoltaic generators that generated - that could be generating in excess.",
        "Additionally, that would significantly improve the financial recovery rate or return rate on photovoltaic, bringing down the effective cost of photovoltaics for the individual generator, for a - even for a business generator, commercial generator.",
        "So what you're saying is basically when you send electricity back to the grid, you're not getting paid for it."

        "There's no benefit.",
        "No, you're getting a benefit because you're paying less for your electricity.",
        "I think that the way you established that, it depends on -ultimately for an offset to work, someone has to own the credit and the regulatory system has to decide that.",

        "There are some advantages to having the individual own the credit.",
        "And that's something that can be discussed.",

        "And also, if you look at the science behind it, actually this, our contribution in CO2 is miniscule compared to the volcanoes, animal metabolism, rotting plants and the amount that's released from the ocean when it's warmed by the sun.",

        "The science on this stuff has been established long, long time ago.",
        "Let me take the second one first.",
        "There are natural sources of carbon dioxide and there are human sources of carbon dioxide like burning fossil fuels.",
        "Carbon dioxide has increased by about 35 percent over the last 100-plus years.",
        "And the question is, where does that extra carbon dioxide come from?",
        "And we have a signature for that carbon dioxide which relates to carbon isotopes.",
        "It's like a fingerprint.",
        "And it tells us to a scientific certainty that extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has come from burning fossil fuels primarily.",
        "So it doesn't come from volcanoes.",
        "It doesn't come from the ocean.",
        "There are natural cycles that are turning carbon dioxide over in the atmosphere but they're not changing the concentration."

        "The question is, where is the increase coming from, and the increase, which is what we care about, which is causing global warming, is coming from burning fossil fuels from human activities.",
        "Now the other question has to do with water vapor.",
        "Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.",
        "The concentration of water vapor is determined by the temperature.",
        "The warmer the temperature, the more water vapor there is in the atmosphere.",
        "Emissions of water vapor from human activities has no impact whatsoever on water vapor concentrations, but there is a perverse cycle in the atmosphere.",
        "We put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.",
        "It warms the atmosphere.",
        "We have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which warms the atmosphere even more, which leads to more water vapor and more warming.",
        "The only way we can control that process is to lower or eliminate out CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning, for example.",
        "So the fact that water vapor is an important greenhouse gas does not change the fact that our emissions of carbon dioxide are causing the warming.",
        "Okay, Mason, thanks for calling.",
        "But what about the impact of the sun, which to me is - I don't see how we can take that out of the equation, which seems to be dropped out of this equation, and it's a very complicated, but it's the magnetism - if you watch sun spots and correlate that with - it correlates much better with...",
        "Let me - what's your name again?",
        "Mason.",
        "Mason, good point.",
        "Let me just say that we as scientists have been working on this problem for decades, and we have used observations to sort of try to understand and eliminate every possible cause of this warming besides greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "In the case of the sun, for example, very likely, changes in the sun or changes in sun spots have caused the climate to change.",
        "We have monitored, for example, the solar output for the last 20-plus years from satellites.",
        "The solar output simply has not changed, net change, over the last 20 years.",
        "It does not - it could not have caused the warming."
