        "I don't think I necessarily had to say it.",

        "DIAZ: Yes.",
        "Yes - the sneaky way I did it without including any kind of notes and the Valentine's Day card and…",
        "So, it was the way that you did it that you're especially remorseful, but as for the fact of doing it, releasing the names of the detainees at Guantanamo, is it something in hindsight that you are proud that you did or that you're ashamed that you did?",
        "How would you describe your attitude toward it?",
        "Lt.",
        "Cmdr.",
        "DIAZ: I can live with myself.",
        "I mean, obviously, I didn't know that about a year later they were going to release the majority of the names to the public.",
        "So, I lived comfortably with myself with making that decision based on the facts as they were at that time.",
        "And you have regrets.",
        "Primarily, the impact that it's had on my family — my wife and my daughter — the loss of income, obviously, the stigma attached with the felony level conviction.",
        "Yes.",
        "When you say you live comfortably, you mean you live ethically, morally comfortably with what you did.",
        "Life, I gather, has been not so comfortable for you after getting out.",
        "Lt.",
        "Cmdr.",
        "DIAZ: No. No. Not having a law license - it's suspended right now, so I'm not able to practice in the civilian sector as a lawyer.",
        "So, yeah, it's been difficult to find a meaningful employment, particularly with a conviction on my record.",
        "Now, there's one aspect to your story that I want to ask you about, and I can't quite figure out if it's completely irrelevant and coincidental to the story of what happened at Guantanamo, or if it has to do with the way you've come to see justice and life and unfairness.",
        "And that's the story of your father.",
        "You have a father in death row in California.",
        "And I gather you feel that he has been convicted for lack of an ardent defense on his path.",
        "Lt.",
        "Cmdr.",
        "DIAZ: Yes.",
        "It just was not a fair process.",
        "Probably, since it is part of my life, a background of my life, I mean, it probably helped form the compass of my morality or the core of my morality and - but I wouldn't say that that's factored in specifically in my decision to do what I did at Guantanamo.",
        "That experience, along with many others in my life, instills a sense of justice or what would be injustice."

        "Well, the engines themselves currently are slung underneath the wings.",
        "So when the air is exiting the rear of the engine, you not only hear the direct sound from the engines but you actually hear the reflection of the noise from the bottoms of the wings.",
        "So the engineers here decided that we would place the engines above the airframe so that whatever noise was created wouldn't be propagated down to the grumble would actually shielded by the airframe and would be reflected up into the sky, where it wouldn't annoy any people.",
        "And one of the very stark designs, you look at the plane and you say I know there's something different about this but I can't put my finger on it.",
        "And you finally look at it, you say there's no tail on this plane.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yes.",
        "That's intentional, but the reason being is having a tail there is another surface that generates noise.",
        "But the removal of the tail increases the fuel-efficiency and it also actually makes the aircraft quieter because it's not there to create noise."

        "Right.",
        "So you - so that's the - this will be the Prius side of this, the airplane is much more fuel-efficient.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "We estimate that the fuel-efficiency would be comparable to a Toyota Prius with two passengers in it.",
        "And that it would also be about 25 percent better can current aircraft.",

        "Today's jets typically get up to a hundred.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Twenty-five percent more, yes.",
        "Tell us about the make up of this plane.",
        "Is it a metal skin or is it the composites we see on fighter planes now?",
        "It would have to - due to its unique shape, the aircraft would have to be constructed of composites entirely.",
        "The metal shape cannot handle the stresses that would be induced because, well, aircraft today have circular bodies.",
        "And a circle is very good at dealing with stress.",
        "The silent aircraft here has an oval-shaped body, and as such you would have to use a technology such as are used in fighters today or actually in the Boeing 787.",
        "So it would be an all-composite structure."

        "And let's talk a bit about turbulence.",
        "We know that airplanes cause a lot of turbulence when the air flows rapidly over the wings.",
        "And that's sort of wasted energy, is it not?",
        "Well, yes, it is.",
        "It's necessary, though, to have an aircraft flying in the air.",
        "So this plane reduces turbulence?",
        "Well, what we've done is - since there's no tail, there's no turbulence being created there.",
        "And any surface that's moving through the air, as you rightly pointed out, turbulence is shed off of it.",
        "So every surface that comes off, such as the landing gear, has been streamlined to minimize the amount of turbulence that's created.",
        "But going beyond this, the airframe itself as a sleek shape was chosen because the entire body creates lift.",
        "And since the entire aircraft is creating lift, it can actually fly slower during approach and takeoff and noise scales with the velocity to a high-power of five or six.",
        "And if you're able to fly slower, you're actually creating less noise.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Now without a tail, I know the tail is used to point the nose of the plane in the right direction.",
        "How do you do that without a tail?",
        "Oh, you've nailed the biggest problem in designing an all-lifting body like this.",
        "You know, at conventional aircraft, the tail is used, you know, to make sure that the nose is pointing in the right direction and to balance all the forces that are acting on an aircraft in flight.",
        "You remove the tail and all of a sudden the air flows themselves have to generate not only the lift to keep the aircraft up in the air but you have to generate it in such a way that the forces are balanced such that, you know, you have enough force in front of the center of gravity is behind.",
        "It's - you have to make sure that the two sides of your teeter-tooter are balanced.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A major challenge in this aircraft design."
