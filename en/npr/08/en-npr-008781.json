        "And how did you solve it?",
        "The way it was solved is we came up with a unique airfoil design for the center where the lift is generated right under where the pilot is sitting.",
        "There's a lot of lift generated there, and that balances the lift being created by the wings.",
        "And that's a revolutionary idea in this type of airframe.",
        "Is there anything like it now that is flying that you may have borrowed some design elements from?",
        "Well, there's a couple of aircraft out there flying.",
        "Aircraft is a bit of loose word here.",
        "One, there's a lot of technology that's been evolved, and there's the stealth bomber that's flying.",
        "And you can see a lot of similarities there; both of them lack a tail.",
        "But what would be surprising is there's another thing that flies out there called an owl that we're using technologies from.",
        "An owl, when it's approaching it's prey, actually creates no noise at the frequencies that the mouse would hear.",
        "So it's making no noise that the mouse would know.",
        "So we've incorporated brushes on to the trailing edge of the wings to reduce the noise that the wings create the same way an owl does.",
        "Little brushes like the feathers on the edge of the owl wing?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well, the way it reduces the noise, as you pointed out a few times rightly, is the noise is created by the turbulence coming off of the surfaces as they leave the end of the surface.",
        "And if you put brushes there, or on the owl feathers, you help, you know, break up the turbulence in a less extreme way such that it's broken up more slowly and it creates less noise.",
        "Wow.",
        "A lot of the noise we hear from plane, of course jet planes, come from the exhaust, you know.",
        "How do you dampen down the exhaust on your plane, or at least the noise from it?",
        "Well, that's another key feature, is the airframe uses a distributed propulsion system where instead of every jet turbine driving one fan, such as is done on today's aircraft, the three jet turbines drive nine fans such that we're able to lower, or expect to lower, the velocity of the air coming out of the jets while maintaining the same thrust.",
        "You need a certain amount of thrust to propel the aircraft.",
        "But by lowering the velocity of the air coming out of the engines, you've greatly decreased the noise"

        "As we know, force equals mass times acceleration.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So if you have, you know, the same amount of mass, you can distribute the mass around instead of in one spot.",
        "That's right.",
        "And you don't need as much acceleration in one spot is what you're saying.",
        "It's a little bit more than that, but yeah, essentially.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So how soon are we going to see this plane flying, or not hear it flying?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, there's quite a few steps that would be needed to - there's a lot of challenges that need to be overcome before that could be taken - to have an aircraft be flying.",
        "We assume technologies about 2030, but there's a lot of assumptions that went in our conceptual design here.",
        "We've assumed that you could, one, make a structure such as this out of composites and you could actually manufacture on a large scale.",
        "This isn't a guarantee and it's something that has to be further researched.",
        "Also, the propulsion system is very, very advanced, and quite a bit of research is needed there as well because the engines are actually ingesting the air that develops over the entire body, and that's a difficult challenge for an aircraft engine.",
        "So right now it's only flying on a computer?"

        "Yeah.",
        "Do the engines even exist that you would need to put on this plane, or do you have to design whole new engines for this?",
        "No, the engines use much-existing technology.",
        "And one of the key challenges is designing a fan that could ingest the flow over the center body and then also making a transmission system that could have one turbine driving three fans.",
        "But work is ongoing right now in these fields for projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.",
        "So you're going to use fighter technology on this?",
        "Yeah.",
        "A lot of times that's what happens.",
        "We're using composite technology from the military, and that's often what happens.",
        "The military develops a technology that finds its way into the commercial realm.",
        "Yeah, so you don't really need any breakthroughs to make this plane, you just need to adapt what's already out there.",
        "The breakthroughs - most of the things here are existing, it's just a matter of you have to go through and do a lot of research to make sure it's possible.",
        "There's a lot of challenges between now and then.",
        "Now this is a joint engineering team from Cambridge and MIT.",
        "Are the airplane makers involved in this at all or are they watching it carefully?"
