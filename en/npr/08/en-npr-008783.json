        "Sure.",
        "I have more of a question, really.",
        "My husband and his little sister both grew up in very abusive households, and this kind of ties into what Queen Latifah was saying before the break about parenting.",
        "They both grew up in not very good households, with a lot of abuse and drugs and things like that.",
        "And my husband has overcome this upbringing, and his sister hasn't.",
        "She continues to be a drug user, even though she's been in and out of rehab programs, and just gets tied up in very bad relationships that are abusive and uses sex as a way to help her self-esteem.",
        "Why is there such difference for my husband, who's a man, and for her, who's a woman, to overcome this?",
        "Why is her self-esteem, why hasn't she found, I don't know, the answer or some kind of a life-changing moment for her?",
        "Well, I'm definitely not an expert.",
        "So I can't speak to what it is exactly that, you know, has kept her in that same, that space.",
        "But I know you know, one of the things that people go through when they're abused is the guilt of it.",
        "For some reason, you feel like you're a part of it, like you contributed to it, like you allowed it to happen.",
        "And, you know, I had to go to therapy just to understand it because I was I mean, I was five years old when it happened to me.",
        "But, you know, what my therapist said to me was, okay, you're a grown woman now.",
        "If there was a five-year-old kid here, could they do anything to hurt you?",
        "No. Could they do anything to harm you?",
        "Could you push them around?",
        "Could you do anything to this little kid?",

        "And I think that's partly because of what happened to me as a child.",
        "But, I mean, honestly, you know, then when you involve drugs and, you know, substance abuse with it, that becomes a whole different thing.",
        "And sometimes people just want to numb themselves from the emotions that they feel.",
        "And women, we're very sensitive, you know.",
        "So maybe she's continuing to try to numb herself from all the things she's feeling inside, but the truth is, once she faces that and deals with a lot of those feelings and emotions and lets it frees herself from that, maybe it will be a lot easier for her to make that change.",
        "But it's something that you have to face, and it's an individual's choice.",
        "And, you know, all those things sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, all that I mean, that's just covering for feelings that are underneath that she has to deal with, that she has to face, that she has to learn how to handle those emotions.",
        "And it's a challenge.",
        "And I really hope and pray that she is able to make that breakthrough and you guys are able to be able to support each other.",
        "Her brother knows what she's been through.",
        "So hopefully, they can continue to be, you know, connected in some sort of way that allows her to just have an honest conversation with someone about what she's feeling.",
        "So I don't know, but I wish you the best.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Do you recommend that - I mean, I just don't know what the best thing for us to do for her but just continue to support her and show empathy?",
        "I think yeah, I think you have to support her, be empathetic.",
        "You don't have to enable her, you know, but I think, you know, as long as she knows somebody's there, it will be helpful because you never know what she's going through out there in the world she's dealing with."
