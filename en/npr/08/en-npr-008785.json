        "And yet a lot of women, young Muslim women today, are saying not necessarily that they want to wear the burqa - there are very, very few women who wear that in France, maybe 1,500 or 2,000 - but head scarves are a sign of religious identity and a sign of liberation, that they can wear whatever they want to wear, so that you've got this incredible conflict going on between people who are saying we're going to liberate these women from wearing what they supposedly are required to be wearing in their religion by doing something even worse, which is to say we're not going to allow women to wear what it is that they want to wear.",
