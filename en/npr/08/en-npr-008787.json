        "(Singing) Selfish, baby, tonight.",
        "This is something else, you know, (unintelligible).",
        "There is a huge amount of money being spent down here and the most spectacular kinds of science.",
        "And basically, scientists want to study what has happened to the Earth over the last several hundred thousand years in terms of climate change.",
        "This is the best place in the world to do it because it is the driest place on Earth.",
        "It's the coldest place on Earth.",
        "And so that means it's the cleanest place on Earth.",
        "You know, there's almost no pollution or even moisture that would interfere in the background of scientific experiments.",
        "So there are some heavy-hitter scientists down here with hundreds of million of dollars worth of telescopes and, you know, all kinds of high-tech equipment who are trying to figure out how the universe was born and where the Earth might end up.",
        "That was NPR's Daniel Zwerdling at the South Pole, reporting for NPR's Climate Connection series.",
        "His reports on that series will be airing on NPR throughout the month of March.",
        "North Korea said today it will rejoin six-nation nuclear arms talks later this month.",
        "The declaration was reported by North Korea's official news agency and confirmed by an American official traveling with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who's just arrived in China.",
        "The meeting is scheduled for the week of July 25th, and if it goes ahead, it will be the first since last summer.",
        "NPR's Rob Gifford joins me from Beijing.",
        "Hi, Rob.",
        "Hi, Jennifer.",
        "This announcement seems something of a surprise.",
        "How'd it come about?",
        "There were talks today that were previously unannounced between the vice minister of foreign affairs of North Korea and the US point man on North Korea who is Christopher Hill.",
        "He's the former US ambassador to South Korea.",
        "KCNA, the North Korean news agency, has just come out with a statement, as you say, confirmed by the US side that these talks are to go ahead.",
        "There has been a lot of diplomacy back and forth over the last few weeks, so in that sense, I guess it's not such a surprise, but these talks today were unannounced.",
        "We didn't know they were going on beforehand, although they do coincide with the arrival today of Condoleezza Rice in Beijing.",
        "Well, North Korean officials had earlier suggested they might re-enter these talks if the United States showed respect toward North Korea.",
        "So do we have any reason to believe that the US has done that?",
        "Well, yes, the important thing is, I suppose, that North Korea believes that the US side has done that.",
        "The sticking point here was rather an interesting one.",
        "It was Condoleezza Rice actually saying several months ago that North Korea was an outpost of tyranny, and the North Koreans got very upset about this and they put this down as one of their conditions for rejoining the talks, that Secretary of State Rice actually withdraw that statement.",
        "In the North Korean statement today, they said that the US side had said that it sees North Korea as a sovereign state and had reaffirmed the fact that the US would not invade North Korea, and the statement said that they are taking from that that the secretary of State had, indeed, withdrawn her statement that North Korea's an outpost of tyranny.",
        "A bit of a stretch actually if you think about it logically, but that's what the statement said."

        "So some delicate, delicate diplomacy here.",
        "I mean, if these things start getting clarified too much, is there a chance it could all fall apart before it starts?",
        "Well, that is, of course, the danger.",
        "It is all very delicate.",
        "The problem is that not only, of course, are the US and the North Korean sides very far apart, even though they've agreed to talks, but within the other six parties, there are some differences as well.",
        "The South Koreans specifically are very much into engaging North Korea in a way that the US government does not particularly like from one of its major allies in northeast Asia.",
        "The Chinese have big differences with the United States.",
        "The Chinese feel very, very strongly they don't want to do anything that could bring about any kind of regime change or collapse of North Korea, so there are definitely many, many problems there to overcome.",

        "A.",
        "MARTINEZ: Well, that's what Donald Sterling wants to do, and his wife as well.",
        "But the NBA also has just come out and said that they are going to proceed with a vote to force the sale of the Clippers, pretty much telling Donald Sterling that he does not control the process, and that they will control the process from here on out.",
        "I think they wanted, maybe, to pick their owner and pick their price, but the NBA has decided to take back control of the situation.",
        "Now we can focus on the game, nothing big, just the playoffs.",
        "Oh, the game.",

        "San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City facing off in the Western Conference Finals, Indiana Pacers are up against, who else, the Miami Heat in the East.",
        "Who do you want to see match up in the finals?",
        "The Heat and the Spurs.",
        "This would be the two most dominate teams in the last few years, not just of this past season.",
        "And for Miami, it would be a chance for them to go back to back to back which hasn't happened since the Chicago Bulls did it with Michael Jordan way, way back, and that had seemed so long ago, the late '90s."

        "No.",
