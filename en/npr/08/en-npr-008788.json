        "But, you know, so much of this is cultural, too.",
        "We keep going back to culture because it's hard in the case of modesty and dress to separate culture from religion.",
        "And, I mean, if you go to a beach on the south of France or anywhere in Europe, you'll see the women in tiny, tiny little bikini bottoms and no tops.",
        "And I can't tell you what it was like the first time I went to a beach there with my husband and my son, who was about 15 or 14 years old.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "They couldn't believe what was going on.",
        "And the French men didn't even pay any attention.",
        "I mean, they did not turn into lust-crazed animals, attacking the other women on the beach.",
        "They could have cared less.",
        "I mean, they were so nonchalant about it because it was so accepted and so part of the culture."

        "As part of our faith expression, my family wears plain clothing, along the lines of traditional Friends, the Amish, Mennonites and other peace churches.",
        "Tradition and scripture plays a role in our community's decision to return to plain dress, but as your guest just remarked, it is mostly a nod to the necessity of humility before God and to present ourselves before others as servants of God.",
        "Our plain-dressed community is entirely voluntary, and there is no prescribed clothing amongst Quakers at the present that I am aware of.",

        "In Corinthians, it talks about the women, you know, cannot shorn her hair, which is if you translate over to modern terminology, it means to cut it.",
        "And also, there's also a scripture, something that I heard you guys talking about, about when the Roman Catholic churches and other Christian churches, it was unacceptable for men to wear head garments but acceptable for women.",

        "And for me, it's a personal relationship with God.",

        "It was a form of respect, like a little gift for him, to know no man could see those beautiful locks except for him.",
        "After he passed away, she cut all her hair off as a sign of respect for him, as well.",
        "And it just made me wonder, Tabitha, if you don't cut your hair, do you keep it up in a bun?",
        "Not always.",
        "Actually, I like to wear it down, but I do wear it up a lot out of convenience.",
        "Okay.",
        "You know what I think is so interesting and valuable about conversations like this is that it lets other people know exactly what people are doing and why they're doing it.",
        "And I think if you listen to any of the people who have spoken on this show and called in and talked about what they wear and why they wear it and why they believe it, it doesn't sound crazy.",
        "You know, it sounds like everyone who has spoken has been talking about his or her own respect for herself and her beliefs and the way that she wants to demonstrate her faith.",
        "And I just think that it's so important for people to understand everyone's faith and everyone's - and to respect other people's faith, as long as people are not forced into wearing certain kinds of clothes or not wearing certain kinds.",
        "And, you know, you look at, for instance, nudists.",
        "A lot of nudist colonies believe that God created our bodies, that God created us in his own image and our bodies are beautiful and therefore are meant to be shown."
