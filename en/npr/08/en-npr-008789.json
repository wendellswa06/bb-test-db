        "Pure Fashion is a program for teen girls ages 14 to 18 that encourages them to live virtuous lives, including the virtue of modesty, which we feel like is often forgotten nowadays.",
        "But the program was developed in 2005, and it was basically the answer to a common question amongst many mothers who were saying: Isn't there something better that we could show our daughters than what we're seeing at the malls?",
        "And can't we show them that they can dress trendy and -that's still tasteful, that they can be pretty without looking provocative?",
        "And the program was developed to help the high school girls to feel confident about who they are, and that then they present themselves in the way that doesn't expose their body parts to get attention, and that they understand that what they wear does send a message, and that they want to be aware of that message.",
        "And it's not just actually what they wear, but it's everything from how they speak, how they present themselves, their body language, what they're saying, even the music they listen to and when they communicate with their friends.",
        "We just want to encourage purity of heart, mind and body.",
        "Do you also encourage young men the same age to do the same thing?",
        "Oh, absolutely, because the message is not just for teen girls.",
        "In the program, we work directly with the teen girls, but the message is actually for the whole family.",

        "You just have to be a little bit more creative.",
        "You have to buy tank tops that you can wear under low-plunging necklines.",
        "You might not - you might walked by that rack of micro-mini skirts and short shorts, but next to it is typically a more moderate-length short, or you can get a skirt that's a little bit longer.",

        "So I don't really believe it when girls say that they can't find anything.",
