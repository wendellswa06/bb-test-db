        "This is old-school.",
        "But there are plenty of instances where the cable goes out, the electricity goes out, and the phone network is there.",
        "That's because traditional phone lines have their own electricity and even battery power.",
        "And then, there's audio quality.",
        "On Internet phones, your conversation competes for bandwidth with your neighbor's Netflix and funny things can happen.",
        "Just listen to these dropouts while Frieden was talking to me.",
        "The phone companies want other technologies so maybe they've already started the process of being a little less vigilant in terms of maintaining the infrastructure.",
        "The Internet-based phone in his campus office just wasn't playing nice with my Google voice, also on the Internet.",
        "The fact is, Internet phone service just isn't regulated the same way traditional phones are.",
        "Just having rules around because they were how we did it back in a very different world doesn't make much sense.",
        "That's John Stephenson.",
        "He's with ALEC, that's the American Legislative Exchange Council.",
        "It fights for a smaller government and it's encouraged states to exempt Internet phone service from the traditional phone regulations.",
        "He says fewer rules will mean more investment in the new-fangled stuff.",
        "We feel, based on our research and experience, that if we were to clear the underbrush, these rules written long before the Internet was even a word, there would be a lot more broadband deployed to the United States and things that are even better that we can't conceive of today.",
        "At the national level, AT&T wants FCC permission to start abandoning traditional phone circuitry altogether.",
        "Harold Feld is following this process for Public Knowledge, a nonprofit specializing in communications policy.",
        "He says he's all for new technologies.",
        "What we don't want to see, though, is a phone system that was the envy of the world goes away and it becomes a system that works well if you're in the right place and you can pay for it and works poorly if you're not."

        "What is that?",
        "Well, XKeyscore is part of an NSA program focused on foreign targets.",
        "And it reportedly allows analysts at the NSA to get at the contents of emails and other Web traffic, like social media exchanges or even Web searches.",
        "According to The Guardian, the program indexes large amounts of digital traffic and makes it searchable.",
        "So analysts can, say, enter an email address and a time period they're interested in and then read through the contents of the email inbox that they targeted.",
        "They could also use other search terms or enter, say, an IP address and then see the specific websites a person of interest was visiting.",
        "So as General Alexander was addressing this crowd of security professionals and hackers, did he address this?",
        "Well, not directly.",
        "The NSA released a statement saying that allegations of unchecked analysts' access to NSA data are untrue.",
        "And General Alexander did talk about the foreign intelligence surveillance program that XKeyscore is part of.",
        "In his talk, he stressed that the program was overseen by the courts, that it's audited, that the number of people who are permitted to search these enormous data sets the NSA collects are tightly controlled.",
        "And at times, General Alexander expressed a lot of frustration about these leaks and the accusations that what his analysts could be up to might be illegal.",
        "Here he is.",
        "And we get all these allegations of what they could be doing, but when people check, like the intelligence committee, they found zero times that's happened.",
        "And that's no (bleep).",
        "Those are facts."

        "So, some tough talk there from General Alexander.",
        "How did the crowd actually respond to this?",
        "Well, you know, he got some applause for that line, but there were thousands of people in the audience and I'd say the reaction was varied.",
        "You know, he clearly wants some points for showing up and taking questions, but there's still a lot of distrust.",

        "They were probably 100 times bigger than the sun, more massive than the sun.",

        "And frankly, when we have performers steadfastly insist they're really just well rested, that's a problem too.",
        "It perpetuates the fiction that a radically different look is A - desirable and B - achievable by means of healthy living and not outside intervention.",

        "Right.",
        "We got a good rundown of the events from State Police Superintendent Timothy Alben a little while ago.",
        "He said about 10:30 last night, there was a robbery at a 7-Eleven, and then just a short time later, an MIT police officer was shot on the campus.",

        "They went into a residential neighborhood.",

        "And some time during the course of that pursuit, that's when several explosive devices were discharged from the car and, I guess, thrown or somehow directed at police officers.",
        "In that exchange of the gunfire, one suspect, police believe, was struck, and that suspect was - they're just saying - taken into custody.",
        "A second suspect fled and that active search is underway right now."
