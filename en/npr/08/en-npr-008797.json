        "Well, they used this base 20 counting system then and created a calendar that reflects astronomical patterns, some of the things that Dr. Grunsfeld has seen in outer space but based upon Venus, based upon the movement of the sun from equinox - which, by the way, today is the equinox - and to the southern end and then back again.",
        "So, actually, it was their zenith passage.",
        "But based on all these patterns, then they used their number system, they used their astronomy, they used their power of observation to build a system by which they could tell time.",
        "And that that time never begins.",
        "It never ends.",
        "It is cycles of time.",
        "It is not the end of time.",
        "Aha.",

        "There's a stela, which is a limestone pillar that is hand-carved, and they would mark on these certain events and certain numbers.",
        "There is one in Machinoc(ph), in Macanxoc in Coba, which I think is in Guatemala.",
        "It goes to an octillion years, 41 octillion years."

        "And when I was an undergraduate, I was fascinated by the field of archeoastronomy, studying what ancient people knew about astronomy, and it's in part because I believe that as long as humans have had consciousness - and I know last week you were talking about an, you know, early humanoid - you know, did those humanoids look up at the sky and wonder, you know, what's the extent of the universe?",
        "Does it begin?",
        "Does it end?",
        "And the things they have observed were very important to them for the counting of time, for crop timing.",

        "I mean, would you say most of these things we find that are left over are in some way connected to time or keeping track of time or direction or destiny, something like that?",
        "What I can share with you, Ira, is that every culture that has seriously been looked at by archeologists, folks that have a background in archeoastronomy or now what is called cultural astronomy, in every culture that we've looked, we have found evidence that humans have been watching the movement of the skies since the beginnings of civilization.",
        "But just in the last - well, it's a dwarf planet.",
        "But just in the last - according to some, not here in Flagstaff.",
        "One of the things that I think is very fascinating - and this comes from Dr. Tony Aveni at Colgate University - is that Alexander the Great was going to attack Egypt.",
        "However, his astronomers came to him and said, hey, wait a minute.",
        "Mars is in the wrong place.",
        "You can't attack now.",
        "And based upon their observation of the movement of the planets and based upon their interpretation of that information, Alexander the Great decided not to attack Egypt, but instead went to India.",
        "And he took advice from...",
        "He took advice from scientists."
