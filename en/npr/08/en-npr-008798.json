        "What do I do in order to celebrate the length of days and how it changes?",
        "For example, the Hopi are now beginning - as of today, they've begun their Mamrawt(ph) ceremony, which is actually a woman's ceremony.",
        "But if you go to the textbooks, if you go to the library, you will never find it there because all the ethnographers were males, and how many women are going to tell males from Chicago - how many Hopi women will tell males from Chicago about their rites of puberty rites and their transitions from girlhood into womanhood?",
        "And yet, that's what the Hopis are celebrating during this next week.",
        "Very interesting.",

        "Ira, my friend just want to CERN and took a tour yesterday, and he knew I was coming here so he asked me to ask you a question, but I think it's better directed at John, given what you said about your third space trip.",
        "Firstly, given the evidence that came out yesterday that seems to say there's something that does travel faster than the speed of light, is - what is your opinion of, perhaps, Einstein's theory, how has that shifted?",
        "But my friend asked me to say...",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...what should he have asked on the tour at CERN that he didn't ask?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "You know, John, you want to comment on that - that first bit of data that's in?",
        "Well, the, you know, any time there's something that radically challenges a theory that has been supported for many years by many different types of evidence, you know, you have to be a little bit skeptical.",
        "I think, you know, the more remarkable thing is that we have tested Einstein's theory of gravity over scales from, you know, the very small, the micro, and in environments, you know, tiny, little experiments with tiny, little masses, to the whole scale of the universe, and we see things that are unusual.",
        "And, you know, when you look at our understanding of the universe in general, either from particle experiments, smashing atoms together to replicate the conditions of the Big Bang, or look at the expansion of the universe, you know, we get very satisfied that we're understanding everything.",
        "But lest we get too comfortable, let me point out that just in the last 10 or so years, when we've added up all of our understanding, we still have dark energy, dark matter, details of gravity that we don't understand.",
        "And it turns out, when you add all that up, you know, in a pie chart or something like that, it adds up to about 96 percent of everything in the universe.",
        "So we still really only understand a very little bit, so I'm sure there's lots of surprises out there."

        "That's why I'm going to let John answer it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Well, I think it's a great question that overlaps both of our disciplines up here because, you know, people have always wondered about that and they've drawn petroglyphs about it and - or at least we think so, and talked about it, and it's a very personal question.",
        "Again, it's a scientific question.",
        "You know, has anybody ever, you know, landed in a large spaceship in a populated area, walked out, you know, other than the movies and said, you know, I'm from, you know, some distant star system, and no, they haven't.",
        "And so we have to, you know, kind of use our own imagination.",
        "If you look at our universe of 20 years ago or so, we knew about nine planets in the whole universe.",
        "That's it.",

        "At least more than half of the audience.",
        "Did you want to sum up, Bryan?",
        "Very quickly.",
        "I was teaching chemistry at Coconino Community College this morning, and we're going through the periodic table, which, of course, is the repeating patterns of the elements.",
        "If we go from the assumption - and, of course, CERN now is challenging our assumptions, which is what science is all about - if we look at the nature of matter, if that's consistent throughout the universe, then what would prevent those molecules from forming into other living creatures?",
        "They may not be in our structure.",
        "They may not have the life history that we've had on this planet.",
        "Maybe they have something very different, but it's beyond my comprehension to have such an incredible universe and only have one planet that has life on it.",
        "So let me add one last thing, which is the young lady actually wants to know that answer to that question presumably; how will we answer it?",
        "Other than somebody coming and visiting us, which is relatively unlikely.",
        "And the answer is astronomy.",
        "We're actually on the verge of being able to characterize a planet around a nearby star such that we could detect life.",
        "And the next step is going to be with the James Webb Space Telescope.",
        "It will be able to observe the atmospheres of planets around nearby stars - this is launching in 2018 - and determine whether there's liquid oceans and ozone in the atmosphere, which is a sign of oxygen, CO2, methane, an organic molecule.",
        "So we'll be able to characterize it probably not enough to tell if anybody is at home, but I think the next generation of telescope beyond James Webb Space Telescope would have the capability to actually see if anybody is home."

        "Now this new star has very little of especially iron and carbon, and so we then believe that the star must have formed very early on in the universe, and it's one of those stars that has one of the very least amounts of iron and carbon that we know of.",

        "And while we know that these stars exist, and certainly the new one exists, and there is some little quibble now with one theory, but there are several other theories that are not touched by the discovery of this star.",

        "So they're all kind of from similar generations, they're all from a similar family, and - but they all look a little bit different, and they all tell us something new about how star formation actually might have proceeded.",
