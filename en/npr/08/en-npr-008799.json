        "The dust grains get made, and they get spilled out into the interstellar medium, and they act as cooling agents there, as well.",
        "And so according to that theory, this new star should well exist, even though there is now, you know, a little challenge to this idea that carbon and oxygen atoms are the major cooling channels, the major cooling mechanism, to form these low-mass stars in the early universe.",

        "You know, we - everyone has lots of ideas on how it happened, and that's great because we want to find out.",
