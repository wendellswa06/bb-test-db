        "So it really helps to find something that, you know, looks yet a little bit different because it sparks a lot of new ideas, and hence we can fill in the puzzle of the universe.",
        "If we have in biology biodiversity, what would we call star diversity?",
        "It's definitely chemical diversity...",
        "Yeah, chemical diversity.",
        "...because we are studying the chemical abundances in these stars because we believe they have been preserved in the outer layers of the stars since the time of their birth.",
        "As Carl Sagan used to call them, star stuff, we're all made of star stuff.",
        "Yes, we are.",

        "Yes, as I said, all the elements have been made in stars and supernovae.",
        "And the clue with this new star, as well as the ones that I have previously found, is that they were right at the beginning of the stuff.",
        "So perhaps only one or two generations of supernovae made the very first amounts of heavy elements, and then these little stars formed from the slightly enriched primordial material, and they're preserved exactly as chemical fingerprint in their surface and transported it with them until today."

        "OK, good question.",
        "Where - how close is it?",
        "Where is it?",
        "Can we see it?",
        "And how old is it?",
        "Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what the exact coordinates are right now, but it's a reasonably bright star.",
        "If you have a small amateur telescope, you can probably see it from your backyard, depending on where you live, you know, Northern or Southern Hemisphere.",

        "It is not too far away.",
        "I heard it's about 4,000 light years away.",

        "And...",
        "How - well, let me stop you there.",
        "Because, you know, if something is that old, near the beginning of the universe, how come it's so close, relatively speaking?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is the beauty of this work with these old stars.",
        "If I can just zoom out for a second again, the way we think that large galaxies like the Milky Way form is through a hierarchical assembly.",
        "Now, that sounds like a mouthful, but what it means is you start in the early universe with a small galaxy.",
        "And it - like a little kid, it wants to grow bigger, and it does so by eating up other, even smaller galaxies and gas and stars and whatever it can find.",
        "So it grows and grows and grows, and eats up all these smaller systems.",
        "And any of these old fossil stars that we're finding, based on their chemistry, we can tell that they're formed in the very early universe, probably in a small galaxy.",
        "And then that galaxy was likely eaten up by, you know, a bigger one.",
        "And so it got deposited into a new bigger one.",
        "And then perhaps, that one itself got eaten up, again, by yet another bigger one.",
        "And so it's slowly made its way, over cosmic timescales, into the Milky Way, into the outskirts of our galaxy where we see it today.",
