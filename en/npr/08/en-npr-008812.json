        "So to disentangle correlation from causation, Rachel, you usually have to conduct an experiment.",
        "In this case, that would be very hard.",
        "I mean, you can't say, I'm going to take 2,000 couples, force half of them to watch porn, while half of them don't and then measure which couples stay together.",
        "That would be unethical.",
        "So how have researchers addressed this problem, then?",
        "Well, Perry and his colleague Cyrus Schleifer used high-quality survey research that asked about 2,000 couples about their satisfaction with their relationships and also about their use of sexually explicit media.",
        "By surveying the same couples repeatedly over time, you can see which couples start to use porn, which couples stop and what happens to their relationships.",
        "We found that married Americans who began pornography were roughly twice as likely to be divorced.",
        "It's a difference of, say, 6 percent likelihood of divorce for people who never begin pornography use to about 11 percent to people who did begin pornography use between waves.",
        "So what happens?",
        "I mean, what does porn do in a relationship that leads people to grow distant?",
        "Well, it's not exactly clear what's happening, Rachel, because this study is only measuring what's happening in the aggregate.",
        "There's been a number of other studies that basically have suggested that porn can have a number of different effects.",
        "For example, it can create unrealistic portraits in people's minds about how sexual relationships are supposed to function.",
        "And that kind of scripting can affect relationships.",
        "It's also the case that porn can have a vicious cycle effect on relationships.",
        "In other words, when a relationship is going poorly, people might turn to porn.",
        "But turning to porn can now make the relationship go even worse.",
        "And you have a vicious cycle.",
        "Did researchers look into what happens when couples who have used pornography within the context of their relationship stopped doing that?",
        "That's right.",
        "So the study actually allows you to do that because it's measuring the same couples over time.",
        "And what it finds is that men and women seem to fare differently.",
        "This was a surprising part of the study.",
        "Women who stop using porn seem to have happier relationships.",
        "But we don't know exactly why.",
        "Stopping porn use didn't seem to make much of a difference for the men in the study.",
        "Are there any big implications to be drawn from this research?",
        "These are worst-case scenarios.",
        "But I think we had to take a hard look at what is happening to some of these twins and just be flexible."
