        "And what we see is a fairly tight shot of a representative speaking directly into a camera whose lens never moves.",
        "What we don't see is anything else - whether other members of the House are riveted by his remarks or reading newspapers or even whether they're there.",
        "The cameras are not controlled by C-SPAN.",
        "Under the original agreement with the House leaders, the speaker of the House is in charge of what viewers see or, equally important, what we don't see.",
        "Last week, C-SPAN's chairman and CEO, Brian Lamb, sent a letter to Nancy Pelosi, the incoming speaker of the House, appealing for the right to show reaction shots, to pan the chamber, to allow television viewers to see what any visitor to the House gallery can see.",
        "Brian Lamb joins us now from C-SPAN's headquarters here in Washington, D.C.",
        "And Brian Lamb, always nice to talk to you.",

        "BRIAN LAMB Chairman and CEO, C-SPAN): How are you, Neal?",
        "I'm well, thank you.",
        "I know you've tried this before with no luck.",
        "Do you expect a different outcome this time around?",
        "Have no expectations at all.",
        "All we're doing is following Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi's own words, in which she says the Democrats intend the most honest, most open, and most ethical Congress in history.",
        "We heard something of the same - not the exact words - when the Republicans came in in '95, and we didn't do very well then, so we thought we'd try again.",
        "And what is it exactly that you would like your viewers to be able to see?",
        "Well, the activities on the floor of the House and Senate are seen through cameras controlled and operated and owned by the House and the Senate.",
        "And in the House, for instance, the speaker has the power to tell the cameras which way to go, what to shoot, what to turn the cameras toward - and they have a lot of very strict rules, which means that you don't really see what actually happens on the floor if you're watching C-SPAN at home, when we are in the House of Representatives."

        "And a lot of the time, that's not a whole lot.",
        "I mean, during morning remarks, for example, there's hardly anybody there.",
        "There - and that's fine.",
        "I mean, everybody that - serious C-SPAN watchers know that.",
        "And it actually, I think, over last 28 years has made some people who watch cynical, thinking that they're trying to cover up what they know is happening and that there are not many people there.",
        "And I don't think if people had it all explained to them, and we try to explain to them, they'd be all that mad that they aren't there.",
        "There's a lot of business that's done that each individual wants to do, and there's no reason why 534 others ought to sit around and listen to it.",
        "And therefore, with an explanation, it kind of makes sense.",
        "Nevertheless, as you point out, without an explanation, it does sound like they're trying to cover up embarrassment.",
        "Well, the operative word in Washington - has been and always will be - control, and this is an example of where they take it a step beyond what's needed.",
        "I mean, our cameras, our C-SPAN-owned cameras, are in all the hearing rooms.",
        "We control the shots, we show the room in a way that we want to show it, rather than the way that Congress wants to show it.",
        "We've never had a problem, never a complaint, in the last 28 years.",
        "And so we're saying give us this chance to do the same thing in the House and Senate.",
        "At the moment, we're just asking for the House - and we'll go from there, if we get it - to the Senate.",
        "The idea being that we will show exactly what's happening without a great deal of embellishment, the same way we have in other venues around Washington for the last 28 years.",
        "We're talking with Brian Lamb, the CEO and chairman of C-SPAN News.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Brian Lamb, we mentioned that a lot of the time, there's not a lot going on the floor, but sometimes there is great drama on the floor of the House of Representatives, or for that matter, the United States Senate - when people are meeting in little conclaves, and the speaker or the majority leader is running around twisting arms.",
        "The last time we went through this, there were several meetings held, both with the Republicans and the Democrats, and at the time, the attitude on the part of the Democrats was not a whole lot different than the Republicans.",
        "There was a lot of talk in the beginning of our request, in 1994-95, that people were interested in it.",
        "But then the longer they talked and the more caucuses they had, people like Tom DeLay stepped up and said - we understand, we didn't, were in the room - but we were told he said: over my dead body will we allow those cameras in the House of Representatives."
