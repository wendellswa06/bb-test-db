        "It's way less expensive than buying organic fertilizers, and it's certainly better for the environment and for all the soil - the microorganisms and the organisms in the soil than using chemical fertilizers, which are mined, or they are petroleum-based, and they're also transported.",
        "So, homemade compost is the best thing that you can do to feed your soil, and that should take care of the plants.",
        "There are some people who compost with worms.",
        "Yes.",

        "You know, I haven't done that, but I do almost always have those little gray squash beetles.",
        "That's different."

        "Maybe that's the borer.",
        "Squash vine borers actually look kind of like a wasp, don't they, Roz?",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "And the best way to control, the best, easiest way to keep those at bay is to cover the plants with floating row covers until they're large enough and then until you have flowers, because if you keep them covered, the bees will never get in and cross pollinate and you'll never get any pumpkins.",
        "But keep them covered until they're strong, and that should help prevent them.",
        "Sounds like you might have a really good population of squash vine borers.",
