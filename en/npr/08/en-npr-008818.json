        "But I have to say, most people who've tried to grow Brandywine, which is the gold standard, are in a climate that isn't really very good for Brandywine.",
        "Brandywine wants it to be wonderfully humid and warm, and it comes from the Brandywine Valley of Delaware.",
        "And what happens when you take them to the mountains of Montana or you put it down in San Diego, you'd have dry air and you don't have it warm at night.",
        "It loves to be warm and cozy at night.",
        "You know those evenings you love to sit out?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so, to pollinate properly and to produce within, I think, it's 120 days, and to have them not crack and to be just divine, you really have to play with the climate.",
        "But when you want taste tests, those three help.",

        "It's a little cherry, a little yellow cherry.",
        "Another thought - thing I'd suggest to people is that they go to their farmers' market and try some of the heirloom tomatoes that are for sale there and make some notes.",
        "In our farmers' market, at least in the spring, the same people that sell tomatoes in the summer in the fall are selling plants.",
        "If it's a true heirloom tomato, can I just plant the seeds from that plant, that tomato that I buy at the farmers' market?",
        "No.",
        "No, because it hasn't necessarily been grown in isolation, so you're not sure that it will come true.",
        "That's a mistake a lot of people make, isn't it?",
        "They think that they can just plant the tomato seeds and that they're going to grow.",

        "Yes, although color combinations are pretty much - you know, if you love a combination, whatever you love is fine with me, but if - there are ways you can pick things that are all going to go together.",
        "I always depend on those things in the catalogs that show you, you know, you can buy this whole set of plants together.",
        "Well, I know myself.",
        "I'm kind of a plant in one hand, trowel in the other, wandering around the garden planter.",

        "There are lots of things you can do to - that you don't have to use this very expensive chemicals.",

        "I pulled off so many from my rose bush that was like liquid in my hands after awhile.",

        "But if you kill off all the aphids, they come and they go, oh, nothing being here, and they fly away, and now you've got the problem for the rest of the summer."
