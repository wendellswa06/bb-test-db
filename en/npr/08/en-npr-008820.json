        "Yeah, that's what the study found.",
        "You know, Rachel, the air in the United States has been getting cleaner and cleaner in recent decades as, you know, these modern air pollution standards have kicked in.",
        "But these Harvard researchers wanted to know, could it be even cleaner?",
        "And so they launched this massive study.",
        "And the answer they found was, yes, it definitely could be cleaner.",
        "And they found, in fact, that thousands of Americans are dying each year because of dirty air.",
        "And if we just cleaned up just a little bit, they estimate that it could save at least 12,000 lives a year.",
        "Wow, 12,000 people.",
        "Is there a specific demographic that's more vulnerable than others?",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "That's definitely one of the most interesting findings here.",
        "This study, you know, was huge.",
        "They analyzed data from more than 60 million Medicare patients between 2000 and 2012.",
        "And they combine that with satellite data and other measurements that could estimate pollution down to the level of individual zip codes.",
        "And what they found was that there clearly were some groups that were at greater risk and specifically, those tended to be poor people and African-Americans.",
        "They - blacks, for example, had three times the risk as the general population of having increased the rate of mortality because of air pollution.",
        "This - the study moved the editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine to write an editorial, I understand, that's accompanying the study today.",
        "What's it say?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So Jeffrey Drazen, he's the editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, and he says he thought the study was so important that he needed to personally help write an editorial that accompanied the study in the journal.",
        "And he says he's really worried about these - some of these Trump administration policies, you know, the EPA - that he wants to cut the Environmental Protection Agency.",
        "It wants to increase the use of coal, which is a really dirty form of energy.",
        "And it wants to relax air pollution standards.",
        "There's been some talk about revoking a waiver for California that would reduce tailpipe emissions.",
        "And they're also concerned about the administration sort of pulling back and walking away from efforts to fight global warming because all of these things could increase the air pollution in the air, make the air dirtier that we breathe instead of cleaner.",

        "On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are 39.",
        "Three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn, having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.",
        "And with that, one of the most anticipated procedural votes of the year, in fact, in many years, went into the history books.",
        "Technically, all it did was formally begin the Senate's health care debate, a debate that by most estimates will stretch from now until Christmas.",
        "But for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, it was not just a vote of confidence for his leadership, but a huge boost for the health overhaul effort.",
        "The road ahead is a long stretch, but we can see the finish line.",
        "We have the momentum that's going to keep this process moving, I have no doubt.",
        "Most of the suspense leading up to the vote dissipated earlier in the day.",
        "That's when the last two undeclared Democrats, Louisiana's Mary Landrieu and Arkansas' Blanche Lincoln, announced they'd join all their colleagues, plus the Senate's two Independents to move the bill forward.",
        "Said Landrieu�",
        "After a thorough review of the bill, as I said over the last two and a half days, which included many lengthy discussions, I've decided that there are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward, but much more work needs to be done.",
        "But getting the bill to the floor for debate and getting it passed are two different mountains.",
        "In order to placate the liberals who make up the majority of this caucus, Reid embraced a so-called public option, a government-sponsored plan individuals could choose as one possibility in the new insurance marketplace for the uninsured and small businesses the measure also calls for.",
