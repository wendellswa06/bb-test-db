        "That's right.",
        "They only have really budget and really only - the space shuttle is really, really old and they want to get it out of service as quickly as possible.",
        "So they're going to make as many launches as they can between now and the end of the 2010, at which point they're going to just stop the program.",
        "So they're hoping there could be 16 or 17 launches.",
        "But, you know, if they have more delays the way we've seen the last couple of years, it could be substantially fewer than that."
