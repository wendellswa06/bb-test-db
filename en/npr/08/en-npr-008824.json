        "And some of the cameras are on the solid rocket boosters, and they're falling quite slowly.",
        "Those eventually land in the ocean, they fish them out, and so they won't have those images for a little bit.",
        "But some of the others they get quite quickly.",

        "No, not for this.",

        "Usually we'll may chase them for landing.",
        "May chase them for landing, I see, for different kinds of purposes.",
        "But, obviously, in the past several years, any angle that people can find to put a camera on the space shuttle, they're going to do it.",

        "On the foam issues because that has been such a problem in making sure.",
