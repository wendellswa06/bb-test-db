        "Anyway, let's go back to NASA.",

        "Discovery nearing the point of negative return, where the shuttle would be too far downrange, too high in altitude to return to the launch site in the event of an engine failure.",
        "And that was Bruce Buckingham, the anchor at launch control at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.",
        "Richard Harris, here in Washington, if memory serves, if that option is gone, the next one is to abort to a landing field in Spain.",
        "That's correct.",
        "If they can get across the Atlantic, they'd do that.",
        "And if they - actually if the failure's a little bit farther downstream than that, they can, they have other abort options.",
        "One of which is called abort once around, which is they go around the earth once and then they land.",
        "Or there's such a thing as abort to orbit, which sounds like an oxymoron, cause if you're in orbit it doesn't sound like an abort.",
        "But in this case, it would mean not getting up to the altitude of the space station.",
        "So they'd be up there and they'd be safely in orbit, but they wouldn't be able to complete their mission to get to the space station at least.",
        "Tell us, this is the second flight since the disaster of Columbia, and the first in almost a year.",
        "Why did it take so long to get back on schedule?",
        "Well, it took a long time between 2003 when the Columbia disaster came along and to really come up with some fixes for it.",
        "And they thought that they had some good fixes in places.",
        "But the launch last year, last July, turned out to reveal that the fixes weren't quite fixes.",
        "And so it was back to the drawing board yet again to fix some of these issues with falling foam.",
        "That's the real issue.",
        "Foam is so lightweight - it was only a pound and a half of foam that fell off the space shuttle - but it was moving - in 2003 - but it's moving at such an incredible velocity that it's able to punch a hole in the space shuttle.",
        "So, yeah, they really wanted to make sure that they had that right and make sure that no more than a fraction of a pound could come out.",
        "Let's get another update from Bruce Buckingham at launch control at Kennedy Space Center in Florida."

        "We're nearing the point where they're going to have to throttle down, because the shuttle actually loses so much weight as it burns through it fuel that it would get going too fast.",
        "So they have to throttle back now that it's later.",
        "Going too fast?",
        "It's an acceleration and they try to maintain the acceleration at a maximum of three times the force of gravity, for three Gs, and that's to protect the fight control systems and the vertical stabilizer on the space shuttle.",
