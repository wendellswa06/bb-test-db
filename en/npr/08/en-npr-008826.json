        "That's right, the end of august is the next one on the agenda.",
        "And, so that's, so they're hoping to be able to pick up the pace, but, I mean, a lot of that depends on the data that they get back from this mission, whether everything is really going to work.",
        "And indeed, David Kestenbaum, will the analysis work, of going over the pictures that people are taking now and all the pictures that have been recorded already, that's going to be done there in Florida and in Houston as well?",
        "Some of it, some of its going to be quite quick.",
        "They're going to have briefings an hour, and a few hours later, and some of it, as I said, some of the pictures are actually on the thawed rocket boosters, and some of it will take more detailed analysis that will take a couple of days.",
        "But we heard them say it looked clean, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "They made some comment about that on the way up, so they didn't see anything obvious, at least.",
        "And Carl, as I understand it, obviously you're not listening to the voices of Bruce Buckingham or Rob Navias or their equivalents when you're on your mission.",
        "You're just hearing this chatter back and forth.",
        "Yeah, well, we were listening to the flight loops, and so we're, you know, just the calls.",
        "It's a very business-like, because, you know, in the event there's a problem you need to have a clear channel so you can relay information.",
        "So, yeah, you don't have the commentary.",
        "Probably not necessary after, how many rehearsals would you conservatively guess?",
        "Oh, we do, you know, probably hundreds of simulations of launches, landings, aborts.",
        "And, so, of course this is the culmination of all that."

        "And David, just before we have to leave, would you remind us who is on board and who are going to be the stars as this mission continues?",
        "Well, there are seven astronauts on board.",
        "I'll just mention Thomas Reiter is a German, of the European Space Agency, and he's going to be actually delivered to the International Space System for six months.",
        "He was on MEAR for six months, so he'll be nearing, at the end of this, a full year in orbit.",
        "Three of the astronauts have never been in space before.",
        "Mike Fossum was in your class, Carl, right?",
        "Well, Mike actually, he and I had applied when we were in the Air Force together, and he came in much later.",
        "But he kept applying, and you know, one of those things, you know, never give up, and he never did.",
        "He was very persistent and finally got his chance to fly.",
        "So, he's been e-mailing you, you said, yes?",
        "Yeah, I got a couple of e-mails.",
        "He was very excited about flying and of course, he's the first graduate from Texas A&M to fly.",

        "And again, if you're joining us late, the Shuttle Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center at about 38 minutes past the hour, and has now achieved orbit.",
        "The separation of the solid rocket boosters proceeded without a hitch.",
        "There was main engine cutoff and then the main fuel tank also separated, again, without a hitch.",
        "And let's, Richard Harris, as we look ahead towards this mission, obviously everybody wants it to be flawless, but this late in the program, you're still describing this as flight test?",
        "The free and independent states also claim the power to establish commerce.",
        "We now correct the record.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that NASA made a, realized they made a mistake when they called the space shuttle program operational.",
        "In fact, it should have been, according to Admiral Gehman, who investigated the Columbia disaster, it should have always been considered experimental.",
        "And I think NASA has changed its attitude.",
        "So the remaining space shuttle flights will be - I mean, some of the jet pilots who were testing jets and so on and then were asked to investigate the Challenger or the Columbia disaster were sort of surprised that this was considered operational, because, you know, it's been, you know, 114 or so missions.",
        "And they were saying that, gee, that's really just getting going on a flight test program for a real aircraft.",
        "We wouldn't consider something operational after just 100 flights or 200 flights.",
        "So, I think NASA had realized, oops!",
        "Time to realize that this is going to be an experimental craft for the rest of its life.",
        "Indeed, they realized every craft they have ever sent with a human aboard has been an experimental flight.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's, as we look towards the completion of the International Space Station, whether they declare it completed or whether indeed all the parts are there, what, first of all, what are they doing now?",
        "I mean, obviously they had to bank down on some of their activities as they've had very little in the way of spare parts, the extra equipment to build onto the space station, to extend it.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And they've been down to a crew of two since the Columbia disaster, or shortly thereafter, so they've only had two people up there.",
        "They assumed, actually, that the two people up there would only be able to do maintenance and do nothing else.",
        "In fact, they have been able to do some modest experiments, and so on, so it hasn't been simply caretaking.",
        "It has been some activity up there.",
        "But, yeah, there's basically it's, you know, they're trying to make the best of a situation that is clearly not the way they had envisioned it when they thought about what the space station was going to be all about."

        "Yeah, not as bad as its predecessors, I think, as, particularly some horror stories from the Russian space stations, and so on.",

        "NPR science correspondent David Kestenbaum and also astronaut Carl Walz, a veteran of four space flights, logged 231 days in space - among them time on MEAR, I think, so I wanted to ask him about that - so has left us for now.",
        "Obviously we'll have continuing coverage of this story later today on NPR News.",
        "So stay tuned for that.",
        "But, Richard Harris, as we look at this, at this point, NASA has to be very pleased.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think they really needed this launch.",
        "I think that the feeling among analysts is that if anything really major happens to the space shuttle at this point, that's the end of the program - probably the end of the International Space Station - certainly construction.",
        "There's still, Russian spacecraft can still bring a few people up, and Europeans are developing systems to bring up some cargo.",
        "But the amount of cargo you can bring up is quite limited compared to what the space shuttle can bring up to the space station.",
        "It cannot bring up any large components that are sitting on the ground waiting to go there in Florida, including parts built by other nationalities who are -who've invested a lot of money in the space station and really want to see it completed, want to send their own astronauts up, and so on.",
        "So, yeah, this would, you know, unfortunately, NASA's in the position where every mission now has to be a real success or they will, you know, just run out of time so quickly.",
        "and are they getting caught up, also, in all the financial realities of President Bush's decision to say, look, we're going to finish that space station and then go back to the moon and to Mars?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That's the real issue.",
        "Well, there are two issues why 2010, the end of 2010, is the deadline.",
        "One of which is it costs a lot of money to run the shuttle program, and the money you're putting into that means you're not developing space ships to go elsewhere.",
        "So that's one very critical point.",
        "The other thing is the commission that investigated the Columbia disaster said, really, if you are going to fly this, you can fly it for a few more years, but if you want to fly it beyond 2010, our judgment as aerospace experts is the vehicle needs to be recertified for flight.",
        "Which basically means you have to pretend it's a new vehicle and say, would you approve this today, if you were looking at it from afresh?"

        "And the reality is the first flight was 1981.",
        "This is 1970s technology basically, I mean, with some significant upgrades along the way.",
        "But the basic vehicle is an old, old vehicle, and NASA doesn't think that they want to go through the time and expense and trouble of seeing if they can recertify it for flight.",
