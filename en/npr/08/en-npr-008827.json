        "Sure.",
        "Well, every time you go to an airport and get on a plane, you are basically taking advantage of the work that was done at Langley.",
        "Between the wars, between World War I and World War II, they did just tremendous amount of fundamental research into basically making airplanes safer, making them more stable, making them faster and turning them into the technology that is as ubiquitous as it is today.",
        "Now, you were born in Hampton.",
        "Your dad was a scientist at Langley.",
        "And in the book, you write, (reading) as a child, I knew so many African-Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that's just what black folks did.",
        "You know, to that end, like, five of your father's seven siblings were engineers or in technology.",
        "Your next-door neighbor was a physics professor.",
        "How was it that so many African-Americans got opportunities at Langley?",
        "Why is it that so many people were there?",
        "Well, one of the things that's true about Hampton Roads - it's a defense community.",
        "There's an air force base, there are several army bases, a Coast Guard center, shipyards.",
        "So it's a huge place in terms of the defense industrial complex.",
        "During World War II, hundreds of thousands of people actually - and among them many African-Americans - migrated to the Hampton Roads area because of the job boom that was happening.",
        "I mean, it was a place where you could get stable war jobs.",
        "When you were growing up, did you know of the vital work that these women did?",
        "I knew that many of them worked at NASA.",
        "I didn't know exactly what they did.",
        "I didn't know why they had started working there.",
        "I didn't know or really had questioned why there were so many women of all backgrounds working there until I started working on this book, you know?",
        "And it was like a window opened.",
        "And all of a sudden, you know, I started looking at not just those women but my hometown in a very different way.",
        "One of the points that you make in the book over and over again, that it wasn't just Katherine Johnson.",
        "She's the most recognized of all the NASA human computers, black or white.",
        "And that - you make a point of saying that she very much wants other people's work to be acknowledged.",
        "But if you could just briefly tell us a little bit about Katherine Johnson?",
        "Right.",
        "So Katherine Johnson, of all of the women, many people at this point certainly have probably heard her name.",
        "She started work at Langley in 1953.",
        "She was originally working on airplanes, as many people were.",
        "But then she was one of the people who worked on Project Mercury, which was our country's first manned space program.",
        "And Katherine Johnson did many things, but among them was co-author a report writing the trajectory equations for putting a craft into orbit around the Earth.",
        "One of the most notable moments of her career was leading up to the orbital launch of John Glenn's flight, which was really a turning point in the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.",
        "You know, the Russians had gotten a real head start into space.",
        "America was playing catch up.",
        "And this was also a moment where electronic computers were taking over the task of much of the - you know, the calculating that was necessary for these increasingly complex missions.",
        "But as sort of a handoff moment between human computers and electronic computers, John Glenn asked Katherine Johnson - he actually asked the girl - you know, all of the women working at that time were referred to as girls.",
        "And he said, get the girl to do it.",
        "You know, I want this human computer to check the output of the electronic computer.",
        "And if she says they're good then, you know, I'm good to go, you know, as part of one of my pre-flight checklists.",
        "So the astronaut who became a hero looked to this black woman in the still-segregated South at the time as one of the key parts of making sure his mission would be a success.",
        "Thank you for that because that really kind of sums up so much of what's remarkable about the story.",
        "I mean, you point out in the book how they were doing this incredibly important work.",
        "Truly, you could argue lifesaving work because if they were wrong, someone could die.",
        "I mean, that's just a fact, right?",
        "If their..."

        "They were mothers.",

        "They were people who were active in their church, in their community.",

        "The men designed the research and did the manly stuff, and the women did the calculations, you know, at the behest of the engineers.",
        "And so I think that it really does have to do with us over the course of time sort of not valuing that work that was done by women, however necessary, as much as we might.",
        "And it's taken history to get a perspective on that.",
