        "Is there something that can be done for those kids?",
        "I think at this particular point, we're in the survival stage.",
        "I think that once that passes, we'll start to see people kind of moving in with relatives and other things where that becomes the norm of getting their kids back into school.",
        "What is this I've heard about kits, little sort of--not quite school but something that would, you know, give kids a little bit of work to do?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think there are organizations here, non-profit organizations, religious organizations, that are putting together all kinds of kits that have school worksheet kind of things to distribute to kids.",
        "Still not sure how we're going to distribute those because we haven't identified who those kids are.",
        "But once we do, I think there are a number of places that are trying to get some kind of feeling of school, even if you're not in a school building.",
        "And that's the point of it, just to give a child a little something to do that will feel familiar?",
        "The familiar is probably what's most needed with a lot of these kids at this particular point in time.",
        "They want to try and stay in some kind of routine, but also to keep them engaged in a school environment of some kind because at some point, they're gonna have to jump back into that classroom situation.",
        "And this will, I think, help the students be able to make that transition whenever that occurs.",
        "What about schools that are gonna have to all of sudden absorb several hundred children they didn't have before?",
        "I imagine `school' becomes a relative term in some places.",

        "Actually, I think we've heard from a number of folks who've said there are regulations that--obviously, under No Child Left Behind and some other things, where highly qualified teachers are required in classrooms--where we're going to have to relax some of those regulations for teachers as well as students as they come across the border.",
        "And, you know, if you've got 700 or 800 new kids in Georgia, that's going to require, you know, a number of new teachers as well.",
        "We're going to have to find ways to maybe waive their certification immediately or, in some ways, let them practice their craft with these kids.",
        "And I think whatever we can do to help ease those transitions will be terrifically appreciated.",
        "How are school districts going to absorb the costs of all these extra students?",
        "Yeah, I think we're gonna have to look for ways, and one of the things we want to do is work with our business partners and some of our community partners to find ways to, you know--perhaps there are ways that the textbook companies can provide textbooks to these students at a reduced or free kind of cost.",
        "But there are other, you know, basic things, like desks and chalkboards and things that you have to have.",
        "We're going to have to reach out to people and figure out ways that we can have them donate those materials as best we can to get schools back up and running.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, a million-dollar block was a term we came up with when we were looking closely not at crime rates, which a lot of people had been studying, but rather at incarceration rates for places.",
        "So what we did was mapped where people lived who were going in and out of prison and jail every year; and started to look at that data on a very local level.",
        "And then we were tallying up the costs of that imprisonment for each block in Brooklyn.",
        "And what we found were these million-dollar blocks; places for which the state and city of New York were spending more than a million dollars a year to send people to prison and jail each year, for - on average - between two and three years.",
        "So you're on the street in Brooklyn right now.",
        "Tell us about the block you're on, and how it applies to your work.",
        "Yeah, we're in a block in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and we're outside a new neighborhood-based probation office.",
        "And just behind us is a whole group of blocks for which the state and city are spending over a million dollars a year to incarcerate people.",
        "And, Eric, you've actually mapped this area several times.",
        "I mean, give us an example of exactly what kind of information the maps give you about the area right where you are.",
        "Well, let me tell you, Audie, what's different about what we did is that no one had ever actually sat down and gotten the home street address of everyone going into prison and jail, as well as all - sort of the background information about their age and their employment status, etc. And when you have that data, it tells you a lot about what's going on, on the block.",
        "And when we look at the million-dollar blocks that we mapped almost a decade ago, it's a highly concentrated group of public housing and smaller, apartment housing, all grouped together in a very concentrated manner; each of which, we're spending more than a million dollars a year for.",
        "But today, when we look around and we see those blocks, things have changed quite a bit.",
        "There has been a real investment by the city and the state, and particularly the Department of Probation; to engage with local organizations around the community, and strengthen what they're doing.",
        "And you can see that in a lot of activities - are going on around me."

        "You've talked about what cities can do with this information, but can you get more specific?",
        "'Cause with the map, they now have very detailed, precise statistics on something which most people who may live in such a neighborhood, know pretty intuitively.",
        "Yes, they do.",
        "And in fact, in all honesty, what we mapped was not a big surprise to people.",

        "They become - almost urban planners; and start to ask questions like, oh, well, look at all the resources around this million-dollar area, but they're not being used well.",
        "How can we take those resources, and then seek to strengthen them; rather than come in blind with some kind of - sort of giant service center that doesn't really link with what's already going on in those neighborhoods.",
        "And it's almost the flip-side of the way police use the data, right now.",
        "There's a big push of - in terms of policing, to use data to find hotspots of criminal activity.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So what we were trying to suggest was instead of law-enforcement tactics that crime mapping helps, incarceration mapping helps you think about the socio-economic dimensions that are a key to making a difference, from here out.",
        "Eric, at what point did your work make the leap from the computer lab, and your hard drive, to policymakers?",
        "It was very soon after.",
        "Within a year, we were all over the country - from Connecticut to Kansas, etc. One - I'll tell you, Audie, one of the things we noticed right away, when legislators and others started to see this, was they talked about this issue differently.",
        "Instead of getting stuck in the being soft-get tough paradox, they started to talk about neighborhoods.",
        "So in Connecticut, where it - which was one of the first places outside of New York we worked, legislators started to talk there about the Hill neighborhood; and why were we spending $6 million a year to remove and return a whole range of people, for technical violations, when we could be investing some of those dollars in the social and economic well-being of those places.",
        "And Eric, we're actually going to turn to New Haven, Connecticut, where people - as you've said, are discussing this.",
