        "Yeah, yeah, my apartment, my loft is across the street from a big old downtown bar in Livingston, and the backdoor faces the street, and I had parked sort of across from it.",
        "And a guy came out of it looking kind of crazed, red-faced and locked eyes with me in that way people will and said, you know, I'm going to kill you and started across the street at me.",
        "I happened to be moving a gun, a target pistol that was in the glove compartment of the truck.",
        "My kids had just gotten out on the other side.",
        "They didn't see me as I reached in, grabbed the pistol, sort of held it at my waistline and turned around in the seat with the door open, facing the street as this guy was now about 10 feet from me.",
        "And he backpedaled in the way you only see in cartoons usually.",
        "From full speed ahead, he went to full speed somewhere else, and that was my experience.",
        "And you've obviously thought about that, where if he was going to come any closer - had you thought, are you going to point it at him, are you going to shoot him?",
        "You know, I had two children just a few feet away, nine and six years old.",
        "I grew up using guns, hunting to some extent.",
        "So I'm not neurologically incapable of pulling a trigger on a living being.",
        "And in that situation, I probably would've, yeah.",
        "And given what happened, were there shakes afterwards?",
        "You know, it happened very quickly, and I imagine that people who call in are going to say they had to think quickly, and when they thought about it afterwards, there were some parts that make them nervous.",
        "I'm not sure, in fact I am sure now, my gun wasn't loaded.",
        "I didn't carry a loaded gun.",
        "And if he had had a gun, it would've been a foolhardy thing to do to draw on him.",
        "So, you know, I didn't really have time to think about that, but it caused me afterwards to think wow, if that guy had been armed, and I'd upped the ante in the way I did and yet was not loaded, things could have gone very badly.",
        "Yeah, it can go any number of ways, and not all of them are predictable, and you've got two kids right - glad it went well.",
        "Yeah, yeah, and, you know, you don't want to extrapolate from any one incident.",
        "The thing that I have thought afterward is that it gave me a little bit of overconfidence about that kind of situation.",
        "And I think I actually had to settle down a kind of euphoric response, having, you know, successfully, primally(ph) guarded children to think, you know, let's hope there's not a next time, and if there is, it might not be this simple."
