        "Some believe challenges like the one McKown presented can change the course of a mass shooting.",
        "So if you've pulled a gun on someone, what happened?",
        "Give us a call, tell us your story, 800-989-8255.",

        "Joining us - and Walter, I wanted to ask you: Your story, obviously we heard the story like the one from Alexander.",
        "When you started sharing your story, do you hear other people's stories like that?",
        "Well, every once in a while I do.",
        "And, you know, I was listening to that story on the air just a second ago, and I thought: How strange.",
        "Here we are, it sounds like we're in a western.",
        "These are stories from contemporary America about gunplay, very violent gunplay.",
        "And I know when I told mine, and I think when I heard the caller tell his, there's a kind of gallows humor that automatically comes up.",
        "You get a little riled up telling it.",
        "And you know, the notion that we're a civilized place kind of falls apart slightly when this topic comes up.",
        "And I notice that when I've told my story, it's often been reciprocated, and you can never tell.",
        "They're like war stories.",
        "There can be a little bit a feeling of unreality about them, you know, but, but it happens.",
        "And obviously if you're talking to somebody, they all have good endings.",
        "Well - not necessarily.",
        "I had a friend who, much like your last caller, came home to his house, someone had broken in.",

        "He wasn't willing to use it.",

        "Many of our students, obviously as armed professionals, have used their firearms to defend themselves.",
        "And some of our citizens that are students also have used them inside the home and outside the home.",

        "We talk a lot about should versus could.",
        "A lot of the debate in the firearms industry revolves around the laws.",
        "And of course the laws vary from state to state, and the laws vary from city to city in some states.",
        "And of course we have instructors who work in Europe, in the different places where the laws are dramatically different than they are here in the U.S.",
        "So the conversation of what you can do legally becomes very convoluted very quickly.",
        "And the reality is while we certainly advocate that responsible firearms owners are going to follow all the laws and be very aware of the laws, the reality in that moment comes down to whether or not you should use a firearm.",
        "And we simply talk about the ultimate (technical difficulty) self or others and that that's really the only reason why you should be presenting a defensive firearm inside your home, outside of your home.",

        "And I hate to interrupt you, Rob.",

        "But thanks very much for coming.",
        "Yes, it sounds good.",
        "So you were saying it's the difference, the only situation in which you should pull a firearm on somebody is immediate threat.",
        "Yeah, it's when you need to.",
        "So it's not an issue of can you pull your firearm, which a lot of people enter into the conversation, they say it's legal, is this allowed.",
        "It really comes down to need.",
        "Once you've met all the legal requirements to have the firearm and be a responsible firearms owner, do you need to use the firearm to defend yourself or someone else?",
        "And I assume there's a lot of, well, deprogramming to do after all the gunplay we've seen on TV and the movies."

        "Well, when it comes to the actual use of the firearm, absolutely.",
        "A lot of what we see in the media, the entertainment media, isn't the best way to use a firearm, and in a lot of cases even a smart way to use a firearm.",
        "Quite often, you know, the drama in the action movie scene comes when the good guy gets the gun taken away or the gun kicked out of his hand or something, and that's when the fight ensues.",
        "So we definitely teach things a little differently than what people see on the big screen.",
        "So the situations, though, are - you know, people are unaccustomed to being in situations like that.",
        "It's difficult enough for police officers or people in the military.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We approach all of our training from a personal defense, a home defense standpoint or even for the military and law enforcement that we train from what we call a counter-ambush point of view.",
        "In other words, if you knew the attack was coming, especially in the personal issues, you would have avoided the fight.",
        "You wouldn't have gone to mall that day.",

        "You get ambushed, you get caught off-guard.",
        "So your training, your preparation needs to take that into account.",
        "And that's why the responsible gun owner really can't be thinking about doing a legal cross-reference in the heat of the moment.",
        "They need to be thinking about do they need to defend themselves, or do they not need to, and that's really the crux of the responsibility issue of presenting a firearm.",
        "As your other guest Walter mentioned earlier, if someone presents that firearm, but they're not really willing to use it, they don't need to use it, it can actually cause more of a problem.",
        "So if you're going to pull a gun on somebody, be ready to use it.",
        "Yeah, and that's the idea.",
        "You don't present that firearm.",
        "It's different in the military, it's different in law enforcement, where you may use that firearm as a challenge.",
        "And certainly in personal defense situations, we do sometimes see what we call a psychological effect, where someone will present a firearm, and a bad guy will decide, well, I guess that person isn't a victim, that person isn't one of the sheep, and that person can protect themselves, so they'll change their mind.",
        "And of course there's time for the person defending themselves to stop and to not shoot or to not continue to shoot once we get that psychological stop.",
        "But once that firearm is brought into play, there's a responsibility to be able to defend yourself and use it and protect that firearm from falling into the bad guy's hands.",
        "And this is really a decision that has to be made when someone chooses to own that firearm for personal defense in the first place.",
        "And I assume responsible gun ownership involves more than a couple of days of training."

        "Well, it depends.",
        "The reality is that we have courses everywhere from four to six hours for people who are interested in learning how to select the right firearm and learning how to store it properly in their home, learning the basics of home defense.",
        "And then it really comes down to practice.",
        "So formal training could simply be a few hours, some exposure to some basic ideas, or it could be several days.",
        "We have some students who will take, you know, five days a year of formal training.",
        "Some will only take four, six or eight hours in their entire lives, but they'll maintain those basic fundamental skills through a practice regimen that makes sense for their lifestyle and budget.",

        "Luckily in the private sector I've never had to pull a firearm to defend myself, certainly never had to do it inside of my own home.",
        "Is the federal government going to cough up some of this money, do you think?",
        "Where?",
        "Where's the work?",
        "But as you alluded to earlier, if they're there to report the story and to tell us what happened, good, bad, wrong, right, what part of the training worked and what lessons they have to share with others, then that's much better than just being a victim of violent crime.",
        "And if you could point to one lesson that we could take away, what would it be?",
        "The lesson is not to think that the training should be controlled and choreographed.",
        "The lesson is that, you know, if you saw it coming, you would have avoided it.",
        "And that's always going to be the smart choice and the right choice, to not have to use the firearm.",
        "You don't go into a situation that you know might be dangerous simply because you're armed.",
        "Instead, being armed causes you to avoid those confrontations even more.",
        "If you take your safety and your personal defense seriously enough to have a firearm, then you certainly should be locking your doors and avoiding dangerous places and dangerous people."

        "Of course, one of the neighbors called the police.",
