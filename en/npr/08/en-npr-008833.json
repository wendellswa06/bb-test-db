        "But in cloudier situations, you can only pray and hope for clarity, I think.",

        "And it happened numerous times, most recently here in Oregon when my daughter was four-and-a-half.",

        "And there was no cars in the parking lot at all.",
        "It was completely empty.",
        "And we had a young puppy.",
        "And so I left my four-year-old in the van, and I said, here, you know, lock the door.",
        "I said you can see mom.",
        "I'm going to walk the puppy, just don't open this door for anything.",
        "And I have an old Smith & Wesson that belonged to my father, and, yes, it was loaded.",
        "And I carried it in the van because it was just her and I.",
        "I never put it in my pocket when I got out.",
        "But that night, I didn't consciously think about it.",
        "I had my raincoat on.",
        "It was cold and windy, and I stuck it in the pocket of the raincoat.",
        "And I'm walking this puppy down, and as I start to come back to the van, I see a very nicely dressed guy coming out of the woods across the grass.",
        "And he had on slacks, dress shoes, leather jacket, you know, not something you go out in the woods in.",
        "And as he started - and I was watching him, of course.",
        "And as he started coming towards me, there was nothing - where I was parked, there was no facilities or anything.",
        "And he was smiling, and he said - and he started yelling when he was about 75 feet away, 60 feet away.",
        "Do you know where I can find water?",
        "And I'm pointing in the opposite direction.",
        "He kept coming towards me.",
        "He was trying to cut me off from getting back to the van.",
        "When he thought he had bisected that distance and he was between me and the van that I couldn't get there, his whole tone changed.",
        "He made it extremely clear what he was going to do.",
        "He was unzipping his pants, and he started telling me, verbally, what he was going to do.",
        "And I had my hand on the gun.",
        "For a moment, I was thinking about, OK, what am I going to do.",
        "Until my four-year-old started running the window down in the van, and that was it.",
        "I pulled the gun out because the last thing he had said to me is something about I'm going to show you what you've got for me or something like that.",
        "And I just said I've got this.",
        "You want this?",
        "And he turned and ran back into the woods.",
        "Now, because I've had the gun - and that's not the only time.",
        "There's been another - there's been other times, too.",
        "Because I had it, because I want to use without any doubt in my mind the minute I saw my daughter was in danger - nobody died.",
        "And, you know, like I said, there's been two other occasions.",
        "Nobody died because the gun made them changed their minds.",
        "They don't expect a woman to have it, and it catches them off guard, that you can defend yourself.",
        "So I'm going down that street to get a permit to carry, because I've done that and I realized that, you know, traveling when she was little and stuff like that, I had a gun in the van if we were camping, and I will - I'm going to completely legal about it, but...",
        "That's obviously wise.",
        "But I'm really glad the situation worked out the way it did."
