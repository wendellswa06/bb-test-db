        "Let's add socioeconomics into the mix, because in some cases there are drug sales, for example that are across race where you have people - you know, I used to live in New York City and folks would always talk about the folks driving in from New Jersey and then picking up their drugs in, you know, New York City and then driving back.",
        "And a lot of the dealers would be black and brown, a lot of the customers would be white.",
        "How does something like that affect these overall statistics?",
        "Well the fact is, that tends to be the proverbial real story that you hear.",
        "And I'm not arguing with the fact that there is interracial drug sales, but by and large we know that there tends to be primarily intra-racial drug sales.",
        "But here's another key fact in why I think we also see higher rates of arrest among African-Americans is that from really good ethnographic research that's been done suggests that African-American's drug markets tend to be more stranger-to-stranger and they tend to take place in public areas.",
        "I think this is really key.",
        "White drug markets tend to rely more upon referrals from friends or colleagues, co workers and they tend to take place in private, as does drug use.",
        "So one of the very practical implications of this is that it's much more easy to detect and pursue the war on drugs in African-American communities.",
        "And in fact, some of the historical research, looking back at the war on drugs, particularly the crack cocaine market in the 1980s suggests that the very public nature of it, the fact that here in Washington, D.C., open-air drug markets were widely available and wildly visible within blocks of the U.S.",
        "capital really raised the issue to a national profile.",
        "When you look at race in the criminal justice system, there's also the question of victim and offender.",
        "And I know that there are some statistics about how the - how much more likely the sentences are to be heavy for African Americans for example who murder whites, as opposed to African-Americans who murder other African-Americans.",
        "How else, you know, whether it's in the case of something like that, but how else does race kind of play into who gets sentenced for how long under what circumstances?",
        "Well, it's important to go all the way back to the very beginning.",
        "We're talking about arrest here.",
        "Where the war on drugs is pursued, where police tend to be in higher concentrations so there are going to be higher arrest rates.",
        "And our sentencing system functions very much on criminal history.",
        "It functions very much on habitual offender laws.",
        "And so if you are African-American, just by virtue of geographic segregation that is very commonplace in the U.S., you have a higher likelihood of having police contact, higher likelihood of being arrested, higher likelihood of that arrest leading to a booking, charge, conviction, sentence, etc. It goes on, and then the cumulative effect of just being African-American puts an individual at a disadvantage versus being white in the criminal justice system.",
        "And so when the sentencing system is based upon your criminal history, it's based upon all these different factors.",
        "It's very difficult to identify, well, it's the police, well, it's the courts, well, its corrections, that's where the racial disparity exists.",
        "It exists all along the way, in some cases very explicit ways, in some cases very subtle ways that disadvantage African-Americans.",
        "And the cumulative effect is what we see in the incarceration population.",
        "There are plenty of black folks who will say, black folks need to get it together.",
        "You know, especially with black-on-black crime, we just need to get it together within our community.",
        "Other folks will point to the system.",
        "Other people will look at a combination.",
        "From your perspective, doing what you do at The Sentencing Project, what needs to happen now?",
        "Well, this is - we could make all the reforms that The Sentencing Project advocates tomorrow morning, and in many cases we still would have not addressed a lot of the underlying reasons that crime occurs.",
        "The criminal justice system doesn't exist in a vacuum.",
        "The fact that we see these incarceration numbers, these arrest numbers that we're discussing are reflection of failures, in my opinion, in terms of addressing poverty, economic opportunity, education, healthcare.",
        "In many of these communities where they have very high density incarceration, high density arrest rates, there are also all of these failures to provide social service to this community."
