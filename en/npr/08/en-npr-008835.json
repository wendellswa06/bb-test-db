        "Oh, well, inside the space station, there's a lot of machinery and things like that, and it kind of reminds me of being in an engine room on a ship, or around a bunch of machinery and mechanical parts.",
        "And what it doesn't smell like is an Alpine forest or a woodland meadow or anything that reminds you of nature.",
        "Jeff, you had even closer quarters in the Shuttle.",
        "Was the odor any different?",
        "Well, I will say that one of the fortunate aspects from the olfactory point of view in space flight is that without gravity constantly pulling on your body, the fluids tend to shift to your upper body, including in your head, and the sense of smell is somewhat reduced.",
        "It's a little bit like when you have a sinus, stuffy nose, headache, which I think, given the smells that are present up there - remember, we don't have showers in space.",

        "We don't do laundry.",
        "So you tend to wear clothes for - until you can't wear them anymore.",

        "I've watched the faces of some of the crew after you land, when the hatch to the Shuttle opens, and the first person comes in.",
        "It's interesting to watch how their noses wrinkle up when they get the first whiff of the air that we've become used to and aren't really that sensitized to.",
        "So I suspect it's as Don says: It's not an Alpine meadow up there.",

        "You'll get different answers from different astronauts.",
        "There are some people who tell you that they really don't like launches because of the risk involved, and they love being in space, but they'd just as soon there were a safer way to get up there.",
        "Everybody has their own way of dealing with risk.",

        "I'm confident that I and my crewmembers can do it.",

        "And one thing that I think history will show, when the space station - when we're looking back and space station years like we're currently looking back at the Apollo years, people will remark on, one, how difficult how that was, and how much we learned from that.",
        "But right now, we're right in the middle of all of that, and we really don't see the forest for the trees - at least those that aren't intimately involved in the program.",
        "And I kind of think it might have been that way with the Apollo program, as well.",
        "After the first trip to the moon, people were wondering: Why are we keeping - keep going back?",
        "And afterwards, we say: Gosh, why did we quit going to the moon?",

        "I think the one common thing that everybody will say is that being up there, looking back at the Earth, looking out at the universe from a completely different perspective, it gives you a sense of true awe, and I mean in the deepest sense of the word."

        "On the other hand, I have to say, I don't think, at the moment, that we really need to build a moon base, because I'd like to explore the moon.",
        "The moon is a big place, and there's a lot of places to explore before we actually commit ourselves to building a base at any one specific part.",
        "I think what we really should do is take off kind of where the late Apollo missions left off and apply 21st-century technology and figure out how to do it affordably.",
