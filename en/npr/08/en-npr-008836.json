        "You know, how do you do something that young kids can relate to?",
        "Because you talk about weightlessness and gravity and Newton, and, you know, that's fine at high school and college.",
        "But elementary school students haven't really studied a lot yet, but they sure know how toys work.",
        "And to see how differently a lot of them behave in space really brings home to them that you're in a very different environment.",
        "And I think this has been - this whole theme has been taken on other flights, and Don's done a great job with it.",
        "And, you know, anything that we can do to excite these young kids, get them interested, get them thinking about how things work, you know, that's what creates budding scientists and engineers, and we need more of them.",
        "And there's a common scientific engineering thread in many of our toys, and I think that can be demonstrated by people like Jeff and I.",
        "We just haven't grown up.",
        "We're still playing with our toys.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And if you look at what the job entails, we're going someplace where human beings really weren't meant to be.",
        "And the only reason we can be there is because we take machines with us, mechanisms to give us the things that we need, whether it's propulsion and attitude control or life support.",

        "You're a babe lost in space.",
        "And you got to know how these machines work.",
        "You got to know how to fix them when they break because they always seem to be breaking, and that's just the way it is.",
        "And that takes math and science and engineering."

        "Don?",
        "I have not seen any evidence that intelligent life exists elsewhere, no green men with almond-shaped eyes in flying saucers and things like that.",
        "So if there - in the terms of is there life out there, there could very well be life on Mars.",
        "We've seen some evidence that there might be life on Mars from fossils found in Martian meteorites that have ended up on Earth.",
        "And it will be interesting to see as time unfolds with our Martian exploration whether we ultimately run across some form of simple life forms on Mars and whether or not we call them intelligent, I guess we'll just have to see what happens when we run across them."
