        "Why did that start?",
        "You know, I don't know when the program started specifically.",
        "I know that when I was sheriff and when I was the patrol operations chief, we did acquire a great deal of equipment for the military.",
        "We got a helicopter, a couple of armored personnel carriers, a number of a rifles, night-vision goggles, those sorts of things.",
        "The reason we got those from the military is 'cause we could not afford to purchase those on our own, and that equipment was very necessary.",
        "We police the metropolitan area in and around Seattle.",
        "So the equipment was very necessary.",
        "Well, it was a list of potentially 12 counts of obstruction of justice contained in the Mueller report that really changed it for me.",
        "I was waiting for it to come out, and it's a game changer.",
        "And we should be clear.",
        "I mean, Robert Mueller did not specifically come out and say that the president committed crimes.",
        "I mean, he raised these questions about his behavior, and then you had the attorney general afterwards saying that it did not meet the standard for prosecuting.",
        "But - so what, despite all that, convinced you that this was obstruction?",
        "It's clear that the report itself is, essentially, a recommendation to the Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.",
        "The beginning of an impeachment proceeding is, essentially, like a start of a grand jury investigation.",
        "And that does not require a finding of guilt.",
        "It merely requires a colorable claim of instances of obstruction of justice, and that's exactly what we have.",

        "Because I've been on every major news network this week, and my text messages are full of colleagues of mine who are thanking me for speaking out.",
        "And these are Republicans - I mean, people involved in politics.",

        "And there are even Democrats who are saying that if the Senate is not willing to convict the president, there's no real value in starting impeachment proceedings.",
        "So what gives you the sense that the party as a whole would ever move in that direction, given some of the voices we're hearing there?",
        "First of all, offhand comments in advance of an impeachment investigation and trial are very different from actually going through the thing itself.",
        "We'll learn a lot more from the impeachment proceedings as people are put under oath, as people face consequences like losing their bar license for not complying with subpoenas.",
        "And furthermore, I don't think it's a waste of time to begin an impeachment process, even if the political calculus is that there won't be a conviction in the Senate.",

        "We've had two impeachments of presidents.",
        "It's still a worthy exercise to uncover information, to have the judgment and the precedent for history that this conduct is not acceptable.",

        "We shouldn't be talking about politics.",
        "We should be talking about differing interpretations of Federalist 65, the Federalist Papers and how they weigh in on impeachment process.",
        "Nancy Pelosi has brought up other options for Democrats to hold the president accountable - potentially, you know, to scrutinize his behavior in other ways and committee hearings with witnesses maybe before ever starting the formal impeachment process.",
        "Why, in your view, is impeachment specifically so important?",
        "I think if they don't begin impeachment proceedings before the end of this Congress, they're doing a real disservice to history.",
        "I think President Trump deserves - we need the truth about what happened.",
        "And we don't - I think right now, some of his activity has led to his successful cover-up of information.",
        "Mueller alluded to that in the report.",

        "It's been the biggest contributor to the rise in incarceration, going back to 1980 or so.",
        "We know that the war on drugs is defined by its discretion, and the fact of the matter is, African Americans were disproportionably arrested and incarcerated for drug offenses.",
        "Those numbers are not representative of their overall use.",
        "So 12 percent of the general population in the U.S.",
        "is African-American, about 12 percent of regular drug users, monthly drug users are African American.",
        "But about three times that rate are arrested, about four times that rate are incarcerated.",
        "We know that the primary means of drug sales are intra-racial so it tends to be African-American to African-American, white to white.",
        "So what's going on with these arrests and conviction numbers has a lot more to do with the decisions and discretion of where we choose to pursue the war on drugs than in who's using drugs and whose selling drugs.",
        "Let's add socioeconomics into the mix, because in some cases there are drug sales, for example that are across race where you have people - you know, I used to live in New York City and folks would always talk about the folks driving in from New Jersey and then picking up their drugs in, you know, New York City and then driving back.",
        "And a lot of the dealers would be black and brown, a lot of the customers would be white.",
        "How does something like that affect these overall statistics?",
        "Well the fact is, that tends to be the proverbial real story that you hear.",
        "And I'm not arguing with the fact that there is interracial drug sales, but by and large we know that there tends to be primarily intra-racial drug sales.",
        "But here's another key fact in why I think we also see higher rates of arrest among African-Americans is that from really good ethnographic research that's been done suggests that African-American's drug markets tend to be more stranger-to-stranger and they tend to take place in public areas.",
        "I think this is really key.",
        "White drug markets tend to rely more upon referrals from friends or colleagues, co workers and they tend to take place in private, as does drug use.",
        "So one of the very practical implications of this is that it's much more easy to detect and pursue the war on drugs in African-American communities.",
        "And in fact, some of the historical research, looking back at the war on drugs, particularly the crack cocaine market in the 1980s suggests that the very public nature of it, the fact that here in Washington, D.C., open-air drug markets were widely available and wildly visible within blocks of the U.S.",
        "capital really raised the issue to a national profile.",
        "When you look at race in the criminal justice system, there's also the question of victim and offender.",
