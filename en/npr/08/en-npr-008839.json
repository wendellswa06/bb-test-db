        "Not every single volunteer fire department needs a ladder truck, but when you need one there's nothing else will do.",

        "What do you say to that?",
        "Some circumstances would warrant it, but we look at statistics and, you know, the ACLU report says that 79 percent of these SWAT teams have been activated between 2011-2012 for search warrants.",

        "So sheriff, is it your view that this is a bad apple situation?",
        "That the horror stories that we've heard about that have now become part of the public conversation involving individuals who are perhaps wrongly killed or people whose doors were busted in, those are isolated instances that reflect poorly on the whole practice.",
        "Is that your view?",
        "Well, I don't think I would use the term bad apples.",
        "I think there are some agencies that don't have proper leadership and discipline, and there are probably many missions that are very poorly done and nobody gets hurt and so the public doesn't learn about it.",
        "So I think there probably are many other examples of bad police work.",
        "But I would say on the balance, the majority of those missions are successful and no one gets hurt.",
        "There is a great deal of reform that is happening in this country, and we are really trying to refocus our training on getting officers - new officers in particular - to understand their role and focus more on the public safety side of the role and using enforcement as one tool in a tool belt full of lots of tools to keep the community safe.",
