        "Yes.",
        "It's really, I think, an extraordinary example of both what's seen as the promise of this strategy and also its daunting challenges or its limitations because really, the question at the heart of it is, when do you know if a case is really over?",
        "How do you manage someone over the long term who may be vulnerable to acting violently like this?",
        "So in the case of Erik Ayala in Portland, he was managed by a threat assessment team for years in another town in Oregon and when he moved away, years later, went on to commit a mass shooting that, you know, seemed to be motivated by the very thing that he had been expressing when he was in high school.",
        "Now, is that evidence that he was stopped from committing a mass shooting in high school?",
        "No one can really say.",

        "I mean, if you look just at that piece of property, you would have thought that the hazard it would've been from flooding, not from the hillside across the river coming down.",
