        "It was the 1960s, not long after Fidel Castro declared Cuba being a Marxist-Lenin state, which was in December.",
        "And not long after that, the Cuban revolution decided to side with the Soviet Union rather than the Chinese in the Russian-Sino split that had occurred in the '60s.",
        "And, of course, North Korea had become a client of the Soviet Union, particularly after the Korean War.",
        "And Cuba had gravitated toward the direction.",

        "Security Council resolutions, which is surprising to me in many ways that Cuba would risk garnering the attention of the United Nations for what it seemed like very little gain for them in trying to so-called repair of these obsolete military equipment.",
        "And you buy that explanation that the missile parts were in fact obsolete and were being shipped to North Korea for repairs?",
        "Frankly, I and many of us are a bit dumbfounded as to this whole situation.",
        "The Cubans could have very easily asked the Ukrainians, the Russians, the Belarusians to do exactly the kind of repair that apparently the North Koreans were going to do.",
        "You do think it's a violation of the United Nations sanctions.",
        "It does seem to me.",
        "The more we see, for example, the fighter aircraft, the MiG, it's clearly a violation.",
