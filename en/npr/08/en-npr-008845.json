        "But economist Keith Reed has some ideas on how to get off on the good foot this year.",
        "He's a reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer and he has just launched BET's personal finance blog, \"\"Dollar Out of 15 Cents.\"\" Hey, Keith.",
        "What's up, Farai?",
        "Well, what's up is reality check, you know?",
        "It's time to take a look at what's left in the wallet.",
        "How do you start off on the right foot in terms of savings, for example?",
        "I think one of the things that people should have done before you even start to talk about getting on - off on the right foot this year in terms of savings was look at what you did last year.",
        "If you've got those receipts that are still left or the bills that are coming due, really look at what you spent last year, really look at how much of a consumer you were during the holiday season, and figure out what you can do to cut back your spending in some areas that you didn't necessarily need to spend.",
        "That would be one of the first things.",
        "I mean, one of the biggest things that I think a lot of people don't do anymore or aren't as disciplined about as they should be is budgeting.",
        "You really have to sit down, look at what you're bringing in every month or every other week or however often it is that you get paid and figure out what you're spending.",
        "Take a pen and a piece of paper with you outside when you, you know, when you go to work or when you're shopping on the weekends and write down everything that you spent, all the little things that you don't keep track of.",
        "Figure out where that money is going and start to work back with from there to see what you can cut out from your budget, so that you can be more disciplined and not end up owing in the New Year as much as you may have owed in the prior year.",
        "That will be the number one place I would start for most folks.",
        "What about actual savings plans?",
        "They're - you can get such low interest rates on money that you just keep in a savings account that's linked to your checking account.",
        "What other options do you have if you don't want to have your money tied up for a long time, but you do want to get some money in terms of interest?",
        "One of the great things you can do is obviously look into an online savings account.",
        "Two to the most popular accounts that are out there are ING Direct's Orange Account and HSBC Direct is an online subsidiary of HSBC bank, where you can go online, you can have a direct deposit or an automatic deposit set up to come out of your either your paycheck or your checking account, link that to your online account.",
        "Those banks, because they don't have physical branches, are - they don't have the overheads, so they pass those savings on an overhead from running a branch onto you in a form of higher interest rates.",
        "Right now, I think both of those banks have given in the 4 maybe even 5 percent range, and sometimes for new accounts, you can get APYs that are a little bit higher than even for 4 or 5 percent.",
        "Sometimes, you'll find promotions that go as high as - close to 6 percent on the money that you put into some of those accounts.",
        "And it's a very good way to save your money.",
        "The other thing that's great about those things is that when you put the money in, because it doesn't come with an ATM card, it's a little bit more difficult to get access to the money.",
        "So for example if you have an ING account, if you put money into that account, it takes at least three days for the money to come back to you if you need to transfer it into a checking account that you have access to.",
        "So in those three days, you've got a little bit of time to think.",
        "It's not money that you can just go get and make an impulse purchase with.",
        "So those are two really, really good vehicles for putting some money away."

        "It tends to be people who have - who are working parents, people who are working but don't make a ton of money and their parents.",
