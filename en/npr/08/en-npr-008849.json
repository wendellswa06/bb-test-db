        "We've made it through two hurricane seasons down here in the Gulf without an event, but we do not want to have group site parks still open and have folks living in those parks through another hurricane season.",

        "As people move out and they do get their repair money to rebuild their homes, they find other apartments or they make other choices for where they want to go, so a lot of our parks have closed just through natural progression.",
        "We do still have several parks open and about 3,000 families living in those group site parks in Louisiana.",
        "What we're doing is closing those parks based on when our leases are expiring and some property owners want their land back, some local ordinances which are forcing us to remove the trailers from that area, and then also just trying to consolidate down the numbers, but, really, to help people move into rental resources and apartments or we have an alternative housing pilot program that's coming online, and we're trying to help people move into a better solution.",
        "What we do when we are working to close a park is we put notices on the doors at least 60 days before the park is scheduled to close, giving them the name and the phone number for their case workers so that we can have someone assigned to their family to help them work, to find an apartment or other resource that works for their family and their family composition and, hopefully, close to their children's schools and jobs, et cetera.",
        "About 30 days out, we have case workers working to contact and meet with each individual family."
