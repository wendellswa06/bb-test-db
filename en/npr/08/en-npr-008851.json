        "So he would often say - and he was right - that in a lot of cases, he was criminal defendant's greatest friend because he found a lot of power in, for example, the right of a criminal defendant to confront witnesses against him and was really responsible for remaking that right under the Constitution, as well as the right to a jury trial when you're a criminal, which changed federal criminal sentencing entirely.",
        "But beyond that, he generally was a very, very solid constitutional conservative and a reliable vote on that side.",

        "He was as incisive and biting on the bench as he was in his defense.",
