        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Even with recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists about when first cervical screening should begin, women and their doctors are still talking about the guidelines for mammograms that were issued earlier in the week.",
        "And they recommended briefly - getting to them briefly against routine screening of women in their 40's and against the breast self-exam.",
        "And since those guidelines were released, we've seen lots of TV shows and news articles telling us stories of many women who say they detected their cancers in their 40's.",
        "They said that without screening they would not have survived to their first mammogram at age of 50.",
        "And it seems hard to argue against these stories, but how do these anecdotes weigh against the panel's data?",
        "How do you compare the benefits of possibly saving lives against the harm done to other women through false positives and unneeded surgeries?",
        "And is it even possible to know that something that looks like cancer would have ended up being a threat to your life?",
        "For a lot of women early detection of something that looks like cancer leaves them with two choices: they either take their chances or they take some preventive action, which could mean a regimen of cancer drugs and mastectomies.",
        "Today, we're going to try to take a closer look at routine breast cancer screening and cancer screening in general and help sort through some of the data that you've been hearing through all week along, and perhaps understand a little better the rationale, the thinking behind guidelines like these.",
        "And to do that, let me introduce two guests: Dr. David Dershaw is director of breasts imaging at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center here in New York and he joins us in our studios in New York.",
        "Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "(Director, Breast Imaging, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) Nice to be here.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Karla Kerlikowske is director of Women's Veterans Comprehensive Health Center, that's at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco.",
        "She is also a professor of Medicine, Epidemiology, and Biostatistics at the University of California in San Francisco.",
        "And she wrote an editorial accompanying those new guidelines.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Kerlikowske.",
        "(Director, Women Veterans Comprehensive Health Center, Veterans Affairs Medical Center): Thank you very much.",
        "David, let me ask you to - see if we can get some ground - to lay some ground here to understand the statistics.",
        "If I'm a woman under 50, what are that odds that I'm going to die from breast cancer?",
        "The odds of dying of breast cancer increase with a woman's age.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "So, as with other cancers - cancer is a disease of aging - so with other cancers the likelihood of dying increases as you get older.",
        "The precipitous increase in risk occurs for women in their 40's, which is why screening is used for women in their 40's.",
        "Right.",
        "We used to recommend screening starting at 35, decided that that wasn't worthwhile and we have eliminated screening in that age group.",
        "So, is there a number that you could put on for women, let's say in their 40's?",
        "It's half of what it is for women in their 50's, to give it a relative worth.",
        "I've seen numbers like three percent.",
        "If a woman - any woman in her 40's, the chance of dying of breast cancer is three percent.",
        "That would be an acceptable number, maybe a little high.",
        "Let me ask Karla, is that a good number, Karla?",
        "Well, the risk of getting diagnosed with breast cancer for women in her 40's in the next 10 years is 1.5 percent.",

        "So�",
        "I guess I'm asking this - let me just fill you in on why I'm asking this - because I'm now trying to see that if I'm a woman under 50, if I know what those odds of dying from breast cancer are - and if I'm under 50 and I get a mammogram, how are those odds going to change?",
        "I mean, if it's three percent when I'm a woman under 50, let's say, how much does it go down to if I get a mammogram, David?",
        "Well, that depends upon which set of data you look at.",

        "Three teams of attackers had descended on half a dozen sites across Paris, including a concert venue in the 11th arrondissement.",
        "Paolo Bevilacqua was nearby.",
        "People was running in the street and screaming and crying, you know?",
        "Actually, I didn't understand what happened, you know?",
        "The concert hall was called the Bataclan.",
        "Eighty-nine people died there.",

        "A blast echoed through the national stadium.",
        "He was quickly evacuated.",
        "Soon, Hollande was addressing the nation, placing blame on ISIS, also known as Daesh.",

        "(Through interpreter) Faced with war, the country has to take appropriate steps.",
        "It's an act of war committed by a terrorist army, Daesh, an Islamist army against France, against the values we uphold throughout the world, against who we are, a free country that speaks to the whole planet."

        "It can wrap its tail around its body and then slide the knot toward its head, scraping the goo off itself.",

        "It's entertaining.",
        "And in the ocean, the animals are fascinating, but oftentimes we tend to get so technical that we lose the entertainment factor.",
        "So I thought if I really want to engage people in learning about what we call biodiversity or the wonderful diversity of life in the sea, I make it fun.",
        "And one of the most fun - if I could put it that way - is - you talk about - is the popular queen conch and the special things that conchs do in their mating habits.",
        "Well, one of the ways I found the information in this book is I queried some of my - maybe we should say more serious scientist colleagues about do they have any good stories.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...you know, that was just a great response from a, you know, more serious scientist, and then I started doing research and discovered that, in fact the biologists have known about the well-endowed queen conch for many years.",
        "And there are limericks written about it, and in addition to not only being well-endowed, it turns out that when the male conch, let's say, puts his, like, they call it the verge, when he puts his lengthy verge outside of his shell and around and under the female's, there's a little problem.",
        "Crabs and eels are all too happy to take advantage of his vulnerabilities and yum, yum, yum, but luckily, for the male conch, lose one, and he just grows another.",
