        "There is another study, which I think is very interesting, which was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology this year and it came out of Boston.",
        "And it looked at 7,000 women who got breast cancer in the 1990s - from 1990 to 1990 - 1999 - and comparing women who got at least two screening mammograms to those who got no mammogram or one mammogram.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So there are a lot of numbers there, and I think it gets really confusing to look at it, but I think there is really very little doubt that your likelihood of dying of breast cancer, if you get screened, plummets.",

        "They looked at both the randomized controlled trials of screen mammography and they also looked at data that is actually collected in the United States, which is the most up-to-date data, by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and SEER data that's available.",
        "And so I think if you look at the body of evidence and not just isolated studies, then you can see that, yes, there is a benefit to screening women in their 40s, but that benefit is small, and the issue, when you're going to recommend screening to healthy people - I'm a primary care physician.",
        "When a woman walks into my office and she's a healthy person, I have to say, if I'm going to recommend something to her, do the benefits of recommending that outweigh the harms?",

        "Preventive Task Force found, by looking not only at randomized control trial data but data collected in women across the United States, is that the benefit for screening women 40 to 49 is small, and there are harms.",
        "So in those situations you basically - it's a toss-up.",
        "It's the benefits and the harms.",
        "It's not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms.",
        "It is true, as women get older, into their 50s and 60s, not only does the benefit go up, but the harms go down.",
        "So now the balance is tilted.",

        "What kind of harm, what kind of harm - Doctor, what kind of harms - we're talking just about, oh, stress, I'm going to be living with this, or what kind of harms are we talking about?",
        "I think we're talking about all the false positives and biopsies that result from mammography, which are higher in younger women because the prevalence of disease is low.",
        "And basically the U.S.",
        "Preventive Task Force showed that if you have - you have to screen 1,900 women 40 to 49 for 10 years, that's 19,000 mammograms, to avert one death from breast cancer.",
        "And in addition to that, you generate 2,000 false positives and all the biopsies that you need to do to prove that someone does not have cancer.",
        "And all the mastectomies that would not have to be done.",
        "Well, and I think that's actually a harder thing to quantify, but clearly we're identifying disease that, in all age groups - it goes up with age, but in all groups - that would not affect someone's survival, and I think really, you know, the key is that we don't - if it's a slow-growing tumor, it doesn't matter whether it's detected on mammography, and we don't do well detecting the fast-growing tumors.",
        "So what you really want to detect are what mammography can't do, is detect those kind of moderately growing tumors, and those will have the greatest impact in potentially changing someone's survival.",
        "But that absolute number of tumors is not very large in women in their 40s.",
        "It gets a little bit larger in their 50s, and probably the biggest increase is women in their 60s.",
        "But I just think that the whole idea of the task force - and they actually said this in 2002 also, this is not that much different of a recommendation - is that when you have the situation where the benefit, it's not clear the benefit of the test outweighs the harms, you need to give women a choice as opposed to just blanketly recommend that everybody get mammography.",

        "Now, what that means is that if you have other health issues that are really very life-threatening, that the advantage of mammography is probably minimal in that age group, and in fact, the disadvantages of possibly undergoing biopsies and that sort of thing really have a very negative impact.",

        "I think one of the issues for older women is not even - not necessarily, I mean, somewhat how much, how long they're going to live, but the other question, I think, is what kind of cancer are you going to detect on mammography in that population.",
        "So there's the issue of competing risks, the co-morbidities.",
        "So at our clinic we - if they have a history of stroke, or they have diabetes, if they have many co-morbidities, then it's unlikely that they'll live long enough that mammography would benefit them, definitely past age 74, maybe even past age 70."

        "But the other thing that I worry about is the risk of detecting ductal carcinoma in situ, and these slow-growing, invasive cancers that, whether you treat them or not, probably would not impact on their survival, that to me is a big downside to mammography in older women.",
        "All the tumors tend to grow slower as they get older in that population, and so I think if someone is, you know, has no co-morbidities at all and is a really healthy person, then probably screening 70 to 74 is okay, but past age 75 it's really hard to imagine that, you know, that mammography would make a big difference.",

        "It increases the sensitivity of detection of one to two percent.",
        "But a clinical breast exam by itself, they basically say there's insufficient evidence.",
        "I actually think there is some indirect evidence in that the Canadian trial of women 50 to 59 compared mammography plus clinical breast exam versus clinical breast exam.",
        "So they basically were asking - does mammography add anything?",
        "And in that trial, all mammography added was detection of more ductal carcinoma in situ and more small cancers.",
        "So basically in that trial they were saying if you can do a really good clinical breast exam, and you have to be good at it, you have to spend time and, you know, really be good at it, that in these older women, you could potentially find cancers that, if you found them early, it would impact their life."
