        "The mantra is becoming this week the way to solve is to, like the commercial says, ask your doctor, you know?",
        "Are doctors, is your GP, the person you go to under your health-care plan, whatever plan that you have, is that doctor, is your doctor generally able to have the time and the length of discussion to discuss these things with you in the 15 minutes you're going to have in that office about what your options should be?",
        "No, we don't hate him.",
        "We don't hate him.",
        "But you got a...",
        "Well, I think that that's an unreasonable expectation.",
        "I think that physicians, especially those outside of the specialties that take care of breast cancer, are very confused by these recommendations.",
        "The ball is being tossed to people who are not actually responsible for making the decision, and it's being taken away from those who are responsible for making the decision.",
        "It's interesting that the advisory panel did not include anyone who was an authority on breast cancer and no one who was an authority on breast cancer screening.",
        "The recommendations were promulgated by people who were number crunchers, who selected studies that would result in the recommendation that they had.",
        "If we're going to have effective screening for any group, for any disease, we have to have simple and easy recommendations to follow.",
        "Part of the effectiveness of screening is getting people to come in and be screened, and if we have this large menu of screening options, it becomes extraordinarily confusing, and I think it results in a failure of the screen.",
        "Dr. Kerlikowske?",
        "Well, I am that primary care physician, I can tell you, and I am faced with these challenges all the time, whether it's breast cancer screening or cervical cancer screening or the latest thing for heart disease.",
        "And I can tell you that patients want choices.",
        "They don't want a one size fits all.",
        "They want to know what their risk is and how, whatever that intervention, is going to help them.",
        "And I can tell you all the time we use the Internet, we use the Framingham Index, and we figure out someone's cardiac risk.",
        "And so I think we are in the mode of doing risk assessment and trying to figure out what's best for that individual and not necessarily one size fits all, and I'm going to do everything for everybody - because patients don't want that.",
        "They see themselves as individuals, and they want to know how these things apply to them.",
        "How many of the average - if we can find an average woman in America - how many women at home with their children, women working, how many women do you think actually heard about this study and actually can take the time to sit down out of their working, busy lives, actually sit and think about this?",
        "I think women, they pay attention to this and they pay attention to the media, and they understand and appreciate things more, I think, than people think.",
        "A perfect example of that was when it came out that hormone replacement increases your risk of breast cancer, and the media, there was press releases from the Women's Health Initiative, there was articles in the newspaper.",
        "And when women saw that, they responded to it, and prior to the WHI coming out, the amount of hormone replacement in this country was around 50 percent, and I can tell you now, it's around 15 percent."

        "And they want to have a choice - just as Dr. Kerlikowske said.",
        "They want to have a choice, and the panel recommended removing that choice from part of the health care decisions that women get to make.",

        "I think if you read the guidelines, that is not what it says.",
        "And it's not what it said in 2002, either.",
        "It said that women should - they should discuss it with their physician and it should be a choice.",
        "So I don't think they're saying that women in their 40s should not get mammography.",
        "I think they're saying it should not be a routine thing that when someone walks into your office, you give them a requisition and say go get a mammogram.",
        "They're saying you should talk to the person and say there's potential benefits.",
        "There's potential harms.",
        "I think you are an average-risk woman.",
        "You're a high-risk woman.",
        "And depending on that, they make the decision, which is very different than saying they shouldn't get it.",
        "And I can tell you that I've heard both ways.",
        "I've heard people say, well, I'm going to continue to get it.",

        "John McCarthy, the American mathematician known universally as the father of Artificial Intelligence, died last Monday at his home in Palo Alto.",

        "WEEKEND EDITION's Math Guy, Keith Devlin, knew McCarthy and has this remembrance.",
        "I first got to know John McCarthy when I arrived at Stanford as a visiting professor in 1987.",
        "He was 60 years old at that time, with a towering and, to me, somewhat daunting, reputation.",
        "Our relationship began when he was in the audience at a research seminar I gave.",
        "He challenged some of my claims and we argued for a while.",
        "His mind was extremely quick and I thought I'd lost the debate, but later that evening I received an email from him with the title \"\"Semi-Apology.",
        "He had thought more about what I had said, and decided it had some merit, though he still disagreed with me - typical McCarthy, I was to learn.",
        "After that John and I became good, though not close, friends.",
        "McCarthy's debating skills stood him in good stead during the early part of his career.",
        "He had arrived at Dartmouth College as a young professor in 1955, and shortly thereafter organized a small summer research conference there on what he called artificial intelligence.",
        "The goal was to build a machine, a computer that could think.",
        "Though others had speculated along similar lines, that conference is widely regarded as marking the beginning of the field of artificial intelligence.",
        "Certainly, that term artificial intelligence, which he introduced, caught the public attention.",
        "And the conference, together with his evident brilliance, undoubtedly helped establish AI, as it became known, as a respected and well-funded field of computer science research.",
        "By the 1980s, when I first met him, most people in the field had reached the conclusion that the original dream - or to some a specter - of a digital computer that could think like a person, was unlikely to be achieved.",
        "Instead, AI had morphed into a discipline that develops computers which, while not thinking in the sense portrayed by the sinister HAL of Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film \"\"2001,\"\" did act in intelligent ways.",
        "Today, AI systems are in many of the devices in our everyday lives; from household appliances to automobiles, from medical equipment to video games."
