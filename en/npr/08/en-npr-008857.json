        "As NPR's John Ydstie reports, both programs' finances have been hurt by the poor economy and high unemployment.",
        "Just during the last year, the weak economy meant Medicare took in two and a half billion dollars less in tax revenue than had been anticipated.",
        "For Social Security, high unemployment now means it's unlikely that a year's worth of payroll taxes alone will ever be enough under current law to pay for a year's worth of benefit.",
        "Prior to the financial crisis and recession, payroll taxes had been expected to fully cover benefits until around 2017.",

        "The trustees projection shows Social Security will have the resources to pay full benefits through 2036.",
        "That's one year less than was projected last year.",
        "At that point, its trust fund will be exhausted.",
        "But Social Security commissioner Michael Astrue emphasizes that does mean the system will be bankrupt.",
        "What exhaustion in 2036 means is that we'll have money to pay a little bit more than three-quarters of benefits with no other legislative changes.",
        "Now that's not good.",
        "You know, we need to have the Congress step up and make changes so that that's not the outcome.",
        "But so far, changes in Social Security are not on the table and the negotiations between congressional Republicans and the White House over the 2012 budget.",
        "That's not the case with Medicare, where the problem is more urgent.",

        "Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will exhaust its assets in 2024, which is five years earlier than was projected in last year's report.",
        "Geithner said the earlier exhaustion was largely due to changes in the economic assumptions underlying the trustees report.",
        "Those changes transformed small, positive balances in the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund in last year's report to small negatives in this year's report.",
