        "Until now, no police have gone to examine the place I was raped in, nor have they detained the people responsible, she says.",
        "They lie to the media that they have detained people, but they haven't taken any measures.",
        "She hasn't even been asked to identify her attackers, she says - more proof that they haven't investigated her allegations.",
        "She says the lawyers who have been appointed to represent her have asked her to deny that she was raped by Gadhafi's troops.",

        "I'm not going to talk around the fact that there were some mistakes that were made.",
        "We - I - am accountable for those mistakes, just as I am accountable for the performance of the firm overall.",
        "Well, the treaty gives the two countries seven years to implement.",
        "Also, the way that the reductions actually are done physically focuses much more on the delivery system.",
        "So, you mentioned the number that we would reduce down to 1,550 deployed warheads.",
        "The warhead is the part that goes boom.",
        "But to be a weapon it has to get to the target.",
        "And it's the delivery systems, the delivery vehicles that get it there, namely, missiles that are based on submarines, missiles that are based in silos, less likely would be on heavy bombers.",
        "It's those things, the delivery vehicles, that are dismantled, basically, if not destroyed, rendered unusable and that process is verified.",
        "Now, the dismantling of a missile is fairly easy to visualize, but a strategic bomber or a submarine that launches nuclear missiles, would such systems actually be dismantled?",
        "They can be, or they can be retired due to age.",
        "But the more likely way that this would be done is that you render, like, our submarines, for example, have 24 tubes, which basically look like tubes into which you could put a missile.",
        "You could render those useless by filling them with concrete or otherwise disabling them.",
        "And then that part of the reductions, as it were, is what's actually kind of counted and verified more than the warheads themselves.",
        "But just to clarify this point, as a result of reductions, of deployed warheads of this sort, each side, Russia and the U.S., would have an increase in the number of somewhere stored warheads and something that could be conceivably used once again in weapons.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And, in fact, one of the challenges, and it was mentioned in the earlier piece in the future, or hopefully a next round, is to for the first time have in arms reductions treaties the verification of the dismantlement of warheads.",
        "And I think that's something that both sides, U.S.",
        "and the Russians will start to think pretty seriously about going forward.",
        "I would think that despite the umpteen thrillers and James Bond-like stories about stolen ICBMs and submarines that are hijacked with nuclear missiles aboard, it really is the much smaller weapons that are much more likely to get into bad hands.",
        "And when we think of loose nukes, it's not really so much an entire missile that we think is going to go missing."

        "What I'm asking is, are - because we're eating their stomachs and what they filter out of the water, are we not getting all the bad stuff that they're taking out of the oceans?",
        "Well, shellfish are one of the things that you have to be careful of, and it's why when there's, say, a red tide bloom or a problem with the waters, they close shellfish beds.",
        "So as long you're eating from a commercial shellfish bed, where they monitor the water quality, it's not a problem, but yes, they do accumulate toxins and things in their bodies, but that's why it is so important that it's monitored appropriately.",
