        "Well, that's correct - and one of my favorite examples is the cone snail, which is just this incredible animal that actually has a harpoon-like tooth on a tether that it can shoot out, capture fish and reel the fish in and then inject it with a deadly venom.",
        "And it turns out that scientists think the cone snail has the most potential of any animal on the planet for pharmaceutical discovery.",
        "Wow.",
        "We'll come back and talk more with Ellen Prager, author of \"\"Sex, Drugs and Sea Slime.\"\" Great stuff in this book.",
        "Stay with us.",
        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255.",
        "You can tweet us @scifri and also go to our website, slash-scifri.",
        "We'll be back right after this break.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking this hour with Ellen Prager, author of \"\"Sex, Drugs and Sea Slime: The Oceans' Oddest Creatures and Why They Matter.\"\" And if you'd like to see a few photos of them from the book, you can go to our website at sciencefriday.com and look at the interesting stuff that is out there.",
        "There was a report recently, Ellen, in June from a group of international scientists, the International Programme on the State of the Ocean, that said that many marine species, including those that make coral reefs, could be extinct within a generation.",
        "And I as a scuba diver, I go around and I - stuff that was there years ago, I see they're longer there.",
        "Are you familiar with that report?",
        "Does this kind of stuff worry you?",
        "I am.",
        "You know, I - in the book, when you write a book about the diversity of life in the ocean, you can't help but also say something about the issues that we face, and that are threatening this wonderful diversity.",
        "And so, yes, I - the issues such as overfishing, climate change, pollution, these are really threatening life in the sea and the ocean as we know it.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, not just direct overfishing and stuff, but acidification, things like that, more CO2 and...",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "Climate change is kind of a double whammy, specifically for coral reefs and things that have a skeleton or shell or calcium carbonate in that you have rising seawater temperatures, which are one issue, but as more carbon dioxide is released in the atmosphere, more is being absorbed in the ocean, and that is basically lowering the pH or making it more acidic.",
        "And so that, we think, is not only going to affect the ability of corals to calcify or create their skeletons, but the very biological processes that animals use to live.",
        "So it's a real concern.",
        "Has working on this book changed what you eat?",

        "You know, I love seafood, but I really try and make wise choices.",
        "Luckily, there are a lot of organizations out there now, Monterey Bay Aquarium, Blue Ocean Institute, that put out good lists of what seafood are well managed, what seafood we think or fish are able to be managed sustainably.",
        "And so I try to make wise choices.",
        "Every once in a while, I have to say, I slip up, but I try and be informed, and I ask when I go to a restaurant like where did they get their fish, or specifically what is it if I'm not sure.",

        "Mary?",
        "Oh no. She must have pressed - you know, if you have cell phone, you press it to your cheek, it turns it off sometimes.",
        "Sorry, we'll try to - she wanted to know what about the shrimp from the Gulf, the residue, is it safe to eat the shrimp in the Gulf?",
        "Well, according to all the reports, it is safe.",
        "I haven't seen any reports of there being any sort of residue from the oil spill in shrimp, so I think we have to assume it is.",
        "Let's talk - an interesting - another interesting sea creature in your book is the lobster, and you say in your book that there's a lot of peeing...",

        "...going on in the lobster world.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's amazing.",
        "And again, this is one of those things that was just fascinating.",
        "It turns out when two American lobsters - we know them as the Maine lobsters with the big claws - meet, pee matters.",
        "The two males when they meet, they basically battle for hierarchy over the best lairs or dens.",
        "And to do this, they sort of shoot each other with pee.",
        "I like to say they get kind of pissed off.",

        "And...",
        "I'm glad you said it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "I couldn't resist.",
        "That's good...",
        "But what's also interesting is that when the female Maine lobster approaches the male, she also shoots a stream of urine, and instead of inciting aggression, it's like love potion number nine.",
        "And she seduces him with her pee, and we think that it may contain pheromones.",
        "So urine is in fact very important, and lobsters are very - they have a very sensitive sense of what we say smell, or they can detect chemicals in the ocean.",
        "And again, when I'm talking about sort of surprising things, scientists are studying their incredible sense of smell, this ability to detect chemicals, for biotechnology.",
        "So it's not just this wacky pee story.",
        "It actually has real application for humankind.",
        "Interesting.",

        "Hmm.",
        "Know anything about that?",
        "No?",
        "No.",
        "But I - it's highly unlikely because the hagfish is not going to give you one of the beautiful filets.",
        "You know, they usually use like a fish like pollock for those filleted fish, kind of, sandwiches.",
        "I find it highly unlikely.",
        "I mean, hagfish is actually eaten in Asia and they actually - think of a - it's kind of - it doesn't sound very appetizing to me - but think of an eel sort of skewered on a stick and roasted.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Well...",
        "But I don't - I can't really - I mean, you will not get the same kind of filet that you would get from something like a pollock.",

        "Well, the slime is actually a defensive mechanism.",
        "They - when something approaches them, a potential predator or they get hurt, it's a defensive mechanism, and they release the slime to facilitate escape.",
        "What's interesting about the slime is that they actually have - they release mucus and these bundles of - this - a threads - their cells are bundles of threads that untangle.",
        "And the slime actually is created as the mucus and threads absorb seawater and that creates the slime.",
        "Interestingly enough, there's also a scientist looking at hagfish slime to create sort of a biodegradable equivalent of spider silk or Kevlar.",
        "So you might be wearing clothes of artificial slime one day.",
        "You know, you always hear that scientists are looking at snails for the slime on their snails, you know, they coat things - at least the terrestrial ones do.",
        "And also they're all looking at barnacles and other sea creatures who have an incredible ability to stick to other things.",
        "How do they do that, you know?",
        "Maybe we can imitate some of that stuff.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, you think about it after, you know, billions of years, hundreds of millions of years, nature has really perfected some of this.",
        "And I think we're starting to learn that we can learn a lot from these biological processes or systems and apply them to technology.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is there one sea creature you wanted to learn more about or find that you couldn't?",
        "Let's see.",
        "You know, I don't think there was one that I want to learn more about, but I will say I have become incredibly enamored by beluga whales.",
        "Just learning about them and seeing them, I'm utterly fascinated by them, would love to learn more about them.",
        "One of the really cool things about belugas is that - you know, most people know that whales and dolphins echolocate by emitting a pulse of sound from their melon or their head that they - it's like sonar almost.",
        "But the beluga can change the shape of its head, so it can actually target that pulse of sound or echolocating beam.",
        "So they actually think it might even be able to target and bounce off ice floes and see around corners.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, fascinating.",
        "We're going to have a little thing on whales, right after we say goodbye to you, which has to be in a few minutes.",
        "But Flora Lichtman will come in and we have actually a video on whales.",
