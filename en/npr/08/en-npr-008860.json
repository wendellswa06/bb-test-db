        "Well, thank you.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Right.",
        "But some people just don't feel that connection and I really wanted them to understand to understand the connections to things that everybody cares about, like food, jobs, the economy, human health.",

        "And your work at the Aquarius Reef Base in the Keys, was that - that must have been a lot of fun.",
        "It was.",

        "Well, that's - I consider that a form of ankle-biting, but I think my poems are slightly underrated, and by the word accessible, which has become kind of like the sound of chalk on a blackboard to me, or nails on a blackboard.",
        "I think accessibility is actually, in poetry, a strategy for me.",
        "It's a way of getting the reader into the poem, you know, access the poem.",

        "Okay, \"\"Winter in Utah.\"\" The road across a wide, snowy valley could not have been straighter, as if someone had drawn it with a ruler, which someone probably did, on a table in a surveyor's office a century ago with a few other men looking over his shoulder.",
        "We're out in the middle of nowhere, you said, as we bisected the whitened fields, a few dark bison here and there, and I remember two horses snorting by a shed.",
        "Or maybe a little southwest of nowhere, you added, after you unfolded the map of the state.",
        "But that night, after speeding on sleds down a road of ice, the sky packed with stars and the headlights of our host truck blazing behind, it seemed we had come a little closer to somewhere, and in the morning, with the snow sparkling and the rough white mountains looming, a magpie flashed up from a fencepost, all black and white in its airy exertions, and I said good morning to him on this first day of the new decade, all of which left me to wonder if we had not arrived at the middle of exactly where we were.",
        "Well, what would you like to know about that?",
        "Well, so you draw us in by that picture you paint of someone in a surveyor's office a century ago, something I think we can all see in our minds.",
        "And are you a poet, Michael?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I just kind of had the idea of the ruler, and then I took it more literally and got us into a surveyor's office.",
        "And I guess one of the things the poem does with - I mean, most poems are very - if you don't have a sense of playfulness with language, right, there's no hope for you as a writer or a poet, particularly, but I just took that cliche, we're out in the middle of nowhere, said by my companion and then expanded it into feeling that maybe we had come closer to somewhere.",
        "And at the end of the poem we actually arrived in the middle of exactly where we were.",
        "So it's a poem about getting located, and that sense of being at the center of things occurs through this natural setting, you know, the appearance of the sparkling snow, the mountains and then finally this bird that looms up.",

        "And some of the playfulness involves being a little southwest of nowhere, a little more precise than in the middle of nowhere.",
        "Then you get to more and more precise - a little closer to somewhere and then finally in the middle of exactly where we are.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "By increment we are inching into where we are.",
        "And so the other question that we're going to ask the other poets who are going to call in today: How do you get an audience?",
        "Well, you know, I'll tell you the truth.",
        "It's - NPR has a lot to do with whatever audience I've managed to gather.",
        "I mean, I think radio is such a perfect medium for the transmission of poetry, primarily because, you know, there just is the voice, there's no visual distraction.",
        "And also, when you hear a poem on the radio, you're usually not expecting to hear it.",
        "You know, many people who tuned into your show today probably weren't expecting to hear poetry.",
        "And if listeners are kind of ambushed in that way, if a poem just happens to be said while they're listening to the radio, the listener doesn't have time to deploy their - you know, what I'd call these poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school, and there's little time to resist the poem.",
        "So NPR has given me a much broader audience than the kind of audience that I started having when I was reading poems to, you know, a dozen people in a church basement somewhere.",
        "But I also think maybe the internal reasons are - I think readers like a certain mix of clarity and mysteriousness.",
        "And I think poems that remain completely clear and un-mysterious to the end are a little flat, and they don't journey anywhere, and then there are poems that tend to be mysterious from the first line to the last line.",
        "I like poems that - I'm trying to write poems that involve beginning at a known place and ending up in a slightly different place, although that last poem was a bad example because we start in the middle of nowhere and we end up exactly where we are.",
        "But in most of my poems, I'm trying to shift, I'm trying to take a little journey from one place to another, and it's usually from a realistic place to a place in the imagination.",
        "We're talking with Billy Collins, his new collection, \"\"Horoscopes for the Dead.\"\" We want to talk with poets today.",
        "How do you get an audience?",

        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And we'll talk with Leah(ph).",
