        "I was interested when Billy Collins said a few minutes ago those deflectors, those poetry deflectors that we all acquired in high school, do you find your audience has those, Michael?",

        "Okay, that's - all right, well, that's a specialized audience.",
        "But I think it's - you know, when I was poet laureate, I got interviewed quite a bit, and there were two - the two most commonly-asked questions were: One, how do you account for this incredible renaissance in poetry, all this poetry activity and open microphones and books being published?",
        "And two: How come no one reads poetry anymore?",
        "And, I mean, I found the way to answer this was that: Yes, there's a tremendous amount of poetry activity going on, which extends out to -from trade houses to self-publishing and open microphones and poetry slams and lots of poetry magazines.",

        "I mean, it - by and large.",

        "You remind me, Stanley Kunitz, a poet with a very long career, toward the end of that career, you mentioned you work in teaching poetry, he did, too.",
        "And said, he wondered at the end - near the end of his very long life if the transformation of poetry into an academic discipline was an altogether benign process.",
        "Well, I think - I mean, that will go on anyway.",
        "I think there are alternatives, obviously, to - I mean, the idea of academic poetry is tied in, I think, in my mind, with the idea of critical analysis, you know, of the teaching of poetry, tends to offer poetry that requires interpretation.",
