        "He says while it's possible to identify concessions on the Iranian side, getting the West to lift sanctions is more of a challenge.",
        "This really boils down to the fundamental problem that we have in the talks at this point, which is the difference in the nature of the parties' concessions.",
        "Meaning that it's much more difficult to turn sanctions on and off than to turn centrifuges on and off.",
        "What negotiators have said about sanctions is that under an agreement, Iran would eventually see all sanctions lifted, but at the beginning, a suspension of some sanctions is the best Tehran can hope for.",

        "He says Rouhani is the former nuclear negotiator himself and is haunted by the ghosts of failure a decade ago.",
        "Because he is the one who in 2003 to 2005 made concrete concessions for the promises of incentives that never came.",
        "If President Rouhani goes back to sell the deal and says I've accepted all these restrictions that are concrete, are immediate, but the West has only suspended sanctions, people will accuse him of being naive.",
        "This history of mistrust flows both ways.",
        "Critics in the region and the West argue that Iran almost certainly had a nuclear weapons program in the past.",

        "Any improvement could be due to the placebo effect, or other factors besides the stem cell therapy, and may not lead to longer-term functional gains.",
