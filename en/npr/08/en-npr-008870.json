        "You know…",
        "Perfect.",
        "It used to represent perfect.",
        "Well, it did, but essentially, what a 10 represented before was the perfect execution of a routine and it had a start value.",
        "So, it was possible for someone to only have a start value of 9.6 or 9.8 before, and perfectly execute that routine and only receive a 9.6 or a 9.8.",
        "I understand the system has also changed the way that many gymnasts are training?",
        "The challenge is that as you push the envelope on technical difficulty, you push the outer limits of your body.",
        "And so - and you have to be conscientious and careful about how much you're pushing yourself to execute routines that are extremely difficult at times.",
        "Does this system push gymnasts too hard?",
        "No, the system doesn't push gymnasts too hard.",
        "The system encourages increasing your technical difficulty and I think the FIG is working on making adjustments to that."

        "Use of the word could be perceived as offensive by the military leaders and by the Buddhist majority, so the Catholic minority - and that's only 1.3 percent of the population - fears that if the pope uses that word, it could unleash reprisals against them.",
