        "And the NEA affiliates, as a part of this agreement, would be able to work on the ground with the AFL-CIO.",
        "They could work on political campaigns, and maybe get better labor contracts.",
        "And this is gonna helpt the NEA, but it really seems to benefit the AFL-CIO, because they need a lot more members, and they're really desparate for dues.",
        "Is this a kind of merger, then, between the two groups?",
        "No, the NEA is really independent.",
        "And this is just an agreement to cooperate, and it would be voluntary, so each NEA local could decide whether they were gonna participate or not, and it's not really clear what the impact might be.",
        "Now, Frank, the unions represent only about twelve percent of the American workers.",
        "That's way down from previous decades.",
        "The split last summer was over a difference in strategy, on how to turn that number around, and bring up those numbers of workers belonging to unions.",
        "Anything on that coming out of San Diego?",
        "Yes, definitely.",
        "You remember, the dissident unions left, saying they wanted to put more money into organizing, and the AFL-CIO's been focusing a bit more on trying to elect more pro-labor candidates.",
        "They figure if they can change labor laws, they can sign up more members.",
        "So, at meeting, they decided to spend about 40 million dollars on political mobilization, and that's the most they've ever spent in mid-termm, and they're doing it even with these recent budget cuts.",
        "Frank, thanks very much."
