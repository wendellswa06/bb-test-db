        "Lobbyists like Jack Abramoff have been at the center of the federal public corruption investigation here in Washington and that's sort of what has been fueling this anti-lobbyist sentiment, and both Boehner and Blunt have been running pretty much as fast as they can distancing themselves from their friends on K Street."
