        "And that has to lead to impairment.",
        "And there's a couple of reasons why this diagnosis would be controversial, and that is because there's no biological marker for it, because the diagnostic criteria are somewhat subjective and because different people will interpret the impairments and the symptoms differently even in the same child.",

        "That's the most popular right now.",
        "And I can well see that there'll be a shift in ADHD diagnosis to something else, just like the terms for autism have changed in the last 10 years to spectrum disorders and things like that.",
        "So you have changes in the names we give, the labels that we give for these conditions.",
        "Is the diagnoses coming from the parents, the doctors, the teachers?",
        "Where are we seeing this increase coming from?",
        "So I can list a couple of possible explanations for why the numbers are going up.",
        "First of all, it could be that kids are actually changing, and there is actually more ADHD out there.",
        "But most people probably don't believe that.",
        "Kids are spending more time in front of their computers, and they might be exercising less than in the past.",
        "Those are probably true.",
        "But whether or not that translates to a diagnosis of ADHD is less clear.",
        "I think some of the reasons, that there's a lot of surveillance for this, so people are looking for it.",
        "There's greater awareness and acceptance of the disorder and in part because the pharma industry has direct-to-consumer advertising, and they've succeeded in selling this.",
        "And then adolescents are way up, and that's an interesting sub-group here because the boys in high school, their numbers have jumped, and there's got to be an explanation for why the diagnosis is being made so late.",
        "And then lastly we just recently published a position paper through the American Academy of Neurology on pediatric neural enhancement, which is a sub-group that might be taking stimulants and might be coded as ADHD, but actually it's healthy children who are using stimulant medications as study drugs.",
        "And that probably explains some of the jump.",
        "You know, there is - if you just think about it, it seems like the jump is occurring at the same time we hear about the epidemic of obesity in children, of type 2 diabetes, of sugar consumption.",
        "Have these things been controlled for or thought about as perhaps having some connection?",
        "I don't know if the data is so clear on the connection there.",
        "But kids are definitely getting heavier.",
        "Looking at movement and physical activity and then human activity, the need to move, and this thing called hyperactivity, most studies actually don't show that children with ADHD are moving that much more.",
        "They're just fidgeting more.",
        "So that's sort of an interesting part of this disorder.",
        "Most kids that I see who have ADHD are actually quite thin.",
        "And I don't know if that's a national trend or not.",
        "How about the link to medication?",

        "That's where the data comes through beyond the survey science, there are more doctor visits coded for ADHD management.",

        "There's more drug being manufactured, and there's more drug being consumed.",
        "And actually last year there was a national shortage of methylphenidate for a while, which means it's actually being consumed.",
        "Another question that comes up periodically is whether people might be motivated to have the ADHD label because of privileges or rights that they might get to take longer for tests.",
        "So it would be a diagnostic label which would have some sort of benefit to them, even if they're not taking stimulant medication.",
        "Is there any federal funding for parents or schools or people like that for children who have ADHD?",
        "And if so, might that be a motivation?",
        "Oh, whether - I think to get Social Security income for a child would depend on the parents' income, and I've heard of that as a possibility, but I don't think it's very common.",
        "Certainly the services for children that are publicly funded through public schools are there, the ability to have children be assessed in school.",
        "And that's usually where the assessment takes place.",
        "It's not in the doctor's office.",
        "It's - these are kids that are not doing well in school, and then the teachers and the school psychologists gather data on that child and bring it back to the physician.",

        "Again there's - this is a complicated disorder.",
        "It's a brain-based disorder when it's real.",
        "And then the real question here is, like you say, these numbers are rising, so are these just milder cases.",
        "What are the other explanations for that?",
        "I think by definition of ADHD, the problem is bad enough that it's causing functional impairment, and that means the child has to be struggling in school.",
        "And usually the data is there.",
        "With the milder cases of the kids that are actually normal who are accounting for part of the increase by getting a label of ADHD and then potentially getting stimulants as study drugs, we don't have any data on that because it's not legal, and it's - we believe as the American Academy of Neurology that it's also not ethical to give children medications who are healthy.",
