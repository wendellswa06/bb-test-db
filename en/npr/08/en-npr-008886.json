        "Yes.",
        "Absolutely, it will.",
        "But unfortunately, it's going to take a little while and economists right now are quite terrified that exactly what's happening to him is how this financial crisis on Wall Street is going to end up on Main Street.",
        "You have to remember that for new business starts something like 70 percent of new businesses in America are started by people taking out loans against equity in their homes and that market's completely dried up.",
        "Lines of credit like for this gentleman are completely dried up and so there's a real fear that that's going to be a problem.",
        "As you may know, yesterday, the federal reserve in the commercial paper market which is essentially loans for businesses, little bigger than this guy's business is.",
        "But businesses with 20-30 people, they had to go in and actually start making the loans directly because with all the terror in Wall Street, no one is lending the businesses of that size anymore.",
        "Dr. Diop also had a question for you.",
        "I run a small business and my line of credit has been cut off with no reason.",
        "My credit is good.",
        "And I want to know what the program is doing to help restore credits for small businesses.",
        "So we talked a little bit about that already but his concern is how's he going to get his credit back.",
        "Well, the problem right now isn't his credit per se.",
        "It's the fact that the banks are completely terrified of lending any money.",
        "The banks right now are under huge scrutiny and pressure because no one knows which banks are holding what toxic assets and the banks are basically hording cash right now because each of them is afraid of a bank run.",
        "They're all afraid that rumors will get out that they're the bank that's in big trouble and that everyone will come to withdraw their money and of course, as you know, banks, the way they money is they take deposits from us and then they lend them out to someone else which means that there's not that much money in the vault at any given time so that if everyone rushes to the bank on a rumor that the bank's about to go bankrupt, to try and be the first one to get some of that vault cash, the whole bank can collapse just on a rumor.",
        "So what the banks are trying to do right now is hold on to as much cash as possible to try and reassure people that there's no need to run up and that there's cash in the vault.",
        "But what that means, though, is they're not lending and so it's not the case that this guy's credit is bad.",
        "Everyone knows that this guy is running a good business and he's always paid on time, but it's the fact that the banks are afraid for themselves that if they lend him the money, they're not going to have any cash in the vault, basically.",
        "It's really, really unfortunate.",
        "Explain to me how the cash in the vault issue and the FDIC insurance tie together for consumers.",
        "Is there- it sounds like there could be a moment where you walk up to your bank and there's just no money to give you.",
        "But then do you get it back later if there's federal insurance?",
        "Cherry, I was interested in that.",
        "They will send someone to wash your car, no matter where it is?",
        "In a manner of speaking, that's correct.",
        "This song was written by a soldiers in 1945 who was actually in Guadalcanal in Solomon Islands, and it's been said that he was trying to tell his family during a time of censorship where he was located.",

        "You guys, how did you get together as a band?",
        "Well, our daughters and nieces danced in a hula halau, which is a school of Hawaiian culture here in the Washington, DC, area, and they needed musicians to play for them.",
        "And all of us were musicians, and we started playing and found out that we could play other things together.",

        "Now I just came back from Honolulu, and I've spent about 10 years in the last--or about maybe five out of the last 10 years there.",
        "And I just want to say to the Aloha Boys and you, Neal, and to the rest of the people listening that Hawaiian music is some of the most beautiful, varied, magnificent music on the face of the Earth.",
        "And for all mainland Americans, if you ever want to hear some really great Hawaiian music, go onto the Internet and turn on thebreezeofhawaii.com, or, also, you might want to turn on--I don't know what their Web site is, but there's a radio station called KINE, K-I-N-E, and you might be able to get some--but the Breeze is the best as far as I'm concerned.",
