        "Well, what's happening right now is they're taking a big nasty hit.",
        "Probably the average person 401K is falling 25, maybe 30 percent in the last year and just to sort of answer the beginning part of the question, basically, what stock market values are, what you're purchasing when you buy say a share of IBM corporation is a share of future profits and so the reason stock prices are falling right now is basically lots of people, most people think that future profits are going to be smaller because they're expecting a recession, they're expecting this credit crisis to carry over into the real economy through channels like the gentleman who had the previous question that his lines of credit are being cut.",
