        "So if that's what ends up happening, then basically, everyone will be OK except for the fact that the stock market might be 10-15 percent lower than it otherwise would have been.",
        "But let me emphasize here, there's one other thing, I'm sort of looking at the broad financial picture, we're going to get a recession.",
        "Unemployment's probably going to pick up about a percent, maybe a little more.",
        "That's literally millions of people who are going to lose their jobs, you know, maybe not permanently, not for the rest there lives, but for six months, eight months, a year.",
        "And that to me is going to be the real human toll, and what really matters here.",
        "The rest of us, if we don't lose our job, are going to scrape by, we're going to be freaked out that 401(k) is down by so much money for few years before things recover.",
        "But it's the people who are about to lose their jobs that really going to take this on the chin for all of us.",
        "Let me go to the international markets issue because, you know, everything seems to be a huge interconnected mass right now, for example some of the European nations were saying get it together America before the U.S passed the bailout plan but their securities don't seem to be doing so well right now.",
        "What exactly is ricochet effect going on right now between U.S markets and the U.S financial situation and other nations?",
        "Well, in one direction, there were,you know, we had a big asset price bubble here, we had all these bad mortgages issued and then people were issuing fancy securities based on whether not those mortgages would pay off and now a lot of them aren't paying off.",
        "The European bought a lot of those, so they're holding a lot of the toxic waste straight now and that's hurting them.",
        "But the thing that have to remember here is that this, you know, this asset price bubble this land bubble, a housing price bubble.",
        "That just wasn't the United States.",
        "They were actually bigger housing price bubbles in England, in Germany, Australia and other countries.",
        "And they were also many, many dubious loan made over there that are also now being defaulted on.",
        "And so, it is going both ways and it certainly as much as European politicians might want to blame this on the United State exporting it's problem over there.",
        "They've had bank failures too, they've had financial firms go under and a lot of it was domestic over there or domestic in their countries.",
        "That being said now going forward, it's unfortunately the case that the Europe's economy has slowed significantly faster than ours which is probably going to hurt us.",
        "For the last year or two when the dollar being so weak, it really was our exports to foreign countries because from their perspective with the weak dollar that allows them to buy a lot of our stuff.",
        "That was really caring the economy here in the United States, and now if their weakening, they're not going to be buying a lot of our stuff and that's going to hurt us.",
        "Speaking of buying stuff in the consumer economy, there's a lot of people who rely on folks who want things versus need things, like they want to go out to dinner.",
        "So, let's take a listen, we have once more from the mall, Mary Miles(ph) and she's from Long Beach California.",
        "I haven't seen any major changes.",
        "I think we're not going to dinner as much.",
        "I know I don't - I used to love to go out.",
        "I don't go out to dinner as much as use to.",
        "So I'm learning how to cook all over again.",
        "Learning how to cook all over again.",
        "That might be good for her, her waist line, you know, the local farmers market who's it bad for?",
        "Well, local restaurants obviously, and you know, in my area here, Vasser College is up in Poughkeepsie, New York a little bit north from New York City, I talked to local restaurateurs and they've definitely noticed it.",
        "Also there's been shift, you know, towards people going out to the local diner which is less expensive than to the fancy restaurants and things like that.",
        "And so, you know, just as a little anecdote along these lines last Monday, week go Monday when, you know that was a really, really bad day on Wall Street although, there has now been many really bad days on Wall Street.",
        "For the SNP 500 stocks, every single one of them fell except for Campbell Soup, so maybe...",

        "Yes, comfort food and maybe people thinking a good cheap meal will do well in a recession.",
        "When you take a look ahead, there's been this cut in short term interest rates.",
        "What does that really mean for people on the day to day?",
        "How does that ripple down?",
        "Well, we're now getting into something that economists - it's a fancy term - like to call it liquidity trap.",
        "And the better metaphor is pushing on a string, right if you try to move something, you know, you might, tie string to it and then you pull the other end right, but if you push at the string nothing happens.",
        "And so right now, the Federal reserve has the following nasty problem and it's happen in several countries over the last hundred years which is that even though the Federal reserve is lowering interest rates which is another way of saying it's making more money available to banks because the banks can borrow the fed from the Fed that the low interest rate.",
        "And then what supposed to happen under normal circumstance is they borrow the Fed that the low interest rate and they turn around and give the money to you at the little higher interest rate and then they make a little money on the spread there.",
        "But what's happening right now is the Fed lowering the interest rates but the banks are bothering to borrow much from the Fed because there's so terrified as we talked about before about lending to you and me.",
        "That even though the Fed is in sometimes pushing on the string, trying to push all this money at the banks, the banks aren't turning around and making loans out in the wider economy.",
        "And so, the Fed is kind stuck here, and it's good they're doing everything they can.",
        "They are shoveling money into the banks as fast as they can.",
        "But if the banks don't turn around and lend that money, it's not really going to work very well.",
        "And that's why I call liquidity trap, that you know, the liquidity cash is floating around but it doesn't' seem to do anything so it's stuck in the trap like drain trap.",
        "All right, who's going to win, who's going to win out of all this economic distress because somebody always makes money.",
        "So, who's it going to be besides Campbell Soup?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's great.",
        "Do you have a question for Will?",
        "When the panic it might only felling for 35 right now, so to the extent that some people are going to come in and be willing to buy right now where while everyone else is panicking in selling.",
        "They're the people who eventually they going to get make some money.",
        "But on the other hand that takes a lot of courage, and it also mean you have to have access to cash right now that you can't buy anything, among other reasons, because you can't get a loan, you can't buy anything with other people's money right now.",
        "So, pretty much people like Warren Buffet who's been conservative and had $10 or 20 billion dollars in cash lying around in his company Berkshire Hathaway investment fund who go in right now.",
        "You know, he paid $5 billion for large chunk of Goldman Sachs.",
        "He's going to end up making lot of money out of this because the stock market had driven Goldman Sachs' share price down unreasonably low in the middle of this panic.",
        "Well, you know what.",
