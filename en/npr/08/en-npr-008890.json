        "There are situations - some of them have been publicized - where people have committed murder and tried to cover them up as a suicide.",
        "Typically in those cases, medical examiners can figure it out because, number one, the scene isn't secure or, number two, the murderer doesn't really know enough forensics and during the struggle of the murder, they cause injury to the body that's then detected at the autopsy examination, injuries such as a broken hyoid bone.",
        "That's a very delicate bone that's in the neck at the base of the tongue, and if you strangle somebody with your hands, you can break it very easily.",

        "The physical findings in the autopsy report support the fact that this is a self-inflicted injury or a suicide.",

        "It's the scene and circumstances that still need to be elucidated.",
        "And there are still questions that are being raised by the justification for her arrest.",
        "There are still questions legitimately being raised about the jail's violation of their own procedures.",
        "There's the intake forms at the jail where she checked off that she had a prior suicide attempt.",
        "The jail had protocols with regards to giving people mental health support when they check off the previous suicide attempt box, and that was not provided in this case.",
        "And that is a tragedy.",
