        "He actually wanted to go back to school, but he was washing cars for a while.",

        "I always see much more of what's going when I'm the passenger in the car looking about, rather than the driver paying attention to traffic.",
        "And Alvin Case(ph) wrote from Boston: I found that where police officers actually live in the communities they serve, there appeared to be a tendency to mitigate crime just from their own knowledge of the area where they were patrolling.",

        "This is a very offensive and degrading way to describe a human being.",
        "By calling someone a jumper, you're shaming him or her and lumping that individual into a group of people that have already fulfilled the potential of that term.",
