        "I mean, was your data basically showing that if you look at life expectancy, you see a much shorter time for elephants in zoos than you do in elephants in these two wild - well, not wild, but two natural populations?",
        "Yeah, essentially.",
        "I mean, how much shorter depends on the species.",
        "We saw the least worrying picture for the African elephants, and in this species, we found that infant mortality in European zoos was pretty much fine.",
        "There was no difference between it and what you saw in Amboseli.",
        "Juvenile survivals - so, that's for animals aged between one and 10 - again, seemed just absolutely fine.",

        "So, amongst the zoo animals, they just have less of a chance of reaching middle age and old age.",
        "So, they die at a faster rate in their 20s, 30s and 40s.",
        "And actually, in Europe so far, no African elephant has reached past the age of 50; although in Amboseli, over a third of animals would.",
        "But in this species, we saw some good news as well.",
        "We looked to see whether things had changed in recent years, because obviously husbandry and veterinary care have changed a lot since 1960, and for the African elephants, we found that there was a significant improvement over time.",
        "So, in recent years, the survivorship of the species has improved.",
        "So, that's great.",
        "For the Asian elephants, which are the far the more endangered of the two species, the pattern was a bit more worrying.",
        "We could see no signs of improvement over time and that was true for infant mortality, juvenile mortality and adult mortality.",
        "There was just no significant difference over the four decades.",
        "And we found that for captive-born animals, there was a really a marked difference.",
        "So, the medium life span of a female elephant born into a European zoo was about 19.",
        "That means half are dead by 19; half live longer.",
        "And in the Myanmar working animals, the median life span was 42, so over twice as long.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, Paul Boyle, let me turn to you and say, I mean, what do you make of this?",
        "First of all, I mean, I know it's a European zoo population - so, it may or may not be relevant to U.S.",
        "populations - but does this seem possible or reasonable to you?",
        "Dr. BOYLE: Well - and first of all, I want to thank NPR Science Friday for delving into this, because it does allow us to identify some of the flaws in the science behind this article.",
        "The first thing I want to say is that the term zoo is really misused as a generic term here.",
        "There's a wide range of quality of venues that hold animals.",
        "So, we represent the best in North America, the accredited zoos that are members of AZA.",
        "And those venues of animals range down to roadside menageries, and they exist in all countries of the world.",
        "So, the dataset that was used in this study, if you go to - the sites where the data is - exists range from some of the best zoos through Europe to those roadside menageries.",
        "But they've taken of all that data, put it into one bucket, and it's muddled the information in a way that artificially biases the answer of median age to a much lower number.",
        "So, you think if the population, for example - and I believe there have been studies out of U.S.",
        "zoos that if you look at the, as you called - what does it mean to be an accredited zoo, by the way?",
        "How does that qualify - how do you qualify for that?",
        "Dr. BOYLE: Well, the AZA, the Association of Zoo and Aquarium accreditation process is the most comprehensive and stringent in the world.",
        "It's an incredibly intensive investigation of all aspects of an institution's operation, with significant attention paid to pushing the envelope of animal care and welfare and standards for the keeping of animals.",
        "So, you know, we're - another thing that really bothers us about this article is that dataset goes back to 1960s.",
        "The data is - goes back 50 years.",
        "Now, in one respect, you could say, well, isn't that a wonderful comprehensive study?",
        "But you know, this is kind of like analyzing the success of heart transplants.",
        "If you included data back to the 1960s, you know, you would end up with an artificially low number for success, because all fields that depend on science to drive them forward have major advances, especially in the past several decades.",
        "So, a specific comment here, you know, when you look at the survivorship, the median age of African elephants in North American accredited zoos, they're - the age is 33 in zoos and it's 33 in the wild."

        "And again, that's looking at a wild population broadly that is exposed to various threats like poaching, I would assume.",

        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "So, we used data from the European stud books, which are animals that are part of the European endangered-species managements plan.",
        "So, one issue was the range of zoos; another issue was that we've looked at animals over the past four decades.",
        "And basically, we had to do that to build up a large enough sample size to run decent survivorship analyses.",
        "But we absolutely take the point that things should have improved in recent years, which is why we looked for that, and we did find optimistic signs in the African elephant, but we didn't find any significant improvement over time for Asian elephants.",
        "But we did look for that, because obviously that's a very pertinent question.",
        "His last comment was the average life span in North American zoos he claims his 33 years, and he's getting this from a paper that calculated average life span excluding infant mortality.",
        "So, that's kind of cheating.",
        "If you exclude a period in which lots of young are dying and just ignore that and then start from year one and calculate an average from there, of course you're going to get a higher value than is true.",
        "He's also comparing this average lifespan that excludes infant mortality with figures in Amboseli that include it, which is clearly cheating.",
        "You've got to compare like with like here.",
        "And that's exactly what we did in our paper; we compared like with like.",
        "So, we looked at infant mortality; we compared that across the various populations, juvenile mortality, and adult survivorship, too.",
        "OK.",

        "Yeah, just a brief comment.",
        "In our analyses, one of the risk factors for early deaths that we found, at least in the Asian species, was actually being transferred between zoos.",
        "And we found that each time a female is moved to another site, she has an elevated risk of dying that lasts about four years after that move.",
        "And I think it'd be really important to identify why some animals die during this vulnerable period, while other animals are absolutely fine.",
        "And one idea that struck me is that animals that are moved from a large, naturalistic enclosure - and obviously, there are some really great looking zoos out there - I wonder if animals that are moved from a large, naturalistic enclosures to smaller ones fare badly, whereas animals that are moved from the smaller, perhaps city-style zoos to large enclosures survive the transfer fine.",
