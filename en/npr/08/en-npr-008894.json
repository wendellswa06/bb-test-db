        "OK.",
        "Thanks, Louis.",
        "Dr. Boyle, is there any possibility that it's something as simple as that they just can't move around as much?",
        "There are differences between the two species.",
        "African elephants are known to move great distances, although a lot of that movement can be driven by the search for food and water.",
        "It's a known fact that Asian elephants, if food and water are abundant, often don't move much at all.",
        "So, do these animals need to walk?",
        "Do they need to move?",
        "Of course, they do.",
        "And that's why our enclosures provide space that's adequate for them to move around and to deal with plant material and so on, and that's why, as we've learned more and more about the science of elephants, our institutions are in a major - and have been for the past five to eight years and will be for the next five to eight years - major improvements in increases in size and space and accommodations for elephants.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Let's take another call now.",
        "Can I comment on the question?",
        "Sure.",

        "Some data have literally just come out from the UK, actually.",
        "They came out yesterday as well.",
        "Ah, yes.",
        "The DEFRA study.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "And here, a scientific team from Bristol University surveyed the entire UK elephant population, and they found that over half of the animals were overweight, but the good news was the degree to which animals were overweight varied a lot between zoos, and it seemed to be less of a problem where you had larger enclosures.",
        "Currently, the average enclosure in Europe seems to be about 3,000 square meters, but obviously, there's huge variation.",
        "Almost all of them seem to be under one square kilometer, and even Asian elephants in the wild roam tens of square kilometers.",
        "So, there's a big difference in the scope for physical activity.",
        "Whether that's really a welfare problem and whether that's really the cause of their possible fatness is obviously an empirical issue.",
        "But I'm not sure what the average enclosure size is in North America.",
        "I don't know if Mr. Boyle has that figure..."

        "Tom, we're going to have to take to a break, but if you can give us a quick question, we maybe can consider it after the break.",
        "Sure.",
        "I was just wondering, it sounds like the study compared European zoos with African reserves, and I'm wondering if they accounted for the difference in the climates, as far as temperature, humidity, how that could affect longevity.",
        "Interesting, because it is a lot colder, I'd say, on average in Europe.",
        "Well, that's a question we're going to have leave for after the break, but stay with us because we'll address Tom's question, and we'll hear more about elephants and their lives.",

        "I'm Joe Palca.",
        "We're talking about elephants with Georgia Mason.",
        "She's the author of a new study in Science Magazine that compares life expectancies of elephants in European zoos with those in certain wild populations.",
        "And also, Paul Boyle.",
        "He's a vice president for conservation and education at the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in Silver Spring, Maryland.",
        "And we had a call from Tom, who raised the interesting question, I think, about whether the difference in lifespan, which Dr. Mason noted that elephants lived - tended to live a shorter time and there's some question about - there's an argument about whether these data actually are reflective of the true situation.",
        "But they are certainly provocative and would make people want to look at the question.",
        "But the question was, can you explain the possibility that animals are living a shorter time in zoos in Europe compared to the wild by simply asking the climate?",
        "I mean, you were talking about the UK.",
        "It's cold and raw this time of year in the UK.",
        "And I'm sure an elephant that was born and evolved to live in the African jungle has got a kind of a different experience."

        "Yeah.",
        "It's a really great question.",
        "Our data came from over 230 zoos scattered across Europe, Scandinavia and the former U.S.S.R.",
        "So, we've got warm zoos in Italy, and Israel and Spain.",
        "We've got cold zoos up in the north of Scandinavia.",
        "I don't know if there's a systematic difference, but it's a really great question and maybe it's something we should look for.",
        "We think - and one possible problem with cold, wet or snowy zoos is that then animals tend to be kept inside for relatively long periods.",
        "So, this recent study out of the UK shows that elephants are typically locked in overnight for 10, 12, even more hours each day, which may be a problem.",
        "We certainly know that induces stereotypic behavior.",
        "I mean, if I had to boil down the differences between our protected populations in Africa or in Asia where they're living much longer, I'd say one difference is that they're probably more physically fit there.",
        "Another difference is that their social groups are more natural in structure; they're more stable; daughters stay with their mothers.",
        "And then the other is, of course, the climate.",
        "So, how warm it is, how humid it is and also, what kind of vegetation they're eating.",
        "My name is Cyril Scott.",
        "I come from Rosebud, I am the tribal president.",
        "What I expect to achieve from this conference is unity, to save our children...",
        "Well, Dr. Boyle, I'm going to turn to you, and you're going to have the final word in this segment, I'm afraid, because we've run out of time.",
        "But I do want to get your perspective on, you know, whether this study raises questions for you and whether or not, you know, there's just always going to be an issue about animals in a captive situation, trying to compare their lives and their happiness and their life expectancy with those in the wild.",
        "Well, there's always going to be a question, because there are people out there who just don't want animals to be in captivity, which brings me to the point that I really want to make here, and that is that a point that gets left out of the discussion here completely, and that's about education.",
        "You know, Ian Douglas-Hamilton, researcher in Africa, is on record actually in ScienceNOW, I think, as saying this article presents an unrealistic image of elephants in the wild.",
        "And he goes on to say that zoos play a significant role in the education of children and adults for conservation.",
        "You know, we have a generation of kids growing up today in the United States - and if you're familiar with the book by Richard Louv called \"\"Last Child in the Woods,\"\" there's a 7th grader in Los Angeles who's quoted on the cover leaf there saying, I mostly play indoors because that's where the electrical outlets are.",
        "You know, as we urbanize more and more, zoos and aquariums are the windows into nature for the next generation, and that's why these institutions, the accredited zoos and aquariums in North America, serve a population annually of 175 million family groups.",
        "That includes 50 million kids, 15 million students.",
        "And these institutions are the places where this coming generation is learning what an elephant is.",
        "So, as we look at the rampant poaching that's occurring around the world that's wiping these populations out, and the fragmentation of their habitats that has them on a trajectory towards extinction, these institutions are the places that can save them for the future and especially can educate lots of people about why elephants are important and we should continue to have them on this planet.",
        "That's the work of these zoos.",
        "There seems to no question that that is the case, but I think, in defense of what Dr. Mason is pointing out in this article, there are issues that need to be addressed, and as noble as the cause is, it's always good to take a good hard look at what you're doing and making sure.",
        "If I could just add to that by saying we are the ones identifying these issues.",
        "Can I possibly interject?"
