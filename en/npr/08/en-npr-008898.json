        "Let's see if we get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Ed, and Ed with us from Hunt in Michigan.",
        "Yes.",
        "I traveled the Grand Turk a lot, and what I'm wondering, I talked some of my friends there.",
        "Most of them have lost roofs.",
        "I think I only know one person who did not.",
        "But while I was really wondering if you or your listeners could find out, is what happened to Salt Key?",
        "It's an even smaller, flatter island right next to Grand Turk.",
        "It has about 90 people on it.",
        "I have some very good friends there and everything I've read says they don't know if anybody's there or not.",
        "We'll do our best to find out, we're trying to get through to Grand Turk now and we're hoping to be able to get some more information there.",
        "But if you travel there a lot, it's a very low-lying island.",
        "Is it not?",
        "Well Grand Turk is very low-lying, there's basically one hill on the island.",
        "And it's very low, probably rises 12 to 14 foot out of the water is all.",
        "Salt Key, which is next to it, only rises about eight-foot except for one hill that isn't big enough to have a house on it.",
        "So there's very little, they're very few places for people to go in the event of the storm like this?",
        "In case of the storm like this on Salt Key, there's basically the one rise on the north side of the island.",
        "And other than that, you're dealing with four and five feet above water, above sea level.",
        "Those islands are protected by reefs, but obviously in the event of a big storm, that's little protection?",
        "Well, and they really aren't unprotected by reefs.",
        "It's what's called, I don't - what I go there for diving.",
        "And that's wall diving, 200 feet off of the shore of both Grand Turk and Salt Key.",
        "You end up with a cliff that goes down two miles in part of the Cayman Trench.",
        "So you have not even a reef until you're like within 200 feet of the island.",
        "Ed, we'll do our best to get through and find out what information we can.",
        "Thank you so much."

        "Good to speak with you.",
        "Thank you, Neal, my pleasure.",
        "And where is Ike now?",
        "Well, Ike is moved off-shore of south of Cuba, into the Caribbean, and back over water which means perhaps a little bit of intensity increase as it again joins that source of energy over those warm waters.",
        "Moving right now, west around 14 miles per hour, should cross the western side of Cuba during the day, Tuesday.",
        "Afraid so, yes.",
        "Wide open waters there looking for intensification as it continues then to move on a more northwesterly course.",
        "Now one of the differences we were told between Katrina and Gustav, which both hit Louisiana of course, was that Katrina lingered longer over the Gulf of Mexico and intensified.",
        "Obviously the tracks of the storm are different, every storm is different.",
        "But, does Ike look to - look like the possibility of re-forming into a major storm?",
        "Well I think, Neal, you've made some good ideas there, that the maybes which were always putting in our forecast.",
        "But indeed, the Gulf of Mexico waters are warm.",
        "We are expecting some intensification and right now, most of the models and the NHC forecast - the National Hurricane Center forecast is calling for Ike to regain major status as a low-end category three.",
        "Low-end category three, so up near what?",
        "A hundred and twenty miles an hour?",
        "Right, 115, 120 would qualify that.",
        "Which is still awfully, awfully powerful.",
        "And the cone - the places it might go or the predictions of where it might go, that's still pretty large?"

        "Yes, it is.",
        "That five-day forecast is certainly a good one these days but anytime you're forecasting the weather and also these capricious storms, you have to be really leery of pinpointing, but certainly, those areas along the upper Texas coast and the southern and the coastline of Louisiana need to really watch the storm over the next couple of days as it moves from Cuba into the Gulf.",
        "So, our friends in Houma might have another problem on their hands.",
        "Well, we certainly hope not.",
        "They don't want two of these I'm sure.",
        "I'm sure they don't.",
        "Also, even if you're not close to where the eye of the storm reaches land, they could be pretty large, too.",
        "Well, indeed they can be and Ike, we saw even with some of the tropical storms that have made landfall, we take Faye for instant that went over Florida and the copious amounts of rain over two feet of rain in some places.",
        "So, it doesn't just take the winds, you still have to deal with the heavy rainfall and then the storm surge along the coast.",
        "And if you're unfortunate enough to have that storm surge coincide with high tide, you've got another problem.",
        "You certainly do.",

        "We got hammered by Faye as the meteorologist was just saying, we had enormous amounts of rain both south and north of us.",
        "And we sit near the St. Johns River so contending with flooding, we still have communities under water from Faye.",
        "So, when Hanna came by we were all praying she would stay far enough away that we wouldn't get any rain.",

        "Well, I think DeBarry is still struggling with at least a foot of water in some areas near the country club and that's the worst hit area and the St. Johns River is still at maximum flood stage and rising, because all the water that' fell in Melbourne flows downstream which for the St. Johns River is north towards Jacksonville.",
        "So we're still contending with flood level along the St. Johns.",
        "And so, this is something - there must be a strange sense of - you look at this track of the storm and you realize it's going to - you know, you look at Ike and it's going to cause terrible problems for people somewhere else.",
        "Exactly.",
        "There's that odd sense of relief that it's not us this time and especially after 2004 where our little community got hit three times, it's - like I said, it's a strange sense of gratitude.",
        "You feel for other people and you want to put on your Red Cross vest and go out and do your thing, but at the same time, you're glad you're not working your chainsaw in your own yard.",

        "Thirty miles south of the Bahamas sits Grand Turk Island, seven miles long, one and a half miles wide.",
        "Grand Turk is the seat of government of the Turks and Caicos Island and early Sunday, it took the brunt of hurricane Ike and joining us now is Rachel Harvey.",

        "I'm very well.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Providenciales as far as I understand it got some damage but nothing like Grand Turk.",
        "I would say Lil' Kim.",
        "In her heyday, rapper Lil' Kim was styled by Misa Hylton.",
        "Misa was pretty much putting her in drag - chain mail bras, breasts out, butt out, everything.",
