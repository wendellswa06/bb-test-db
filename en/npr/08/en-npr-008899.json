        "So we had experienced some flooding before and then, Ike came and just, icing of the cake - if I could put that way.",
        "So, we have been reeling under the effects of two storm systems back to back.",
        "And when Ike hit, it was category four and very powerful.",
        "That is true.",
        "That is correct.",
        "When Ike hit, it came aboard - I had power on at night until two a.m. so I was able to see it heading directly for our capital, Grand Turk.",
        "And it was not a pretty sight on the screen so I could just imagine what it was going to do to that island.",
        "Grand Turk is of course, the seat of government.",
        "Are people in Providenciales in contact with the government at all?",
        "We have been - people have been in contact with Grand Turk.",
        "The cell site's up and down.",
        "Sometimes, I mean, people can get through.",
        "I know for a fact that some people are in to assess what the damage is and to see how quickly things can be turned around to get full restoration of services into Grand Turk.",
        "I've sent out a broadcast text message to the nation so that people there would know where to go in terms - there's a meeting that was held around noon today to let the residents, I guess, to give them an update.",
        "I'm not sure on what was discussed.",
        "But I heard that one of the British naval ships is there at - I mean, at the port in Grand Turk.",
        "But I don't have that much more information but what I do know is that there has been a lot of damage.",
        "People lost their homes.",
        "I'm actually from the island of South Caicos and I've been in contact with my family members there.",
        "And they're in - South Caicos sustained a lot of damage to a lot of homes.",
        "And the roof tops and so you know what goes along with a hurricane and we got some of that this time around.",
        "Sure, we had one listener call with a question about what happened to the people who live on Salt Key, any word at all?",
        "I'm not sure what happened with the Salt Key residents.",
        "I do know that the government had issued a mandatory evacuation for all residents.",
        "Now, you know, in a hurricane, there are times when people don't go.",
        "So, I have not heard whether or not anyone stayed or what's the status there.",
        "So I can't give any information on that part of things.",
        "And finally, Providenciales, a major tourist city, obviously business has got to be really badly affected.",
        "Well, I know just before Ike hit, an advisory went out so that tourists and non-residents had an opportunity to leave before the hurricane hit.",
        "But I'm living in the Leeward Palms(ph) area and surprisingly, there were some of my neighbors who had power straight through the hurricane.",
        "They never lost power.",
        "And there are some people who have electricity as well now.",
        "I don't think Providenciales got hit as badly as the other islands, South Caicos, Grand Turk and Salt Key.",
        "So, I think that it might be a shorter time in getting service restored - services restored on Providenciales.",
        "Rachel Harvey, thank you very much and good luck to you."
