        "And you used mathematics to figure this out?",
        "Well, I didn't, but a professor of mathematics at Macalester College and one of his students did that.",
        "And they use this stuff called social network analysis, which is what the NSA uses to identify key terrorists and, you know, the people that they want to send the drones after.",
        "But these guys at Macalester College took that same method and applied it to \"\"Game Of Thrones.",
        "Is it as simple as they just add up all the mentions on social media platforms or what?",
        "In a sense it is.",
        "It's a matter - it's - look at the networks, you look at the strengths of the connections between the networks and almost always you find that one or two nodes come to the top, and they're the most important nodes.",
        "And they're the ones who, in a terrorist network, if you take them out, it causes significant damage to the network.",
        "And in the case of \"\"Game Of Thrones,\"\" if you took out Tyrion, it would make a huge difference to the rest of the story.",
        "So he's the one that is most likely to survive through the entire series.",
        "Unless of course he gets a better offer from another series and they decide they have to write him out.",
        "But I'm interested in the fact that it can be used to penetrate what's going on in a supposedly secret terrorist network.",
        "When you start talking about terrorists network, then of course it gets to be real big.",
        "In fact, the reason the NSA and now the FBI want to dragnet information about everybody is the bigger the network is that you perform it on, the more accurate the results you're going to get.",
        "So when you take this idea that can be applied to \"\"Game Of Thrones\"\" and plug it into the network of everybody that's on the internet and everybody that's using mobile phones, which the NSA can do thanks to enormous computing power, then you get results that you wouldn't be able to figure out any other way because things surface that would be otherwise lost in the sea of communications.",
        "Have you applied this to any other endeavors?",
        "Yeah, in fact my own institute at Stanford did this a few years ago to look at entrepreneurship and start-up companies.",
        "We did one study where we compared Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley and MIT to see which one was the most entrepreneurial and in terms of start-up companies and the companies that they - how much money they make and so forth.",
