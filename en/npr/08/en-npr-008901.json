        "But they did warn me, so I just sort of sat back and enjoyed it.",
        "What was the point of the whole thing?",
        "Well, the point of this experiment is that - I mean, we knew that people who are long-term blind, the parts of their brain that would normally be processing vision, they process other things.",
        "But the question was does that happen over many years?",
        "Is it only as a result of, like, permanent blindness or what happens?",
        "And this particular researcher who dreamt up this experiment, Alvaro Pascual-Leone at Harvard, he didn't think that was what was happening.",
        "He thought that probably any brain have the capacity to just switch over, you know?",
        "If vision is cut out then, you know, maybe that part of the brain will just reach out to some other sense to try to get information."
