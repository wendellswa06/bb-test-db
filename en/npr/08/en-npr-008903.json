        "There was a - during World War II, a famous series of starvation experiments led by Ancel Keyes in which volunteers agreed to basically starve themselves down the skin and bones so that people could learn not only the effects of starvation but how they could counter those effects because the Allied Forces were expecting to encounter a lot of starving people after World Wart II, and they just needed to know, you know, how can we treat them.",
