        "And this was a study where people would - thought, you know, had no problem with shocking, basically shocking other people to death.",
        "Right.",
        "Giving them the equivalent of 450 volts.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They would kill other people at the command of an experimenter.",
        "The experimenter - he wouldn't apply any kind of force.",
        "He would simply say the experiment requires that you continue and that would be enough for people just to keep pushing that shock button and in their mind killing another person which really again underlines how amazingly obedient people - how much people are willing to obey whatever crazy thing an experimenter comes up, you know, dreams up in their mind.",
        "So no one - and you said they weren't, of course, really killing people.",
        "They just thought…",
        "Right.",

        "There was an actor screaming.",
        "Yeah, there were screaming and banging on the walls.",
        "And - but then the most frightening thing was when it got up to around 450 volts and the screaming just stops and there is silence and, you know, the implication is that this person is dead, and yet the people just keep pushing the button when the experimenter says the experiment must continue.",
        "I think - I believe it was about 60 percent of people, just random people chosen from the area around New Haven will just keep pushing that button.",
        "It's - I mean, it's kind of shocking, you know, (unintelligible)…",

        "They said, were you told that you can withdraw anytime you want and did you understand everything.",

        "The blind was drawn and I still have the blindfold on and the experimenter put a towel over my head and then he said, you know, you can take the blindfold off.",

        "And it was - the inside of the towel in a completely dark room was glowing to me.",
        "Wow.",
        "It was as though it works like ambers.",
        "And then after a few minutes, I could, you know, start to distinguish the texture of the towel.",
        "We took that off of my head and I could sort of see the room and some of the things in the room.",
        "And I made the mistake of looking down at my legs which made me very dizzy.",
        "And they were radioactive, just so bright.",
        "It was shocking, so I had to look up again.",
        "But then over the course of maybe 15 minutes, I started to be able to see things, you know, on the wall and the table and all the things that I had actually been trying to mentally keep track of all that time.",
        "But it took about 30 or 40 minutes before my head movement.",
        "You know, my vision and my head movement agreed on how things were going.",

        "It was like watching a sort of a, you know, a series of images clicking by instead of that smooth thing we normally see, that smooth image we normally see.",

        "I felt that I was stumbling a little bit over the next 48 hours.",
        "But the vision maybe took 30, 35 minutes before I could see pretty much normally again.",
        "Do you have another experiment you'd like to - or you're anticipating?",
        "You know, I'm not planning on it although it is an interesting way to learn about science.",
        "I mean - my job is to write about science.",
        "And I do - it is interesting to watch it unfold from the inside.",
        "So I guess someday I might do something again - not blindfolding, something else."
