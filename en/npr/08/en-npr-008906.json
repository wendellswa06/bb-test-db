        "Well, some of them variance in genes, some of them genetic regions that we use new technologies to scan the human genome for inherited variants that are associated with increased risk of breast cancer.",
        "And we identified some strong associations and confirmed one of these in three additional studies.",
        "The other groups concern additional genetic regions and the variance in those genes associated with breast cancer risk.",
        "And so what - what use do you make of this finding now?",
        "So at this point, I think the key thing to know is that there'll be more findings soon.",
        "We're using a new generation of technology that's been (unintelligible) by The Human Genome Project and the human (unintelligible) type map project that defines genetic variation around the world.",
        "And these new technologies allow us to look at gene variants that convey much lower degrees of risk than BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are the classic, very high-risk genes.",
        "And so, this is really the first reports of probably a series of reports as we really access these lower-risk genes for the first time.",
        "So are you saying you have a more sensitive task that brings out other risky genes that we might not have seen before?",
        "That's correct.",
        "It's basically - what we had to before was essentially look in families in which there was a very, very high burden of breast cancer.",
        "So by definition, the risks had to be very high for the variance from those genes in order to create those families with a very high burden.",
        "But most women with breast cancer either don't have a family history or just had a single family member who's been diagnosed with breast cancer and don't come from these very high-risk families."

        "So the new generation of technology allows us to look at more than 500,000 variants across the genome and detect the location of these gene variants by screening thousands of women with breast cancer and thousands of women without breast cancer, but those women don't necessarily have to have a strong family history.",
        "1-800 - 1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Talking with David Hunter.",
        "Can you then theoretically continue screening and find even more variants that way?",
        "Almost certainly we will.",
        "These papers are really the first fruits of this new approach, and in our own study, we're actually calling deeper through the initial scan.",
        "We're taking large numbers of gene variants that are, well, weakly associated with breast cancer in the initial scan, seeing if they are associated in large studies.",
        "And it's very, very likely that there'll be more of these lower-risk variants discovered in the next months and years.",
        "You mentioned briefly about comparing them to the BRCA1 and two genes that really produced a significant increase in the risk of breast cancer.",
        "Can you give me an idea of one - something that you found - and compare it to the - to how they might compare to those two genes?",
        "Sure.",
        "So the variants that we found were in the gene called FGFR2, Fiber Glass Growth Factor Receptor 2, which wasn't really a gene that had been previously associated with at least inherited risk of breast cancer.",
        "And the risk variance there that we find are associated with about a 20-percent increase in risk if a woman carries a single copy and about a 60-percent increase in risk if a women carries two copies.",
        "And that compares with BRCA1 and BRCA2, where the risk increases more like 2,000 percent.",
        "So, we're comparing sort of a 1.5 fold here with 20 fold plus with the BRCA1 and the BRCA2.",
        "The big difference is that the mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BCA2 fortunately is fairly rare in the population.",
        "Less than one percent of the women in U.S.",
        "carry mutations on those genes, whereas now, we're finding genetic variants that actually the majority of women carry, but they give rise to a much more modest increase in risk.",
        "Did that give you - does that make you feel better that you find more of these variants in women, or does it make you feel worse that there might be more women at risk?",
        "Well, you know, we've known that breast cancer is a very common disease.",
        "About 11 percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime.",
        "So it's been very frustrating that through BRCA1, BRCA2, these very high-risk genes, we've only been able to explain a very small fraction of breast cancer risk.",
        "So this gives me hope that we're going to understand a much, much bigger piece of the inherited risk of breast cancer.",
        "And if we do that, we understand more about the mechanisms of beast cancer, and that may lead to better means of prevention and potentially treatments.",
        "At - at what point do doctors start, then, screening women for these other kinds of risk?",
        "Not yet - for two reasons.",
        "I think there'll be more variants soon, and it's only once we have the complete list of variants that we'll really be able to sensibly put them all on the table and work out which variants it would make sense to screen for in which combinations.",
        "That may only be two or three years away, but we're not there yet."
