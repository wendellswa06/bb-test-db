        "The other reason is that we very rarely screen for risk of disease if there's no advise we can give that will then ameliorate that risk or alter that risk.",
        "And the real challenge here is, as we understand how better to sort out high from medium from lower risk for breast cancer - and in fact all common diseases - the real challenge is going to be then working out what advice we can give to allow people who are at high risk to reduce that risk, and that will require maybe several more years before we're really confident that we've got good evidence to give that advice.",

        "And thinking what they might have in common is, like, World War II or a Navy chemical exposure.",
        "And I know they aren't testing people for how much exposures they get to these chemicals, and if they're in the air.",
        "And when I look at this book and I look under associated risk factors for all kinds of cancers, it's talking about vinyl chlorides, it's talking about I - you know, like radiation exposure, and nobody seems to want to talk about that.",
        "And I was wondering, you know, why that is, because my idea of how the genes work is that the genes are either turned on or turned off by what we're not quite sure.",
        "But, you know, it sounds like - by looking at this book - that it's chemical exposure that's doing it.",
        "Dr. Hunter?",
        "I think that that's a really good point.",
        "I mean, we know that environment and lifestyle are tremendously important for breast cancer and other diseases, and the data you refer to, which shows that in certain parts of the country, breast cancer rates are higher than other parts of the country has been a very, very active focus of research - the possibility exists that some of the pollution exposures that you refer to are maybe associated with breast cancer, but it's been very, very difficult to prove.",
        "And some of those geographic variabilities and risks have been shown to be due to different patterns of breast cancer risk factors that we do understand, like the age which a woman has her first child, the number of children, obesity, alcohol consumption.",
        "Those do vary around the country, and they do explain a substantial proportion of the geographic variability in breast cancer rates but not all.",
        "Thank you for calling, Penny.",

        "Is it appearing, as we - as we're able to probe the genome more and more, that cancers are having specific genes for certain cancers rather than, you know, a general gene for a lot of different cancers?"

        "That's pretty much what we're finding, and that raises a whole series of fascinating questions about why these gene variants are so organ-specific and may give us insight into the genesis of cancers at specific sites.",
        "Is it true that only 10 percent of all breast cancers are caused by genetic components?",
        "Well, that's the estimate for the - that's the upper end of the estimate for the, sort of, high-risk genes where there's a strong or at least present family history.",
        "The twin studies suggest that the proportion that's due to inherited genetic variation actually might be substantially higher and up to about 50 percent.",
        "But most of that risk is going to turn out to be these common but low-risk alleles, of which there may turn out to be before we're done…",
        "Right.",
        "…dozens, potentially even hundreds.",
        "So when you say before you're done, is that where you're headed next?",

        "Exactly.",
        "So our group working with National Cancer Institute and the other groups internationally are really very well organized now to use these new technologies to comb through the genome to find these variants that are associated with these more modest degrees of risk.",
        "And then there's a whole other set of research opportunities.",
        "Basically, what's happening is that genes that we have no idea had really anything to do with cancer risks turn out to be involved.",
        "So we're very hopeful that this can open up whole new avenues of research into the causes of cancer.",
