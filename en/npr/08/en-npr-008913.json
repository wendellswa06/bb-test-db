        "My point is that the American consumer doesn't really understand how our fruits and vegetables are produced.",

        "And that if the American consumers understood that, then they would also understand that if these people were paid fair and livable wages that then a salad would cost probably twice as much as a steak.",
        "Does he have a point there?",

        "The last time we heard about the tomato pickers was, indeed, there was a work stoppage, it was a year and a half ago or so.",
        "And they - the associations, the places that buy it, McDonald's for example, agreed to pay a higher price.",
        "All of the major fast food companies in the world have agreed to pay the higher price and Whole Foods has agreed to pay the higher price.",
        "Some big food service companies, you know, that supply cafeterias and nursing homes, have agreed to pay the higher price.",

        "But I also wanted to go to this other point in that while, you know, conditions in a lot of these places are not good - you cover agribusiness - and, indeed, there are a lot of the illegal aliens who work in the picking crops in this country and, particularly, picking citrus and picking tomatoes.",
        "Yes.",

        "And this industry, it's all handwork?",
        "I mean, oranges, they've learn how to harvest by machines.",
        "There's mechanization in the citrus industry, although there is still some handwork done.",
        "But tomato picking has to be - cause tomatoes are very delicate fruits and the plants are delicate, tender plants.",
        "They don't have woody stems.",

        "And then there is the market-base idea that the Coalition of Immokalee Workers is forwarding, and that is that if you get more money to the labor force that the conditions will become normalized, that tomato picking can become a job like a - you know, working at 7-Eleven or the Burger King.",
