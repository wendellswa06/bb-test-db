        "So looking at all of these problems together, what can be done to restore the Gulf, to protect it, to build up its natural resilience?",
        "And as sea levels rise, are we going to be restoring marshes that may be under water in a hundred years?",
        "How do we plan for 50, 200 years into the future?",
        "And aside from the oil's affect on pelicans and sea turtles, how has it affected shrimp, fish, or your oysters on the half shell?",
        "Is Gulf sea food safe to eat?",
        "How are we testing it?",
        "Can you restore the reputation the Gulf once had in people's minds for sea food, the brand, that's coming from the Gulf?",

        "Well, let me begin with you, Don.",
        "Your report calls for better regulation of the oil industry, more funding for scientific research.",
        "Do you think these recommendations are going to be difficult to implement in the current political climate that we have now?",
        "Well, I think anything is going to be difficult in the present climate, but I think we have a very good opportunity.",
        "First of all, the response that we've received so far, not only in the press, but from political leaders, leaders in the industry actually, has been very positive.",
        "Although everyone doesn't agree with every recommendation, there is broad agreement that we need to increase the safety of off-shore oil drilling.",
        "And there's also broad agreement that we need to learn from this lesson and take heed, and help understand the environment better and restore it."

        "And what about the money that's waiting for restoration?",
        "Is it going to go into restoration, do you think, that the, BP has in the coffers there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are two sources under federal statutes of funds that could go to restoration.",
        "First of all, under the oil pollution act of 1990, there's a process by which the responsible party, the companies that are responsible for the spill, have to compensate the trustee agencies - those are the state and federal agencies that have responsibility for the fish and the sea turtles, and all those resources - for the cost of that damage.",
        "And that money then goes to repair the damage due to the spill itself.",
        "In addition to that, under the Clean Water Act, there is a fine that's levied that is based on a per barrel of oil.",
        "And depending on how the courts find the degree of negligence, that could yield anywhere from five to $20 billion, say, of money that would normally go help fund the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, but also go to the federal treasury.",
        "So the argument is going to be: we, all of a sudden, have this money coming from the Clean Water Act, as a result of the damage, isn't it reasonable or logical to use that to repair - not just the damage of the spill -but the longer term problems, the degrading delta, the dead zone, those things.",
        "But that's the argument you're going to have to make to use that money...",
        "Right, right.",
        "'cause that's not where we...",
        "Well, first of all, I think we - actually you mentioned the political polarization.",
        "We start off, actually, I think, in the Gulf coast, with bipartisan consensus, that this is an important thing to do.",
        "So the degree to which that can be worked through Congress, with Republicans convincing their Republican colleagues and Democrats convincing theirs that this is the appropriate thing to do, I think we have a decent shot.",
        "And certainly, we've got our response back from when we met with the president.",
        "I think he'd be very supportive.",
        "We've met with people in industry and police leadership of many of the committees of Congress.",
        "and so I think there's a very likely outcome that we will have some significant new resources to deal with these long term problems.",
        "Well, we talk about the restoration of the Gulf.",
        "Well, whenever you talk to citizens, folks out there, one of the first things they want to know, Tracy Collier, is how safe is the food that's coming out of the Gulf, the fish.",
        "And you folks are involved in testing it, correct?",
        "Or talking about the standards for testing.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And the levels that are being found are essentially background levels.",
        "How do you test the food?",
        "The process is to - first, if an area is oiled, it's off limits.",
        "You don't take seafood from an oiled area.",
        "Once the oil clears after a certain period of time, then you take fish and shellfish from that site, you run them through a series of tests.",
        "First, is what we call organileptic or call it the sniff test.",
        "Basically, people are trained...",
        "What do you call the technical word for sniffing?",
        "The technical word is sniff.",
        "Yeah, that's the technical word.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "So, basically, panels of people are trained to detect the odor of oil and in this case, the odor of dispersant.",
        "And so panels sit in a room and have seafood run in front of them, both raw and cooked, and - until they determine whether or not it smells oiled.",
        "And in fact, of all the re-opening samples from the federal waters when they were re-opened, there were only two detects of an off-odor.",
        "And both of those, when re-tested, came up negative.",
        "After that, once they're subject to this sniff test, then they go to a lab where they're run through a gas chromatographs, mass spectrometers, analytical chemistry to look for levels of what we believe are the most harmful constituents in oil, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",
        "Sorry, there's no other way to say it.",
        "That's okay."

        "Nothing above background has been detected in any of the samples from federal waters that are being re-opened for harvest, for commercial harvest.",

        "Dr.",
        "D'ELIA: I think it's a mixed picture and I think it's early to say really where we are, because a lot of the data that have been collected are not easily available or not put into a form that's summarized and easy to make good conclusions from at this stage.",
        "There's no question that, though, out of activities going on, the federal government has taken scads of samples related to this and the academic community as well.",
        "One of the surprising things to we observers, was how little data you had about this to begin with.",
        "There was - well, you don't even know what the baseline is.",
        "Why are we surprised by this?",
        "Dr.",
        "D'ELIA: Well, certainly in the deep area of the Macondo Well, the baseline data was relatively scarce.",
        "When you get closer to shore, when you get in the near-shore areas that we're very concerned about, and when you get into the marshlands, there actually is a pretty good database available.",
        "For example, our scientists have been studying some of their wetland sites for 40 years.",
        "So there's a very, very good, continuous database in some places.",
        "The problem is spatial coverage isn't necessarily very good."

        "Don, do you have any reaction to that?",
        "Yeah, I think it's - Chris made the point about the deeper Gulf of Mexico was less well-known.",
        "And I think if we reflect on why this is the case, first of all, I was living and working in Louisiana in the '80s, and when I left in 1990, about - only about three percent of the oil produced from the Gulf was coming from greater than 1,000 feet.",
        "Now it's 65 percent.",
        "So in that 20 years, a phenomenal shift, a phenomenal movement, to deep water occurred without the investment in science understanding that environment for the public interest.",
        "Now, the oil companies understood the science that they needed in terms of the deep geology, but the government didn't invest in it.",
        "Why didn't the government invest in it?",
        "Because no one was demanding it.",
        "The - then the agency, the Minerals Management Service, that would conduct these studies, their budget went to about one-fourth or -fifth of what it was several years before, when there was a lot of concern about expanded offshore development in so-called frontier areas.",
        "But there was no real advocate for investing more and understanding the deep Gulf of Mexico when that activity extended in to that working environment.",
        "Is that going to change, do you think?",
        "I think it has.",
        "I think, obviously, you the people are aware of it, not only within the region, but nationally.",
        "But the government -Secretary Salazar - who spoke to this conference two days ago, has requested significant increases in investment in the science.",
        "Could you use some of the penalty money coming from BP or - to do the science that was not...?",
        "The commission looked at the issue of what to do with the penalty money, and our conclusion, after considering - you can imagine, we had, everyone had lots of ideas about what to do with the money.",
        "Our conclusion is that the only thing that made sense and was compelling to the American people is to invest that penalty money in restoration, restoration that worked, that was forward-looking and comprehensive."
