        "Now with that restoration, there needs to be a robust science and technology program to understand what are the best approaches, to make sure that they would last for the long period of times that you talked about, in that they were - they had positive outcomes that could be verified through monitoring.",

        "The government, in its responsibility, should fund the research it needs to make the right leasing decisions.",

        "They're going to focus on the workers.",

        "They're hoping to enlist 55,000 response workers in the study and follow them for 10 years.",
        "And they'll be doing a range of clinical assessments, interviews, looking - and they'll be looking for things like psycho-social disorders, depression, as well as clinical evidence of injury.",
        "Because in - there are just - there's only a handful of studies that have looked at human health after oil spills, and they have not been definitive, large enough or long-term enough.",
        "So we hope to really address this.",
        "Was there any follow-up after the Exxon Valdez spill?",
        "There was some, and it largely focused on psycho-social, basically depression, especially in some of the affected native communities, where, obviously, their way of live, similar to the Gulf, was so tied in to the shorelines.",

        "Not all of it reached the ocean.",
        "About 800,000 barrels were captured at the well head, in various attempts to try to cap the well.",
        "So that's a little over four million barrels.",
        "And the - what happened to that oil is that most of it is effectively gone.",
        "It has either been degraded, decomposed by microorganisms or diluted in the vast Gulf of Mexico to concentrations which are undetectable.",
        "The oil that remains in the Gulf is primarily found in near-shore deposits, along beaches where it got rolled in with sand grains and the like, and in marshes, where it's been just unable - we're not able to remove it from the marshes.",
        "It's better to leave it there...",
        "To leave it there because you'll do more damage.",
        "Or there is evidence now that there's some deposits of oil near the well site, in the deepwater environment, on the seabed.",
        "Some of it seemed to potentially have, in fact, impacted deepwater coral communities, but it is not a layer, a thick layer of oil.",
        "It's very small quantities of oil mixed in with bottom sediments in the deep Gulf.",
        "So about a quarter of the oil is somewhere in the ocean.",

        "The other thing is the way the oil came out of that wellhead was in a jet.",
        "There was a lot of natural gas in the plume.",
        "And what happened was it essentially dispersed it into small micro-droplets, which were able to be dispersed almost as if the Corexit were to do it.",
        "And I think that aided the process of degradation.",
        "That's what I'm beginning to hear from a lot of people.",
        "So the size of the Gulf, and the fact that it came out like a cappuccino maker, almost, I think really benefitted us.",

        "So do we know what effect the dispersants had?",
        "Do we have enough science about that and whether they really worked or what?",
        "Maybe that cappuccino maker did more than the dispersants did, or it did something different.",
        "Yeah, I actually use the metaphor of a sneeze rather than a cappuccino maker - dispersing these droplets out.",
        "But I think Chris' point is well-taken is that that oil in the deep ocean would have been -caused this deepwater plume, between 1,000 and 1,300 meters deep in the water column, with or without the use of dispersants, that the application of dispersants just injected more into that layer.",
        "So the use of dispersants was really a choice between two bad options.",
        "You could either have the oil come to the surface and more of it reach the shore, where it could affect marshes, it could affect pelicans, it could affect, you know, sea turtles.",
        "Or you could inject it into the ocean with risk that you're increasing the concentration of exposure to aquatic marine organisms.",
