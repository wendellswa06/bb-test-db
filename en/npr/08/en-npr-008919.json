        "That's a very strong economic pressure on the administration right now, at a time when they're trying to generate more economic activity, as we heard before.",
        "But on the other side, we've got the countervailing problems of our need to protect the environment and the very real concerns that things like this oil spill have raised in our minds.",
        "So balancing that is going to be very difficult.",
        "I would say that I think the oil commission did us a tremendous service by recommending better ways to approach the industry's operation.",
        "And I think that Secretary Salazar recently announced that he would be reorganizing Minerals Management Service into three separate groups to deal with the different kinds of function that they have to be working on.",
        "I think these are positive steps forward, and I am hopeful that it will allow us to be safe as we try to get more oil out of the ground.",

        "That seems to me to be another 800-pound gorilla in the room, about the Gulf is that the rising sea level, the warming of the oceans.",
        "How is that going to affect, long-term, the Gulf area?",
        "Well, you know, it's not entirely by coincidence that this blowout happened in the year 2010, where we had the world's warmest recorded temperatures around the world.",
        "Because we are so driving to find oil, we're going to go into a riskier, more challenging environments to meet this demand, and there's a larger cost.",
        "You know, there's cost in terms of oil spills, but there's also a cost in increasing the dependence on fossil - continuing to depend on fossil fuels and then increasing the greenhouse and CO2 particularly in the atmosphere and warming the world.",
        "There is no place in this country, arguably, except perhaps the north slope of Alaska, that's more at-risk with respect to global warming than the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "With all the low-lying areas along the coast, sea-level rise is a really big deal there.",
        "It's not just a matter of a few feet of shoreline, it's a matter of a third of the state of Louisiana.",
        "So - I hoped, when this was occurring, that it would force our attention to this dilemma, that we cannot continue this.",
        "We have to move into a renewable energy future.",

        "And maybe we can change the mindset of folks who - from the energy coast, which feel very - appropriately very proud of what they produce, but also realizing that they need to be part of this transition to a renewable future.",

        "And that's something that I'm not sure people are fully aware of, that - for our transportation economy, in particular, we need liquid fuels, and it's not easy to produce those from renewable sources.",
        "Renewable sources may not always be steadily available, and they may not always be abundant enough to meet our needs.",

        "Cultures there are always changing.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And HHS and others there were saying that we know we didn't have enough primary health care, enough mental health care available, and they've scrambling to get it in place.",
