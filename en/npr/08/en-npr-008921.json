        "That's important because it tells us what happens if we have a warming world.",
        "And those methane deposits, those hydrates that Chris talked about, if they are all of the sudden released because the ocean is warming, do they get up in the atmosphere when it's a very potent greenhouse or do the microbes take care of it?",

        "But what I think they also understand is that it's time for them to act as an industry, to move them up to that same high standard.",
