        "I was even offered a buttock lift.",
        "Its value exceeded a 140-pound gift limit, so that daunting task is left undone.",
        "A buttock lift - we had to ask him about that when we spoke to him.",
        "(Laughter) Well, Lebanon is a kind of cosmetic surgery capital of the world.",
        "And so early on, a surgeon came up to me and said, you know, we're glad you arrived.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Please come along and let us fix your buttocks for you.",
        "It's a funny thing to hear.",

        "(Laughter) No.",

        "It is utterly, utterly grim.",

        "And I think if we went back four years and predicted this situation in Syria, most experts - most people who even live in this region - would've expected Lebanon to go under by now because the two countries are so connected.",

        "There isn't really a serious border.",
        "Given all of that, and given the role the Syrians had here for decades, really, in running the country, it's extraordinary that that division in Syria hasn't spilled across the border.",
        "Of course, Lebanon is used to finding a way to survive.",
        "Lebanon's always been fiercely fought over.",
        "When you walk around Lebanon, three of the world's longest-inhabited cities are here, and you can see the tide marks of empires that have come and gone.",

        "This is far too important in my view, than just to sort of go ahead with this and express our opposition without doing more, taking steps to actually stop this from happening.",
        "So why not go even further and tie it to funding?",
        "Because, with all due respect, an authorization can be basically vetoed by the president and he can decide to do what he wants as commander in chief.",
        "Well he might at some point go that route, and that's what it may come to, but I'm reluctant to want to cut off troops from funding they may need over there.",
        "And the better way to approach this it seems to me, is to set the cap on the troop level, have the debate here, and require a new authorization.",
        "If your amendment goes through to require congressional authorization, and in fact is voted upon by both chambers and the president does veto it, what then?",
        "And you do that by setting priorities, and our priority's got to be this global war on terror and supporting our troops and protecting the homeland, and that's what our budget will say.",
