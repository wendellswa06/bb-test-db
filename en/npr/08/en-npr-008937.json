        "You're absolutely right that some of the problems, especially Asia, it's more a question of the fact that world trade has collapsed.",

        "So, they are getting hurt by this.",
        "In other parts of the emerging world, in Eastern Europe let's say in particular, there it's much more this credit crunch where these are countries that have borrowed a lot, borrowed a lot in dollars and Euros and Swiss francs, and they're getting clobbered by now high interest rates and this tightening up of credit that's occurring worldwide.",

        "But more generally, Africa and Latin America are being hurt, but it doesn't seem quite as bad for example, as those in Eastern Europe, their debt levels are not as high.",
        "While they're hurting some because of the big fall in commodity prices - I mean, we've seen for example the first negative growth in South Africa since 1998.",
        "But I don't think these are as hard hit because the financial exposure in this part of the world is not as great as let's say it is in the U.S.",

        "Is that what is allowing some countries to be - I hesitate to use the word financially successful at the moment, but allowing them to compete in a way that they had not been able to before?",
        "I'm hoping that that is going to, when that money becomes available, make it so that the technology industry can still remain resilient, because largely we have been.",
        "I mean, we're not immune from the problems, but we've been pretty resilient throughout.",

        "But the supply pipeline coming out of the colleges certainly seems to be ample.",
        "Are you saying that, no, we don't really need to go overseas to bring them here for these jobs because there are enough graduates in this country?",
        "You know, we go overseas, we're bringing immigration for a number of reasons.",
        "So, partly, you know, it's to complement the labor force in terms of certain skills and talents and that's one flow.",
        "As to the other flows, whether it's substituting for an adequate workforce that we already have is something that we want to look at with more detail.",
