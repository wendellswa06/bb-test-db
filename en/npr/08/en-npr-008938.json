        "Let me just get an on-air response to Dr. Barrett from Hal.",
        "Hal, Dr. Barrett says that why would we be importing all this talent from overseas and why would we be wanting more visas for them if the industry didn't agree with you?",
        "Well, that's part of what I think we need to understand, is what is about the jobs that it doesn't induce enough of the students to continue on.",
        "So if we look at bachelors in science and engineering, only about a third to 40 percent go on to masters or graduate school or into the workforce in the science and engineering careers.",
        "So this is part of the puzzle that - something that puzzles us is that we produce vast number of qualified bachelor degrees -bachelor graduates in science and engineering, and only a small fraction continue on either in a career or graduate school.",
        "The evidence that they suggested is that they just don't find these careers attractive.",
        "Is it, there's not enough money in it for them?",
        "It's probably money, it's probably boom and bust cycles, you know, employment, they see what the careers prospects are.",
        "And from the field interviews we're doing, there's just not the optimism about the future in some of these fields - in some of the engineering fields, in some of the IT fields.",
        "You know, people we talked to - managers, engineers - say, you know, it was a great they loved their careers but they think the ride is over and they say -they would tell their son's, daughters, nieces, nephews - if you're looking for a stable career, it's not here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You say…",
        "That's disheartening to hear.",
        "…you say almost that it's a self-fulfilling prophesy in your study that they hear, that they, you know, that all these jobs are going overseas so they say, why should I get into one of these jobs?",
        "It certainly is.",
        "You know, we have, kind of, a maxim in Sociology, that says if perception to believe something to be real, it's real in its consequences.",
        "And, you know, people make decisions one by one, day in day out, and when they believe there's no future, they make career decisions based on that perception, you know, whatever the numbers.",
        "And I think we'd all agree that whether or not it's true, that certainly is a widespread perception out there and that's something worth discussing about.",
        "Is that in accurate perception, if not, what do we do about it?",
        "Shirley Malcom, you've been a critic of the education system.",
        "In your testimony before Congress you have said that, our need to import talent has been necessitated by failures to develop talent by expanding the talent base for technical and scientific fields.",
        "How do you square that with this report that says there's plenty of talent, they just - they're not go into the fields?",

        "I think that one of the things that you have to look at is page 2 of the report.",
        "And the caveat that is put over there that, in fact, a lot of this does not apply when you're looking at under-participating and underrepresented populations.",
        "And as I've said before, one person's caveat is another person's headline.",
        "And if you look at the growing percentage that these students represent of the entirety of the talent pool that's available to move on into higher education and into the workforce, then you look at this particular aspect as being a one that is not a part of this descriptor of the schools working well.",
        "Schools work least well for these students.",
        "And I think that every bit of data that we can find, including that which they acknowledge in the report, indicates that this group is not included in those for whom the system is working well.",
        "Hal Salzman, you do point out that big chasm I talked about.",
        "There's a big chasm between minority students, immigrants and the general white student population and achievement, and you say that it doesn't have a whole lot to do with how, you know - it has to do with outside forces, outside of the education system.",
        "Can you talk about that a bit more?",
        "Well, what we say is that if students comes - meet more challenges.",
        "If you're from a poor family, certain schools have many more challenges to compensate forward, to provide a good education.",
        "And given part of our system - the resources, the talent, you know, in some of the schools -they have a harder time providing kids would come to school with a disadvantage, the kind of quality education that would make up for those differences.",
        "And a lot of what kids learn comes from their home, in the background, and some children have more of a disadvantage, and that's where we need to strengthen those schools to provide them the opportunity the other kids have.",

        "My wife graduated from University of Massachusetts and came down to San Antonio, Texas to get her Ph.D. and after getting her Ph.D. at the Health Science Center in biochemistry and immunology, she just -and doing with some postdoc, she decided to go to medical school because the pay outlook for all the work that she did was pretty dismal for a Ph.D., either she could do postdocs for the rest of her life or, you know, maybe she could write grants and then be successful.",
        "But the thing is, is that people just don't make a lot of money going into science for all the work they put into, getting their degree - a lot of people, a lot Americans.",
        "And she seems to really think that a lot of foreigners will come over here because this is very attractive, they'd come over here and get away from a bad situation the country they came from even working for a low pay because the green card makes up for much, you know, it's worth much more to them than high pay.",
        "And so it's just…",
        "Craig Barrett - let me ask Craig Barrett about it.",
        "You're a businessman, why not just hire cheaper labor that way?",
        "Well, first of all, you'd - it's illegal to bring people into the country and pay them at substandard ways because you have to pay them that the going competitively wage rate in the U.S.",
        "The second point is a company like Intel or a Microsoft or Cisco, pick any of the high-tech companies, we hire at Intel hundreds and hundreds of Ph.D.s each year, who do exciting work and make above-average wages.",
        "I think there's huge opportunity in these fields."

        "I would like to go back to the comment that you made earlier, Ira, about minority students.",
        "I think we would agree that if you're in the urban school system, heavily populated by lower-income class minority students, those are the places we are least likely to get a good math or science teacher there, those are the areas where are least likely to get a good preparatory math or science education.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "That's been recognized by every study that's taken place, and that's one of the reasons you see studies like \"\"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\"\" say, hey, in this country, we need more and better match and science teachers in K through 12.",
        "They get the overall education level of kids up in school, out of school, whatever the factors are.",
        "Unless you have good teachers, the system doesn't work.",
        "Let me just jump in on that.",
        "You know, I'm glad that Dr. Barrett brought that up because Dr. Salzman seemed to imply that what you had was largely driven by the home environment.",
        "That is true.",
        "That, in fact, there's a lot - it may be a lot be may be a lot harder if you, in fact, don't know about these kinds of careers, that you have other kinds of social and cultural issues that you're trying to address at the same time.",
        "But in many cases, you're talking about policies that school systems are putting into place or not, that of - that are driving a lot of the things that you are seeing.",
        "For example, the distribution of highly qualified teachers, those are decisions that school systems are making that lead to lesser qualified individuals being disproportionately assigned to teach the students with the greatest challenge.",
        "Hal Salzman?",
        "Oh, I think we would agree, and I think Dr. Malcom made a very important point that what's in the footnote should be the headline, and I think that's part of our study and certainly one of the issues we have with, you know, about gather - about \"\"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\"\" and some of these others.",
        "That rather than the average, we should talk about where the deficits are which is the bottom half, bottom third, and that really needs to be the headlines to where funds should be and resources should be put in the education reform efforts.",
        "Well, I also don't want to miss that your headline, which says there are enough qualified graduates in science and engineering, and where are they and why are they not going into the jobs that Craig says are all there and going to well paid foreigners?",
        "And that's frustrating to outsiders, such as EU leaders in northern Europe - whom Spain is trying to court, says economist Fernando Fernandez.",
        "And here are the headlines from some of the other stories we're following here today at NPR News.",
        "Well, we hear - at least from your caller - that's we hear from the field talking to people that it just doesn't have the attraction it once did, you know, there are other career opportunities out there that pay more, people perceive have a better future in terms of employment stability, and those are the decisions people are making, you know, from the people we talked to and interviewed…"

        "Let me raise an issue here, though, and that is that you can't just look at the numbers aggregated.",
        "As I have said before, the devil is in the disaggregation.",
        "And if you, in fact, do look in the field of medical sciences, those are areas where we do, in fact, have oversupply.",
        "And if we don't believe that, we look at the numbers of postdocs and the kind of leap and the continual participation one postdoc after another.",

        "In his report, he goes to a great effort to kind of discount the TIMSS test, the PISA test, and the results of NAEP.",
        "It's kind of a backward-looking analysis showing that our kids do better than they did 30 years ago.",
        "But his conclusion is they kind of do average or standard, at best.",
        "And I think if you look at the quantitative result of the NAEP test, which is the best example - this is the National Assessment of Educational Progress test that the U.S.",
        "gives to measure different states and how our kids are doing.",
        "You know, only 30 percent of our kids or less are measured as proficient on the NAEP test.",
        "Proficient.",
        "That means 70 percent are below proficient.",
        "That's not a positive measure.",
        "The U.S.",
        "cannot be successful if we are only average.",
        "We have the highest standard of living.",

        "And I just want to encourage Mr. Salzman not to look back at - do we do 2 percent better than we did 30 years ago, but how are you going to compete against the onslaught of millions and millions of kids studying math and science in India, China, Russia, et cetera.",
        "That's where the competition is in the future.",
