        "He is chief economist and executive vice president of IHS Global Insight, a forecasting company that provides analysis on the world's economic and financial markets.",
        "He joined us from Boston Bureau Productions in Boston, Massachusetts.",
        "This is News & Notes.",
        "I'm Tony Cox.",
        "During his presidential campaign, President Barack Obama laid out an ambitious technology agenda for his administration.",
        "Now that he's in the White House, how will Mr. Obama implement those ideas?",
        "Today our series on the Obama Effect continues with a look at the impact on technology.",
        "Here to size-up Mr. Obama's tech agenda, our very own tech contributor Mario Armstrong.",
        "Hello, Mario.",
        "Hi there.",
        "How are you?",
        "I'm fine.",
        "Glad to be here.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Glad to have you back.",
        "During the presidential campaign, we talked with you about President Obama's stand on key technology issues, He was candidate Obama at the time, of course.",
        "Remind us briefly about some of those issues, and now that he's in the office, what are some of the top priorities for his administration?",
        "Yeah, well early on, you know, early on, he had been very forthcoming about how he envisioned technology and the role that it would play in the Obama administration.",
        "And that dates back actually to when he was a senator and he had put some other programs in place that were kind of like - you can think of it like a Google search engine if you will, back in Chicago.",
        "So he had some programs back then that he believed in, technology could really assist growth and moving forward.",
        "And so, you transition that now to where he is today.",
        "He's been playing technology largely to the point of transparency and to broadband access for all of the United - all of Americans across the country, which has to date, not been the case.",
        "You know, one of the things that's associated with the new president from a technology standpoint that perhaps everyone can relate to, was the issue of his BlackBerry and whether or not he was going to be allowed to keep it or not.",
        "Specifically though, how has the president used technology, BlackBerry aside, to update and to revolutionize the White House itself?",
        "Yeah, BlackBerry aside, when they moved - first and foremost, the minute they made the formal announcement, the Web site changed.",
        "The Whitehouse.gov Web site had an immediate makeover.",
        "In other words, they had already been working on developing that Web site, what it was going to stand for, how it was going to engage citizens, and how it was going to keep the same momentum that basically carried him into office throughout this administration."

        "So, number one, the Web site made a drastic change and a tremendous shift.",
        "It opened up transparency.",
        "It put a lot of ways for individuals to feel that they could be more empowered to have better access or a direct access, almost like an open Internet door to the administration.",
        "Number two, they looked to hire a chief technology officer for the administration, which has been done.",
        "They've actually checked that off of their list and that has never been a position within the White House to that level before.",
        "And then, number three, I would say actually the stimulus package, you know, coming through with $7.2 billion being placed specifically for broadband access in rural areas.",
        "Those are three key things - oh, and the fourth thing would be, actually redoing - re-upgrading rather the systems within the White House.",
        "Internet connectivity was extremely - is extremely slow there.",
        "Outdated computers, viruses, just issues with just the infrastructure of technology that was there left by the previous administration.",
        "You know, that was going to be my next question because I understood as the new administration staff took their offices in the White House, what they found were computers that were - I suppose outdated and very slow and...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Not nearly as technologically advance that you would expect from the White House.",
        "You would expect from, you know, the innovative country of the world, that our White House would - but you know, leadership is driven top down.",
        "And I'm not trying to point a finger here.",
        "I'm just saying, you can look at companies as well as government, and look at the leadership and whether or not they adopt technologies.",
        "You know, you mentioned that there was a new chief technology officer and our conversation is coming to a close, but briefly tell us who this person is, if you know, and what you know about his or her background?",
        "I know that when we began in the first season, the PBS folks were sort of, you know, bummed out that we were finding most of these stories didn't pan out and there was some pressure to find one that actually, you know, hey, guys, we really need to find one that's true.",
        "But they've sensed, I think, come to discover that there are a lot of these stories floating around and not all of them are true.",
        "I mean, one of the most common questions that I get about this - the show is, why do people like it?",
        "And it really does seem to crosscut a broad spectrum of ages and socio-economic groups who watch the show.",
        "And I like to say that they like it because it's not the kind of history that they get when they take a class in college or in high school, which is a survey class, a sort of history with a big H that looks at American history as a sort of a grand sweep, you know, colonization to the Civil War, Civil War to the Cold War.",
        "But rather, it's history with a little H.",
        "And everybody in this country enjoys history with a little H.",
        "And that little H is a story that each family have - all of us have some story that relates us to - or some person in our family to the bigger history with the big H.",
        "I mean, you know, people saved letters from World War II, they saved letters from the Civil War, they saved Aunt Minnie's chair.",
        "All of these things, each one of us, as families, have big and small, and that's why people connect with the show, because they're enjoying history with a little H that connects them to history in the grand sweep of things."
