        "Really.",
        "But they removed like some G - from what I understand, you can't like ping it for like GPS location.",
        "So I believe GPS types of tracking or chips have been removed out of it.",
        "So I think it is a stripped down and highly secure BlackBerry.",
        "One of the things and you mentioned this earlier, Mario, that the president wants to do - he wants to put everybody on the Internet who wants access to it, and he's trying to expand it into rural areas.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "My question is, is he trying to push the Internet and technology onto areas and to people who may not really want it?"

        "You know, I don't - that's a tough question.",
        "That's a really good question because, you know, I come from a frame of reference that everybody should want the Internet, that the Internet should be a utility.",
        "The Internet should be like water, it should be like electricity.",
        "So that's hard for me to remove my own bias to answer that question.",
        "However, we have always talked about having a national broadband strategy and that has not been the case.",
        "So the point is there are people who do want it and there may be some people who don't want it, but they don't have that option given to them at this point.",
        "So now we have Americans across the country who are not connected to this high speed Internet and don't understand what it's capable of doing, how it can increase your access to information, your knowledge, start new businesses, create innovation, do research, help education.",
        "Once you get access to it, I believe that does change things.",
        "So, my suggestion is, I'd rather people have the option and choose not to do it than the option not be there at all.",
        "Well, let me ask you this then because the tech sector - because all of this would have to cost money to make it happen whether people wanted it or not, the president's, you know, intentions to expand Internet access nationally.",
        "The tech sector is not insulated from the current economic crisis, I would not think.",
        "So what are you seeing...",
        "No.",
        "As the biggest impact there?",
        "From the tech sector in today's economy?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, just job loss.",

        "You are seeing just in recent news, other technology companies like HP and others are making some type of adjustments to - not only their work force but also to their strategies, in a good way though.",
        "And I think right now what we're finding is that, I think this - the technology industry though, Tony, you can't - this country, businesses, the ecosystem cannot function without information technology.",
        "So you have companies like HP, Dell, Microsoft, Google, they're all being very creative now or I would say, more creative than I guess that they had to have been in the past to really understand how they can make the largest impact without it affecting their employee work force.",
        "And I think today's times are making people more innovative and the mother - mother's the necessity of innovation and I think it's just making people be more creative now.",
        "I'm hoping that the stimulus package with having a chief technology officer in house, with $7.2 billion going towards - from the stimulus, going towards broadband, with another $19 billion going towards health information records and technology, and health care."
