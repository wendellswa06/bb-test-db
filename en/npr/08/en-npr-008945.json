        "What's this deal that came up today?",
        "I mean, what--how--this was sort of a face-saving agreement on both sides.",
        "Well, that's right, and it's much closer to the negotiations that have been going on for many months last year leading up to this crisis this week.",
        "Under the deal, the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom will sell its gas for $230 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas to a trading company.",
        "Now that trading company will then mix the Russian gas with cheaper deliveries from Turkmenistan and other Central Asia countries and then sell it to Ukraine for $95 per 1,000 cubic meters.",
        "So that price, the price that Kiev will actually be buying Russian gas, is much closer to the Ukrainian position.",
        "So essentially both sides win out of this deal.",
        "Now this was arrived at, though, after this exercise of Russian political bossel(ph).",
        "That's right.",
        "And a lot of people are saying, `What does this mean when Russia,' as you said, `the new leader of the G8 for this year, shut off the pipelines to Kiev the very same day that it assumed the presidency of the G8, knowing full well that it could disrupt supplies to Western European countries that depend on that gas at the height of winter?",
        "And this week saw very cold temperatures.",
        "And, of course, when European countries started seeing reductions in their supplies, their complaints went to Moscow.",
        "And, of course, they pointed out that when Russia assumed the presidency of the G8 on January 1st, it said its major source of interest this year is going to be security of energy supplies.",
        "That's right.",
        "Russia has been promoting itself as a reliable supplier of energy at a time when many countries are worried about a possible global energy crisis.",
        "Russia has said that it wanted to charge Ukraine market prices for its gas.",
        "It had said that it had been selling gas for highly subsidized rates and that it was time to change that.",
        "World prices."

        "I'm sorry, world, that's right.",
        "But many people are saying that Russia really wasn't interested in market prices; it was really interested in pressuring the president of Ukraine, the fairly new president, Viktor Yushchenko, who defeated the pro-Moscow candidate in elections in 2004.",
        "So this was seen as Russia's way of expressing its displeasure and trying to flex its muscle on the international stage.",
        "Well, let's bring another voice into the conversation.",
        "This is Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, where she specializes in Russia, Eurasia and energy issues.",

        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "This is not the first time Russia has done this sort of thing, is it?",
        "No, it certainly isn't the first time.",
        "In fact, on various junctures over the last several years, Russia has employed these same kinds of strong-arm tactics, including with Ukraine, on issues of energy pricing and energy transit.",
        "And, in fact, one of the parties in the new deal, Turkmenistan, has experienced some real strong-arm pressure from Russia in the past.",
        "In 1997, for example, Gazprom, the Russian gas company that's at the center of the recent dispute, cut off Turkmenistan's access to the export pipelines that it used, in fact, to export gas to Ukraine and left Turkmenistan in a really dire situation for quite some time.",
        "It's had a real an impact on the Turkmenistani economy.",
        "So there's more than meets the eye to this deal here because Turkmenistan and its gas is a factor in this deal between Ukraine and Russia again.",
        "And it's sort of interesting--a few years ago you would have expected that Gazprom by now would have been a privatized company.",
        "Instead it seems to be being used as an instrument of state power.",
        "Fiona Hill, senior fellow at The Brookings Institution, joined us from the studios at The Brookings Institution; that's down Massachusetts Avenue here in Washington, DC.",
        "And our thanks to Gregory Feifer, NPR's Moscow correspondent.",
        "The distance between check posts for us is at least from 12 to 15 kilometers.",
        "So if anything comes from in-between, as the narcotics does, that is possible.",
        "I do not - but from the border with a taxi illegally, that's absolutely refutable.",
        "Iranian diplomats in Herat declined to comment for this story.",
        "The consulate spokesman referred NPR to the Iranian Embassy in Kabul, which did not respond to repeated requests for an interview."

        "I thought this was quite a significant study, partly because of the CBO's nonpartisan status, but also because it showed that over the last 30-plus years, that is the conscious lifetime for most Americans.",
        "There have been a quite profound shift in the nature of the American economic distribution that for the top 1 percent, as you said, their share after tax - and this is the crucial point - after all the sort of progressive taxes we have, they went from having roughly $1 out of every 12 of the American income distribution, to roughly $1 out of every six.",
