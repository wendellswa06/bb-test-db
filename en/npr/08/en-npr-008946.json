        "Fiona Hill, does Russia still sell gas at subsidized prices to more favored former Soviet republics?",
        "It certainly does.",
        "Belarus is the prime case in point.",
        "I think Belarus is purchasing its gas from Russia at around $47 per 1,000 cubic meter, which is just a little bit under what Ukraine was paying before; I think it was around $50 under the old contract that was at the heart of this dispute.",
        "But even if you look at some of the other states, getting back to what Gregory has just said about Ukraine really coming out looking like a winner in this dispute, some of the other consumers of Russian gas are the former states of the Soviet Union, the Caucasus states--Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.",
        "And even the Baltic states, which have been in numerous political disputes with Russia, are actually paying now more for their gas than Ukraine is.",
        "They're paying between 110 and $120 for the same meter of gas, for the same 1,000 cubic meters.",
        "So, in actual fact, Ukraine does appear to have come out quite well here.",
        "But it was inevitable that the price would be changed, I think, given the nature of the relationship between Ukraine and Russia at this point.",
        "The Russians have a good point about why should they continue to subsidize the gas.",
        "But in actual fact we now come out at the end with a question mark of who's done better out of this deal.",
        "Frankly, I think, you know, if the Russians had handled this differently, they could probably have pushed Ukraine closer to the amount that the Caucasus states and the Baltic states are paying.",
        "And in Moscow, is Mr. Putin going to be looking like, well, he was in a confrontation with Mr. Yushchenko and he blinked?",
        "Well, that's exactly what it looks like.",
        "You know, in many respects, I think the Russians, as I said, were well within their rights to push for something closer to market prices.",
        "In fact, market prices are around the levels that they were first starting, the 220, $230 per 1,000 cubic meters that was the initial asking price, in which they claim that Gazprom is still selling its portion of the gas for.",
        "And this is something that the Russians are pushing very hard.",
        "They've made a strong statement about it.",
        "They've emphasized their importance as the primary gas supplier to Europe.",
        "But what they've also done as a result is raise a lot of questions, not just about Russia's reliability but whether Russia really sees oil and gas in particular as a commercial enterprise or whether it's going to be purely a tool for political manipulation.",
        "And I think that's the dangerous issue to put on the table right now for Russia, not just because of the G8 chairmanship but because there were also questions over the last year in many countries, like Germany, which is Europe's largest gas consumer, about whether it was a good idea to be buying so much gas from Russia in the future.",
        "And I think this will make people ask that question even louder.",
        "And the theory that if Ukraine irritated Russia today and got this reaction, what if Germany did it tomorrow?",
        "Sure, or somewhere a long time down the line.",
        "But, yes, I think many people in Brussels will be sitting wondering if that, indeed, could be the case somewhere on the horizon.",
        "And does it tell us also something about Russia today?--I mean, the explosion not only of gas and oil prices but the proportion of Russia's industry that--or Russia's exports that compromises.",
        "This is an OPEC nation almost."

        "And Russia today is much more vulnerable to oil shocks, you know, that--a drop in the price of oil and gas than at any other point since the Soviet period.",
