        "And it lowers the relative size of the deficit to four percent of the size of the economy, down from just over 10 percent in 2009.",
        "That's a lot of good news, and when it comes to the budget we should take the good news where we can get it.",
        "That's Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which has campaigned to reduce the federal deficit.",
        "The problem is a lot of this comes from temporary savings and it doesn't mean that we're on a path that's sustainable.",
        "There are a couple of big temporary factors behind the dramatic improvement since February.",
        "One is news that mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are making big dividend payments to the government this year.",
        "The government bailed them out and took them over during the housing crisis.",
        "The second temporary factor is higher than expected tax payments from well-off taxpayers.",

        "Selling washers to Americans became more expensive for foreign companies, and domestic manufacturers, like Whirlpool, could finally raise prices.",
        "But then Trump imposed more tariffs - on metals, like aluminum and steel, which is critical to building almost any appliance.",
        "Suddenly, appliance makers everywhere, including Whirlpool, began complaining about the rising cost of raw materials.",

        "But in the past year, the increases have been bigger than most.",
        "Now overall prices of major appliances, tracked by the Labor Department, are starting to tick down month to month, but they are still higher than they were last year.",
        "When you talk about machines that people want to buy, front-loaders, I think you're looking at $200 to $400 difference versus last year.",
        "Sheinkopf predicts prices are probably stabilized at this point, at least for a while.",
        "But for shoppers who chase specials and deals, he says promotions have not been as good as a few years ago.",

        "You know, if you take a dog and you run it through, let's say, an airport looking for drugs, and the dog comes up and sniffs some of your luggage, the report was saying there's actually an influence of the handler wanting the dog -maybe subconsciously or unconsciously - to find something, and that influences what the dog is doing.",
        "That's absolutely true, and we actually did a little work with dogs and found the same thing.",
