        "I know when I first began working with animals, and I was testing them and knew what I wanted them to do, and they were doing something wrong, I developed the most tremendous urge to sneeze.",
        "And it's a very powerful phenomenon, and so one has to really protect against it.",
        "So we're not envisioning a time here when you might walk into your doctor's office, and the doctor's going to introduce you to a dog?",
        "Well, I don't think so.",
        "In principle, it would work, and of course we use dogs all the time for drug sniffing and things of that sort.",
        "On the other hand, my guess is that for doing diagnosis of disease, which would lead to some sorts of maybe serious kinds of surgery, they would be reluctant to do it.",
        "And I should also say that I think the disease diagnosis by smell is never going to be the only diagnostic tool.",
        "It's going to be one that potentially is very, very cost-effective, very non-invasive.",

        "But he sniffs my breath all the time.",

        "Yeah, and that's part of the issue of the other citation you talked about, that there is a strong desire for this to be the case, and particularly for dogs.",
        "I mean, dogs have this special relationship with people, and the idea that the dog would do this sort of signals that the dog has particular love for that individual.",
        "So you can see the strong desire for that.",
        "Nevertheless, I believe that there's something to these stories.",
        "Well, I think it varies, and what she was saying is that it pays no attention to the breath until there's some change.",
        "In the example I was saying, it sniffed much more frequently, and pushed and poked.",

        "And it just seems completely logical to me because in - at times where we come across people like, where you're taking care of somebody that has advanced cancer, the smell is very strong.",
        "You know, you can smell it in the room, and you can smell it on the patient.",
        "So it seems just simply logical to me that a dog who has, you know, just a higher sense of smell would pick this out at a much earlier stage.",

        "He - obviously people, as you say, have been talking about this for a while.",

        "Well, I think the first step is what the paper that's just come out, and several other papers, similar, are doing, and that is to put it into an experimental situation, where you're really testing the hypothesis."

        "Then the next step is doing also exactly what you said, which is to try to take samples - we use urine; you could use breath, what have you - from patients and controls, and making sure you have the appropriate control people, and try to identify the compounds and develop ways of discovering what the odorants are, and then using and developing devices that can be routinely used to detect them.",

        "Does, say, lung cancer produce one kind of odor, and colorectal cancer a different - or do the different classes of cancers produce different odorants?",
