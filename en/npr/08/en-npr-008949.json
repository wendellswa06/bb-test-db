        "He said that the conversation in Washington should be about if the war effort does not succeed and there is failure.",
        "Of course, the challenge for Mr. Bush is that there are a lot of Americans in the country who believe that the war effort has already failed.",

        "What do you make of these polls and Herman Cain?",
        "There was that marvelous ad for Herman Cain this past week showing his campaign manager doing a Marlboro man smoking into the camera, making the point there's never really been a campaign like this.",
        "And that is true in a broader sense than Herman Cain really wants to remind people of.",
        "He's never held elective office of any sort or at least, I guess, post-high school or college.",
        "And really, the last president that we had who was in that situation was Dwight Eisenhower, who after all had commanded the largest fighting force in the world history for a number of years.",
        "Herman Cain, in addition to that background, he has an economic and tax policy, which he's been trying to sort of explain away over the last week or two.",
        "And he has made clear in foreign policy, that's something he would educate himself about once he took office if elected.",
        "And so, the fact that he is still ahead of Mitt Romney, the more sort of obvious credentialed, experience former governor, suggests something about the strains within the Republican Party as Herman Cain's appealing to its heart and Mitt Romney is appealing to some of its practical sensibility of what would be an electable candidate."
