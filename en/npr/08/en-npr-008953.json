        "So all those things, you know, became news to me and it's still news to a lot of people today.",

        "Hold it.",
        "Aren't they enemies of anti-Christ?",
        "Aren't they, you know, all these kind of weird myths of growing up about religion because nobody's actually properly studied it.",
        "But when you do study it, you know, with an open mind, then I think a lot of people could probably get beyond their prejudice and start to realize that hey, you know, there's a lot we have in common and we need to share that.",
        "We need to, you know, to create this world of peace where people are not fighting about the prophets who were sent to guide us how to live together.",
        "We're actually not following their teachings, are we if we do that?",
        "There's, in fact, a track on this album - I think the only track not written by you - but the old - I remember it as an Animals tune, other people did it too, Nina Simone most famously - \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's kind of an obvious song for me to sing today, you know.",
        "And it was one of my favorite, all-time favorite, songs of Nina Simone.",
        "She was one of my favorite singers and artists.",
        "And the good thing about that, of course, I didn't write it so I can't be blamed for that either.",
        "So, you know, I'm kind of - I'm trying to kind of remind people that, you know, because of so much misunderstanding we've got to start building bridges and we've got to start entering, I think, into an era of understanding.",
        "People are talking about, you know, an era of a clash of civilization.",
        "I don't believe in that at all.",
        "I believe that civilization is something that we all, you know, subscribe to and we all borrow from and we give to, you know, whether it was the Italians or the Romans who invented the wheel, you know, or whoever, you know.",
        "And those who invented, you know, the writing pen and those who invented paper and those who invented the transistor radio, whoever, you know, contributes to the improvement and progress of humanity is part of civilization.",
        "And if you look at Islamic civilization you'll find, my goodness, all the coffee that we're drinking today, where did that come from, you know?",
        "There were coffee houses in Istanbul 500 years ago.",
        "The guitar that we love so much, the one I put down about 30 years ago, guess what?",
        "It probably came from Islamic Spain, you know, through to Europe.",
        "So civilization is something that we should all be sharing.",
