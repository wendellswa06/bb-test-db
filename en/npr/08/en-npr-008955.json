        "Right.",

        "Ben, help us understand a bit how these two companies, HP and Oracle, relate in the marketplace.",
        "Not that long ago they each had pretty defined roles.",
        "Oracle sold software to businesses.",
        "And HP made the equipment that they used in their data centers as well as the personal computers.",
        "In January, however, Oracle bought Sun Microsystems, which makes the same server systems, the storage systems that HP sells to businesses.",
        "Sun was struggling, but it was well known for having good technology.",
        "Now, at Oracle, they didn't really have a lot of expertise for running one of these hardware businesses, and Mark Hurd has done a phenomenal job doing just that at HP.",
        "He took that company and he made it into the world's largest technology company by revenue and the largest seller of these systems.",
        "So, you know, he's known as a strong operator, someone who can cut costs and make businesses more efficient.",
        "And he's going to be expected to come into Oracle and turn that Sun business around and really make it a competitor with HP.",
        "And the story surrounding Mark Hurd gets pretty colorful also because of the Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, who hired Mark Hurd away.",
        "Why don't you tell us about him and what he's known for.",
        "Yeah, Larry Ellison is one of the most outspoken people in the tech industry.",
        "He's always said exactly what's on his mind rather than the polite thing to say in any situation.",
        "For instance, as soon as HP ousted Mark Hurd, Larry Ellison very quickly came to his defense, calling it the worst decision since Apple's board decided to fire Steve Jobs years and years ago.",
        "Now, in the background, Ellison and Hurd are actually close friends.",
        "They play tennis together from time to time.",
        "And so this is really going to be an opportunity for these guys to work together instead of, I suppose, just playing tennis."

        "She says when Peggy Seltzer claims that she slept with a gun nightly and bought herself a burial plot with some of her first drug profits, she's doing more than ripping of Straight's neighborhood.",
        "She's insulting Straight's friends, her children, and former in-laws.",
        "In the black community, I think there's this incredible sense of despair about the fact that if you're a mom with black children you can't send them walking down the street to the grocery store because you're afraid they'll be shot.",
        "So to have someone who didn't live like that pretend to have a gun and to get a burial plot is a huge amount of disrespect.",
        "Especially when there are real-life examples, like 17-year-old Jamil Shaw.",
        "A college-bound high school athlete, Jamil was shot steps away from his parent's Los Angeles home.",
        "His mother returned from active duty in Iraq to bury him last week.",
        "The only gun she's ever carried was in service to her country."
