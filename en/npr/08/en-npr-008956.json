        "So what happened?",

        "He finds referees are much more likely to make calls that comply with what people nearest to them are demanding.",
        "If the action is on that side of the field, it goes in favor of that team's bench basically.",

        "One thing, I think, that all immigrants to the United States have in common, though, is the need and, in fact, the desire to learn English eventually so that they can function fully in American society.",
