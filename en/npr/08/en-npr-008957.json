        "Karen Grigsby Bates, NPR News.",
        "It can be mesmerizing to watch a flock of birds soaring through the air, then suddenly the entire flock veers off in a new direction, as if the birds had magically made a group decision.",
        "Scientists have long wondered how that happens.",
        "So, recently, researchers decided to track individual pigeons in a flock.",
        "As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, they outfitted each bird with a GPS device in a little backpack.",
        "The birds in this study were about a dozen homing pigeons kept by a fancier who lives in Hungary.",
        "They looked very cute in their tiny custom made backpacks.",
        "You have to imagine sort of a backpack where the straps fit around the wings and the kind of compartment fits on the back.",
        "Dora Biro is a scientist at the University of Oxford, who did this study with colleagues in Hungary.",
        "She says, at first, the pigeons would peck at the backpacks.",
        "So, you know, this isn't something that they experience naturally.",
        "So they do sort of investigate the backpacks initially.",
        "But very quickly they get use to them.",
        "It helps that the backpacks weren't heavy.",
        "Inside was a GPS device that weighed about half an ounce, but it could record a bird's position five times a second.",
        "Biro says without this information there'd no way of knowing who in the flock shifted direction first and how the others responded.",
        "The decisions that are made and that spread through the group are made at such short time scales that it's really not visible easily to the naked eye.",
        "And you can't just assume that the birds out in front are calling the shots."

        "Birds have a very wide angle of vision, so for them, it is possible that they would be responding to birds who are flying behind them.",
        "So, to see if pigeons might be following a leader or leaders, the researchers analyzed all of the data logged by the GPS devices during short flights and longer journeys.",
        "I guess from the beginning we weren't sure whether we were going to find any kind of consistent leader-follower relationship.",
        "But, in fact, to us surprisingly, we did.",
        "She says for any given pair of birds...",
        "You can accurately work out which of them is the leader and which one of them is the follower.",
        "Some birds had more followers than others.",
        "This created a hierarchy of influence within the flock.",
        "Basically, every individual gets a kind of a vote in what the flock does, but the weight of your vote depends on your rank, your position in the hierarchy.",
        "And it turns out, the birds with the most rank tended to fly out in front.",
        "The results of this study are reported in the journal Nature.",
        "Biro says it's not clear what make a pigeon a great leader in the air - maybe some birds have a better sense of direction or just fly faster.",
        "But the study does show that in these flocks, not all birds were equal.",
        "That's what some scientists have assumed when making computer models that use simple rules to mimic the behavior of flocks.",
        "Iain Couzin is a researcher at Princeton University who studies how groups of animals make decisions."

        "But Spanish, of course, is far and away the leading second language in the United States, for obvious reasons, but has that always been the case?",
        "It has not always been in the case, but it is true that in the most census, the following information stands out.",
        "Eighty-two percent of people over the age of five speak English in the home in the United States.",
        "Of the remaining approximately 18 percent who speak a language other than English, 60 percent of those speak Spanish.",
        "Hmm.",

        "I come from a family of Italian and German speakers, and I know many of the listeners can name the heritage languages that their grandparents and great-grandparents came to the country with, and it won't always be Spanish in the majority of the cases.",
        "What determines which language, which second language, if you will, an American chooses to learn or feels the necessity to learn?",
        "The research that we do at the Modern Language Association shows us several things, and in speaking with my colleagues who are language teachers like myself, I hear a lot of reasons.",
        "In fact, I often say that there are as many reasons individuals have to learn a language as there are languages.",
        "The primary thing chat connects them is they want--students want to understand a different language, a different culture, and they know that learning those languages opens those doors to new opportunities.",
        "Sometimes they will pick a language entirely for vocational reasons.",
        "For example, if you want to work in the medical profession in San Francisco, and you know that you'll have many speakers of Spanish, of Korean, of Tagalog, come into your medical setting.",
        "It would be a wonderful addition to your skills to have at least one of those languages.",
        "Another reason that students give is they want to learn the language of their grandparents or their great-grandparents, or perhaps they want to further a language that they've already heard in the home, so they'll take the heritage language in either the high school, if it's offered, or in the post-secondary school, college or university, where a great variety of lesser commonly taught languages are offered.",
        "And finally, I think a lot of language students simply want to expand their educational experience, and acquire a deeper humanistic view of their studies.",
        "Languages are a part of the traditional liberal-arts curriculum, and so I think students want to expand their learning in that way, int eh same way they might take history or archaeology or biology.",
