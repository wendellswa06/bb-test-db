        "Let me just say a bit about the caller.",
        "(Spanish spoken) Americano.",
        "Even though the joke about Americans being monolingual holds to some degree, you can also see, from his trilingualism, that Americans, indeed, are multilingual and are proud of that heritage and are encouraging their children to continue with that heritage.",
        "In our most recent--the Modern Language Association did its most recent study of foreign-language enrollments in colleges and universities in 2002, and we found that all languages grew by about 17 percent, some of them dramatically, including American Sign Language which, interestingly, is often categorized with foreign languages at colleges and universities.",
        "But Asian languages also grew considerably, specifically Chinese, Korean, Japanese.",
        "So, of course, did Middle Eastern languages, like Arabic.",
        "But all languages are up.",
        "So I don't think you can say Spanish has displaced, but rather has amplified the panorama of languages that students take.",
        "Clearly, many students find a more practical use for Spanish in their careers, as your caller just indicated.",
        "But the general interest in languages among American students has never been stronger.",
        "Learning a second language is not necessarily required or expected of students in this country.",
        "Virtually everywhere else in the world, it is.",
        "Richard Brecht joins us now.",
        "He's executive director of the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Study of Language, and he's been kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Nice to have you on the program.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "So is English the second language of choice around the world?",
        "There's no question that, now, English is the most popular learned second language in all parts of the world.",
        "It's hard to find anyplace where that isn't the case.",
        "Hm.",
        "You would think, though, that in some parts of the world, maybe central Asia, Chinese would be a natural second language--Mandarin.",
        "There are place--yeah, exactly.",
        "There are places where, if you will, that English is still dominant, but other languages, historically, are important.",
        "For instance, in central Asia--it's a good question--Russian is still a lingua franca across many of the languages of central Asia, and--but that is a language that is part of the education system.",
        "It's even official language in many of those countries, but then the foreign language, if you will, the acquired language that doesn't have a basis in the society, is English.",
        "Hm.",
        "I wonder; in many parts of the world which were, of course, colonized by various groups--in this country, the American Indian..."

        "Right.",
        "...Indian languages have been largely supplanted by English.",
        "Is that true in other areas?",
        "It's interesting, because in the United States, the autochthonous or the original languages, indigenous languages, and populations, as you know, were greatly suppressed.",
        "And so it's been a kind of an open market in the United States.",
        "And what's predominant in our education system are the colonial languages of French and Spanish and English and German.",
        "In the rest of the world, that's not the case, as a rule.",
        "The languages are tied to the land, and the people are tied to the land, and so even in central Asia, for instance, or in north Africa as an example, French colonies--the north African countries were French colonies.",
        "And French is very strong there by historical tradition, but Arabic now is the national language of most of those countries, and the dialects of Arabic and even Berber are very strong in those languages.",
        "But the tradition in the United States is we learn second languages, except for our immigration.",
        "It's a second-language-learning issue.",
        "But in most parts of the world, it's: What's the language of the hearth?",

        "And what's the language of the country?",

        "Well, if you're choosing to learn to speak Klingon or, for that matter, Esperanto, these are intellectual decisions that people are making, no?",

        "I teach Arabic at one of the public universities, California State University in San Bernardino, and we've seen since four years, although the program was agreed upon prior to the tragic events of 9/11--but there were a couple of schools who realized the importance of offering Arabic language in a place where, one, we have a lot of business, and we also have to work with some, if not, you know, more countries in the Middle East.",

        "I...",
        "And I wanted to also share with you that the interest in Arabic is not only because we are only in a war, and it does, indeed, open up opportunities for some people to join the Foreign Service.",

        "Since academic--there was a lot of scholarship written about Islam.",

        "The people are interested into Arabic to see what was happening about a thousand years ago.",
        "Richard Brecht, you were talking earlier about this idea that, well, certainly Arabic has undergone an explosion of study the last few years.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "In the United States, since the year 2000 or 2001, it's practically tripled in enrollments.",
        "However--in the university.",
        "However, the problem is that, at that time, there were approximately 5,000 people in the US taking Arabic, which--so the tripling of that number, whereas it's a good thing to happen, it's a trivial final number compared to where it ought to be in the United States.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And let me ask you, Rosemary Feal--this is certainly not the only war which has affected language study here in the United States or second languages.",

        "In fact, some of our most distinguished sociologists--Sovietologists and also sociologists, for that matter, come of that kind of initiative.",
        "We have seen, however, that the interest, as your caller just indicated, in Arabic is accompanied by a general interest.both in languages in the Middle East and in all languages generally.",
        "We expect--Richard Brecht is right--there were only 5,000-some students studying Arabic in colleges and universities in 1998, and we have a long way to go.",
        "But in 1998, there were practically a million and a half undergraduates and graduates studying languages.",
