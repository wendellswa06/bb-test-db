        "It's very interesting that the English-speaking countries generally share the same fate.",
        "In Great Britain, it is a struggle to get people to learn languages.",
        "They learn mostly French because that's their neighbor, and so on.",
        "But it's still a struggle to this day, where they're trying to get more people to study more languages.",
        "If you take Australia, it's another situation.",
        "Somehow or other, in the '60s, Australians came to understand that they were more a part of Asia than they were of the British Empire.",
        "And so by the mid-'80s, they had a language policy in Australia that said, basically, everybody should know English.",
        "If you have another language, you should keep it.",
        "You have a right to keep it.",
        "If you don't have another language, you have an obligation to get it.",
        "So by the mid-'80s, Australia came to a national decision to have a language policy--excuse me--advocating bilingual citizenry, and that's a remarkable thing that this country should learn from.",
        "Richard Brecht, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "It's my pleasure.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Richard Brecht is executive director of the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Study of Language, and came in to join us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Well, whether you're obliged to keep that second language or not, learning a second language as an adult can be a daunting challenge.",
        "Kids seem to pick up languages very easily.",
        "But what about after we're grown?",
        "Joining us here in Studio 3A to talk about this is Michael Long.",

        "Jury's still out.",
        "I believe it is easier.",
        "I think the data are overwhelmingly in favor of an early start, if you want nativelike achievement.",
        "However, adult starters do very well, too, providing they have high language aptitude sufficient motivation and time on task.",
        "However, there's no question, overall, children do better than adults.",
        "They start slower, but they catch up.",
        "It's like hare and tortoise.",
        "Adults take out very, very fast; older children, too, but over the long run, the younger children are the only ones who seem to be able to get up to nativelike levels.",
        "Is it--are all languages equally difficult or easy for kids to learn?",
        "And what about adults?"

        "That's another interesting bit of evidence as to the difference between them.",
        "It's--the fact of the matter is that all languages seem to be approximately equally hard or easy, whichever way you look at it, for children, so that children learning Arabic, say, as their first language, or Turkish or French or Spanish, are all doing roughly the same thing at roughly the same age, and 99.9 percent of them become native speakers of that language; whereas for adults, the picture is very, very different.",
        "Government data show that, in fact, the government separates four categories of language, that those same languages--Arabic, Chinese and so forth--take at least three times as long to reach the same intermediate level of proficiency for an American speaker of English, as do Spanish or French.",
        "So Spanish or French they can get from zero to low-intermediate level in 20 weeks of full-time instruction, whereas Arabic takes 44 weeks.",
        "Hm.",
        "Here's...",
        "Something seems to have changed, in other words, between children and adults.",
        "Something's happened in the brain.",
        "And do we know when that break is?",
        "Thirteen years old?",
        "There are rival claims about that.",
        "Increasingly, people who do research in this area think that it's somewhere between four and six that the ability to learn a nativelike phonology is no longer guaranteed.",
        "After that, if you start later, you--some people can still do it, but after 13, really, the game's up.",
        "The morphology, syntax, the grammar, if you like--mid-teens.",
        "Not everybody accepts that.",

        "My mother, who's listening, I'm sure won't accept it.",
        "I became fully bilingual at age 17 when I went away and studied Spanish intensely.",
        "I pass for a native speaker in every Spanish country I go to, and I don't like to think of myself as a case of arrested development, but rather fairly typical, and I know many of my colleagues in the Modern Language Association also are practically bilingual, if not bilingual, in a language acquired post-age 13.",
        "Well, Michael, there certainly are people like Rosemary who do pick it up, and there are people like me who try to pick it up and it's like a brick wall.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Rosemary's correct, and there are people--I said mid-teens--it's usually plus or minus two--we're talking about human beings, not chemicals in a test tube, so we get outliers.",
        "Notice probably people who work in LA are not typical language learners, otherwise they wouldn't be there.",
        "They have a real yen to do well in it.",
        "The data, though, are overwhelmingly in favor of the generalization that young children do better than adults in the long run.",
        "And very few adults--very few--vanishingly few make nativelike levels."

        "The international students seem to approach languages as a very real tool that they fully expected to be using almost on a daily basis throughout the rest of their life, whereas her US student friends seem to be approaching the languages either as intellectually interesting--they were French majors because they were interested in French literature...",

        "To have access to those great bodies of literature, to understand history and culture in the languages themselves gives opportunities that simply don't exist in translation.",

        "So even though we might not use the language in our job in a particular part of the United States, if we go to another part, we'll have opportunities not only to study abroad in our lives, but to study at home, to interact at home.",

        "Then the grammar of the language of the language will be easier, but the phonology and the pragmatics will not.",

        "Is it higher aptitude--in other words, is aptitude something that's partly innate, partly learned and you've just improved your aptitude for any language, or just for the ones that are close."
