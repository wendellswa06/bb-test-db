        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "And here are the headlines from some of the stories we're following today at NPR News.",
        "Food, blankets and tents are finally getting to earthquake victims in Pakistan, but heavy rain and hail has forced the cancellation of some relief flights to the earthquake-stricken region.",
        "And Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan getting assurances that the United States will continue to have access to military bases in that country.",
        "Earlier this year, Uzbekistan ordered US troops out of a base that had been used to operate in Afghanistan.",
        "You can hear details on these stories and, of course, much more later today on \"\"All Things Considered\"\" from NPR News.",
        "Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, natural gas prices have been steadily rising as a result, we can all expect to pay a lot more to heat our homes this winter, whether it's natural gas or heating oil or electricity.",
        "We'll talk about what you can do to make it less painful.",
        "Home heating costs tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Right now we're continuing and wrapping up our conversation on what's your second language and why.",
        "Our guest is Rosemary Feal, executive director of the Modern Language Association; is with us from our bureau in New York.",
        "And I wanted to read you this e-mail that we got from Arlie(ph)--I think it is--Lomelle(ph).",
        "`One area of the United States that's an exception to the rule about second languages,' he writes, `is the intermountain West.",
        "In the case of Mormons, second-language learning, a large institutional apparatus called the Missionary Training Center supports this learning and is by some accounts the largest language school in the world.",
        "Although the clear motivation for language learning is proselytizing, many Mormon missionaries go to specialize academically in the countries where they were missionaries, and the Mormon presence in foreign language instruction and related cultural fields such as folklore, linguistics and geography is considerable.",
        "I learned Hungarian in this manner,' he writes, `and I found Hungarian to be highly useful in my present field of study--folklore--and it never ceases to amaze Hungarians who meet me that I speak Hungarian and that I have no family or heritage connected to Hungary.'",
        "That's a wonderful observation, and I think it's exemplary, because it shows us that while you can learn languages for a very specific function, such as doing your mission work, you can also find uses for them way beyond that particular opportunity.",
        "I think it's also a model for all Americans to study languages so that you can interact with others in the world in their tongue and not only in your tongue.",
        "Another e-mail, this from Hilda Alvarez in Miami.",
        "`I'm a 42-year-old Cuban American living in Miami.",
        "I was born in New York City.",
        "While my parents worked I was cared for by my maternal grandmother, a Spaniard who lived with us.",
        "Since she didn't speak English, I learned Spanish before I learned English.",
        "I actually learned English from watching television and from books my bilingual parents read to me.",
        "Now living in Miami where Spanish is everywhere, I can't really say that Spanish is my second language.",
        "I consider both English and Spanish to be my primary languages.",
        "I'm completely fluent in both, and in fact earn a secondary income from translating in both directions.",
        "And I think Hilda is representative of a lot of people in this country who don't think of either of those languages as primary or secondary.",
        "That's right.",
        "That would be a fully functional bilingual, and many Americans identify themselves in that way and move seamlessly between the two languages.",
        "In fact, code-switch, as we call it, and feel very comfortable speaking in both Spanish and English and very often both at the same time as I do at home.",
        "So I think a good lesson here is that we should be encouraging our children to learn the languages that their parents or their caregivers speak and to keep those languages.",
        "Throughout American history, as we know, it was typical, as we heard from one of your callers, to get a rap on the knuckle if you spoke Italian in school or if you reverted to an indigenous language.",
        "And we should be encouraging kids to learn their own languages that they've come to the country with, learn English well.",
        "Cognitive studies have shown, research studies have shown that cognition is improved with acquiring another language.",
        "It also helps in aging.",
        "We understand that the aging brain that is bilingual does better, and I hope that gives a lot of us something to look forward to.",
        "Throughout the program we've been talking, at least for the most part, about living languages--I guess even Klingon fits in on some definitions.",
        "But what about the classics--ancient Latin, ancient Greek?"

        "Those languages are also up pretty remarkably, about 20 percent overall in the period from 1998 to 2002.",
        "Some of those languages that have increased dramatically are biblical Hebrew, modern Hebrew, ancient Greek and Latin.",
        "I talked to quite a few professors of classical languages who are...",

        "I was explaining why these languages might be of interest to students, these classic languages such as Latin and Greek.",
        "Part of the reason is a return to studying religious texts in the original languages.",
        "Latin, Greek and obviously biblical Hebrew are enormously of interest for scholars, students who want to read texts in original languages.",
        "There also seems to be a return to a classic humanistic liberal arts education, and anyone who's over 50 who's listening to this show knows that Latin was always a language that was required in a liberal arts curriculum.",
        "So I think a lot of students are recognizing the classical heritage that is our heritage, and connecting to it through study of these languages."
