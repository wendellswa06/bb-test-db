        "You see, what Hirsch and her colleague Michael Rosenbaum have found in their research is that when they scan people who've been on diets, lost 10 percent of their body weight and have depleted levels of the hormone leptin due to the weight loss, their brains tend to show an emotional pattern of response.",
