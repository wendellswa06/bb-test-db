        "They were able to get it out on paper, you know, in a way it almost acted as a confessional, you know.",

        "And so they felt completely comfortable and open.",
        "And I think, to be honest, a lot of them because they knew their parents were going to read this at some point, they even more so wanted to talk because they wanted on some level their parents to find out from the book what they were not comfortable telling them in person.",
