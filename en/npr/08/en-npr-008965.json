        "I haven't been for about a decade now but I totally agree with what your guest is saying.",
        "I was dealing, when I was a teenager especially when I hit puberty, with dealing with the fact that I was gay.",
        "And although I had tried to tell - had actually told both of my parents and neither one of them were blatantly or hostily(ph) homophobic, neither of them heard me.",
        "And so I spent many years in increasing levels of - I suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder.",
        "And so the compulsions and the rituals became more and more debilitating and more and more rigid in this attempt to purify myself and somehow to change or to…",
        "I don't mean to put words in your mouth but to meet their expectations.",
        "Totally, to meet everyone's expectations.",
        "And I felt like there really was no one that I could tell the truth to because that would be admitting that there was a truth to tell.",
        "And it wasn't until I was still a teenager when it happened, I was 18, when I finally just accepted it.",
        "I remember the day and the moment and I have never sensed it before, I experienced such relief.",
        "But I really do wish there had been someone that I could have talked to.",
        "And I hope that things are different for teenagers now.",
        "Malina Saval, thanks very much Deon, but one of the characters you write about is gay but defies expectations in other ways.",
        "And though his parents seemed - at least his mother seemed to have some of the same reactions that Deon's parents did.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean it's interesting because this particular boy that I write about in my book, he was put on Prozac by a psychiatrist shortly after he came out of the closet, so to speak, and told his parents that he was gay.",
        "And though, you know, the reasons for that were not just because he'd come out and said he was gay but because he was, quote-unquote, \"\"in their mind, acting out.",
        "He, you know, kissed another boy in the high school hallway and suddenly he was in a shrink's office and that shrink said, oh, you know, you're acting out.",
        "You've got some behavioral problems.",
        "Let's put you on Prozac and see if we can, oh, I don't know, repress your gayness, you know.",
        "So he was, you know, also dealing with people that just weren't 100 percent ready to, you know, accept him for who he was.",
        "And he spent a lot of time dealing with, you know, he comes from a part of the country where there's, you know, a high influx of individuals that, you know, are not exactly open to homosexuality.",
        "You know, they don't consider it a sin or whatnot but it's just not something they're comfortable with.",
        "And, you know, he had to deal with a lot of these individuals.",
        "And people who still said, you know, we love you but we don't really, you know, accept this part of you.",
        "The president has handled this racially charged situation very carefully, making sure to acknowledge the grievances of the community, but also the reality that police officers are working in dangerous circumstances."

        "So that was very difficult and also what was really interesting about this particular character, not only that he debunks stereotyping at every turn but also that a lot of the time it wasn't the other teenagers that he told that he was gay that had a problem with his homosexuality, his sexual orientation, it was actually adults.",
        "Which raises, I think, a really interesting point about how a lot of times the problem isn't about teenagers accepting themselves and accepting who they are, it's the adult population.",
        "And it was, you know, fascinating to hear a lot of the times from these boys that they felt okay in their skin, but their parents had all these unresolved issues that they had yet to deal with.",
        "And that's what made it difficult for teenagers to feel comfortable.",
        "They felt fine.",
        "It was everyone else, you know, their parents or guidance counselors, teachers sometimes that just were not ready to accept them for who they were.",

        "I was actually - I had a comment about why the guys might have opened up.",
        "I'm 22 now, but even when I was in high school, like 16 to 18, as a young guy, it was just easier to talk to women about emotional problems and stuff like that.",
        "Even now, I'll call up my friend Lisa rather than my best friend Ian if I want to talk about some kind of emotional thing that's been going on with me, you know?",
        "And you think that's true of other males, and specifically teenage boys?",
        "Well, I've had that with me definitely, and I just would be really surprised if it's not that way for a lot of other guys.",
        "Women just seem like they want to listen to you more about that kind of thing.",
        "Guys usually - like, I have great relationships with guys, but generally speaking, they just don't want to hear about that kind of stuff as much.",
        "Malina Saval, was that your experience?",
        "Well, you know, my only reference point is obviously me being a woman and me, you know, researching this book and meeting with all these boys.",
        "So I think there probably is something to that.",
        "Maybe there's a nurturing quality that boys saw, or maybe it's because I wasn't interviewing them in a clinical setting."

        "So I think it could be because I was a woman, and maybe I had a slightly youthful appearance and I was into a lot of the same music they were and really made a concerted effort to find out what was going on in their life pop-culturally.",

        "So while I hesitate to use the word crush, I think there's definitely a lot of respect and affection that was present and what made the book, you know, work well and made, you know, us be able to establish a close bond.",
