        "I think I talk about in my book how, you know, they're not going to sit around talking about supermodels per se, but they definitely, you know, there's a couple of conversations I had with boys, we'd be flipping through the latest copy of, you know, Details magazine and, you know, we're looking at a fashion spread of, you know, Patrick Dempsey, and some of the boys saying, oh, you know, it'd be so cool to look like that.",
        "So they how look was incredibly important to these boys.",
        "Another point - and we just have a couple of minutes left - and that is that as you went through all the things that segregated boys into different cliques and different groups and race and ethnicity and other factors, you said class, socioeconomic position was by far the most important."
