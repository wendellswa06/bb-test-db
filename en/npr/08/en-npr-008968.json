        "I've recently gone through a divorce, and my son is just - he's just empathetic and nonjudgmental, and the list can go on and on.",
        "But, you know, had I speculated early on about what my teenage son would be like, I don't think I would've guessed that those would be the qualities that I would describe.",

        "I was wondering if the daughter, her daughter, the twin shares the same sort of empathetic qualities and whether or not she was surprised that her daughter possessed those.",

        "But there's definitely been a difference, definitely been a difference.",
        "He's been a lot more supportive in many ways.",
        "Well, I think what's so great about what you said is that throughout the book, a lot of, you know, other than just the profiles of the boys, a lot of people weigh in - clinicians, experts, people - other people that have worked with boys, they weigh in on the fact that loyalty and empathy are two of the most undersold qualities about teenage boys.",
        "And even in the minds and through the point of view of the boys themselves, they see themselves as more emotional sometimes and empathetic than the girls.",
        "A lot of boys came to me and said, you know, my friends and I, we have such a tight bond and we would never stab one another in the back.",
        "And all the girls at school, they'll say one nice thing to someone's face, but then they'll just turn around and say something cold and judgmental.",

        "Boys are incredibly loyal in terms of friendships and very empathetic.",
        "And that we've got this misconception in our culture that they're not, that's what's interesting, because boys are emotional.",
        "And anyone who's spent time with boys will know this to be true.",
        "And if you haven't spent time with boys, then you don't know that.",

        "Well, I will say the number one caveat is guessing wrong.",

        "The boys absolutely loathed that approach, because the truth is, you were young, yes, but not at the same time, you know, and place that we're in right now in our culture in America.",
        "So, first of all, I think if you're going to your son, per the boys that I interviewed, have just a really open - keep an open mind about what their situation is like and understand that it's going to be different from when you were a child.",
        "And don't come in with any presupposed notions of what's going on because right away, that's going to turn them off.",
        "They just did not like when parents said to them, you know, I understand that this must be hard for you, or I understand that you must be feeling this way.",
        "I would say go in with as few assumptions as possible and really just encourage your child to be able to talk, you know, freely from their point of view about how they feel.",
