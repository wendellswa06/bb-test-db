        "Is the Iraqi government still fighting the same war as the United States?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "Not at all.",
        "I mean, Iraqis, I think, are fighting, quite frankly, for their own - I mean the people in the government, for the most part, it's quite venal.",
        "I mean, they're fighting for power, they're fighting for money.",
        "It is highly corrupt.",
        "There is no sense of national unity.",
        "No, I mean, for all this talk of a government of national unity, people are not working together for the betterment of the greater whole - far from it.",

        "Money is not the issue.",
        "It is not filtering down to the people.",
        "I mean, the American commanders have been tearing their hair out because, you know, they would go in and clear an area, and the ministers and the ministries would not appear on the ground.",
        "They did nothing to improve the infrastructure.",
        "You know, it is - I was in Basra, down in southern Iraq when I was there this last time and it's just like Anne was saying.",
        "I mean there is, nominally, a government in place in Basra.",
        "But basically, what you have on the ground is a free-for-all between competing militias, you know, vying for power, money and influence at this point.",
        "And, you know, basically the way they deal with each other is through assassinations and killings.",
        "I mean, one morning we woke up and... The killing in Basra is not like the killing in Baghdad.",
        "But you wake up one morning and 20 people had already been killed.",
        "And most of those are assassinations.",
        "Have you had an opportunity to ask an Iraqi leader a question along the lines of, what is the matter with you?",
        "Your country is falling apart and you're arguing over who controls some bit of turf?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But Iraqis tend to blame everybody but themselves.",
        "And this is an age-old problem.",
        "They did it under Saddam.",
        "They blamed their Arab neighbors for their problems.",
        "And now you ask them why aren't things working better?",
        "And they'll blame the Jordanians.",
        "They'll blame the Syrians.",
        "They'll blame the Iranians, depending on who you're asking, and they'll blame the U.S.",

        "You know, it's such a... I swear, it is so grim at this point.",

        "You know, I asked him the question.",

        "And he looked at me for a couple of seconds, and he knitted his brow, and he said, you know, how could it get any worse at this point?",
        "Let me pose that question that the gentleman asked you.",
        "Can it get worse?",
        "Oh, I'm sure it could get worse.",

        "at least keeps some kind of a lid on at this point.",
        "That incident that I mentioned, the Americans being removed from the checkpoints, reminded me of a conversation with an American who had just come back from Iraq not too long ago.",
        "And he said one thing to remember is that we have even less control in Iraq than we think we do.",

        "Oh, there's no question that we've seen that now, three years in.",

        "You know, this idea of the sectarian divide, you know, the role of religion, the influence of militias, all of these forces have finally kind of come together and intersected into this chaos and this anarchy that we see in the country today.",

        "Now, observers are forever inferring motives to all of this.",
        "What was the news that was so disturbing or what was the absence of good news that was so disturbing that was driving stocks down earlier in the week?",
        "Well, I think it's been just this relentless barrage of negative economic news whether it's a company specific or the overall economy or the world's economy.",
        "But no matter what the catalyst, the news had been negative and the market has been of course in this negative bias now going back 16 or 17 months, and it's just been relentless without anything positive to look at.",
        "In fact, if there has been positive news and clearly there has been from time to time, it's been completely lost by the negative, by the overall negative feeling.",
        "Now, today the big comeback at the end for the Dow came just as word of Timothy Geithner, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, being picked for Treasury secretary was being reported everywhere.",
        "Were people on the floor actually hearing Geithner, Geithner, Geithner, was this the Geithner rally?",
        "Well, I don't think they said it was the Geithner rally, but clearly that was one of the catalysts.",
        "But I think a lot of folks actually felt coming in to today after last - yesterday's close which was so disappointing that, you know, it's sort of like kicking a dead horse and after a while and no matter how bad the news, and the market is so dramatically always sold, that it just felt today like perhaps we will going to get a rally.",
        "And I think the Geithner news couldn't have come at a better time because it came late in the afternoon, the market actually had sold off about 80 points, it rallied to even and then the news sort of came out and then the market took off.",
        "I think it was just primed for any kind of news that would be construed as positive, and clearly I think that's a good selection.",
        "I think most people are happy with that I mean certainly he's qualified and he understands the dynamics of what we've been going through for the last six months.",
        "So, I think the perception is that it was a good choice, the market needed something good to focus on, it was over sold, and we ended up with a good short covering, technical rally to close.",
        "We're still down on the week, but certainly whatever the reasons I think it's - we'll take it.",
        "I was hoping you could define for us, a word that we hear sometime from Wall Street people, a capitulation.",
        "What is it and is it anywhere in sight?",
        "Well, I think a capitulation is basically when people say you can keep the cheese, let me out of the trap.",
        "It's - they give up, you know, so much of stock trading is driven by human emotion.",
        "Unfortunately they never ring a bell at the top, they didn't ring a bell when the Dow was at 14,000 to tell us it was the top, and we have a lot of emotions running then, except it was all positive and now of course we're on the opposite side of that equation and we have a lot of people that are basically just giving up and perhaps for good reason because they are scared and disappointed and everybody has lost a lot of money and, but at the end of the day when human emotion starts to make the investment decisions I suppose to logic, we get into an environment where we get the capitulation and it's simply - it's another word for people just throwing in the towel.",
        "They give up, they're scared, they just want to go home and be left alone.",
        "And it usually comes at an inflection point in the market either, you know, you can get a capitulation on the upside and certainly you can get it on the downside.",
        "I'm not sure that we have seen that yet because we've been through so many negative days, but there is no question that people are basically throwing the towel in here and it is in an environment like this whether the capitulation comes in one day or it comes over a period of time that usually things get way over done in this case on the downside, and in fact there could be some really very, very, interesting long term opportunities.",
