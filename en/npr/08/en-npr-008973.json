        "They both talk about building a stronger country.",
        "They both especially lean on economic nationalism.",
        "But they've got different approaches to a lot of key issues, especially if you think about energy.",
        "Some examples we've come across in our reporting - China has a goal to be a leader in electric cars.",
        "President Trump doesn't seem interested in that.",

        "China's cutting back on coal as President Trump promises more.",
        "Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord while China emphasizes they're going to honor it.",
        "And fairly or not, these differences have allowed President Xi to propose - to pose as the one who is the protector of the global order and the one who's looking to the future.",
        "Interesting - which would be something Donald Trump would not would not appreciate, I imagine.",
