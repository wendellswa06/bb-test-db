        "Next, we have a follow-up on a woman named Catherine Royce.",
        "She contributed an essay in 2006 for our series This I Believe.",
        "She had been a dancer and a deputy arts commissioner for the City of Boston.",
        "Then in 2003, Catherine Royce was diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease.",
        "Here's NPR's Richard Knox with the rest of her story.",
        "My friend and neighbor Catherine Royce died recently, by choice.",
        "Choice was important to Catherine, as she said two and a half years ago in her essay for NPR.",
        "I believe that I always have a choice.",
        "No matter what I'm doing, no matter what is happening to me, I always have a choice.",
        "There's a deep irony here.",
        "Catherine certainly didn't choose to get ALS.",
        "And she had no choice as she lost her ability to walk, to feed herself, to talk above a whisper and lately, to breathe without sucking on an oxygen tube every 15 seconds or so.",
        "As the losses mounted, Catherine considered again and again whether to choose life.",
        "As she said in 2006…",
        "Every day, I choose not only how I will live, but if I will live.",
        "I have no particular religious mandate that forbids contemplating a shorter life, an action that would deny this disease its ultimate expression.",
        "But until this spring, Catherine kept finding reasons to live.",
        "As she put it, she opened herself to other possibilities.",
        "I can choose to see ALS as nothing more than a death sentence, or I can choose to see it as an invitation, an opportunity to learn who I truly am.",
        "She poured out those insights in a series of essays that she got to see published a few months ago, in a book she called \"\"Wherever I Am, I'm Fine.\"\" But as breathing got more difficult, Catherine became anxious and frightened of dying - that is, until an event that happened a couple of months ago.",
        "A nurse was filling the vaporizer on Catherine's oxygen machine.",
        "Something went wrong.",
        "The machine shut down.",
        "Soon, three nurses were in the room, frantically trying to restart it.",
        "They couldn't hear Catherine's feeble voice.",
        "She tried to tell them she was running out of breath, that they should hook up the spare machine.",
        "She was insane with fear, she said later, and knew the game was up.",
        "Then she experienced something others have described at the threshold of death: The scene behind my closed eyes was filled with a brilliant white corridor featuring a right-hand turn at the end, she wrote in her blog.",
        "Feeling curious and no longer afraid, I started to walk down the corridor - no wheelchairs here.",
        "At that point, I heard one of the nurses say, there it goes.",
        "The machine started up again.",
        "Catherine was pulled back to life.",
        "After that, she wasn't afraid anymore.",
        "She began planning her death, a deliberate one, not one that would occur because a machine suddenly broke down.",
        "It wasn't easy to arrange.",
        "Some around her felt strongly it was wrong, and told her so.",
        "A lawyer for the nursing home was consulted."

        "Now the Colts are among the league's worst in kickoff and punt coverage, which means they let opponents start with the ball in pretty good field position, on average, the 31-yard line.",
        "The Bears, meanwhile, are very good at returning the ball.",
        "They've got rookie Devin Hester.",
        "He's got six touchdowns on special teams.",
        "That's tremendous.",
        "Before we get on to all the non-kicking guys who will be playing on Sunday, there's only one kicker in the football Hall of Fame?",
        "Yup.",
        "Jan Stenerud of the Kansas City Chiefs, and they did win a Super Bowl in 1970.",
        "Back to Sunday's game, there are a lot of people who think that it doesn't matter where the Bears start, where they get the ball, they just won't be able to score enough points to keep pace with the Indianapolis Colts and their quarterback, Peyton Manning.",
        "The funny thing, though, is on paper the Bears are the better team.",
        "They've got better special teams.",
        "They have a far better defense.",
        "They have an offense that has scored as many points as the Colts.",
        "But Manning is the story.",
        "He's that good, and he hasn't reached the Super Bowl or certainly won one.",
        "And there's an article on the Web site coldhardfootballfacts that I've just read that shows how Manning, through the nine years he's been in the league, compares more than favorably with the full careers of some of the greatest passers ever.",
        "It also argues that even though he's only got a six and six playoff record, Manning's post-season statistics match up very well with those of three-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady of New England.",
        "The point being it's more than just individual performance that decides football games.",
        "On the other hand, Manning will go up against the Chicago Bears defense that is very good."

        "Very good.",
        "Another numbers focused Web site, FootballOutsiders, says that the Colts offense this season is the second best in the NFL in the past decade, behind only the Colts offense in 2004.",
        "The strengths are not just Manning's arm, but things like the ability to protect Manning when he passes.",
        "And to control that, the Bears rushers are going to have to put pressure on him and that's the one thing that they're not great at.",
        "Now just a word about the other quarterback in the game, the Bears' Rex Grossman.",
        "Hardly the ideal quarterback, but he gets the job done.",
        "And I don't think it matters that much.",
        "You can win a Super Bowl with an average quarterback.",
        "Trent Dilfer and the Baltimore Ravens did it in 2000.",
        "Phil Simms of the New York Giants in 1986.",
        "If you look back, he had very mediocre season statistics and then he put up the best passer rating in Super Bowl history.",
        "Now the issue with Grossman has been that he's had some awful games and now he's being compared with Manning.",
        "But so far in the playoffs, his statistics had been on par with Manning's.",
        "So the key might be which Indianapolis defense shows up on Sunday - the one that gave up more points in the regular season than any team that's won a Super Bowl or the one that was exceptional in the first two playoff games and good enough to beat the Patriots in the third.",
