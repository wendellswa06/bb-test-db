        "So the Log Cabin Republicans declined to endorse Trump's 2016 bid.",
        "What was the rationale for endorsing the reelection?",
        "Well, you know, it's not a very large board.",
        "I think that there is a sense that they wanted the opportunity to work within the party to be able to have a voice.",
        "Those of us who opposed it felt very, very strongly that the president simply has not earned the endorsement.",
        "That's why I and, at this point, several others have resigned from the board.",
        "Now, you made this decision very publicly, and I just wonder why was that important to you but also very specifically what were the major factors in you saying not only am I going to step down, I'm going to talk about why I did that?",
        "Sure.",
        "Listen, President Trump has an abysmal record on issues of equality and inclusion.",
        "And I think it's always important to stand up and to speak out when we're talking about such important issues to our country.",
        "I think it makes it easier for other people to stand up when they see somebody else doing it.",
        "And while I certainly respect that people have all sorts of reasons perhaps not to do so, from my perspective, the example that I want to set for my children and the reasons that I got involved in politics to begin with require that I make sure that my voice is heard.",
        "Since you resigned, one of the things I've heard from board members on the Log Cabin Republicans is, you know, actually they see the president as somebody who's been good on LGBTQ issues specifically and also that possibly what contributed to your resignation was that you worked on Bill Weld's campaign, who announced a primary challenge to Trump.",
        "How do you respond to that?",
        "I have been speaking up against Donald Trump since April of 2011.",
        "He came to New Hampshire to kind of dip his toes in the primary waters at that time and was scared off by the strength of Mitt Romney's campaign.",
        "And I published an op-ed at that time warning the Republican Party what would happen if they took Donald Trump seriously.",
        "The idea that this has anything to do with anything other than a long record of trying to be consistent and principled in my positions on Republican values in Donald Trump is just - it's not the truth.",
        "And the idea that he's actually been beneficial for the LGBT community.",
        "Yeah, I'm just - obviously I saw the endorsement op-ed that the organization wrote, and it talks about the fact that this president, you know, supports the idea that homosexuality should be decriminalized throughout the world and that countries that criminalize it should be held accountable in some way.",
        "That's just - how low a bar are we going to set?",
        "This president has a record of targeting the transgender community over and over again, in housing protections, in protections for students, you know, the trans military ban, in so many ways.",
        "Now, you mentioned your children and how important they were in making this decision.",
        "In your resignation letter you wrote, you could never endorse Trump for president of the United States and still look them in the eye.",
        "What's your hope for the future of the Republican Party for your children?",
        "My hope is that we will return to the day when our party stands on principle, when we stand firm and at least try to fight for the high ground.",
        "I think it is immoral for us to try to suggest that Donald Trump is just like any other president.",
        "He's not.",
        "And what I would like to see is a party that is able to move forward in a much more inclusive manner.",
        "We will return to kind of that inspirational and aspirational idea that we were founded on the fight for freedom and equality and opportunity for all."

        "Anne Sexton's poetry is like blood on the page, the most intimate kind of writing about depression and death, motherhood and sex, religion and family.",
        "She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1967 and had a prolific but tragically short career.",
        "She took her own life at the age of 46.",
        "Now two poetry hunters - that's right, that's a thing - have discovered more of her works, previously unknown works that show how she became one of the pioneers of confessional poetry.",

        "And when was the moment that you realized, oh, no one's seen these before?",
        "Well, Zach looked at them and said, you know, these look like Sexton.",
        "But they don't look like the Sexton I've read.",
        "So even from the beginning, we had a very clear idea that we might have found something special here.",
        "So the next step was to reach out to other more-established Sexton scholars who hadn't seen them.",
        "And that was when we got really excited.",
        "They put us in touch with her daughter and literary executor Linda Gray Sexton, who also said, I have never seen these, either.",
        "So Anne Sexton, as we've said, is one of the poets that really introduced the idea of confessional poetry, poetry that's personal - so much about the I.",
        "How do these poems fit into that emerging style?",
        "I would suggest to you that right now, every member of Congress is trying to do whatever he can, because of the outrageous $3 gas and the outrage coming from the public.",

        "For decades, it's been tough for British farmers, as rock-bottom crop prices meant huge financial difficulties.",

        "Wheat prices three years ago were around 60 pounds a ton.",
        "Now the spot price for wheat is around about 170.",
        "That tripling of the price Munns gets for his wheat has revitalized his farm as a business.",

        "We won't do anything particularly to make biofuels here now, just because of the - it's just not worth it.",
        "Britain had turned much less land over to biofuels than other European countries such as Germany.",
        "But still, only two percent of European agricultural land is used to grow such crops, compared to between 20 and 30 percent in the United States.",
        "So, spokesman on agriculture at the European Union in Brussels, Michael Mann, believes the EU is a part of the solution to the world food shortage, not part of the problem.",
        "We're seeing huge areas of land in countries that have recently joined the European Union coming into production that previously people left unplanted.",
        "We're also trying very hard to move into the second generation of biofuels, which don't use agricultural raw materials but use byproducts and waste products.",
        "And also, we will import a certain amount of our needs.",
        "So we don't see the European Union biofuel policy will a major affect on food prices or food availability.",
        "John Alliston, dean of the School of Agriculture at Britain's Royal Agricultural College agrees.",
