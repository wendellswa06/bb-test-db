        "Well, I think one of my favorite things about Sexton is how she kind of emerges almost fully formed, right?",
        "So she wasn't a childhood poetry writer.",
        "You know, before she even started taking a poetry class where she's writing for therapy, 12 years after that, she's winning the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.",
        "So what these poems show is, yes, her development but also very much her initial poetic power.",
        "In 1957, she presents her mother with a sort of homemade book of poems.",
        "And she says this was the first year of Anne Sexton, you know, poet - and that's before she even starts publishing - and then very shortly after has a meteoric rise to fame.",
        "So I guess I'd like to know what these poems are about and something that really moved you.",
        "Can you give us an example?",
        "In some ways, they're almost a young person's poem - some of them.",

        "OK.",
        "So we expect Johnson's opponents to try to block him in Parliament this week.",
        "How would that even work?",
        "Well, they've already got a bill put together.",
        "And what they'll have to do, almost certainly beginning tomorrow, is take control of the agenda of the British Parliament, which normally is under the control of the prime minister.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But they're expected to get it 'cause they'll have a lot of support from the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.",
        "And then if they can get that through in the next few days and they can block him from leaving with no deal, then we actually think that Boris Johnson is going to do what he just said he wouldn't do and doesn't want to do, which he'll have almost no choice but to call an election and take this back to the people.",

        "But Corbyn's hoping that Boris Johnson would get knocked out after an election.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But the question is this.",
        "One the reasons people think Johnson may actually want an election is Corbyn is a pretty weak candidate in a lot of ways.",
        "He did very well in 2017, but he is a socialist.",
        "He's pretty far to the left.",
        "And he would be easy, in some ways, for Johnson to paint him as somebody who is going to damage the economy.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",

        "No opposition leader or party with these poll ratings has won an election.",
        "And those poll ratings are not good for Jeremy Corbyn right now.",
        "For the month of August, Labour is running 8 points behind the Conservatives, and Corbyn would be a drag on them, it seems, at the ballot box.",
        "The other thing is, why would Boris Johnson actually want an election?",
        "He has a tiny, tiny majority.",
        "He would love to go into election, get a much larger majority.",
        "And that way, he'd have the votes that he needs to push through Brexit.",
        "So how do you think the EU feels about all this?",
        "What do you think they want?",
        "Oh, I think they would love to see Brexit either get it done and get a withdrawal agreement - 'cause they don't want to no-deal Brexit, where you could have a lot of disruption at the borders.",
        "Or they would like to see - I think they'd love to see a second referendum where they didn't leave the EU at all.",
        "But right now I think they're sitting back in Brussels and they're letting the politicians in the United Kingdom battle this out as they have now for more than three years, waiting to see especially what happens at the end of this week."
