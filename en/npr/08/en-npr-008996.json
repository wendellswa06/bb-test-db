        "His voice was sort of weak and the judge had to ask him to speak up.",
        "Hard to tell but I'm sure it was an immensely emotional experience for him.",
        "And he said several times that he was extremely, extremely sorry.",
        "So, he said that this began in the early 1990s, so for nearly 20 years that he was basically sending these false statements to these investors saying they were invested in this stock and that stock and carrying on this massive multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme, is it conceivable that he did this all by himself?",
        "Well, that is the really big question here and that's what all the people I talk to, the lawyers that have come to watch this, that the victims who came to watch this guilty plea, that's their question.",
        "Most people I talk to say there is no way he could have done it alone.",
        "Now, specifically, I'll say, in the indictment against him prosecutors named no other names, they do not charge them with conspiracy, which you have to do if he was working with somebody else, and they say he hired low-level employees who didn't understand finance.",
        "So as of right now, we don't know who else may have helped him, but we do know his brother was part of the business.",
        "His wife was an early bookkeeper for him.",
        "His two sons were part of the business, and there are certainly going to be questions and further investigations in terms of how much impact they had on this crime.",
        "As you say, many of his victims were inside the courtroom watching.",
        "What did they want today?",
        "The ones that I've talked to did not say that they were - wanted a huge long jail sentence for him.",
        "You know, the total amount of crimes could total 150 years.",
        "They are not as much as interested in that as they are finding this money.",
        "They want their money back.",
        "They certainly want him to spend the rest of his life in jail, but they're far more interested in making him hurt where it really counts, which I guess is his wallet.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, and is there any hope then that there actually is money squirreled away somewhere that these investigators could get back?",
        "As of right now, the magistrate has located about a billion dollars.",
        "Now remember, at the time that they arrested Madoff, he had claimed investments of $65 billion on behalf of his clients.",
        "So, a billion is a tiny fraction of this.",
        "There may be more money out there, but remember, a lot of this money went back to investors that pulled out five years ago, 10 years ago.",
        "That's the point of a Ponzi scheme.",
        "You have to keep paying the money out.",
        "Some of the money went to the IRS to pay taxes.",
        "Certainly some of the money went to his lavish lifestyle.",
        "The question now is how much is left over and is it in any form that they can get to.",
        "NPR's Robert Smith outside the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan where Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty today to all the charges against him, that he ran a giant Ponzi scheme bilking investors out of billions of dollars.",
        "He'll be sentenced in June, and the judge has said that he will be jailed until his sentencing.",
        "At 70 years old, Bernard Madoff will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.",
        "Robert, thank you.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "A year ago, writer Neil Gaiman told the graduating class at Philadelphia's University of the Arts that life is sometimes hard.",
        "Things go wrong in life, in love, and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong.",
        "And when things get tough, Gaiman said, this is what you should do: Make good art.",
        "Neil Gaiman's speech became a hit on the Web, and now it's been adapted into a small book.",

        "I didn't tell any stories, mostly because it was a graduating speech and I - you know, a commencement speech, and I had 20 minutes to try and squeeze everything that I'd learned or figured out, normally by bitter experience, in 30 years of being a professional writer into 19 minutes of talking to a graduating class.",
