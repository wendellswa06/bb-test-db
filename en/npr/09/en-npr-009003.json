        "You could feel the life in the mill towns of Massachusetts.",
        "But in both cases, they are one standard American theme, which is somehow rising up out of the working class.",

        "Yes.",
        "Although in dealing with documents from those days, one has to make very sure that you tune your ear in to the little things that were actually said during a trial or during a hearing like this and the things that are inferred, the things that might've been smoothed out by the court interpreter who would try to smarten up the language and make it the acceptable current language of the Dutch at the Cape early - in the 18th century.",
        "Tell me how tangled the relationship between Philida and Francois is in the novel.",
        "It is extremely tangled, because initially, it was practically a rape.",
        "But both of them became, in one way or another - in one measure or another - infatuated with the other.",
        "They developed between them a real love relationship, which meant that it came as a shock to both of them - to Francois as much as to Philida - when his father, Cornelius, decided that he had to do the decent thing and marry his son off to a rich white girl, not a slave.",
        "Let's read from the latter part of your book where Philida, really, is on the brink of freedom.",
