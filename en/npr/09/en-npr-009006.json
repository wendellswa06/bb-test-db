        "We want to make sure it's not just another stimulus bill that will not create any jobs, so it's just too early to tell what that package is going to look like and the weather is sort of interfering, this week, with our ability to do business as well.",

        "Even Japan's protective quotas on rice being imported in Japan, we could sell rice to Japan at one-half the price of what it costs their farmers to grow.",

        "Finally, the Islamic Courts came in and actually created safety and kind of ejected the warlords out of Mogadishu and actually took over other parts of the country, which was really welcomed by the Somalis because for 14 years they had no law and order.",
        "And for the first time, their children could play in the streets; the women could go to the market.",
        "And so the Islamic Courts Union was actually welcomed by a majority of the people because they had nothing but terror over the 14 years.",
        "Of course, then we encouraged Ethiopia to go in.",
        "They deny they were there.",
        "They've been there for months.",
        "But they can't stay there because it will be a guerilla-type war.",
        "It would be simply what's happening in Iraq to our coalition forces with Ethiopia there.",
        "And so - and it also weakens, I think, the transitional government because it seems like a proxy of Ethiopia, who are archenemies of Somalia.",
        "So I think it was a failed policy.",

        "So there really wasn't a lot of information in the trial.",
        "But one thing I found was a confession that was obtained without an attorney around, and Willie wrote eight mysterious words in that confession that always caught my eye, and I always thought there was something more to this story.",
        "He wrote, \"\"It was a secret about me and him.\"\" And that never came up in the trial.",
        "It never came up in any appeal.",

        "So this really captured the public's attention.",
        "And I think why people looked at it differently was that people may not have had strong feelings one way or the other about the death penalty, but when it came to somebody who woke up in the morning, who went to the electric chair and did their part, and because of two drunken executioners, they didn't die, people thought that's unfair, and that he should not have to go back to the chair.",

        "And so I think his dignity and the things he used to say, he was very poetic in his speaking, and even though he described the first trip to the chair as being \"\"plum mis'able,\"\" and he had a terrific stutter, but he was still very poetic and a lot of newspapers called attention that here's this calm kid who speaks so beautifully.",
