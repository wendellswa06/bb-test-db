        "And the last thing he said to the people was, \"\"There's people watching me right now go to my death who know that I'm innocent.\"\" And when he fell from the scaffold, they had too much rope, and his feet touched the ground.",
        "And what happened was the sheriff dug a hole under his feet until he strangled to death.",
        "And the last thing he did was put a curse on St. Martinville, and so a lot of people thought when Willie went to the electric chair and survived, that the town really was cursed.",

        "The defense in the Jerry Sandusky trial rested today without calling the former Penn State assistant football coach to testify, perhaps because he did not help his cause in media interviews after charges surfaced last November.",

        "And jurors are always instructed, after they start - before they start deliberations that the fact that the defendant didn't testify should make no - draw no conclusions from that.",
        "But there's that, and then there's human nature.",
        "Well, you're right.",
        "The law is belied by human nature.",

        "If you didn't do it, you should look me in the eye and say: I didn't do it.",
        "And in light of the fact that the defense theory appears to be that these eight kids were lying for financial gain, that they were influenced to lie by the police and that Sandusky is a man of good character, why shouldn't this man of good character look them in the eye and say: I didn't do it.",
        "And here's why I believe they're lying: I was friends to these kids.",
        "I was horseplaying - however he wishes to explain it.",
        "It doesn't have to be artful explanation.",
        "It just has to be honest, sincere explanation, and then maybe the jury will find some sympathy with him.",
        "Maybe the jury will find a reason to care about him, maybe a reason to find a not-guilty verdict.",
        "Then you need a reason to acquit him.",
        "And at this point in time, without him looking them in the eye and giving them that reason, I think Sandusky's running a huge risk.",
        "Although, on the other hand, can't forget, Sandusky was a defensive coordinator.",
        "So he ought to know defense.",
        "I just hope that he knows a little bit more about criminal defense than he's let on so far.",
        "Would an attorney - and this is, again, hypothetical - but would an attorney look at his client's interviews in the media and say: ooh, well, hmm, he's not so good.",

        "Ultimately, the decision as to whether or not to testify is the client's.",
        "That's one of those inviolate decisions that the lawyer can't make for the client.",

        "Ultimately, it's the client's decision.",
        "The average lay person is no match for a skilled prosecutor's pointed cross examination.",
        "So it's a Hail Mary pass?",
        "Is that the right idea?",
        "Well, if your client is going to take the witness stand, you obviously prepare him, you know?",
        "We've heard on the news lately who's going to be the presidential surrogates for the debates.",
        "Well, you do the same thing with any witness.",
        "The lawyer asks them the questions, asked them cross-examination questions that they can expect to hear, so you get the witness ready to testify.",
        "You go over all the bumps.",
        "You have him ready to answer any tough questions.",
        "Ultimately, the decision has to be a strategic one, but you prepare the client for the worst.",
        "And again, the kinds of considerations that you have are: Is you're client affable?",
        "Is he friendly?",
        "Is he likeable?",

        "He can use all of those same tools that he's developed over the years when he's on the witness stand.",

        "So what I'm going to hope to do is to have a more integrated approach where we could perhaps have the Army Corps of Engineers assist countries in building elementary schools, which are very inexpensive, and to work with a voluntary organizations, religious groups, to equip and to help assist in teacher training itself."
