        "Was there a case that you remember where it was either a particularly wise or a particularly unfortunate decision?",
        "I've had a number of cases where - I mean, I agree.",
        "I think no matter how much counsel and the court reminds the jury that there is a presumption of innocence, jurors always want to hear from the defendant.",
        "And, yes, there have been a number of cases where I've just said you really don't want to testify.",
        "And I had a case where the client took the stand over my advice, and ultimately, I think it was just extremely detrimental to his case.",
        "And there's no recourse after that, of course.",
        "No. It is the client's choice.",

        "This is from John: I was a criminal prosecutor in the 1980s in Shasta County, California when a defendant like Sandusky had a particularly unbelievable version and took the stand.",
        "An old adage came in very handy during closing arguments.",
        "It was: It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.",
        "I think that's a quote from Mark Twain.",
        "And I wonder, Gary Asteak, if you had a chance to - have a thought like that cross your mind?",
        "Well, it is always risky.",
        "You know, you always say that your client is always his worst witness.",
        "On the other hand, I believe that any analysis begins with a premise.",
        "The jury wants to hear from him, so why do we not put him on the witness stand and take it from there?",
        "It's easy to Monday-morning-quarterback this.",
        "It'll be very easy for us to say, he should have testified or he didn't testify.",
        "But at the end of the day, the client doesn't want to be sitting and stake prison for the rest of his life thinking, you know, if I'd gotten on the witness stand and I looked him in the eye and I told him I didn't do it, maybe that would have meant a difference.",
        "And if Sandusky does have an explanation or did have an explanation or your client has an explanation, he's going to see the cunning cross-examination of the prosecutor for what it is.",
        "The jury is going to see it, and the truth will prevail.",
        "Ultimately, the truth will prevail if everyone who participates takes the stand and testifies honestly.",
        "And if Jerry Sandusky had decided to take the stand, at least he'll have no buyer's remorse Monday morning when they lose the national championship because he didn't call the play that should have been called.",
        "Gary Asteak, a criminal defense attorney.",

        "I had told him I did not think it would go well.",
        "I suggested he not.",
        "He had to testify.",
        "And in the middle of his testimony, he volunteered for the first time that I had ever heard in six months of working with him, I never should've taken the wheel that night.",
        "I wish I just given my wife the keys.",
        "I was drunk.",
        "And obviously, it took the jury 30 seconds once the case went to them to find him guilty.",
        "And since that time, I cannot think of a time where I've ever encouraged or not try to discourage a client from testifying, and I can't think of a time where it's ever helped.",
        "Ever helped?",
        "Each chamber actually has passed a health care bill; it's just that they haven't passed the same one.",
        "As Majority Leader Harry Reid opened an afternoon session of the Senate, he made no mention, whatsoever, of the unfinished business of health care.",
        "Issue before the Senate today is what we do with Mother Nature.",
        "Mother Nature's been very difficult to deal with.",
        "In my personal, you know, within my jury trials, I just cannot think of a time where I have seen the client get up and be able to actually convince the jury that either, you know, he's - obviously, the criminal defendant has the greatest - in the opinion of many jurors, I think, has the greatest motivation to shade the truth.",
        "So my opinion is, even the juries may want to hear from that individual, they tend to view that testimony, I think, with a preexisting skepticism.",
        "And it's just as not - in my opinion, it has not seemed to help my clients.",
        "Or the, you know, other attorneys when I watch their trials, it generally does not seem to go well.",
        "Thanks for the call, Al.",
        "And, Gary Asteak, here's another lawyer who disagrees with you: I represent abusive parents in juvenile dependency courts.",

        "Sure.",
        "It depends on the circumstances.",
        "If your client tells a story or recounts a version of events that are consistent with other bits of evidence in the case and fleshes out and fully forms the theory of your defense - there's the story of defense.",
        "And if your client is capable of fleshing that out and providing a human context to that story, it is far more compelling than asking the jury to decide simply, well, I didn't find him guilty because there was reasonable doubt.",
        "Sandusky - this case, is not a reasonable doubt case.",
        "In light of the overwhelming evidence that is in that courtroom, it does not appear to me to be the kind of case where coming in to the defense side of the case, they can say, well, they haven't proved it.",

        "It was so fantastic that I was left with the impression that they must be guilty.",
        "There's no other reasonable explanation.",
        "And so as, you know, you look at the Sandusky case, eight accusers and all these facts, and you wonder, is there any story he could possibly author that wouldn't sound so fantastic and outrageous that wouldn't further convict him?",
        "But despite the admonition about presumption of innocence, don't you think, in this kind of a case, not to testify is raising the white flag?",
