        "To see why, its helpful to understand just how the immune system of the younger adult responds to a vaccine.",

        "And pieces of bacteria are foreign, and pieces of viruses are foreign.",
        "So then, says Dr. Stefan Gravenstein of Brown University, your immune system goes into action when it gets a vaccine."

        "So now you have a refined surveillance system for the whole body.",
        "Like microscopic spies searching the bloodstream for enemies, some of these spying cells also begin to make antibodies, which are like little flags that literally attach themselves to the foreign invader, alerting the rest of the immune system to their exact location.",

        "Some of them work like this.",

        "Other killer cells absorb the remains of the foreign invader and use their enzymes to chew it up.",

        "But somewhere between your 50s and 70s, your whole immune reaction, you could say, just sort of loses its pep.",
        "When confronted with a vaccine or a real germ, the immune system of an older person makes less of everything: fewer spy cells, fewer antibodies and fewer killer cells.",
