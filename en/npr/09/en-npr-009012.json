        "Roku is cheap and it's easy, and that's a winning combination.",
        "But I think that there's something larger to remember, which is that, in the next couple of years, most of these boxes are going to go away.",
        "And this technology is going to migrate into either your TV or your set-top box itself.",
        "You know, it's impossible to predict which that will be.",
        "There are a number of business problems that need to be solved before we get there.",

        "And we had one of those bundle plans, where you get the cable, the Internet and the phone together.",
        "And the price for Internet by itself from our provider - in order to stream the Netflix, I guess you have to have like six to eight megabytes per second or whatever to have a good picture - is pretty high.",

        "It's like the local cable companies seem to have a monopoly on subscribers in the area.",

        "Don't ask me to explain that one.",
