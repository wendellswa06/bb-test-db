        "Right.",
        "You're seeing it around, I would say - you're seeing it around the fringes.",
        "You're seeing some experimentation with, for example, you know, Major League Baseball showing it on their website.",
        "But there isn't a mainstream solution for people who want to watch that football immediately as it's happening on the Web.",

        "What's - are you seeing a lot of them?",
        "It doesn't seem to have caught on terrifically, does it?",
        "Well, we're seeing a little bit of variation of 3D this year.",
        "One of the things that we're seeing, which I like, are the end to those expensive glasses that are two or three - $200 a pair and require batteries - and the use of just cheap polarized lenses, the ones you get in the theater.",
        "And I've seen a number of demos of that from Toshiba and others.",
        "And also Toshiba and LG are showing - I call them prototypes of TVs that don't require glasses.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Oh, okay.",
        "Because, you know, the other thing about tablets, Ira, is you know, last year the iPad wasn't even out.",

        "And the fact that Google TV isn't quite ready for primetime is a problem for a lot of folks here.",
        "Larry, you agree?",
        "I absolutely agree.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So you guys are saying go for the Roku and that would be the pick of our week this week for doing it on the cheap?",
        "I would agree, unless you have something in your house that works already, and doublecheck before you assume you don't, because there are a lot of things that do the job.",

        "And then, of course, you could also watch TV on your PC if you want to.",
        "Yeah.",
