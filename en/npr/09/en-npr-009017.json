        "We're trying to upset the balance.",

        "Here are the economics for the program.",
        "Where it's worked, families are usually given a supplement amounting to a third a quarter of their income.",
        "In Mexico, that could be a few hundred dollars.",
        "In New York, it means four to five thousand dollars a year for a single mother of two.",
        "The philosophy behind the program strikes at something deeper than a few thousand dollars, though.",
        "In this country, public opinion is almost exactly split on the question, what causes poverty.",
        "An equal number of people say it's the poor people's fault as say it's due to circumstances beyond their control.",
        "Maybe this is the kind of program that satisfies both points of view, says Dalton Conley, head of the Department of Sociology at New York University.",
        "Then upon reflection, Conley says, maybe it will just tick off everybody.",
        "The left, they don't like this kind of patronizing paternalism of the city, saying, well, you know, we're going to help you economically but we're going to tell you what to do and we're going to make you sort of, you know, dance and do dog tricks for it.",
        "And the right won't like it because it's more aid to the poor for doing what they should be doing anyway, what any family should be doing.",
        "Conley, who's all for the idea, doesn't actually think the poor will be asked to do dog tricks.",
        "They'll be forced to meet conditions for their cash.",
        "And at least in the beginning, tax payers won't be bankrolling the program.",
        "Foundations will donate funds to try it out with a few thousand people in a pilot program.",

        "From \"\"Monsters, Inc.\"\" to \"\"Shrek,\"\" many present-day monsters seem to be, well, tamed.",

        "Roger White, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, why do you think Sendak's wild things changed our perceptions of monsters?",
        "Well, I think it was one of the first times where monsters became less, you know, figures of terror and were suddenly very accessible, friendly, lovable creatures that you wanted to hang out with rather than a, you know, tormentor.",
        "Well, the monsters, they're not that lovable.",
        "I mean, you know, they've got big teeth and long claws and yellow eyes.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "No, it's true.",
        "One of the interesting things about Sendak's wild things is that they're a very strange mixture of, you know, the legitimately frightening, horrific.",
        "You know, they have all the sort of classical attributes of monsters, the scales and the claws and the fangs and the mismatched animal parts.",
        "But at the same time, there is something sort of endearing about them.",
        "And I think a lot of the reason for that is that Sendak, in fact, based the wild things on these caricatures of people that he knew, of his relatives, stuff.",
        "So that, you know, beneath the monstrousness, there's this sort of friendly, familiar core.",
        "Well, also that idea of mismatching body parts from different animals is throughout classical art.",
        "Number one, I've enjoyed all of the early Japanese genre.",
        "They - I think they did a super job.",
        "I always enjoyed the miniatures.",
        "But much like the tornadoes that we have in Oklahoma, you can see Godzilla coming.",

        "Now, human rights groups see this as the government surrendering to extremist views that repress women and mete out harsh punishments.",
        "And the United States is also wary, seeing this as a gambit for the Taliban to gain legitimacy."
