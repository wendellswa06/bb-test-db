        "I wonder if you can go into these divisions, and what is - what's behind them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "These divisions go way back.",

        "Sure, yes.",
        "I mean, he drew his support from an area of Baghdad - it's now called Sadr City.",

        "Now, one is true, the other is true, but both can't be true.",
        "And so, when Bremer moved against Sadr, moved towards arresting him, there was a massive explosion right across southern Iraq and Baghdad.",

        "He said that militiamen have 72 hours to hand over their weapons to the army.",

        "He's in Iran now.",

        "No, not really, but I think it is a great mistake and really a very damaging mistake to think that anything the Iraqi Shia do is as pawns of the Iranians.",
        "I mean they do it because it's in their own interest.",

        "It's - that's really not a problem.",
