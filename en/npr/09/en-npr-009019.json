        "And now, it's moved across the border into New Mexico.",

        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "PETER O'DOWD: Thanks for having me.",
        "And I wonder, how far from Phoenix do you have to go before you start to see evidence of this fire?",
        "O'DOWD: Well, it kind of depends how the winds are blowing.",
        "We had some reporters up about, I would say, 40 miles from the actual blaze, maybe closer to 30.",
        "When the winds were blowing out to the east, you know, you wouldn't really see that much of a problem.",
        "In New Mexico, though, that's a different story.",
        "The wind is really just - the smoke is really hanging over New Mexico.",
        "And if you're on the eastern flank of that fire, you'll definitely smell it.",
        "And that's - it is in New Mexico now though, as I understand.",
        "I heard a report you did earlier today, as I understand, that fire was deliberately set.",
        "O'DOWD: Yes, though I think this is an important point to make.",
        "This is fire has gone into New Mexico but fire officials are very clear to say that these were efforts that they did on purpose in order to stop the main wall of the fire from crossing the state line and threatening a town called Luna.",
        "It's about five miles from the state line.",
        "Each one of them will try to pull you in another direction.",
        "So the hawk will tell you definitely send the army because it will raise your security.",
        "But the dove will tell you that the presence of troops will actually hurt the Palestinian quality of life."
