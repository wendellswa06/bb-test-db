        "Yeah, definitely.",

        "I mean, they're just beautiful illustrations.",
        "You know, when you think about it, I mean, there's very few words in the book, in fact.",
        "It's all pictorial.",
        "You know, the books - there are these lovely watercolor washes over which, you know, Sendak has gone with a pen and ink and really gotten into these rendering the, you know, the physicality of these monsters, you know, this, like, very maniacal cross-hatching that he does.",
        "And the what really comes out is just the, you know, the texture of them.",
        "They're very furry.",
        "You know, it's like a central aspect of the wild things is that they're these, like, hairy creatures, and the way that he draws them really brings that out.",
        "And once again, everything is just - it's - on the one hand, they're very flat.",
        "The pictures, they're like these - it could be a frieze on the side of a, you know, like on a bas-relief sculpture.",
        "At the same time, you know, there's this incredible depths to them, this richness of the color."

        "Do you see echoes of monster paintings from the Middle Ages?",
        "Definitely, yeah.",
        "I mean, if you look at something like Hieronymus Bosch, who was a Netherlandish painter working at the beginning of the Renaissance, you know, he made these enormous canvases filled with tiny little figures of like demons and monsters that are, you know, tormenting sinners.",
        "And, you know, a lot of them - you know, there's a very similar thing going with hybridization.",
        "There'll be like a rabbit with a, you know, like a human body, or a giant mouse or a fish with wings, you know?",
        "It's the same sort of, you know, putting different things together into strange combinations.",
        "But those are very much about frightening you to death, you know, keeping you sort of on the path of good behavior, whereas Sendak is obviously about something different.",

        "And there was a certain tragedy there, especially at the end.",
        "He's all powerful and he's unstoppable, and he just runs the gauntlet.",
        "And then a simple little device strips him of his bones and his immortality, if you will; I think that entered into it, too.",
        "But the one thing that always stood out in my mind about Godzilla, and this is the funny part of it, was they found a trilobite.",
        "You know, a little invertebrate worm, basically, from the Cretaceous period.",
        "And that always caught my interest, that little trilobite they found, and - which forced me to go into the geologic field.",
        "As I got older, I studied geology down at OU back in the '60s for that reason, and you can really blame Godzilla for it.",

        "And do you think that's kind of - was brought in or affected, especially in the Halloween time of year with monsters and all this?",

        "Are you going to go see the movie?",

        "And then, of course, he meets these creatures of his imagination who are, you know, like actual monsters.",

        "And it was magical.",
