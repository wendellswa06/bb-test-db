        "Walter Fields, in what already seemed to be a ridiculous climb in oil prices, this is going to further devastate not only the country, but we should note the poor are being hit hardest by all of this.",
        "Without a doubt, and that's one of the concerns I had when the initial reports came back, because the first reports were that New Orleans was fine, and that's because they were focusing on the French Quarter when, in fact, most of the city was under the water and most of the areas where African-Americans live were devastated.",
        "I think you're absolutely right.",
        "The poor are going to be hit disproportionately.",
        "We're going to feel it in our pockets, for those of us who live outside of the state, because, unbeknownst to a lot of Americans, you know, oil refineries--you know, they're down in Louisiana.",
