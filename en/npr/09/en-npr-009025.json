        "Yeah, China does have serious environmental problems, but those are China's problems and they're not our problems.",
        "And unfortunately, that's where most stuff is made - not just cheap stuff, but high-quality stuff.",
        "Cole Haan shoes, for example, are made in China now, because the Chinese actually do have the capability of making good products.",
        "So it's not a question of everything from China being cheap, but it certainly is less expensive because their labor costs are less.",
        "People in America just won't work for the kind of wages they pay in China that make goods affordable here.",
        "They also provide jobs for Chinese people who 30 years ago, were living on dirt-poor, collective farms.",
        "Many of them, 30 days ago living on…",
