        "I'm satisfied that the president has the authority he needs to go ahead and I say that as one very protective of congressional prerogatives.",

        "In the Senate it gets more complicated.",
        "Perhaps, President Obama's staunchest defender there on Libya is the Republican he beat two and a half years ago, Arizona's John McCain.",
        "This week on the Senate floor, McCain took House Republicans to task for prompting a letter of thanks from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi after they passed a resolution this month chiding President Obama on Libya.",
        "Republicans need to ask themselves whether they want to be part of a group who are earning the grateful thanks of a murderous tyrant for trying to limit an American president's ability to force that tyrant to leave power.",
        "McCain has teamed up with John Kerry, the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, to draft a resolution expressing the Senate's support for the Libyan intervention.",
        "Kerry said their motive in doing so is not the War Powers Resolution.",
        "I don't believe it applies, but I think it's good for us to be on record as being supportive.",
        "The top Republican on the Foreign Relations panel disagrees.",
        "Indiana's Richard Luger says President Obama will be in violation of the War Powers Act starting next week, and Congress must act.",
        "If the administration wanted to declare a war on Libya, we should have asked a declaration of war and have that debate.",
        "Libya also divides Senate Democrats.",
        "Illinois's Dick Durbin is that chamber's number two Democrat and one of President Obama's closest allies on Capitol Hill.",
        "But he disagrees with the president's characterization of the U.S.",
        "role in Libya.",
        "We went beyond supplying technology to supplying support for refueling, intelligence and the like.",
        "America is engaged in this conflict."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "The United States is paying far too much, and other countries are not paying enough.",

        "It was no surprise that he entered this summit today with a goal of making our allies nervous.",
        "This is something that he's done many times in the past.",
        "And he did that in a number of ways.",
        "He said that Germany is totally controlled by Russia.",
        "He excoriated our allies, specifically Germany, for not spending enough on defense.",
        "And then it's been reported that he said maybe we should even up the defense spending target of 4 percent of GDP instead of 2 percent, which is really interesting because that's not even what the United States spends."

        "It was reaffirmed back in the Wales summit in 2014.",
        "But it's tough because it's sort of an arbitrary number given that it doesn't adequately represent the impact or the contributions that NATO allies actually make to the alliance's mission of collective defense.",

        "They're not trying to convince the president or the United States that they're upping their defense spending, but they're trying to show that they are making an impact.",
        "For example, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, today said that the Canadians would lead a new training mission in Iraq that NATO is hosting for this - that they decided on this upcoming summit.",
        "So you can see that they're shifting away from, you know, trying to prove that they're spending to proving that they are actually making an impact, which is I think more important.",
        "As you mentioned, President Trump singled out Germany this morning, accusing it of being too beholden to Russia because of an energy deal between the two countries.",
        "I know Germany is pushing back on that, and we'll hear more about that later in the program.",
        "But let me just ask you.",
        "How much does Russia figure into the thinking and conversations now among the alliance members?"

        "Their online subscription model lets readers access 20 articles a month and then you have to pay a fee to see more.",
        "The pay wall was seen as a risky move at the time, but the Gray Lady's third-quarter profits are in, and the results are better than expected.",

        "And, David, you know, the website, Business Insider, ran some numbers and found that before the pay wall, a New York Times print reader was worth 228 times as much as an online reader.",
        "And so no matter how much money they're making with this porous pay wall, can it really close that gap between the worth of the print and the online reader?",
        "Well, I think it's worth doing a couple of things and thinking about that.",
        "First off, it's worth remembering the prevailing wisdom has been that information on the Web wants to be free, and you can't charge people for news as a commodity online; that only specialized financial information and reporting and sports coverage for the most passionate football or baseball fans really induce people to open their wallets and pay for it.",

        "He's also the head of a group called Press Plus, that's helping news organizations around the country put up their own pay walls.",
        "Here's how he explained what the challenge was for news organizations and why it was important to charge people online.",
        "Ad revenues are, over time, I'm confident, will continue to decline and will not support quality journalism.",
        "There'd have to be other revenue streams.",
        "And the most typical one has always been letting the most loyal, avid readers help cover the expense.",
        "We probably studied for, you know, 10, 15 hours.",
