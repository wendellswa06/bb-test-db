        "In the past, the business community has often been an obstacle to action on climate change and seen more as an enemy than a partner.",
        "Peter Bakker of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development says that was clear at the first big United Nations conference that addressed climate change in Rio back in 1992.",
        "He says there were about 5,500 delegates there.",
        "Only a handful - to be precise, 13 people - were representing the business sector in that first meeting.",
        "And most other delegates thought that business was the cause of all evil.",
        "But more than 1,000 business representatives will be in Paris and most will be supportive of climate action, says Edward Cameron, who represents a coalition called We Mean Business.",
        "There are always going to be pockets of agreements and pocket of disagreement.",
        "But what I think we see going into Paris is a far greater level of support from the business community writ large and far more willingness to speak out publicly about this.",
        "One gauge of business support for curbing carbon emissions is that more than 150 big U.S.",
        "companies have signed a White House pledge to reduce their carbon footprints.",
        "The list includes General Motors, GE and Wal-Mart.",
        "What's changed, says Peter Bakker, is that businesses now see that the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of acting to curb climate change.",
        "That's the case at General Mills, a big food company whose products include Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Yoplait yogurt.",
        "Ken Powell is the CEO.",
        "For us, it's not theoretical.",
        "We depend on natural systems, and we depend on healthy environment for the crops and the ingredients that we use.",
        "For that reason, businesses in the agriculture and food sector are among those most interested in curbing carbon emissions.",
        "General Mills started by reducing energy use in its facilities.",
        "We've eliminated about $250 million of energy costs over the last 10 years.",
        "And so for people who worry that companies are misspending resources, you know, to address this issue, our experience has not been that.",
        "Our experience is that it's been very positive from a business standpoint.",
        "That's a big theme at the Paris conference - the idea that addressing climate change is good for business.",
        "It's an idea that's gotten Wall Street's attention too.",
        "And big banks and investment firms are beginning to change their approach to investing.",
        "They're looking out over the horizon, and what they see is a low carbon future, so they're limiting investments in carbon intensive businesses and putting more money into companies that will thrive in a low carbon environment.",
        "Val Smith, an executive at Citigroup, says while her bank wants to be seen as a good global citizen, this is really about good business.",
        "It is very much about looking at the business opportunity and profits that can be made in the environmental-finance and climate-finance space."

        "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates echoed that thought yesterday in Paris.",

        "They all act as a vanguard of venture capitalists moving new clean energy technologies from government research labs to the market.",
        "Of course, there are major business sectors that are lagging.",
        "Oil and gas companies must come to terms with potentially leaving billions of dollars' worth of their assets in the ground.",
        "Auto companies, built around the internal combustion engine, remain conflicted - witness Volkswagen's emissions cheating scandal.",
        "And if the price of oil remains low for a long period, investments in renewables will look less attractive.",
        "But Ed Cameron of We Mean Business is cautiously optimistic.",
        "Business and government need to work as partners in this process.",
        "Previously, they haven't.",
        "I think they now are and I think that's one of the reasons why we're likely to see greater success coming out of Paris.",
        "Cameron says what businesses want from this meeting are clear goals for curbing carbon emissions.",
        "Many also want a price on carbon in the form of taxes or other measures that reflects its threat to the planet.",

        "The embryonic stem cell bill co-sponsored by Democrat Diana DeGette and Republican Mike Castle now moves to the Senate.",
        "Supporters believe they have enough votes to send the measure to President Bush's desk, despite his threatened veto.",
        "For a closer look at the bill, and its political future, we're now joined by Congressman Castle of Delaware.",
        "Congressman, thanks for joining us.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Why did you believe this bill's so important to break ranks with Republicans and vote for it?",
        "It's a very basic question of 110 million people--about one out of three in the United States of America--who suffer from a debilitating disease, perhaps, diabetes or juvenile diabetes, all the way through cancer, heart and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, whatever.",
        "Stem cell research, in general, and I'm for all medical research, has shown great promise, but the greatest promise is in embryonic stem cell research because these are stem cells that have not yet differentiated into the--one of the 200 stem cells in your body, and could be directed to do so, and, in that way, potentially, could help relieve a lot of problems, unlike the adult stem cells, which can only address the blood-borne diseases.",
        "So the potential is tremendous to help so many people whose lives are foreshortened or the quality of life is unfortunately badly impacted."

        "That being said, Congressman, I'm wondering if you struggled with the idea, as some suggest, that these embryos, in their minds, are simply unborn children?",
        "Did you have to wrestle with that moral question?",
        "No.",
        "I did not have to wrestle with that moral question, although that's a legitimate moral, even biological, question, and I understand that.",
        "But the reason it's a little bit simpler than wrestling with it is that, in the in vitro fertilization process, they create more fertilized eggs than are needed, simply because it often doesn't work, and they don't have to re-do the process, and they keep them in a frozen state, and then as people either have children, or for whatever reason decide not to go forward, they, basically, take the embryos out of that frozen state and discard them as hospital waste.",
        "So you're, basically, talking about using those, and they're going to be discarded as hospital waste, so no matter what word you want to use, destruction, killing, you can describe it however you want, it's gonna happen anyhow, as opposed to be able to be--to use them for research with the sign-off, obviously, of everybody involved in the process, including the creators of the embryo, and, if that's the case, if that's the equation that we're dealing with, it's pretty simple.",
        "We want to help everybody in the world, particularly, Americans, with this research, and I think it should go forward.",
        "Congressman, are you disappointed that you're hearing from the White House that the president says if this measure passes he will indeed veto it?",
        "Of course, we prefer that not to be the case, and we overcame huge opposition from the White House, all the leadership in the House of Representatives on the Republican side, yesterday, to get this bill passed, which shows something about the receptivity of it across the United States of America.",
        "And that's true in the Senate, as well.",
        "That war will start today.",
        "And I would hope that the White House would back off from that.",
        "Having said that, I don't think that's likely to happen.",
        "So, perhaps, there's some middle ground that we can reach or strike.",
        "I want the research to go forward.",
        "Whether our legislation actually ever becomes law is not as relevant as some policy change to allow the research to move forward so that's what my ultimate goal is so I understand where they are.",
        "But, you know, we are going to continue to persist in this and so, hopefully, when it's all said and done, that we can work out something that everybody can agree is satisfactory so that we can advance the research.",
        "It's a temporal thing.",
        "This is gonna happen.",
        "It's gonna happen someplace in the world, perhaps, California; perhaps, Indonesia; or whatever.",
        "But we want it to happen sooner rather than later so the suffering can cease as soon as possible.",
        "Mike Castle is a Republican congressman from Delaware.",

        "I'm sure you heard the congressman there, and know all of the arguments.",
        "You see this slightly differently.",
        "You do see this as a bigger moral question than the congressman.",
        "There is an interesting question here.",
        "We're debating not just science but also the ethics, and, biologically, yes, the human embryos are the earliest stages of human development.",
        "The science, though, has been interesting.",
        "We keep hearing about the hope and promise of embryonic stem cell research but the published science so far does not back that up, and that's after over 20 years of research with the mouse embryonic.",
        "By contrast, the adult stem cells, the umbilical cord stem cells, have treated far more than just these blood type diseases, as was mentioned.",
        "They've been treating brain type of disorders, including Parkinson's, spinal cord injury, heart damage, and, you know, if we really cared about the patients, the adult stem cell, the cord blood stem cell are the ones that are already starting to treat patients now for these disorders, and we'd be putting our money, our taxpayer funding behind that."

        "The cells still in the animals tend to have problems forming tumors, getting transplant rejection, being able to actually get the cells that they want.",
        "The cells are just very difficult to control, whereas the adult stem cells--hundreds of published papers--a paper just last week in New England Journal of Medicine where they treated young children for a disease called Krabbe syndrome, which is a neurological disorder, not just a blood disorder.",

        "It's more a matter of being able to make the cells do anything.",
        "I do think in the end the ultimate answer where we go one way or the other will probably depend on the results in terms of the scientific publication.",

        "Well, I think in one sense we are seeing the politics.",
