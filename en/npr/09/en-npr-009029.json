        "When people need real help and fighting for their lives, people are taking advantage, exploiting that.",

        "I mean, this is no excuse for any of that, because I agree with what has been said, but the lack of communication--even the resource people cannot communicate with each other.",
        "So I witnessed an interview with a young man not long ago, and he was saying, `Well, the mayor should be doing this and that.",
        "Well, those of us who have communication understand that the mayor is doing this and that, but it's not word that gets to the people.",
        "So there you are.",
        "You're already desperately poor.",
        "You don't know what's going on.",
        "It seems to be, you know, going on and on forever, and there's no word that you can count on, and you respond--I think some part of those people responded out of desperation, but I make no excuse.",
        "I'm personally mortified.",
        "I mean, you know, I'm from the credit-to-your-race generation, so this is horrific for me to look at.",
        "But there are some underpinning things going on here that make it, I think, for those people who would not normally respond in this way, to respond in this way.",
        "The other issue, too, is what do you do with poor people?",
        "You know, when those highways were filled with cars leaving, nobody really made provision for people in the hospitals and for the people who don't have transportation but who rely on public transportation.",
        "They're like, `Oh, let's herd them all to the Superdome,' and then you find out that that's a problem as well.",
        "In the future--and I hope we learn from this--there has to be provision, maybe buses, trains, whatever--but provision for people who do not have private transportation to get out of these areas.",
        "I think...",
        "I couldn't agree with you more.",
        "I mean, they were...",
        "Yes.",

        "And we should salute Mayor Ray Nagin, who has in the midst of all of this, in every interview that I've seen, remained calm, forthright, truthful in the circumstance and situation that his city finds himself in, and has conducted himself in a way that many people should salute, I think.",
        "Well, I would underscore that.",
        "I was about to say that I also give him credit for saying--first suggesting strongly, `Leave,' and then saying, `You must leave.",
        "So we're talking about a large part of the population that couldn't leave, but he did get out most of the other people in town, so that has--cannot be discounted.",
        "That was very important.",
        "And I think...",
        "I'm not discounting that, Callie.",
        "I'm not discounting it, but I don't care whether Ed calls it Monday morning quarterback or Wednesday morning quarterback; you have to have some plans and it cannot be ignored because you have emergency plans, anyway.",

        "You are only as good as your advisers, and I think, as Walter mentioned--I think most folks--and I'm talking about experts included--thought that, because the eye of the storm did not hit New Orleans directly, as they had predicted, many people could not anticipate some of the things that have gone on.",

        "But, see, that's the problem.",

        "That's right.",

        "Yeah.",
        "...to a headline that becomes even more prevalent because of what we've just been talking about, and that's that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has suggested that his government wants to sell as much as 66,000 barrels a day of heating fuel to the United States through Citgo, but they want to sell it to the poor communities in the United States.",
        "This offer was made after talking to Jesse Jackson, who went down to talk to President Chavez and also talked, obviously, about the comments that we reported last week of the assassination called for by Pat Robertson.",
        "That being said, the plans of the sale of this fuel have not been worked out, and one has to believe it would not be an easy thing to do, but is this something that the Bush administration cannot now afford to scoff at and balk at, if you believe that they would have done so prior to the devastation that we've seen?"

        "But I don't that, as a policy standpoint, the Bush administration would say you can give--sell gasoline and then determine where it's going to be distributed to.",
        "I mean, once you get into that, you kind of open all kinds of doors.",
        "The idea is good, but I think it'd be problematic even carrying it out.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I couldn't agree more.",
        "And what's more, I think that if, for some reason, even in moments of desperation, they said, `OK, well, let's just get it in here and we'll figure it out,' somehow or another, it would be distributed elsewhere by the time--it would never reach its intended targets.",
        "If there were even the most minor agreement around it, I don't believe this would ever happen.",
        "But, Walter, it does put the president in a precarious position, because today he announced that he is going to, in fact, tap the US petroleum reserve to let out fuel that sits in reserve for situations like this.",
        "But if we see, as we're suggesting earlier, these kinds of events causing a rise in heating oil costs for the United States and, in particular, as we have already suggested, disproportionately affecting the poor, what must he say to those who won't really care where this fuel is coming from?",
        "Oh, no, I believe that.",
        "I believe that.",
        "You talk about the Oprah brand.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, you know, I think it's a brilliant political stroke by Chavez.",
        "I mean, given the fact that he just underwent this attack by Pat Robertson, what do you do?",
        "You come back and you show how benevolent you can be as a leader.",
        "And I think one issue that the Bush administration will not be able to sweep away is the Gulf Coast.",
        "I mean, if Chavez says, `Look, OK, you don't want me to distribute to poor communities, but you have a real need right now in a certain part of your country; I'll send it there,' it'll be tough for this president to say no. And so I think, you know, this was a brilliant political stroke on his part.",
        "I agree with George, as a long-term policy, you know, the White House isn't going to allow someone to dictate where energy is delivered in the United States.",
        "But under the current circumstances we're seeing unfold in the Gulf Coast, I could see Chavez saying, `Well, fine.",
        "Let's send it to your area that's been hit hard by this storm.",
        "I want to help.",
        "How do you refuse that help?",
        "Well, I think whatever happens, he's going to end up being a player in the conversation, which makes this a very interesting political dynamic, given that, Pat Robertson aside, there are people that really don't like this man, who are great supporters of this administration.",
        "So now you've got an administration that can't really afford, as you said, Walter, to look away from an opportunity to bring energy resources in, but at the same time doesn't want to be sitting at the table with a guy who'll get a chance to dictate some terms.",
        "Now we know that the heating fuel will be needed but, George, you raised an interesting point, in jest to some degree, but I know that you meant it in one way, and that's the red herring that Jesse Jackson remains, often, to administrations, whether they be Republican and Democrat, when he steps on the international stage."
