        "Certainly, you know, I've said this before; I mean, I don't think he should appear every time there's an international crisis, whether it's in Mexico or going down to Venezuela.",
        "But he does have international influence, and you see--I think it's a direct result--this proposal's a direct result of Jesse Jackson meeting with them--certainly that.",
        "But still, I go back to the point it's like, you know, Jesse's kind of the ambassador at large, but when the Bush administration look at this in terms of policy--or any other president, I think--they're simply saying, `Look, even though you supply 15 percent of our energy imports, we can't have you telling us how it's going to be distributed.",
        "I just don't see them ever going for that.",
        "Problematic, Walter Fields, in the sense that Jesse can go down, have the photo op, have this brought up, but, as you laid out, doesn't have to administer the plan after the fact.",
        "Well, you know, it is problematic, and it's also interesting that because we have a major corporation that would have to be the intermediary in this--I mean, you know, there's a whole 'nother realm of politics in this country.",
        "So I think it is problematic, and I think it's always problematic for a sitting administration when you have a private citizen who is recognized worldwide by leaders, who gets into these sort of negotiations that aren't officially sanctioned by the United States government.",
        "What do you do with a person like that?",
        "You can't easily dismiss them, because they do carry a degree of credibility out there in the international community.",

        "...any president in an awkward position.",

        "Well, I would say it's even worse than that because this is somebody he doesn't respect, and also most of the people who support him don't respect, so it makes it doubly a problem for him--Bush, I mean.",

        "I said that.",

        "You know, we are so like-minded, Ed, really from the very beginning in terms of how we think, what we like, what we dislike, our life philosophies, how we see people, and I think when I met her, it was the first time in a long time that I thought, God, I met somebody who feels the way I do.",
