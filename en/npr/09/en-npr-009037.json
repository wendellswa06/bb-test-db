        "So in immigration news, we saw news this week that the Trump administration was implementing a new rule that would make it harder for migrants to seek asylum in the U.S.",
        "There's a ton of reporting on that.",
        "Right.",
        "What did Mark Morgan tell you?",
        "Well, this was a really big deal, Noel.",
        "The rule would've empowered - it - well, it has empowered U.S.",
        "officials effectively to deny most asylum-seekers if they don't first apply for protection in the country they pass through on their way to the U.S.",
        "And it was announced with great fanfare earlier this week as a major change in asylum law.",
        "But Mark Morgan told me at present, it's actually just a small pilot project - very limited.",
        "And they're testing it in just two stations down in south Texas.",
        "If it works out, they'd like to expand it all along the whole southwest border.",
        "But lawsuits have already been filed to block it.",
        "And Morgan said they expect a federal judge to issue an injunction any day now, which would leave them dead in the water for now.",
        "Interesting.",
        "He's even - he's expecting that.",
        "All right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So let me ask you about this private Facebook group for Border Patrol agents, current and retired, that Steve mentioned; first reported on by ProPublica, members allegedly posting really, really offensive things about migrants, about lawmakers.",
        "It was not a good look for CBP.",
        "What did he tell you about that?",
        "Well, we know that CBP Internal Affairs is investigating at least 62 current Border Patrol agents who were members of this group.",
        "The commissioner seemed to be waiting for my question."

        "Some of the images that were out there - absolutely horrendous, wrong and not consistent with the way that the CBP, or specifically Border Patrol, conducts themselves.",
        "He also said they're actually looking at criminal charges to show how serious they were, possibly, against some of the agents.",
        "I asked him for specifics, but he said he couldn't talk about an ongoing investigation.",
        "He said several agents have already been suspended from the force, and there could be more.",

        "Yes, sir.",
        "The CBP has also been under fire for these terrible conditions in holding cells for both adults and children.",
        "There have been two government inspector general reports about this - nonpartisan reports, that we should say.",
        "What did he say about those reports?",
        "Well, he acknowledged the agency cannot handle the crush of migrants, but he claimed they've always gotten the basic necessities.",
        "You know, Noel, immigrant advocates say that if you look at the totality of the policies of the Trump administration, such as detaining migrants in these dreadful cells, family separation at the border, making asylum-seekers wait in Mexico, the conclusion they draw is that the Trump administration wants to punish migrants and make them miserable so they'll stop coming in the first place.",
        "That's just absolutely not true.",
        "What we are trying to do is enforce the rule of law, maintain integrity in the system and do the best we can to address this unprecedented crisis.",
        "Mark Morgan told me the numbers of migrants they're taking into custody at the border continues to drop - 2,500 a day, that's down from about 4,600 a day in May.",
        "He credits Mexico for enforcing its southern and northern borders.",
        "So he thinks what's being done to stop the migrants is finally starting to pay off.",
        "Interesting.",
