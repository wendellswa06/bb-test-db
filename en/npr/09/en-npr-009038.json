        "Yes.",
        "And recently, those prices went up because there's a financial bubble; because investors trying to protect their assets from what's happening to the U.S.",
        "dollar and other currencies are taking refuge in oil and gold and nickel and…",
        "Other commodities.",
        "…all sorts of commodities.",
        "But before that happened, there was a structure change.",
        "By that, I mean a situation where in recent years, millions of people started eating three times a day, which is in many countries an unprecedented reality.",
        "And that may be a metaphor, which is actually a reality, but it's also true that we are witnessing the emergence of a large middle class in countries - in China and India, as you mentioned, but also in places like Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, and around the world.",
        "Yet for many, many years, that was seen as an unalloyed good.",
        "This was not merely good, this would be miraculous.",
        "And it is good.",
        "I think the world is a better place where people can eat three times a day.",
        "What - again, what that means is that it will require some adjustments.",
        "And, again, remember that we have a Malthusian alert that has gone on for centuries.",
        "You know, Malthus, centuries ago, alerted that the population would be growing faster than our capacity to produce food and that will create, eventually, a collapse of civil society and civilization as we know it.",
        "And…",
        "And Malthus, though, miscalculated.",
        "The population has grown many times beyond what he calculated would bring utter and complete collapse, and growth continues.",
        "And Malthus, like Marx and others, got it wrong because he underestimated technology, and he underestimated the price system.",
        "So prices are a very powerful mechanism to adjust supply and demand.",
        "But very far more important is technology.",
        "The green revolution transformed agriculture and created opportunities for millions of people to have access to rice and to other grains that made it affordable and accessible to everyone else.",
        "And now, we are - I think we are also going to move into circumstances where there will be huge opportunities for technology to solve problems.",
        "But if prices of important commodities - energy, food, things like that - if they're going up, why is not, you know, a first-world country like the United States, in a far better position, wouldn't that seemingly trap those millions in China and India below the middle class, because they're going to have to spend more for their cars and their refrigerators too, and their food?",
        "But they are also producers.",
        "And, again, what we are witnessing now with globalization is that what you have is a huge global pool of resources.",
        "And, yes, prices are going up, and yes, the poor are now, in some countries, suffering the consequences of steep increases in prices.",
        "And that's what I say, and I said in the article in foreign policy magazine, that that's - it's, yes, the world can afford a middle class, but it's going to be very expensive.",
        "And in the process of going from here to there, there is going to be painful and there's going to be important dislocations."

        "What bothers me is that nobody wants - nobody has got the guts, or they won't discuss this, particularly in this country, the - about the high birthrate, particularly Hispanics.",
        "And how in the world are we going to be able to overcome that?",
        "That's what I don't - I can't understand, because I talk with people, and I talked with a lot of Hispanics.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "You're on the air.",

        "And here, probably, once there is a wider agreement that something will have to be done aggressively to deal with environment, it will be inevitable that energy prices will have to be priced in a way that capture some of the revenues and be - and use those revenues to deal with the consequences of climate change.",
