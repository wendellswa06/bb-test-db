        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "Listening earlier, your speaker mentioned that the wealthier nations or the middle class are going to have to make some adjustments in their consumption patterns.",
        "I wonder what he believe was the most significant alteration in consumption patterns for the majority of wealthy nations.",
        "Well, as I said, energy is going, the way we consume energy.",
        "And that has a lot to do with both the way we move ourselves, both in cars and airplanes, but also in the way we consume certain items that are very energy-intensive.",
        "Recycling will become far more important.",
        "And the whole infrastructure of the country will have to be rethought.",
        "Do you think that there is a specific area that is going to be hardest for us to change?",
        "There is no doubt that every single one of the things I mentioned is going to be very hard.",
        "I am not naive in terms of how hard politically and how difficult this is going to be.",
        "But, again, reality will eventually prevail.",
        "Thank you very much.",

        "As you look ahead towards this, as prices, markets - as all of these things cost more.",
        "But again, the cost to the environment - if the price of gasoline, the price of carbon fuels goes up, certainly the price of coal is going through the roof, too, and we're shipping an awful lot of coal now to China and to India and places like that.",
        "Cars, you know, all these cars in - people talking about the incredible environmental damage that may result from people rising up into the middle class.",
        "And that is going to be a very important debate in years to come, the debate of who bears the burdens of dealing with the consequences of energy consumption and climate - and dealing with climate change.",
        "The argument from - coming from India and China is, well, you had your turn, United States and others, to develop by using very cheap energy…",
        "And dirty energy.",
        "…and contaminating the environment.",
        "So, now is our turn.",
        "And so, who will bear the burdens of dealing with environmental change and climate change is going to be one of the most difficult, thorny conflicts we're going to have in years ahead.",

        "Hi, there.",

        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "You know, the more that I kind of live in American society, the more aware I become of our tendency towards conspicuous consumerism, if you will.",
        "You know, obesity and waste and trash just a wanton-living style that just is really mind blowing, if you sit back objectively and look at it.",
        "We really do kind of exist mindlessly, unaware of what we're doing to the environment.",
        "I agree enthusiastically with this, you know, with your - the viewpoints of your guest, but how do we change some of the cultural overhaul, you know, mass attitude change in American society and Western civilization that is really consumed with, you know, not just consumerism but trivia, you know?"

        "Thank you.",
        "Okay, Joanne.",
        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "There is a very powerful culture that is ingrained that we'll have to change.",
        "And again, it's not going to be changed by appeals to change.",
        "It's going to be a change because it's going to be very expensive to sustain.",
        "There's no other choice.",
        "So when you go to a fast food restaurants, and the portions that are huge - and very often, in a large majority of circumstances, an important part of the portion goes uneaten and becomes waste.",
        "Well, if that starts costing you far more, you are going to be more careful about the size of the portions that both you're going to order and that restaurants are going to offer - same with cars, same with a house - the sizes of houses - and so on.",
        "So, there is a tendency to oversize things that is going to be taken care of by prices.",
        "And we mentioned earlier misguided former predictors, Marx and Malthus - can you envision a technological change that might stave this off or even reverse it?",
        "I have no doubt that as the prices of these things become more expensive, there will be strong incentives for entrepreneurs and engineers or the scientists to come up.",
        "You know, there must be someone now thinking about ways of providing energy that is far less expensive.",

        "A strange visitor from another planet, Howard landed in Cleveland, back in the 1970s, where despite a noticeable lack of bravery or any super power beyond the ability to speak English, Howard save the world from Bessie the Hellcow and Phelch the Space Turnip among many others.",

        "What was so special about Steve Gerber, do you think?",
        "His way of looking at the world, which was unlike anybody else.",
        "I mean, you had a remarkable group of writers working at Marvel and DC back then, Marvel - Len Wein, Danny O'Neill, Gerry Conway.",
        "And Steve was the sort of the dark side of the creative force, not in the sense that that it was - it as nicely wicked, but it was such a weird way of looking at the world, of looking at characters, of expressing himself that you couldn't help but be drawn in.",
        "And Howard's a perfect example."

        "He says that having a historical record is super useful.",
        "Glaciers, they can respond to climate over time scales that are fairly long.",
        "And so the fact that we can look back further in time several decades ago really helps us pin down how they are responding to the climate.",
        "They compared the spy satellite data with images taken in the last 20 years, and they found that the glaciers in the Himalayas have been losing 20 inches of ice a year.",
        "That means they're melting twice as fast now as they were in the '80s and '90s.",
        "The Himalayas' glaciers supply fresh water for billions of people in South Asia.",
        "More than half of those glaciers are projected to melt in the next 80 years because of climate change.",

        "It's a treasure trove for scientists.",
        "Essentially, what we're doing is capturing the changes in the terrain.",
        "So you could do this for landslides, you could do it for volcanic eruptions.",
        "We focused on glaciers, but these images are useful for any sort of land surface changes that people might be interested in over time."
