        "And we use the extension service to help us determine what kinds of things we can use to keep the crop healthy, not just pesticides, but how to check the crops and to make sure that they're healthy.",
        "They use independent research all the time to help us with this.",
        "And with the public funds just dwindling, we have a lot less independent research that go on and have to go on more of what the chemical companies are telling us.",
        "Well, can you give us one example of a plant or a crop that was kept alive with the help of the extension service?",
        "Well, I'm looking at a cotton crop right now, and the farmer advisers, the cotton farmer advisors in California, helped us what the program called plant mapping, where we were able to take a look at what's going on with the plant even though we might have bugs out that could be damaging the crops.",
        "We (unintelligible) are going to turn into (unintelligible) and determine, now, do we really need to spray or not...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and how the plant's growing.",
        "It's a very - it's a very good program.",
        "I'm a bit of a gardener myself, Sandy Rikoon, and the ability to tell which bug is going to actually destroy your garden and which ones, well, they're benevolent, is - as far as I'm concerned, they all look mean.",
        "So it one of the perks of the job.",
        "So if I have a beetle or something in my garden, I just find a little container.",
        "I put the beetle in the container.",
        "I take it over to the university, over to extension, and they'll tell me what it is and how to get rid of it.",
        "And not just necessarily how to get rid of it with pesticides or insecticides, but what other types of natural or sustainable kinds of controls we could use.",
        "So extension is really the envy of other countries.",
        "I could say one thing in terms of international work.",
        "Many countries are trying to duplicate the extension system.",
        "Many countries have research, agricultural research, but what they don't have is that group of people who take the research and then take it to the people."

        "You know, in Missouri, if you went to Missouri 20 years ago or 25 years ago, every county had an extension office and there were multiple extension people, probably in every office.",
        "Well, the state appropriation has not risen with the level of population, the local contributions have gone down, and so you're finding we're consolidating offices into regional offices.",
        "One extension person may cover seven counties or may cover two or three different areas.",
        "One thing that I should notice is we often focus on extension, and they're primary, but there are other parts of the USDA that have people who do extension-type activities.",
        "So let me just mention one of my favorites, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, OK?",
        "And they deal with farmers on soil conservation and water quality and things like that.",
        "They have technicians and they have other folks who also go out to the farms and help farmers.",
        "So extension works in cooperation, I think, with some of these other organizations.",

        "Well, at least I can get information on what crops are grown and the university is basically in wheat and some of these other small grains that the big companies have quit doing any research on.",
        "Well, at least we've got varieties that are going to be useful and have weed resistance or chemical resistance (unintelligible) and so on.",
