        "It was looking for - they were looking for new meaning.",
        "They weren't interested particularly in uncovering the original intention of the author, but to find meaning the way God would speak directly to them from that, you know, in their own time, answering the burning questions of the hour.",
        "And that the - it was thought that unless the Bible could yield a new meaning, it was a dead letter.",
        "And the rabbis were - went very inventive and creative in their interpretation of the Bible at that very difficult period after the temple had been destroyed the second time, and this time it was never going to be rebuilt.",
        "And they - the rabbis entirely, in a wonderful burst of creativity, produced a new Judaism based on the text and created new scriptures, the Mishnah and the Talmud.",

        "Thank you.",
        "…and I just wanted to follow up on the comments about how the obscurity of the language of the Bible has been used for political purposes over time and the lack of a vernacular, you know, version of different books like the Bible or the book of Mormon has been used that way.",
        "Oh, well, I don't - I'm not sure that it was simply a matter of - simply of translation difficulties.",
        "But people have used the Bible, people have used Scripture generally especially in our modern period for their own purposes.",
        "But the Bible has so many messages, so many authors that it's very difficult to tie it down to a single meaning.",
        "But there are some people, some Christian fundamentalists for example, tend to pick out on the more belligerent, more war-like aspects of the Scriptures.",
        "They dwell heavily on the Book of Revelation, with its great stories of nth-time scenarios, and they don't mention so much Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, where he tells people to turn the other cheek not to retaliate."

        "Religion, like any other activity, can be used for good or ill, and there are unscrupulous people that will use the sacred text to back up their own nefarious policies and prejudices and even to commit violence or crime.",
        "But this is an abuse of the Bible, because the great rabbis, again, and as similarly, the fathers of the Church said that while any kind of interpretation was as possible for this text, which was the word of God, it always had to lead to a sense of charity and compassion.",
        "As the sun rises, the first Marines emerge from the woods.",
        "The great rabbi (unintelligible), said that any interpretation of the Bible that resulted in hatred or disdain for other people or contempt with illegitimate that - St. Augustine said that to quarrel about the Bible was an absolute contradiction in terms because the whole point of Scripture was to find a charitable interpretation of these often very difficult texts.",

        "And hence, King James I of England in 1611 commissioned this great work.",
        "And it is a very sonorous and beautiful translation.",

        "Oh, well, Jesus certainly existed and I - and he was executed by under the Romans roughly in about the year 30 of our era.",
        "But there had been many, many way, as I say, it's almost a scholarly industry among new testament scholars to say - to find some - what - who Jesus was, very divergent.",
        "Some Jewish - the great scholar, Geza Vermes, sees Jesus as a very much a Galilean faith healer of a particular type that was found in the northern territories of Israel, an exorcist, a faith healer, a holy - a popular holy man of the people.",
        "Others have seen Jesus as belonging very closely to the Pharisees.",
        "Many of his sayings resonate very closely with what would be - with what some of the early Pharisees were saying, particularly, the golden rule, for example, which I quoted earlier, don't do to others as you would not like them to do to you.",
        "Jesus has another version of it.",
        "It says, do to others as you would have -would like them to do to you.",
        "And so, very much, as far as we can tell, from the gospels which were all written long after his death - and the Resurrection - a Jewish figure.",
        "His teachings are closely in line, as I say, with what would be - later be in - as the words of the great rabbis of the Talmudic era.",
        "And - but the first gospel you see was written roundabout the year 70.",
        "That's some 40 years after Jesus died.",
        "And we know how difficult it is to preserve it in our era with all our texts and all our media - even to find out exactly what happened last week is difficult.",
        "What we do know is that the New Testament writers also relied very heavily on their own personal, intimate, spiritual experience of Jesus as a spiritual presence in the community and their hearts.",
        "And also on the text of the Hebrew Bible - they scoured the Scriptures, searching the Scriptures, looking for references to the words of the prophets, words of the psalmists that seem to refer to the life of Jesus.",
        "And so the gospel writers seem to see the Hebrew Bible almost as a source for the biography of Jesus.",
        "And you can see the New Testament, in a way, as a commentary on the Hebrew Bible, saying now it's all coming clear.",
        "As some folks say, now, we understand what the Hebrew Scriptures were saying.",
        "They were all pointing to Christ, to Jesus Christ, to Jesus the Messiah, and now, we did - only we couldn't see it before."
