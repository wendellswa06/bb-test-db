        "How should one read the Scriptures?",
        "How can it sort of help everyday people like Steve?",
        "Well, I think you see that lots of the Bible is really rather disturbing.",
        "Don't let - you know, I said that the Bible is about charity, but there's an awful lot of it that has nothing to do with charity at all.",
        "There's a lot, you know, there are stories of the great massacres committed by the Jewish commander, Joshua, when he conquered the Holy Land from the indigenous population of Canaan.",
        "There are - stories of King David are often rather sort of surprising to modern tastes.",
        "And so I can well understand that people are put off by the Bible.",
        "What I think the Bible shows, what is admirable about it especially the Hebrew Bible, especially the Book of Genesis, which I like particularly, is it - it doesn't attempt to whitewash anything.",
        "It shows human beings as they are, struggling.",
        "There are no sorts of plaster saints here.",
        "These are human beings struggling for enlightenment in difficult times.",
        "And in that sense, they can be a consolation for us.",
        "But they are - they shouldn't be interpreted as literal facts.",
        "They are attempts to explain the struggle to find God, the struggle to find peace and meaning in life, a struggle for vision.",
        "That word struggle, in fact, you've written that Scriptures are a struggle, right?",
        "Scriptures are a struggle.",
        "And the word, Israel actually comes from - it is the name given to the patriarch, Jacob, who wrestled, they said, with God one night, and he was given the name Israel - he who fights with God, he who struggles with God - in order to find meaning.",
        "It's - so I think what the Bible shows you is this sense of endeavor that to find meaning in our flawed and tragic world, is - and to find God in our flawed and tragic world is difficult.",
        "Sometimes, the Bible, I think, shows the failures as well as the triumphs of the spiritual quest.",
        "And we shouldn't be ashamed to see that.",

        "And there's - you have to understand that what we call homosexuality today, gay life, for example, is a kind of sexuality that just didn't exist in the ancient world.",
        "Very often, when the Bible is talking about sodomy or homosexuality, it's really talking about temple prostitution, ritual sex that happened quite a lot in some of these temples in the ancient world.",
        "There's a lot of ritual sex going on, and the prophets don't like it, and the lawgivers don't like it.",
        "I think that I really dislike the habit people have of picking out texts to endorse a particular program.",
        "I think the Bible doesn't work like that because for any one text that you find to support one view, you can easily find another that gives you quite a different meaning.",
        "And in fact, in the history of the church, people found they couldn't rely on the Bible to tell them - when they were trying to formulate doctrines, like, was Jesus divine, was he the son of God.",
        "People were quoting all kinds of scriptural texts to prove, first, that he was the son of God and some others proving that he was not.",
        "And they decided - they relied more on their personal insights alongside the Bible, more of their spiritual experience, more on their rational reasoning powers, working on biblical data and going further.",
        "And I think the idea that we just sit and use this book as a kind of holy encyclopedia, where we can look up facts about God or the moral life is rather a passive, childish way of looking at things.",
        "We are thinking people.",
        "We should reason and pray in the presence of God about these difficult issues.",
        "There are many difficult issues in the modern world.",

        "We're talking to Karen Armstrong, author of \"\"The Bible: A Biography.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Karen Armstrong, I want to just pick up on some of those points.",
        "And something that you say - just in the final minute of the program that we have left, you write the Bible is in danger of becoming a dead and irrelevant letter.",
        "It is being distorted by claims for its literal infallibility.",
        "It is derided, often unfairly, by secular fundamentalists.",
        "It's also becoming a toxic arsenal that fuels hatred and sterile polemic, which you were alluding to.",

        "But I find that Scripture has to be read selectively.",
        "These books are - these texts don't all apply to modern life, and this has been the case throughout biblical history.",
        "The rabbis, when they were composing the Mishnah and the Talmuds, left whole junks of Scripture to one side that had been for an age gone by, and they were creating Judaism for a different world and not all the Bible applied.",

        "These crimes can be hard to categorize because states have differing standards as to what they are.",
        "Advocacy groups offer studies, but as DAY TO DAY's Mike Pesca reports, whether these statistical reports on hate and bias are about anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim or anti-gay crimes, they often have one thing in common: dubious methodology.",
        "Two weeks ago, CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, released its annual report on the status of Muslim civil rights in the United States.",
        "As the only report of its kind, CAIR's study normally gets a fair amount of media attention, and this year was no exception.",
        "Articles in the LA Times, Washington Post, and the AP echoed the one in The New York Times headlined: Muslims report 50 percent increase in bias crimes.",
        "The report's author, CAIR's national legal director, Arsalan Iftikhar, says the organization found 1,522 incidents.",
        "Now, this ranged from everything from employment discrimination to the denial of public accommodation to airport profiling to anti-Muslim physical violence and hate crimes.",
        "That last item, hate crimes, is the only one actually tracked by an organization other than CAIR--in this case, the FBI and its federally mandated reports.",
        "But any bias incident, from a Muslim being yelled at from a passing car, to a Muslim being profiled on a plane, can wind up in CAIR's report.",
        "Iftikhar explains one incident which will show up in next year's study.",
        "Over Christmas last year, we had a group of 40 American Muslims returning from a conference in Toronto, and American citizens who were detained at the border for in excess of seven hours, fingerprinted, searched, photographed with threat of arrest for non-compliance.",
