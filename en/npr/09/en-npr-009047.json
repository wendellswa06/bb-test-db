        "Right.",
        "They're fair game?",
        "No, no, no. Not good enough to get a search warrant of a lawyer's office.",
        "To get a search warrant of a lawyer's office, you should be looking for Mafia-type drug connections, major corporate crimes.",
        "To use that nuclear weapon, and it's used very, very rarely - a search of a lawyer's office - on what seem like rather technical criminal charges sounds like a lack of proportion.",

        "It's turgid, incoherent and hateful.",
        "Mein Kampf\"\" became a bestseller because Adolf Hitler bullied his way to power, which made the book become a compulsory possession in German households.",
        "The Reich gave it as a wedding gift to couples, instead of a spice rack, I suppose, and the sales made Adolf Hitler a wealthy man.",
        "The Bavarian state government has held the copyright to \"\"Mein Kampf\"\" and never reissued the book.",
        "The symbols of Nazism, including swastikas, are still prohibited in Germany, except for scholarly and artistic purposes.",
        "Yet, when the musical \"\"The Producers\"\" opened in Berlin, they turned the swastikas into pretzels.",
        "But it may be impossible these days to prohibit any words or symbols when they are so freely available on the World Wide Web.",
        "And modern Germany has a free press and diversity of people and opinions.",
        "This new \"\"Mein Kampf\"\" is a door stopper, nearly 2,000 pages long with 3,700 critical annotations by scholars from Munich's Institute of Contemporary History.",
        "We are like a bomb disposal unit, rendering relics from the Nazi era useless, Christian Hartman, one of the historians, told Germany's ZDF.",
        "Ron Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, is among those opposed to \"\"Mein Kampf\"\" being republished.",
        "Not because he believes a bloated book of rants punctuated with modern scholarly retorts will lead to a neo-Nazi revival, but because \"\"Mein Kampf\"\" is just a really rotten book.",
        "Unlike other works that truly deserve to be republished as annotated editions, \"\"Mein Kampf\"\" does not, he told a French news agency.",
        "And then the fans loved it so much they kind of made them make a movie.",
        "Germany took in about one million refugees from around the world in 2015.",
        "A number of Germans protested, and over New Year's, there was a particularly ugly episode at the Cologne train station in which women accused crowds of migrants of sexual assault.",
        "But modern Germany has faced up to its history and become a free and merciful country that fleeing refugees want to reach.",
        "I wonder how many Germans might hear there's a new publication of \"\"Mein Kampf\"\" and just think, oh, yeah, I saw the movie.",

        "Well, the grace and the torture of adapting good books is that you got to throw them away if you're going to make a possible film.",
        "This book has a lot of words in it, as books tend to, but it has really rather more well-chosen words than a lot, and it is, as you say, all written letters.",

        "And in my opinion, the truth is that it is not possible to say whether hate crimes are going up or down.",
        "The material to make judgments like that, the statistical material, simply isn't out there.",
        "For this, Potok faults the government or rather the governments of the many states and municipalities which often have differing standards of defining and reporting hate crime.",
        "In a report for the Southern Poverty Law Center called Discounting Hate, Potok concluded that hate crime statistics are plagued with inaccuracy.",
        "That's a big problem because if hate crimes are seriously undercounted, as he believes they are, it affects the allocation of law enforcement dollars.",
