        "I mean, it has a lot to do with the fact that it's made by an extremely inspired filmmaker.",

        "There's something about it putting up there our worst fears and there's something about the position the woman is in which is so beyond any kind of nightmare you can imagine that's kind of good to look at.",
        "I think there's something really great about looking at the worst-case scenario played out.",
        "The other I would say, though, is - and again, I don't want this to sound flippant, 'cause I mean it most sincerely.",
        "The film is a love story.",
        "Truly, it's about love.",

        "I'm happy to say it because the work of having children - and I speak of someone who had twins, so I kind of know the deal - the work of having children, particularly in those first months and early years is so intense, as we all know, that if you - can you imagine doing it without that drug?",

        "I know children who are the children of mothers who've been in that situation and it is almost never spoken about which, of course, by the way, is another answer to first question, what drew me to this subject?",

        "And as you said, we were able to find them nearby.",
        "For those of us who study animals in the laboratory, it was – our field work was involved, going to a local - the mass transit garage.",
        "And we were able to capture some pigeons and show that we could be field biologists.",
        "And they're very docile animals.",
        "They work well.",
        "They don't bite you.",
        "And as I think our videos show, when you slow down the high-speed motions that they make - we're interested in understanding how they turn.",
        "Something that seems fairly straightforward to try to study and understand, but it's taken us several years to sort that out.",
        "They actually work really well.",
        "They fly between perches.",
        "We could train to fly down a maneuvering course and make a predictive right or left-handed turn.",
        "And so, they're large enough to carry the weight of electronics we put on them.",
        "And they're large enough to make maneuvering a challenging enough task so we can actually try to understand how they produce the forces that they need to produce to turn.",
        "And they're actually, you know, one thing that was amazing about looking at your video is they're way more graceful than you think of them as.",
        "They seemed to be pretty good turners.",
        "Well, they are.",
        "I think the reason you see so many of them in New York City, in any urban landscape is they're well-adapted.",
        "They're cliff dwelling, and they're known as rock doves.",
        "They have evolved to live in stiff cliff-like environments.",
        "And square, rectangular, tall buildings...",
        "Right angles.",
        "...provide exactly the right kinds of environments and be successful.",
        "And so they are - they're able to fly in a way that makes them very maneuverable at a fairly large body size.",
        "They're pretty large bird.",
        "And so it's, you know, they're taken for granted because they're so numerous.",
        "And I think probably considered a pest species by many.",
        "But, in fact, just like a laboratory rat that's - there's reason people study rats and mice.",
        "And for those of us that study bird flight, pigeons stand high in the list of why we'd be interested in studying them."

        "Plus, there's been a lot that's been studied about understanding their neurobiology.",
        "And part of what we're interested is trying to understand what birds are looking at, and how they use visual and their sense of balance to control how they move their wings to maneuver in a crowded environment.",
        "And you found that they move sort of like helicopters.",
        "Can you explain that?",
        "That's right.",
        "Much to our surprise - we thought - like many biologists, we thought that organisms selection had evolved - animals, they really had some unique capabilities.",
        "And we thought, with wings, and a left and a right wing, and they could flap in different directions and change the shape of the wings, we though they could redirect the force their wings would produce, relative to their body.",
        "But much to our surprise, very much like helicopters, the forces that they produce with their wings, which keeps them in the air and moves them forward or helps them turn, to make a turn, were actually directed very consistently relative to their body.",
        "They don't - aren't able to readjust the direction of the force at a turn.",
        "They actually have to change the orientation of their whole body, which changes the forces produced when they're flapping their wings.",
        "So they're propelled in one direction by the flapping.",
        "And then to turn, they roll or pitch or lean, like you do on a bike or something?",
        "Exactly.",
        "They roll their body.",
        "They direct the force inward to make a turn, just as you would on a bike.",
        "When you're turning, you lean into the turn.",
        "The birds turn their bodies into the turn, and then they have to reorient their bodies to reacquire a forward flight direction after they've already made a turn.",
        "So they, you know, pitch up.",
        "They'll swivel around or yaw around, and they also, importantly, roll to initiate the turn at the beginning of the turn.",
        "And if you want to see this in glorious, high speed, courtesy of Dr. Biewener and his colleagues, including Ivo Ros, go to our website @sciencefriday.com, where we have your awesome footage.",
        "It really is fun to watch them.",
        "So do all birds maneuver this way?",
        "Well, we – this - we're the first to study this in this kind of detail.",
        "It took nine high-speed cameras and a lot of...",
        "Wow.",
        "...long of periods of analysis by Ivo and other students working on the project, mainly Ivo.",
        "And I think what we know is a lot of work has been done studying how insects turn.",
        "And it turns out that most of the insects that have been studied are similarly require changes in body orientation to redirect the direction of their flight forces, to turn.",
        "So it was a psychological battle for me to do this because I knew that in some ways, I was breaking a sacred promise to my dad.",
        "But there was another promise that I had also made to him, and that I would try to embody the teachings and the life of Jesus.",
        "And concern for the poor, oppressed, vulnerable is at the heart of that."
