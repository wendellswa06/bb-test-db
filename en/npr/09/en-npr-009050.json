        "The Muslims, of course, are not Christians.",
        "They have a brown skin.",

        "You know, we are living in a world where we are supposed to be engaged in a war against terrorism.",
        "We've had many articles on Islam after 9/11, and we are still having articles about Islam.",
        "But I'm always shocked to see that the articles don't distinguish very clearly between Islam, secular Muslims, religious Muslims, extremists, like those who are in power in Turkey, for example, or elsewhere, who are peaceful extremists, and the terrorists.",
