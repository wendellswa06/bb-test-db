        "So they're very easy to study in terms of how they maneuver.",
        "But the - and it seems like the work that we've done, in collaboration with some other groups on hummingbirds, suggest that they are able to reorient the forces of one wing relative to the other.",
        "So they can change the direction of the force relative to their body more effectively than what we found with pigeons.",
        "For people who are making little robots that fly or helicopters, are there any lessons that you think they can get from the way pigeons fly?",
        "Well, that's certainly one of the motivations for this work.",
        "We, actually, currently are collaborating with groups at MIT, Carnegie Mellon and NYU trying to understand how birds make path planning decisions when they're flying and avoiding obstacles.",
        "And the goal there is to be able to understand how information taken with video cameras could be use to guide a small, micro air vehicle.",
        "I'd say the - what we have found is that the bird - if you have the ability to be very maneuverable, that is birds are able to change the orientation of force by rotating their bodies very quickly in different directions.",
        "So being highly maneuverable has real advantages.",
        "And that allows animals like a pigeon or other birds to be able to react quickly to obstacles.",
        "Now, I'd say where we're, you know, we're dealing with animals that are flapping their wings, which have - that adds an additional demand on how they actually propel themselves through the air.",
        "A lot of the micro air vehicles are using a typical propeller or a jet engine, would be using a more traditional way of generating the forces of - for flying the craft.",
        "So it's - having a fixed wing aircraft is the kind of airplanes that we fly around.",

        "And when they get up to be on the order of 100 pounds when they're adult weight, then you're - they're used to it and you're used to - you've grown up with them, basically, and it's easier to work with them.",
        "But they are a challenge.",
