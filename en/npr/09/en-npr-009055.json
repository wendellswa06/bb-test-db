        "Even after that, the president continued to drag his feet.",
        "He told reporters as he was traveling in California over the weekend that he was waiting for a full report, which he promised would be out today.",
        "That report appears to be this three-page statement from the president in which he brushes aside the CIA's assessment and says of the crown prince, maybe he did, maybe he didn't play a role in Khashoggi's killing.",
        "We may never know.",
        "So that would appear to be, at least for now, a pass for the prince.",
        "Is there a sense about why the president is so reluctant to make the Saudi government specifically pay a price for the Khashoggi - Khashoggi killing?",
        "Well, he stressed the long-term strategic and economic ties between the U.S.",
        "and Saudi Arabia.",
        "And it's true.",
        "This is an alliance that dates back to the 1940s, but it has really been heightened in the last two years of the Trump administration.",
        "Trump has gone all-in with the Saudis not only against their mutual archrival, Iran, but also smaller, regional rivals like Qatar.",
        "What's more, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has established a personal bond with Prince Salman.",
        "They're both ambitious and wealthy young men in their 30s.",
        "They seem to have a similar worldview.",
        "Kushner is counting on the prince's help to advance his long-stalled Middle East peace plan.",
        "And I'm really famous for my sandwich loaf that I've been making.",
        "This is a…",
        "But he also made it clear that he was going to stick with the constitutional declarations that gave him sweeping powers, remove him from judicial oversight.",
        "And also, that he wants to push ahead with the controversial draft of a constitution, which he'd like to see voted on by the Egyptian public in a few weeks.",
        "And we mentioned the clashes in Cairo earlier.",
        "What sparked this violence overnight?",
        "Well, what happened is that the Muslim Brotherhood called for protesters to go outside the presidential palace, where a lot of the opposition had been gathering and had set up some tents.",
        "And they basically clashed with each other.",
        "What happened was the pro-Morsi supporters went ahead and tore down tents and were beating some of the opposition - striking them with stones and even bullets, according to some of the reports we heard.",
        "And as a result, a fair number of people died and hundreds were wounded.",
        "Now, it's also important to note that there appears to be violence on the other side.",
        "This evening, for example, we heard that right after Mr. Morsi's speech, that the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo were set on fire.",
        "This is according to a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman.",
        "Now help us understand the current status of this draft constitution.",
        "I mean, is it going to go to the Egyptian public for a vote?"

        "Well, that's certainly what Mr. Morsi indicates.",

        "And, you know, people are still out protesting.",
        "It seems very hard to believe but he insists that the vote will go ahead.",
        "And why are Egyptians opposed to the draft constitution?",
        "Well, it was drawn up by the Islamist allies of President Morsi.",

        "Pica says climate should be a top issue in this presidential campaign, not stuck near the bottom of the list, where it is now.",
        "Well, the president has a bully pulpit and so he could make it a top 10 issue, if he chose to do so.",
        "You can lead by following the polls, which means you're leading from behind.",
        "Or you can take an issue, as cataclysmic as a climate crisis or climate disruption will be, and you can lead the American people to solutions.",
        "That may be noble public policy.",
        "But Frank Maisano, at the energy lobbying firm Bracewell and Giuliani, says it's not good politics.",
        "This election is largely about jobs and the economy, and introducing climate change isn't engaging voters on the issues they care about.",
        "The big flaw in the environmentalists' pushing for climate, climate, climate, is they don't understand the policy disconnect with many of the political challenges that we face.",
        "They're just not realistic when it comes to what is the art of the possible.",

        "People are simply concerned about getting or keeping a job, and how much they pay for gasoline and electricity.",
        "Paul Bledsoe, who dealt with climate policy in the Clinton White House, says the Obama campaign has a whole new perspective on the issue compared with four years ago.",
        "After talking about it a lot in 2008, as John McCain did, I think they have decided that the economy is such a paramount issue that it's better to talk about the economic side of clean energy, rather than the climate change side."
