        "As a teacher, he comes home pretty stressed from his day, and I know that a lot of it has to do with the funding that's taking place within his district but also within the state of California.",
        "Kellyanne, I want to start with you.",
        "We heard about national security, two different views on the war in Iraq, and education.",
        "Do these track with the issues that you find in your polling?",

        "Undecideds are much more like Obama voters when it comes to their belief in climate change, the causes of climate change, their desire for action by the president and Congress.",
        "They're almost identical to likely Obama voters.",
        "And if those undecided voters are feeling put off by the relentless conversation about jobs, the economy, health care and the other top-tier issues, Leiserowitz says they might just respond with a pitch on climate change.",
        "But with the days ticking down to the election, there seems to be little inclination to introduce this potentially divisive issue into the conversation."
