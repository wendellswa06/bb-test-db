        "Iraq is on the ballot in every single race today.",
        "But in some of these other contests the second-tier issues, mired in single digits as they are, can spell the difference between victory and defeat for some of this closer elections.",
        "And, Ron, you know, there are so many different ways that we can talk about ourselves demographically.",
        "There's gender, which Kellyanne just spoke about.",
        "Then there's race.",
        "There's geography.",
        "In some regions immigration I'm sure is a huge issue; and in some places it's not.",
        "What are you finding out maybe in regards to ethnicity or other factors and how they're breaking down by people's voting attitudes?",
        "Well, when you look at the overall picture, it's very interesting because political scientists like to look at the wrong track, right track.",
        "And right now 60 percent of the American people say we are on the wrong track.",
        "And then when you ask a question why - and I'm looking at the last Washington Post/ABC News poll - they say Iraq again, as Ms. Conway said.",
        "The second-tier issue here was the economy, and that's interesting because African-Americans, Hispanics looking at immigration issues, the economy is playing out very strongly in those communities.",
        "In a state like Ohio that gets to be very critical because, although Iraq is again the number one issue in that race, people have moved I think largely because of the state of Ohio's economy.",
        "And the fact that jobs are being outsourced and you've had the auto industry, a secondary - tertiary industries in Ohio to the auto industry collapsing.",
        "And so there' a lot of pain in that state, and I think that tracks in a lot of places where, despite what looks to be a booming economy, there are a lot of these communities have not benefited from it.",
        "And the middle class, lower-income classes are now beginning to vote with their feet.",
        "Kellyanne and then Ron, both of you.",
        "How does issue-based voting affect people's behavior?",
        "Are people more likely to vote against something than for something they believe in, or do people care less about issues than politicians?",
        "How does that work?",
        "Kellyanne and then Ron.",
        "Yes, it's very typical that the primary motivating factor to get people to the polls is out of frustration, angst, anger, fear.",
        "And it's much easier to say I'm against something because I fear that it could happen or it could continue in this case, and therefore I need to feel energized and engaged about that issue.",
        "Asking people to go out and just pull a lever or push a button as a way to say, atta' boy, keep on going, is far less compelling to people.",
        "Then why bother waiting in line?",
        "Why bother taking time away from your sleep, your family, your work or your peace of mind on some random Tuesday in November.",
        "So this is why negative campaigning exists; there's a market for it, frankly.",
        "This is why parties out of power and challengers sometimes - often have a cash disadvantage and a name recognition disadvantage, but often have advantages with respect to being able to say, look, you, the voters, demand and deserve change and reform.",
        "And you should shake yourself out of this status - and that is very natural to Americans - and pull a lever, push a button as a way to express that change."

        "Well, yes.",
        "Well, since 9/11 - and Ms. Conway talked about fear -I think that that's been the critical dimension in American politics.",
        "Because the politics of fear has been the stuff of which, particularly the Republican Party, has sort of focused this campaigning.",
        "That has been important in security issues, has been important also to women because they are the largest part of the electorate.",
        "And so to the extent that they have changed their mind with respect to the priority of Iraq as opposed to security and (unintelligible) privileged Iraq, that shift has been like a seismic quake in the electoral system.",
        "And so what it means is that the politics of fear here is less and less an issue when it comes to American security than it was before.",
        "Briefly both of you.",
        "Kellyanne, what issues help Republicans the most?",
        "And, Ron, what issues help Democrats the most do you think?",
        "Security definitely is an issue.",
        "But I think the Republican Party could have done a slightly better job in recognizing that security is also kitchen table economics security and health security and freedom from fear as well as it is national security and homeland security.",
        "But the other issue that seems to help Republicans, in most places anyway, is this matter of affordability.",
        "You do hear Americans, even though every leading economic indicator would show that this economy is doing well, people are nervous out there.",
        "They've overextended their personal debt in their households; they believe they got a right to buy three lattes a day for five bucks a pop, and they think that the economy's not going well if they can't do that.",
        "But there are people out there who do feel economically squeezed who are talking about affordability.",
        "And I think that's why the president in his 10-city tour this last weekend did talk an awful lot about the economic agenda and reminded people that it's a risk to vote for people who are currently not in charge, because the affordability that you question long term may be that much more compromised if people come into office and raise taxes who are a little bit more profligate with spending.",
        "I have to give the last word to Ron.",
        "Well, Nancy Pelosi wrote out a campaign agenda for the Democrats in the House.",
        "And one of the issues of course had to do with environment, another, health, obviously the economy.",
        "Strikingly, public opinion polls are saying that Democrats now are more favored - people are more confident that they can deal with taxes.",
        "So these are some of the issues that they have rolled out.",
        "And this governing agenda is okay except that African-Americans have a slightly different one, Katrina is on there, jobs, low-income wages, minimum wage, some of these other things which have to do with the bottom half of the economy that they want fixed."
