        "With $450 and a tip from another vendor about how to connect with wholesalers - go to trade shows, he said - Fall went into business nine years ago.",
        "As for that cliche of the mystical link between the Senegalese and the rain, he says that since the sidewalk vendors depend on the elements, they follow the weather forecasts religiously.",

        "Mr.",
        "Fall says the Senegalese bring a work ethic with them that accounts for their persistence vending goods on city streets all over the world.",
        "Nearly all of the Senegalese vendors are adherents of a Senegalese branch of Sufi Islam, a very spiritual form of the faith.",
