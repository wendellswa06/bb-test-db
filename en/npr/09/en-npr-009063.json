        "Now there's a legal battle over who can actually go through the documents that federal agents gathered in that raid.",
        "Right.",
        "The president and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, want to review the material before prosecutors have the chance.",
        "They want to determine which materials should be shielded by attorney-client privilege.",
        "But the Justice Department says it already has a separate group of prosecutors to do exactly that.",
        "A federal judge took up the question at a hearing yesterday, but the judge hasn't given a totally clear path forward.",
        "Let's figure out what's going on with Domenico Montanaro from the NPR politics team.",
        "Domenico, good morning.",
        "Good morning, Steve.",
        "Would you work us through this decision, please?",
        "So Cohen and Trump were seeking to review the seized material first - the stuff that was taken from Michael Cohen's, you know, office, his hotel, his safe deposit box - before prosecutors.",
        "They wanted to review it.",
        "The judge said no to that, so that's put down.",
        "This is a blow to Trump and Cohen.",
        "You know, that seemed like a sort of long shot anyway.",
        "The judge indicated she had confidence in the Southern District of New York to work with integrity through this material, and she decided not yet to - whether or not she would appoint a special master, which would be an outside attorney who would look at the information first or maybe help the Justice Department's filter team to make that determination.",
        "So basically, where we are is that federal investigators at this point can keep what they've seized from Cohen's office.",
        "They can continue to categorize it all.",
        "But they just can't look at it yet."

        "I guess we should be clear.",
        "Cohen was essentially saying, I want the right to decide whether some of these documents should be withheld.",

        "And then the next thing is, should somebody from the outside weigh in on whether certain documents should be withheld from prosecutors?",

        "Right.",
        "What's related to attorney-client privilege?",
        "OK.",

        "Yeah.",
        "The thing that got the most attention, was all over cable news yesterday was that client No. 3 for Michael Cohen was revealed, and that happened to be Fox News host Sean Hannity.",

        "Michael never represented me in any matter.",
        "I never retained him in the traditional sense as retaining a lawyer.",
        "So he said Cohen represented him in no legal matters, that his conversations never involved any matter, by the way, between him and a third-party group.",
        "He said instead what they talked mostly about, Steve - real estate because he doesn't like the stock market.",

        "He says many people are criticizing the American system, but at least it treats everybody the same.",

        "In a nutshell, Republicans like Robert Mueller and his investigation and the FBI less and less, and they see bias in the investigations and the FBI.",

        "Abe himself, though, has denied personal involvement, but his entire cabinet is taking a hit in popularity.",
        "Abe's leadership approval rating is now down below 27 percent in one poll.",

        "However, the overall result of it is that Abe is now facing rising public anger.",

        "Oh, right.",
        "That's a real simple one.",
        "But Japan is, of course, North Korea's next-door neighbor, so its security is under threat here.",
        "And it's really fearing that North Korea will essentially be normalized as a nuclear state through these discussions, and if that happens, then North Korea's short- and medium-range missiles that could easily reach Japan will really put Japan under threat.",
        "So Abe's going to be pressing Trump on hopefully keeping Japan's interests in mind if he does indeed get to meet with Kim Jong Un in person.",
        "Oh, well, that was my other question.",
        "Has Japan indicated whether it's enthused at all about President Trump meeting the president of North Korea?",
        "Well, now Japan is supportive.",
        "Originally, of course, it was rather surprised by the decision to meet with Kim.",
        "But Japan is a longtime security ally of the United States and is supporting the potential talks."

        "Our society's failure to recognize the basic human rights of poor people is a major cause.",
        "Before Katrina, historic and structural intersections of race and class forced thousands upon thousands of black New Orleanians to live in poverty.",
        "They were subjected to inferior schools, inadequate health care and housing and governmental neglect.",
        "They were already the weakest and the most vulnerable when the hurricane hit, and then, as with poor black communities of the past, they were left in the chaotic whirlwind as others with more resources fled to safety, still left when the levee, neglected for decades, broke and flooded the city, left languishing for days in inhumane and violent conditions before the federal government, their government, responded.",
        "Now a city rich in black history, a city that gave us Louis Armstrong and Mahalia Jackson, is in ruins.",
