        "As she tells Alek her story, we learn how 42 dancers from the small corner of the Missouri Ozark had perished in an instant; waltzing couples murdered midstep, blown toward the clouds in a pink mist chased by towering flames.",
        "We know the explosion is no accident; we learn that early on.",
        "But the real subject of the book isn't the mystery of who set the fire.",
