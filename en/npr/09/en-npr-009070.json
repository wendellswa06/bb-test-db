        "And once you start looking for them, as I said, you realize that people out there have been collecting these recipe books themselves with the same sort of guilty fascination and horror.",
        "The minute you start talking about these, they say, my mom had a book like that, and then they mail it to you and you have no choice but to put out another book.",
        "Indeed, a little like trying to drive past a car wreck without looking at it.",
        "The worst sinners, it seems to me, at least looking through this book, a lot of them seem to involve sauces of dubious origin and jelly of some sort.",
        "They love their jelly.",
        "They love their sauces.",

        "For the '30s and '40s and '50s, there was vogue that I can never quite come to a good explanation for for suspending things.",
        "In these aspects, they would suspend the carrots, they would suspend the celery.",
        "And these were passed off as meals and desserts.",
        "I have a 7-year-old, and I can well imagine if I put down for her as dessert something that was green and jiggly and had celery embedded in it as though it had been frozen there in time.",
        "So, yeah, they loved all of these things and, again, it may just be that photography was a little bit less spectacularly sophisticated than it is today.",
        "Perhaps if you took some of these dishes and put them in the fine bon appetit magazines and gave them a nice name and assured people that the fennel was organic and had been handpicked by, you know, nuns at midnight, people would think these are wonderful things.",
        "But given the palette of the time and the reproduction capabilities of the time, the things glisten just a little bit more than you'd like them to, food-wise.",
        "But, yeah, it wasn't just the jellies.",
        "It wasn't just the sauces.",
        "It was the strange things they eat that people no longer considered to be choice number one when it comes to putting things down your gullet, some of the peculiar meats, for example.",
        "Yeah, you know, fruit cocktail in Jell-O, bananas in Jell-O, even celery in Jell-O - corned beef in Jell-O?",

        "And if that story sounds familiar, it's because it's the latest in a string of political assassinations.",

        "Syria has denied involvement.",
        "Let's go now to NPR's Peter Kenyon, is in Beirut.",
        "And Peter, what have you seen on the streets today?",
        "Well, the body of Pierre Gemayel made the trek down from the village Bikfaya, his home village, and is now back there following a very public funeral and rally right next door at Martyr's Square.",
        "The funeral was at St. George's Cathedral, presided over by the Maronite patriarch who very rarely leaves his home on the mountains, people say.",
        "But afterwards a number of the VIPs and dignitaries went over to Martyr's Square and addressed a very large crowd, estimated in hundreds of thousands in Martyr's Square.",
        "And the message there was fairly defiant, talking about defending the government against attack by the opposition, which is led by the Shiite Hezbollah movement and not giving up in the face of either protests or assassinations.",
        "And just to be clear on who's on what side, and I know that is unclear in some cases, you have Lebanon's government, which has been installed just in the last year, year and a half, and you have Hezbollah, which has allied with Syria, and Syria is being blamed for this assassination.",
        "What was the mood of people on the streets as the coffin itself was carried through?",
        "The mood was part grief and part defiance, as I say.",
        "A lot of people brought up what may seem like a rather technical issue, this international tribunal that was just approved by the United Nations to try suspects if and when they're brought forward in the case of the killing of another leader, Rafik Hariri.",
        "That has to come back now to this very embattled and barely holding on government for approval.",
        "And these people here today were saying that they want to do whatever they can to make sure that it is approved and that the suspects are brought to justice.",
        "Peter, this government still faces some of the same problems that it had before the killing.",
        "Are people concerned about what happens next?",
        "They're very concerned about it.",
        "We just went through the issue of the Hariri tribunal.",
        "That is going to be the order of business for the next two weeks, at least because one of the things they might need is the signature of the pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahud.",
        "And how they get that is anybody's guess at this point.",
        "Plus there's the even more urgent question of keeping this government in power from the government's side, and perhaps from the opposition's side the need to topple it.",
        "Hezbollah and the allies that it has on the opposition side will be staging their own demonstrations and they'll be doing everything they can to bring the government down, they say, through peaceful means.",
        "But in Lebanon, what happens one day can lead to worst things the next, as we've seen over and over again."

        "Well, that appears to be the case.",
        "There are sometimes dissenting voices or dissenting opinions on these estimates, but that wasn't mentioned in the New York Times piece - so apparently this was a consensus view.",
        "And it, frankly, doesn't surprise me.",
        "Now, you were the chairman of the National Intelligence Council, which oversees this Estimate and worked on others.",
        "What sort of intelligence would the council need to come to the critical conclusions that were in this latest classified National Intelligence Estimate?",
        "Well, this particular estimate - I was involved in the beginning of this - this was done a rather unusual way because it involved conferences and conversations with experts around the world.",
        "So it's a classified document but it was based on an awful lot of unclassified work around the world.",
        "So, I think the views you find there are pretty broadly shared by experts outside of government, as well as officials inside."

        "Terrorism was included, but it wasn't the dominant theme.",
        "On the question of terrorism, it did find that the war in Iraq had catalyzed a global jihad and was producing a - was becoming a training ground and a recruitment pool for a new generation of terrorists.",
