        "And one of the things that we do every year, we've done it for 25 years, is we have a huge formal picnic that's 1920s style, and a lot of the people dig out all sorts of incredible recipes including things like candlestick salad, which I don't if you're familiar with.",
        "Yes.",
        "I - but I'm known to make them in all sorts of ways.",

        "(Soundbite of distaste)",

        "One of the things that that I don't think we're going to get a lot of people calling in about, perhaps, are the variety meats.",
        "They seemed to have fallen out of favor.",
        "And I think there's a great block, a mental block, a mass amnesiac forgetting that the American people have visited upon themselves to forget the sort of meats that they were fed.",
        "In World War II, you could understand, when meat was short, why they had to consume, you know, hog duodenum and the rest of it.",
        "But even in the '50s, they were trodding out these variety meats in this recipe books.",

        "That's good eating.",
        "That's Fourth of July.",
