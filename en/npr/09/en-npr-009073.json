        "In my voting life, this has been one of the most interesting presidential races.",
        "And to have had as many opportunities provided to us to actually meet and talk to presidential candidates has just really been remarkable.",

        "And then all of a sudden, NASA said we're going to cancel SOFIA.",
        "To understand why SOFIA's future was in doubt, you have to go back to its start 14 years ago.",
        "Bob Meyer is the program's manager at Dryden Flight Research Center near Palmdale, California.",

        "Who would've thought of cutting this big a hole in the back of an airplane?",
        "And, you know, my response was, NASA takes on challenges like this and takes what appear to other people to be crazy ideas in turns them into reality."

        "At the time, the 747 was the largest airplane flying.",
        "And the telescope was engineered to be as large as it could be and still fit inside a 747.",
        "That turned out to be more than eight feet across.",
        "The plane ended up looking like it had swallowed something very large.",
        "There's a noticeable bulge behind the wing.",
        "Part of that bulge is a garage-sized door that retracts to give the telescope's mirrors direct access to the night sky.",
        "Meyer says the observatory can fly like this for hours.",
        "We're looking at light that was generated, you know, literally hundreds of millions of years ago.",
        "So in order to get enough light, it may take hour of just looking at that target to gather enough light from it to reconstruct the picture.",
        "Skeptics also asked whether a 747 with a big hole in it would fly smoothly enough for cutting-edge astronomy.",
        "Troy Asher, a research test pilot for NASA, remembers the first time they opened the door in flight.",
        "Sitting there waiting, and they say, okay, we're going to open the door.",
        "And there's a countdown: three, two, one, open.",
        "And if you didn't actually pay attention extremely carefully when they say ready, ready now, you would've missed it.",
        "Great engineering.",
        "But it all took a lot longer and cost a lot more than it was supposed to, which is why after a decade of overruns, NASA was ready to cancel the program.",
        "Scientists and the German Aerospace Center, a partner in the project, got the decision reversed.",
        "But the reprieve came with huge pressure to finish quickly.",
        "So it was a big deal when, a few weeks ago, SOFIA took off and opened its telescope to the skies for the first time."
