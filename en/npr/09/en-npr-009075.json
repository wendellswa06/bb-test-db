        "And because there's no legal right to welfare - there were about 3.9 million people on welfare, shrunk from the 14 million of the mid-'90s when the recession started - it only went up in the recession with all the need that was out there to about 4.5 million.",

        "Tell me about how the states have played a role in diminishing the number of people who can receive cash payments, because my understanding is the states get a block grant from the federal government, and in many cases, they can decide what they want to do with that money.",
        "They don't have to spend all of it on welfare payments.",
        "That is certainly true.",
        "And so the message that came with it back in 1996 was to get people off welfare in any way.",
        "If they got a job, that's fine.",
        "But if they didn't, that was OK too.",
