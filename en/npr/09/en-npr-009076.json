        "If you look at El Paso just 10 years ago, it looked like, given its asset base, it would be a nice sort of takeover target for a number of different companies.",
        "But when you look at them - the liabilities that the company had because of their trading activities, it just didn't make any sense.",
        "After the smartest guys in the room blew up Enron in a cloud of lawsuits and criminal prosecutions, El Paso decided that following in Enron's footsteps might not be the best strategy.",
        "It took years to undo the damage, but the proposed deal proves El Paso has done it.",
        "A small irony is that the buyer Richard Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan, used to be one of Enron's smartest guys.",
        "But when Enron anointed Jeffrey Skilling as Ken Lay's successor and not Richard Kinder, he left and began his own company.",
        "Medlock says that while Enron executives indulged in flights of fancy, believing every far-flung business they touched would turn to gold, Kinder focused on building his core.",
        "And that's the thing about Kinder Morgan.",
        "By not traveling that path, it really left the company in a situation where they could have a very solid balance sheet coming out the back side of the merchant energy meltdown and put it in a position to grow.",
        "And it's been growing.",
        "And this is growth by leaps and bounds, obviously.",

        "You can't go asset-light in a business that is dominated by returns on investment.",

        "That day, back in 1996, when Richard Kinder was told he wasn't going to be the guy at Enron had to be one of his most disappointing.",
        "Fifteen years later, he's being hailed as a pipeline company superstar and the guy who got the nod is serving a 24-year federal sentence.",

        "When Michela Wrong returned for a visit to Kenya, she expected to hear that booming voice again.",
        "Githongo was one of his country's leading opponents of political corruption, and he had been recruited to work for Kenya's government trying to battle corruption from the inside.",
        "But at a dinner, John Githongo seemed subdued.",
        "So Michela Wrong told him if he ever needed a place to stay, to flee, he should drop by her London apartment.",
        "And then a couple of months later he turned up at my doorstep and he had an awful lot of luggage with him, and came in and just said, I've gone into exile and can you keep quiet about this and not tell anyone until I've worked out what I'm going to do?",
        "Githongo had smuggled out audio recordings and documents showing how Kenyan government officials were stealing almost a billion dollars.",
        "Now he's the subject of Michela Wrong's new book, called \"\"It's Our Turn to Eat.",
        "Well, that's a reference to the system of running Kenya that has really done so much to damage it, because what you've had is this rotating series of ethnic elites who have regarded the opportunity to run Kenya as an opportunity to benefit themselves.",
        "And it's an attitude that has obviously destroyed the economy.",
        "So you have this beautiful country with a lot of economic potential, and yet you have massive corruption in the government causing immense amounts of taxpayer money to disappear, immense amounts of possibilities to disappear.",
        "So how did John Githongo, who wrote so scathingly of misgovernment in Kenya, end up as part of the government?",
        "Well, there are some people that are upset about it but here again, you know, my word is my bond.",
