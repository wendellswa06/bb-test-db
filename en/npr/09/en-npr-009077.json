        "And so the new government comes in with a mandate to clean up the corruption.",
        "And one of the first things they did as soon as they won the election is they went to John and said we want you to be anti-corruption czar working out of State House right next to Kibaki, briefing him daily.",
        "You know, you will be his eyes and his ears.",
        "And if you're a young man who has dedicated yourself to fighting corruption, I think this was too good an offer to miss.",

        "No, there was this tremendous relationship of trust, and the story of John Githongo is basically that trust being steadily whittled away.",
        "In 2004 he began to hear reports, rumors, people were coming into his office giving him information.",
        "A lot of the information he got was from civil servants who were passing him files and letters and telling him what they were hearing.",
        "And they were hearing that there were a series of dotty contracts being signed off by people in key ministries which involved - in the end it was nearly a billion dollars.",
        "These were military and security contracts and in return Kenya was going to get almost nothing because they were being signed with shadow companies that were little more than addresses.",

        "Behind it there was just a shop front.",
        "There was nothing there.",

        "Well, now, what would make the opposition leaders who had decried the corruption of the last government change their tune once they were in government?",
        "I think once you get into power, this way of operating, which seemed so despicable when it was benefiting other people - and in particular in Kenya you have to think that it was benefiting people from another ethnic community, these men who had spent a lot of time in political activism, they'd been out in the cold for a long time, they hadn't made much money, and suddenly this is their big chance and they were going to grab it with both hands.",
        "John Githongo, your central character, found out that his fellow government officials were not going to do anything about the corruption that he was exposing, but he did start taping people.",
        "Did you get a chance to listen to the tapes?",
        "Yes, I did.",
        "I listened to two or three of them because obviously when I started thinking about writing this book I wanted to be sure that he was telling the truth.",

        "You often hear death threats being made.",

        "And so how do you cover it up?",
        "Well, you cover it up by laughing.",
        "You suggest that they may also have meant it's us in a different way, meaning it's all us in this tribe and we're all in this together, John, and pull yourself together and be with us.",
        "Definitely.",
        "I mean that message came across very explicitly the longer John carried on investigating.",

        "Well, Kibaki had had a series of small strokes at the beginning of his presidency and a lot of people would say to you while these contracts were being signed he was sick, he was ill, he wasn't compos mentis, so this stuff was being done without his knowledge.",
        "But the thing that John eventually came to decide was that he was going in, briefing this man about all these unsavory things he was discovering and the complicity of various ministers, and then the president would go onto the radio and say there are all these allegations about corruption being made but we have no evidence.",
        "And John would say, but I was giving him the evidence, what more did he need?",
        "And I think the point where he decided to flee and the point where he turned up at my flat in London was when he realized that there was a sort of big cobweb and at the heart of it sat the president.",
