        "So how did this play out, say, in the 20th century?",
        "Did it make much of a difference if a war was considered historically controversial?",
        "Generally, the more controversial the war is, particularly over time and the aftermath of the war, the more memorials are built.",
        "So the Civil War is by far the war that has the most memorials.",
        "There are just tens of thousands of memorials.",
        "In fact, if you go to Gettysburg or Antietam, there are hundreds of memorials just in one battlefield.",
        "World War I takes the spot for the second-most-monumented war, and I would argue it's probably the - one of the most controversial wars in American history.",
        "It's, to me, definitely the most controversial war of the 20th century.",
        "And yet, World War II - we see a marked difference there.",
        "I know that this is your area of expertise.",
        "What happens with World War II?",
        "World War II is interesting.",
        "I remember being so struck when I was first studying the topic back in the 1990s, and all of a sudden I realized, where are the World War II memorials?",
        "And I realized - this was in the 1990s - that there aren't very many memorials because the veterans, in a sense, didn't want them initially.",
        "If they thought of memorials at all, they wanted the things like highways.",
        "They wanted parks.",
        "They wanted community homes.",
        "Only when the generation was starting to age did they start thinking, maybe we should leave some memorials behind.",
        "But I also think it was their children that are also equally the driving force to build memorials, but that's only - the drive to World War II memorials only comes sort of around the 50th anniversary.",
        "Going forward, what are you seeing when it comes to Afghanistan, Iraq?",
        "What kind of memorials have developed out of these wars?",
        "So what kinds of information are you finding in these documents?",
        "It is brilliant, and you know, my girlfriend, she brushes her teeth all the time, and I think she knows.",
        "One of the things that prompted me to sort of write this article for The Daily Beast is I've been wondering when we are going to really start thinking about commemorating the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.",
        "And I think two thoughts prompted me, as I remember that rush to memorialize 9/11, and I think that was very much to mourn the dead and had a real cathartic element to it.",
        "And I've been surprised at how - I think the failure to even discuss memorialization in a serious way is how these two wars have increasingly, for most Americans, just sort of disappeared for them in terms of consciousness and memory.",
        "But I also think there's a number of deeper issues going on here.",
        "One of them is, you know, are these wars really over?",
        "Will they ever have an end?",
        "And I think the other issue is we're fighting with very much a professional army, so I think there's less of a sort of public desire to kind of remember these wars 'cause we have fewer connections with those who fight in the war.",
        "That's Kurt Piehler.",
        "He's the director of the Institute on World War II and the Human Experience.",
        "His article, \"\"Why Don't we Build Statues For Our War Heroes Anymore?,\"\" appeared originally in The Daily Beast.",

        "One of the most interesting is a so-called Internet of Things company called LiFi Labs that is trying to redesign the light bulb - basically, a wireless light bulb that you can control from your phone.",
        "And is this just an infusion of cash or is Silicon Valley also attracting Australian talent - you know, engineers, programmers?",
        "What's interesting, as you've seen, several hundred entrepreneurs set up companies initially in Australia - be it Melbourne, Sydney, elsewhere.",
        "But then once they've got proof of concept, Arun, they're coming to Silicon Valley - Palo Alto, Mountain View, elsewhere - for a number of reasons.",
        "One, they think that they can raise more capital.",
        "There's more of an established venture capital industry there for them to raise money from.",
        "But they're also saying there's a bigger market here.",
        "They're saying rather than stay at home, where 21 million people in my country, let me come to a place that's got 300 million-plus and that regularly exports to the world.",
        "So you have seen quite a boon over the last 24 months.",
        "And the reality is it may just be beginning.",
        "We may see a lot more people begin to make this move as you see more and more very public successes.",
        "And often, the way you know a country really comes to prominence in the Valley is when they're not only offering up entrepreneurs or even investment, but when the big, established companies start buying some of our most interesting up-and-comers.",
        "And so I would keep my eye out for that over the next six to 12 months as a real sign that this trend is thickening and growing.",
        "And why is it happening now and why Australia?",
        "You know, I think a couple of reasons.",
        "One is that as the Australian government itself has begun to push heavily this idea of startups, and that was part of the kind of seeding of it.",
        "You also had a number of entrepreneurs in Australia, who had some success with various kinds of e-commerce companies, actually put money back into creating these hubs called accelerators where lots of would-be entrepreneurs can come gather together and begin to practice their craft and trade.",
        "And while all of that was happening, you began to have folks from Silicon Valley make the reverse Marco Polo trip and go to Australia and start to find companies there that they wanted to invest in.",
        "And so you've always had engineering talent.",
        "You've always had people who've had some success in business.",
        "But now there began to be a way towards Silicon Valley and some quarter of a billion, maybe almost half a billion dollars in investment later.",
        "You now have a number of interesting companies that have either set up camp here or have attracted Silicon Valley investment back home."

        "A lot of the time, they were determining that someone was with al-Qaida by having some other detainee simply say he was.",

        "You'd read an assessment of some detainee and you'd hear all these bad things that he supposedly did.",
        "And then you drill down a little bit, and it becomes really clear that the evidence is pretty sketchy.",
        "I mean, some of it was from other detainees who had mental illnesses or from detainees who were tortured.",
        "So I want to ask you about this, the idea that one - that information from one detainee was used against another detainee, and then that becomes the basis for deciding whether or not these guys were risky or not."
