        "Although, if they are rejected the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces will have to fill the void.",
        "That means Egypt's military rulers could end up drafting their own set of rules as to who can run for president in the parliament in the coming months.",
        "That's not acceptable, not only to Elbaradei, but to the youth leaders of the revolution who forced Mubarak out of office.",
        "Voters are being asked to approve or reject nine amendments to the current constitution.",
        "Some of the provisions are appealing to Egyptians, such as limiting future presidents to a maximum eight years in office, and limiting their power to impose a state of emergency to six months before having to put it to a public vote.",
        "Mubarak, by comparison, maintained the intrusive and hated emergency law for all of his 30 years in office.",
        "But opponents say they are worried about other provisions, like those determining who can run for office and day-to-day powers of the president.",
        "They claim the measures unfairly benefit Mubarak's former colleagues and a handful of organized political movements, like the once banned Muslim Brotherhood.",

        "The army appears to want to do the same thing, they don't want to stay in power.",
        "That is why they're rushing to these constitution amendments.",
        "Fahmy says two recent opinion polls, conducted by the Egyptian army, showed the measures would likely to be voted down.",
        "He adds few Egyptians believe the referendum will be free and fair, given widespread allegations of ballot tampering and voter intimidation in November's parliamentary polls.",
        "One of the basic problems with the previous system was the electoral system itself and the rigging in the vote, and the very lists of voters that were tampered with.",
        "We don't know where to go to actually vote and cast our ballots.",
        "None of this is clear and everything is so rushed, and people are panicking.",

        "I throw things at the TV when a call doesn't go my way, and it was really inspired by doing that and recognizing that if you did have ways to track various things on the football field, it would be a really interesting concept to try and supplement today's refereeing with additional electronics that you might put in the football, in the uniforms, in gloves, and other things.",
        "So what exactly do you put inside the football, for example?",
        "So, inside the football, we've done a couple of things.",
        "We've put a mini GPS unit inside the football, and the GPS unit then allows us to track the football as it moves around the field of play.",
        "So, for example, if there's a quarterback who throws the football, then we can track the trajectory of the football as it's moving in the field of play.",

        "So additional things we've done is put base stations which transmit wireless RF signals around the football field, so the ball is continuously in contact with something.",

        "So, the gloves are standard-issue wide receiver gloves.",
        "They have a set of pressure sensors on every one of the fingers, and they're sewn into the gloves.",
        "And whenever the player makes contact with any object, the pressure sensors will fire telling you exactly how much pressure was applied when that object came into contact.",
        "So, for example, someone who's catching the football, we can tell you how that person caught the football, whether they caught it, all of those different things.",
        "Could it revolutionize the instant replay?",
        "That's one of the hopes.",
        "I mean, I don't think this will ever replace human referees because human referees can make very interesting decisions based on their vast experience, based on having seen the same play at multiple different games.",
        "But this thing could supplement their decision-making especially if, you know, for example a coach throws the red flag on a field and you have to go to instant replay or you have to go back and, you know, re-decide the call that you just made.",
