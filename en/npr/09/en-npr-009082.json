        ": How would you describe Tottenham?",
        "Well, you know, Tottenham is a traditionally poor, inner-city neighborhood in the north of London, and it would equate with parts of your downtown areas in your major cities similar to the South Side of Chicago or, you know, Queens in New York, say.",
        ": And racially diverse?",
        "It is the most ethnically diverse neighborhood in Europe, with people speaking over 200 languages.",

        "When a young, black man loses his life at the hands of the police in an area like mine, that is a major, major event, and the community has questions to ask and wants answers for sure.",
        "That then turned or escalated into some unbelievable that is now sparking riots across the country.",
        "And I think that that is linked, one, to, I'm afraid, a lack of policing.",
        "The police have not been able to move quickly to deal with these issues.",
        "And we've seen an escalation.",
        "We certainly did in Tottenham on Saturday evening, and that is the cry that we're hearing across the country.",
        "And second, there is a situation, I think, with young people.",
        "The majority of young people, obviously, in Tottenham and other areas similar to Tottenham are totally against this violence.",
        "But there are two or 300 people in areas like mine who are very much at the margins of society who have a different value set, and I'm afraid we are seeing those young people running rampage through the country.",
        "And to see people losing their lives now as a result of this is something I never thought I'd see.",
        ": What do you mean by a different value set?",
        "Well, it's not to say that riots aren't new.",
        "I am from a generation that saw riots in the 1980s, and indeed Tottenham saw some of the most serious riots in 1985.",
        "But on that occasion, it was a pitch battle between Britain's black community and the police, and there was profound racism in the police force."
