        "When you look ahead for the next two to three years, do you see this money reappearing for non-profits specifically?",
        "Do you think people will find ways of replacing the funds?",
        "Or do you think there's going to be a rough road for non-profits?",
        "Well, if they're looking for the money to come back from the Madoff scandal, the answer is no. You know, Madoff had spent a lot of that money, and a lot of that money will never be recovered.",
        "For non-profits in general, I think the bigger threat to non-profits is the economic downturn, and the fact that a lot of charitable giving has declined substantially as a result of the economic struggles that we're having as a country right now.",
        "I do believe optimistically that, within the year, the bulk of the recession will be over, and we can get back to business as usual, while at the same time, there are some serious long term problems in the economy which may not even reveal themselves for another three of four years.",
        "It sounds like - are there any potential sources that you can see that might replace some of the lost moneys?",
        "Well, you know, I can't really say for sure.",
        "I don't really think that the model for non-profit giving is going to change very much.",
        "I think that it's sort of like the weather, you know, when it's raining you just come inside or you get an umbrella and you wait the storm out.",

        "Some of our investment strategy changed.",
        "Where we managed our money, how we allocated our funds changed.",
        "We tightened our belt a little bit.",

        "So, we got to speak to your organization about Timothy Cole who died in prison about, you know, after being wrongly convicted of rape, a very tragic story and one where you have been instrumental in exposing what's happened and working to exonerate him and in fact, having another hearing coming up in February.",
        "So, what kinds of funds give you the resources to do this kind of work?"

        "Well, until the news of the Madoff scandal broke, and it broke on us like a real tsunami, we had no way of seeing this coming.",
        "We were - we had received a grant from an organization called the Jett Foundation which funded a lot of our work in Dallas County, which has, in turn, enabled us to put a lot more volunteer effort into cases like Tim Cole's in other parts of the state, but as it turns out, the Jett Foundation was pretty much supported solely by one donor, and that donor had all of their money tied up with Bernie Madoff's scheme.",
        "So the consequence, not just for us, but for dozens of criminal justice reform groups throughout the country is that, effectively, our either primary or sole funding sources are gone and frankly, we're scrambling here now.",
        "We are not in good shape.",
        "It's going to be - fortunately, the Texas legislature is getting ready to convene, and it's going to be up to them to step up.",
        "You know, the state of Texas caused our problem here and it's time...",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Well, sure.",
        "The State of Texas, through the system that we have created and let go on for the last 20 to 30 years, has turned itself into, not just sort of a cruel joke in the criminal justice world, but a false conviction machine.",
        "It's not for nothing that we have gotten as many folks out of prison in Texas, especially in Dallas, as we have.",
        "There is certainly a lot more to get out here, and there are a lot of reasons for that, but the primary reason is we've suffered from a convict at all cost mentality.",
        "We have elected judges, elected D.A.s and the net result has been that a lot of poor people, who couldn't afford good lawyers, have just simply been framed and falsely convicted.",
        "Well, let me jump back into the finance issues, and certainly, we do want to follow up as we have been on the big picture of what's going on in Texas and give folks (unintelligible) within the legal system there.",
        "But your whole reason for existing is because there are flaws in the system.",
        "So given that that's the fact, and given that you have to try to scramble to find this money, are you expecting the state to now pony up for the work that you're doing to challenge them?",
        "Well, we're certainly asking them, expecting much from the State of Texas is a tricky proposition, especially when it comes down to criminal justice reform, although there are a lot of encouraging signs with this legislature, and I think that, frankly, a lot of legislators have now decided that there really is a crisis in this state with a number of folks that we've been able to get out and that the Innocence Project nationally has been able to get out here.",
        "So we're hopeful that they're going to have some impetus to really step up and do the right thing.",
        "Finally, when you think about your options, you mentioned you're not in good shape, you're looking to the state.",
        "If the state doesn't ante up, could you close?",
        "It's conceivable.",
        "Under the current set up that we've got, like, let's just say, things remained absolutely the same, that there was no increase from the state, we would be able to operate a small clinical program out of one law school.",
        "But its ability to get much done would be pretty severely hampered.",
        "The key to us, because it's such a huge state and there are so many cases, and we have a gigantic prison system, is being able to mobilize lawyers and volunteers and law students from all over the state, instead of just one little town or one little region.",
        "So it's critical for us, to really do our job right, to be able to get more money.",
        "In the meantime, we're preparing to do what the previous guest, the professor, said and that's, you know, we're looking to get the umbrellas out and try to get through this rainy day.",
        "All right.",
        "Jeff, thank you."
