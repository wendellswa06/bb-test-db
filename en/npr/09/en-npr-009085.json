        "And many of these cases, as we have seen with this case involving Genarlow, it involves going beyond all the evidence that's before you.",
        "And in this case, we're seeing the minority accusing the majority of going beyond what the general assembly intended.",
        "But sometimes I think you need go beyond the bench as you look at these cases.",
        "And I think in this case the Supreme Court may have done just that.",
        "Now, I'm going to stay with you, John, different topic.",
        "Back to SCHIP round two.",
        "The president vetoed the bill earlier this month claimed expanding the program will allow for middle-income families to take advantage of the system.",
        "This seems to have legs.",
        "How do you think the story has been covered?",
        "Is it something that's now playing out on a broader level nationally?",
        "This - it's gotten a huge amount of coverage throughout the country.",
        "And I think, you know - what I think to some extent is lost in all of this coverage.",
        "A lot of coverage we've been seeing has been looking at who's winning and who's losing.",
        "Whether the Republicans are head on this issue or can use this next year or the Democrat's can.",
        "I think what's being lost here is the fact that we have millions of low-income people who actually need this insurance, who are not going to be able to get in that.",
        "And I think a lot of the coverage we have seen have not really been zero in on that key fact, instead we're looking in effect who's up and who's down and who can use this issue, and I think that's unfortunate.",
        "Dani, do you think this is playing out more on a level of - okay, what's this about or politics?",
        "I think that's, yeah, I think that a lot of the coverage has focused on the politics and especially with the move of Dianne Feinstein coming through is, you know, a Democrat who've kind of crossed over.",
        "But I think, you know, again, here in Wisconsin the focus has been - it's not really playing as that bigger story, I think, because we do have a pretty extensive, you know, SCHIP program here batch or care which was just expanded to include families above to 300 percent of the federal poverty level.",
        "So the -our program here in Wisconsin was expanded and our budget just finally passed after months of deadlock on Tuesday.",
        "And so I think most focus here are focused more on - that there's broad support for an expanded program and just many people are just taking kind of a wait and see approach to what's happening on the federal level.",
        "And Adrian, these issues are very different locally.",
        "Massachusetts has had a broad ranging set of health care initiatives.",
        "Does that affect in Boston - at the Boston Globe?",
        "How you cover the story?",
        "I think it does a little bit.",
        "You know, we're in the early stages of trying to or, you know, Massachusetts in the early stages of trying to insure everybody in the state.",
        "And I think they probably makes SCHIP a little more interesting than it would be otherwise.",
        "And I also agree with rest of the panel that it has been covered primarily as a political story as opposed to, you know, more substantively.",
        "And I think that's too bad.",
        "Well, you know, there's been, of course, this huge coverage of the wildfires.",
        "There have been yoga and massages at San Diego's Qualcomm Center California's in flames.",
        "And there has been a discussion, Adrian, of whether or not there is some shadow of Katrina.",
        "Whether it's, oh wow, government has finally gotten its act together or hey, if you're white and you're not poor, you can get much better service.",
        "Have you written about this?",
        "How have people - other people, in your opinion, written about this?",
        "I have not written about this and we haven't covered the wildfires extensively, I guess, because they're so far away.",
        "But, you know, I think the Katrina comparisons are inevitable and you're going to see them every time there's a disaster like this.",
        "And it is certainly interesting to see the contrast between the way they have responded, you know, relatively quickly in San Diego versus what we saw in Louisiana a few years ago."

        "Dani, what do you think about even making this comparison?",
        "I think it's a fair comparison and I think it is inevitable.",
        "I think that the way it's playing here in our editorial pages is, you know, clearly, the federal government and the coordination between various levels of government is working much better in California and isn't it sad that we had to kind of go through the horrors of Katrina in order for government to get its act together.",
        "And that's been kind of consistent with what I've seen in the coverage elsewhere.",
        "I think that - yeah, I think it's a fair comparison, I think that - I mean, again inevitable, maybe not fair, but I think that after what happened in '05, what we have to look at these types of disasters through that lenses, how poorly it was handled in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast.",
        "John, is a disaster of huge magnitude, thousands and thousands of homes destroyed, so many people displaced, can you, as a reporter, make a judgment about whether a story that is localized, in this case, in California all the way across from where you are in Miami, should be heavily covered in your paper?",
        "Well, Farai, I live in a state that - where we're no strangers to natural disasters with our hurricanes.",
        "And so we can certainly empathize with what our friends in the - in some cases probably in California what they are going through.",
        "So I think we have had it here at the Miami Herald on the front page several times although we are at the point where we're turning the corner on it because, to some extent, it's seems to be waning.",
        "And going back to one of your earlier questions about whether or not we need to look at this to some extent through the Katrina lens, I think it's an appropriate question.",
        "And even the president is addressing that given how we have - how the U.S.",
        "government has handled Katrina, I think everything that comes after it, to some extent, has to be looked at through the Katrina eyes, and hopefully everyone can say, we'll never do that again.",
