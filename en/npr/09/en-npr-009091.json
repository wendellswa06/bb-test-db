        "I'm an English instructor at a community college, and this is really fascinating to me because the last assignment I just had my students turn in was a - sort of analysis of a print ad.",

        "The ad is very persuasive because - well, actually, what I would have said is: I'm Ray Lewis.",
        "And I don't need to use Old Spice, but I do.",

        "Yeah.",
        "That's how I would have done that one.",
        "And what do you think of the television ads that are - well, they've been wildly phrased, the Old Spice ads that - with the unbelievably attractive male model doing all kinds of absurd things?",

        "And they have a study that they reference that basically - and I'm paraphrasing here - it says, if, you know, a (technical difficulty) over the course of a dog's lifetime, it has shown to extend the dog's life up to X number of years.",
        "And essentially -you know, my wife works in the veterinary field, and what she has basically told me is, that just means don't overfeed your dog.",

        "And I just think that in general, it's very interesting to hear the wording that companies use when referencing studies.",
        "And it's found that - that I have found that it actually turns me off to the product when I hear someone reference their own study, even if it says an independent study.",
        "Very smart, because what the public is asking for, and I quote, no fine print, unquote.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And so anything that causes you to doubt, to raise either objections or just concerns about it - and they always put the information right at the bottom of the screen so you can't really read it - every time you see a company do that, the ad becomes less effective.",
        "The communication becomes less effective.",
        "What about those companies - and thanks, Matt for the call - that are forced by, you know, regulation to put in, you know, the possible side effects of this: This drug is going to make you feel absolutely fantastic; of course, it may cause heart failure.",
        "Yes.",
        "And what the people now respond - and the goal of those ads is to merely get the name of the medication into the minds of the consumers so that they will ask their doctor about it.",
