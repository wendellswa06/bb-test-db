        "On January 22, President Obama signed his first executive order.",
        "It concerned the disposition of the cases of detainees held by the Department of Defense, and it included a clear statement about the prison camp where they were detained.",
        "Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now.",
        "Now, how far along is the U.S.",
        "toward meeting that goal?",
        "Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that making the deadline of January 22, 2010 will be difficult.",
        "Joining us for a Guantanamo update is Sarah Mendelson who is the director of the Human Rights and Security Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
        "Sarah Mendelson, difficult or impossible to reach that deadline, do you think?",
        "Difficult.",
        "It's always been the case that Guantanamo was very, very difficult to deal with.",
        "When the president signed the executive order in January calling for 12 months, I thought that was great; a lot of us thought that was great.",
        "We'd spent a lot of thinking about how long we thought it was going to take, and 12 months made sense to us.",
        "But by 12 months, we meant 12 working months, not sign the executive order and then several months go by - and February, March, April, you finally get the task forces together.",
        "In May, you finally get the main diplomat who's going to be negotiating for the release of certain people.",
        "So it had a very bold start but then a bit of a delay, and that has really caused a lot of problems.",
        "Now, bring us up to date.",
        "Who are the detainees who are still at Guantanamo?",
        "Roughly, how many and how do they compare with what the place had its peak?",
        "It's important for people to recognize that there have been over 700 men held at Guantanamo since President Bush opened the detention facility in January 2002.",
        "The Bush administration released over 500 people.",
        "We don't have a lot of transparency on how the decisions that they made.",
        "At the moment, there are about 223 left in Guantanamo.",
        "And you get different reports on how the administration has sorted through them, and it's very difficult to say exactly and perhaps administration officials will tell you.",
        "What I'm hearing is there are about 75 that are slotted for release or transfer.",
        "There are about 40 that are slated for prosecution.",
        "And there are about 110, depending on who you talk to, where they haven't made a decision about what they're going to do with these people.",
        "Well, just the ones who are slated for release or transfer, why are they still at Guantanamo?"

        "Because it's a very complicated process of negotiating with friends and allies around the world to take people.",
        "And frankly, the fact that we haven't taken anybody for release in some ways has held things up.",
        "But it's just - it's simply, you know, there's one person - Ambassador Daniel Fried at the State Department - whose main job is negotiating with countries all over the world to take folks.",
        "And he's actually been the good news part of the story.",
        "Is this just a garden variety case of campaign promise easily articulated, comes face-to-face with the complex reality of actually governing and being in office?",
        "Or is it unique?",
        "I think the answer is actually a bit of both.",
        "It is unique in the sense that it has attained a kind of quality well beyond Guantanamo.",
        "It is almost - it's mythic in proportion.",
        "And it's important for the United States, in regaining its moral stature, that it'd be done in a way that essentially restores America's place as a center of justice and a country that abides by international law.",

        "And you know this is not right.",
        "And you're just going to stop.",
        "Right?",
        "And the addict will tell you whatever you want to hear when, in fact, he was in the middle of this downward spiral.",
        "So don't let hope conquer reality.",
        "Face reality.",
        "And if you think your loved one is in that spiral, act early to get them into some kind of treatment.",
        "On a personal level, I wonder if you could share a little bit about how you dealt with all this because you are someone who is used to getting results.",
        "You are someone who has faced some of the most complicated problems there are.",
