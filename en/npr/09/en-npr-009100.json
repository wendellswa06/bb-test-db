        "Well, I think that the concern about election machines is valid and I think that they - we have to pay a lot attention to that.",
        "One thing we should pay attention to is there's one group out there called Acorn.",
        "It's a community-organizing group that's been about 35 years old.",
        "They, unfortunately, have a long history of registering people who aren't eligible to vote, and they have a long history of just basically laughing at the election laws.",
        "They have had people indicted in several states, from Washington State to Missouri to Ohio to Wisconsin.",
        "And one of the things that's interesting is Barack Obama, when he was a committee organizer in Chicago, was not only a trainer and an organizer for this group, but he was their lawyer for three years.",
        "So, when the Obama people say we want every vote to count, I take that at face value.",
        "But some of their allies like Acorn, have a tradition and a history of manipulating the election process and trying to sneak people in who shouldn't be voting.",
        "And that's of concern on both parties because we have two civil rights here, Neal.",
        "The civil right to make sure people aren't blocked from voting - we had a civil rights battle in the '60s about that, we abolished poll taxes, we made sure we weren't intimidating people.",
        "We have to preserve and extend those games.",
        "But there's another civil right.",
        "You lose your right to vote if your vote is canceled out by someone who shouldn't be voting, someone who's voting twice, or someone who doesn't even exist as happens in Chicago and many other places.",
        "So, there are two civil rights at play here.",
        "We have to try to preserve both of them and pay attention to both of them this election.",
        "Is there any chance, any prospect that the parties could work together on this?",
        "Trevor Potter, who's John McCain's legal counsel, was at a recent event, a legal event and talked to Bob Bauer, who was Barack Obama's legal counsel, about having bi-partisan teams and inviting reporters along to beembedded with these teams as they go around to precincts and try to figure out what problems there are and trying to resolve them in an amicable fashion.",
        "This has been a very polarizing election.",
        "Bob Bauer's response, I understand, to that was, you know, we're not going to be caught the trap of bipartisanship, we frankly don't think your offer is valid or sincere.",
        "Therefore, you know, we're not really talking about that.",
        "So, both parties are completely polarized, both parties have great suspicions.",
        "And the fear is, the voters are going to be the ones to be hurt by this because if we go to overtime, I don't think it's going to do our democracy any good and if we don't know who the president who's been elected is for several weeks, that could lead to all kinds of instability.",
        "And whoever it is, their legitimacy might well be challenged by a considerable portion of the electorate.",
        "That has happened in the past, as you know.",
        "Yes, indeed.",

        "I think this is a very solid moment for the country because - I'm for Obama, I think that he can - he represents a solution for all the problems that we are having in this country, like energy independence and economy, health care and all the rest.",
        "I think that contrary to McCain, Obama is - during the convention, proposed a lot of solutions.",
        "So far, at the convention - Republican Convention, I didn't even hear anything about solutions.",
        "To be fair, Senator McCain's not had a chance to speak yet.",
        "So, he'll get that opportunity this evening.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But during the Democratic Convention, even the other speakers were telling about the Obama program, all the things that he's planning to do.",
        "Instead, the McCain convention, I just hear - of course, he's a hero of war and all the things that - they say that he did a lot of things, he accomplished a lot of things, but they don't specifically what.",
        "Vanessa, do you fear that - you say Obama presents the opportunity to solve all of these problems.",
        "That's an awfully high bar.",

        "And he uses it as an attack point against Obama, another guilt-by-association because he was a lawyer for Acorn, which he says was indicted in a number of states.",
        "And I guess I'd asked them the question, has Acorn ever been found to actually have violated any campaign law?",
        "Not somebody charged them with it.",
