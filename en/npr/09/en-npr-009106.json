        "The Open Content Alliance and the Internet Archive are with working with libraries around the world to take images of the pages of books and then put those through a set of processing steps so that you can run optical character recognition so that you can search those books and create searchable downloadable, printable books that look like the original book.",

        "This is a legal problem you're working through.",
        "Yes, but it's working out pretty well in the orphan works and out-of-print works area.",
        "There was a call by the copyright office to get people's input as to what should we do with these works because in 1976, the United States Congress expanded copyright massively and it caused a problem especially in this digitization world where we don't want things just on physical bookshelves and book in libraries anymore, we want them online.",

        "A couple of examples are digitizing the archive of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, which is the predecessor organization to the World Trade Organization.",

        "I'm against the locking up of the public domain.",
        "The public domain is small enough as it stands.",
        "What we want is people to thrive on it, use it, cut it up, make new and different things.",
        "And there are commercial projects out there that are putting restrictions on the public domain and that I think is not something that we in the library world should really put ourselves behind.",
        "The other thing, another interesting project we're working with is with our partners at Corpus Christi College Cambridge, digitizing manuscripts dating from the 6th century to the 15th century, illustrating the, essentially, the separate lineage of the Church of England from the Church of Rome.",
        "Those documents will be available on the Web, some of them shortly in good enough resolution for people to work on those manuscripts from wherever they happen to be in the world.",
        "And then, of course, the big - the big project is Google Book Search project.",
        "They have digitized well over a million titles to date, a great many of them public domain titles and they will be providing indexing for millions of other titles as this project proceeds.",
        "The contribution Stanford is making to that, presently, is supplying books from our collections, books that are either public domain or out of copyright.",
        "Books in amount of about anywhere from 1,500 to 3,000 books a day go over to Mountain View for scanning, and then they go through indexing and quality control processes, ultimately leading to both the indexing, which is the main thrust of the project, and in the cases of books where there are public domain then Google displays the pages.",
        "Is Google facing any copyright issues from scanning books that are still in copyright?",
        "Google has been sued by the Author's Guild and five publishers representing the Association of American Publishers.",
        "The scanning of copyrighted works in order to perform the indexing is the major issue and we have - the suit is in progress.",
        "Many of us have been asked to submit documents and are facing depositions and whatnot.",
        "It's a long complex process.",
        "I'm relatively sure that it's not going to be over soon.",
        "What is the point of it?",
        "The point of the project is this and I illustrate it in two different ways.",
        "The point is that we have locked up on in these books and in these big collections of books, as both Michael Hart and Brewster Kahle have demonstrated with their projects, a great deal of information and knowledge that is difficult to discover.",
        "It's difficult to discover because our ordinary cataloguing routines provide very brief descriptions and very brief numbers of subject catalog, subject entries to identify what's in the books."
