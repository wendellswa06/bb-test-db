        "So, when we digitized our card catalog at Stanford over the period '87 to '97, at the end of that period, we noticed that we're circulating a lot more books to the Stanford faculty and student body.",
        "That means that they were able to use the keyword indexing that we were providing just on those meta data, on those catalog entries to find more books of relevance.",
        "So, we think that if they're able to search these books word by word, they'll be able to discover lots more books of relevance, either in our collections or other collections.",
        "A side benefit of that project is that we are getting back from Google, digital files that we will preserve, we will preserve digitally to hedge against the factors of acid paper and overuse and so forth that ultimately destroys a great many books.",
        "Google has been open to criticism in the past about censorship.",
        "I'm recalling that agreement with China, in which Google agreed to censor information the Chinese did not want their people to read.",
        "Would that hold true of this project also?",
        "No.",
        "Have they said that they will no longer - in other words, let's say I search for a passage of a book about the Falun Gong group which China has been very vocal against and would Google allow people in China to see a passage of that book?",
        "Ira, I don't know the answer to the question.",
        "I do know that the Chinese have filtering services, un-services, perhaps and people, all working night and day to filter those kinds of inquiries anyway.",
        "It's probably not a Google function at all.",
        "It's probably a function of some larger state-run censoring operation in China.",
        "But as far as you know there is no agreement by Google to keep those kinds of requests outside their domain?",
        "As far as I know there's no such agreement.",
        "I've been asking Google for that and we haven't gotten a word back on that either."

        "Well, I think Michael Keller can answer some more about what's in the agreement between Stanford and Google.",
        "But there are restrictions between the University of California and Google such that the works can pretty much not be downloaded in bulk for - even for research and educational use by the general public.",
        "That basically Google will turn you off as they've told people or even if it's research and educational use of public domain materials from their servers, and they've restricted at least the University of California and University of Michigan from offering those works to the general public for bulk use.",
        "Michael Keller, is that true?",
        "It is true.",
        "But let's be sure to understand that Brewster's version of the ideal, while it is clearly desirable may be, so baldly spoken, the enemy of the good.",
        "The truth is that most citizens do not get the opportunity to read a great many public documents, indeed, including our own government documents.",
        "And these projects, all of them, but especially Google because of the indexing of the mass of materials, provide access so citizens can read.",
        "They can at least read the documents.",
        "And I believe there are some facilities for some of the documents to be downloaded one upon one for use.",
        "I think we have to look at how these projects are benefiting.",
        "It's certainly appropriate to have - to raise the bar, to raise expectations to make requests but the same time, we have to recognize that Google is making a fantastic investment, a gigantic investment in making these documents, which otherwise would not be seen at all - except by the few that could get to our libraries -visible to citizens all over the world.",
        "They must think they're going to get a return on it.",
        "These are very smart guys.",
        "They probably will get a return on it in the form of additional traffic to their site but - and they may get a return on it by appending advertisements to those entries that have to do with books that are for sale, presumably under agreement with the publishers.",
        "That return, of course, is a small price to pay which most of us don't pay at all for the ability to read and the ability to use that great big index.",
        "Brewster, any reply?",
        "I think let's focus on what the dream is and there are going to be some pieces for the commercial guys to go and make indexes and distribute information in new and different ways and I'm all for that.",
        "But the dream is universal access to all knowledge.",
        "It's building the great library and actually your conversation with the Encyclopedia of Life and their piece of that which is the Biodiversity Heritage Library, I think it's a very shining example of what we actually want to build here.",
        "The Biodiversity Heritage Library is scanning works from about 10 different libraries around the world of all the information about species to make that available on the World Wide Web for free download."
