        "Under the current law, a hundred years from now, that will be half a percent, it will be virtually nothing of the entire corpus of the human work that's in the public domain.",
        "Now in terms of Brewster's ideal, he and I agree on so much of almost everything that I almost hesitate to say, but the one difference we really have is that he doesn't - he talks about $300 million and Project Gutenberg has never spent a million dollars in doing everything because we have an army of 50,000 volunteers around the world that do all of our work.",
        "Our goal is for people to be able to actually own their own personal library in the same way that they own their own personal computer.",
        "I'm wearing around my neck a little four gigabyte RAM stick - flash drive, thumb drive, whatever you want to call them - and it will hold about 10,000 books.",
        "Two days ago, I bought three of these at one of the local box stores for under $100.",
        "That's enough space to hold all the books in the average United States public library, 30,000 books and the total weight is 1 ounce.",
        "No batteries needed, you just carry it with you.",
        "You can stick it in your iPod or anything else that has a USB port, it's just ready to go.",

        "You could put a thousand copies of the complete works of Shakespeare on here if that was your goal.",
        "And the same kind of thing for hardware, hardware.",
        "We bought a terabyte of outboard hard drive this week for $256.",
        "We bought a terabyte of inboard hard drive for $216.",
        "That's a thousand billion bytes, right?",
        "Yeah, it's enough to hold a million books uncompressed - I was using compression on my little RAM stick.",

        "What's the point you're trying to make here?",
        "Well, I'm answering the question that you asked Brewster, which was what's the ideal.",
        "And to me, the ideal is for everyone, by the year 2021, to be able to own a library - not of million books - a billion books.",
        "Now, let me run that by you slowly because everybody hates me when I use big numbers.",
        "But Brewster and Mr. Keller will tell you that there are 20-some-odd million books in the public domain.",
        "When we do half of those - and the rate will increase until we get to half of them - then we'll have to search the attics and basements harder - but we will get to 10 million of those relatively quickly.",
        "It would be faster every year.",
        "And that's with or without Google, with or without anybody, it's going to happen.",
        "Just look at how fast it's been growing already.",
        "Now, once we get to 10 million, all you have to do is translate every one of those books into a hundred different languages, and you have a billion-book library.",

        "Like, are you using multiple drives or tape or, you know, what is it that's going to stick around for decades or centuries?",
        "Well, I'd like to quote Linus Torvalds on that, the inventor of Linux.",
        "He said real men don't use backups.",
        "They put their stuff on FTP and let the whole world download it.",
        "Brewster, do you agree with that?",
        "We do believe in the idea of having multiple copies.",
        "If there's one lesson from the Library of Alexandria version one, it's don't just have one copy.",
        "So we've gone and made a copy of all of that we have and put it in, actually, the new Library of Alexandria in Egypt, and also a partial copy in Amsterdam.",
        "So the idea is to not just have things in one fault zone, say, in San Francisco, but say in the flood zone of Amsterdam and then the Middle East."

        "The other approach that we're using is what we called manage care for bits and bytes.",
        "We're very much focusing on preservation of individual bits, and we do expect this archive to migrate formats.",
        "And as operating systems and applications and data formats change, it involves spinning disks, it involves near-line tape, it involves offline tape.",

        "We've been doing this for 10 years, every two months.",
        "So a full public snapshot of every publicly available Web site and all the pages on them.",
