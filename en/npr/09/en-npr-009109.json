        "I think that's a terrific service and a great project.",
        "However, the publicly accessible citation is of great interest, because the publicly accessible part of the Web is really only something like 10 percent of everything that's available.",
        "We have to deal with and recognize the rights and interests of the creators and the publishers who put out information, having massaged it and marketed and generated it in some cases.",
        "And despite the fact that the current way that the copyright laws in America are written, that this material is going to be locked up for a very long time, something that I agree entirely with both Michael Hart and Brewster Kahle about, we have to find a way to bring in these other players.",
        "And the Google Book Search project is precisely trying to do that in order to provide deep access to works in which there are still copyright interests active.",
        "It's good to be able to see 10 percent.",
        "It's good to be able to see the public domain works.",
        "It's wildly important to be able to index and understand what's in works that are available for some fee or another, or available through a library in order to advance knowledge and advance study and teaching, and to serve small schools and small libraries and individuals in distant places that are distant from libraries.",
        "Oh, Michael Hart, you got the last word.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'm going to sneak in here for 30 seconds.",

        "That's the best backup you can have.",
        "No matter how many gateways are down, you're still going to find it.",
        "Now, in terms of this whole thing about copyright being locked away forever, I'm afraid Michael Keller was all too right about that.",
        "Every time a copyright is going to expire, especially for the Mouse, copyright becomes extended all of a sudden.",
        "So they tell us, if you leave this alone for 26 years, 28 years, 14 years, whatever the period was at the time, we'll let you have it after that period.",
        "But that period never comes.",

        "The copyright gets longer and longer.",
        "And unless something seriously changes, the trend of the last 300 years - you started with a 14-year copyright, is going to end up with a permanent copyright.",
        "Nothing will - I'm not quite sure that any copyright will ever expire in the United States ever again.",

        "I think there is that prospect.",
        "But at the same time, I know that the publishers and the Congress would like to do the right thing.",

        "I think that the copyright industry would continue to make its money, and I think there are some possibilities.",
        "But at the same time, I think we have to expect that as a social good, all those who create content should allow that content to be thoroughly indexed.",
        "And the active indexing of that content should not be a criminal act.",
        "Making information accessible - that's not making the pages necessarily accessible for free, but making the information about those pages and from those pages free, freely accessible, is an important public good.",

        "There's a high amount of interest in this particular cancer, which means there's a high amount of money, which means that there's a lot of research and sometimes it's going to disagree, and things keep changing.",

        "That's a great question, and the good news was a good combination of interaction between our risk management and our asset management professionals.",
        "And the bottom line was that they looked at those securities and said, for the underlying risk, we don't think the return is sufficiently high.",
        "And they made what was a very, very good, smart calculation.",
        "We were also helped by the fact that we are a privately held, not-for-profit company which means that we didn't have to chase incremental return to keep the quarter-to-quarter earning stream flowing.",
        "Presumably, people all over the financial sector here and abroad could have done the same thing?",
        "Presumably, they could have.",
        "But I think they had a range of incentives, which were perfectly legal and legitimate incentives, to meet quarter-to-quarter demands.",
        "And frankly, in many cases I think some of them are also underwriting some of those securities and marketing the securities, so there are a range of views.",

        "Is the volume of calls at least going down a little bit?",
        "The volume of calls has come off a little bit.",
        "The only thing I worry about, frankly, is when the market drops, our call volumes spike.",
        "And that tells me that people are staying glued to the screens worrying about the ups and downs of a very volatile market.",
        "And frankly, for my participants, I think they should be focused in on educating and teaching, and spending less time worried about the ups and downs of markets which are going to be beyond their control and certainly, in these troubled times, very volatile."
