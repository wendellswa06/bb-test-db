        "And I guess there is an implicit attitude from this party that if they get what they want or if they are catered to in a way that they'll be able to take care of the insurgency in their own way.",

        "For the large part, I guess, it would be but then, you know, we are hearing instances of voter intimidation.",

        "We also had a report from Kurdistan of at least one incident where about a hundred militia walked into a polling station and voted, but they refused to get their fingers dipped in ink, which basically is meant to stop them from voting anywhere else.",

        "The kind of uneasy relationship between the two has actually gone on for centuries.",
        "It has been most recently exacerbated by what they call the great western development program, where they encourage Han Chinese to go into places like Xinjiang and like Tibet and to start their own businesses and to create new lives.",
        "And many Uighurs believe that they have been disadvantaged by the influx of the Han Chinese, and also that their freedom of religion has been restricted, so that is a very sore spot for many of them.",
        "Now, the Chinese government is blaming a Uighur separatist group for this attack, called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement.",
        "What can you tell us about that group?",
        "There's a lot of controversy outside of China about how big and how sophisticated the East Turkestan Islamic Movement is.",
        "After September 11th, China pushed to have the East Turkestan Islamic Movement listed as a terrorist organization.",
        "And the United States did agree to list it as a terrorist organization.",
        "Terrorism experts who have been in Kashgar and in the Xinjiang province, though, say that there is little evidence that this group is a highly significant, highly organized terrorist organization.",
        "The East Turkistan Islamic Movement has not claimed responsibility, and officials here have not yet formally linked the group.",
        "This separatist group is saying, I believe, we shouldn't be part of China at all.",
        "Yes.",
        "The East Turkestan Islamic Movement has fought for an independent Islamic state.",

        "Rather, they just would like to have more autonomy and recognition of more rights in Xinjiang.",
        "What else are you hearing from people on the streets about these attacks and what followed the crackdown there?",
        "I think people are very frightened.",
        "Today, as we were walking around, many Uighurs really didn't want to talk to foreign media and certainly wouldn't allow their names to be used as we were trying to talk to them about what had happened and how they felt.",
        "We observed some special police doing house-to-house searches in the old city of Kashgar, which is a primarily Uighur neighborhood.",

        "How does that work?",
        "Well, of all the 228 total delegates in Texas to the Democratic National Convention, 126 will be decided by the primary vote on Election Day, and it's after that vote, at 17:15, 15 minutes after the polls close that the - what we're now calling the caucus system, the Texas Tuesday up or the primary caucus kicks in.",
        "And that's where the remaining 67 of the pledged delegates are selected.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, let's talk about those 126 primary delegates first.",
        "These are allotted through district and they're weighted differently.",
        "Those districts are weighted differently based on past turnout, is that right?",
        "That is correct.",
        "And that's where it gets problematic for the candidates.",
        "You have 31 state senate districts in Texas.",
        "Not all of them are created equal.",
        "As you noted, it was weighted by past general election turnout.",
        "And in some districts, for example, let's take Austin, the capital, Travis County, that Senate, District 14 is allotted eight national delegates.",
        "Up here in Dallas, District 23 is allotted six.",
        "Now, most of the districts, almost fully half of the 31, have four national delegates, and that becomes very problematic for a candidate in most of the Hispanic areas or four-delegate districts.",
        "And why is it problematic?",
        "Well, because in order to peel off a net vote, in order to get three-to-one, a candidate will essentially have to get a vote total in that Senate district that exceeds 62 percent of the popular vote, otherwise it's a tie and it awash.",
        "So you have to do really well to get that one extra delegate.",
        "Yes.",
