        "We want to ask him about, for example, why was he opposed to the extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1982?",

        "That's right.",
        "When a woman goes in for a mammogram, her breasts are compressed, and an X-ray image is taken of the breast.",
        "That can either be with film technology, an analog technology, or with digital.",
        "And so why is there so much room for difference in terms of how one radiologist may see it versus another, how a computer may read it versus a human being?",
        "Why is there so much grey area?",
        "Well, what was exciting about mammography and what continues to be exciting about mammography is we can see cancers before they will become evident to the woman by feeling her breast or to her doctor by feeling the breast tissue, and that's why we've seen an impact in decreasing breast cancer mortality.",
        "We can find these cancers earlier with mammography, but it's an imperfect tool.",
        "It takes an X-ray, but the density of a cancer may be very similar to the density of some women's breast tissue, so being able to sort out what might be a cancer and what's normal breast tissue or normal changes in the breast can be challenging.",
        "And this is where the different age guidelines come in, because younger women have denser breasts?",
        "I think there are two reasons.",
        "One, younger women do tend to have denser breast tissue; but also, younger women who do develop breast cancer, those cancers tend to grow more quickly.",
        "So you were one of the authors of the American Cancer Society guidelines that said high-risk women should get both mammograms and MRIs.",
        "Who, first of all, is in that high-risk pool?",
        "Well, the women that are in this very high-risk pool are women that have a known genetic mutation, or women who have a first-degree relative with a mutation, or women who have a 20-percent greater lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.",
        "That might be based on their family history or on other factors - if they received radiation to their chest while between the ages of 10 and 30.",
        "So there's a fairly heterogeneous group of women, but what we're looking for are those that if we predicted their risk of breast cancer over their lifetime, it would be greater than 20 percent.",
        "Joanne, MRIs are more expensive than mammograms.",
        "Are insurance companies covering them?"

        "Well, right now, I think that some are because they're really being done for high-risk women, but there's no legislation like there is for regular mammograms.",
        "Do you see that coming?",
        "I haven't heard of anything about that coming, but it'll be interesting to see if it develops.",
        "You know, this idea of using it as a screening tool is new, and it'll be interesting to see how they react to that.",
        "It took about - it wasn't really until the early '80s that we saw any legislation at all for regular mammograms, which had been around for a couple of decades by then.",
        "So it did take a while for that to happen with regular mammograms.",
        "And so what about the women, Dr. Lehman, who are at some risk but not necessarily high risk, who maybe have one relative with a history of cancer but not a lot and don't necessarily have a genetic component, who are concerned - I think probably most American women are concerned about breast cancer - but don't necessarily fall into that high-risk group?",
        "Well, in the recommendations, we've divided women into three groups.",
        "The very-high risk we've talked about.",
        "Women who are at average risk, as far as we know, there is nothing that is placing them at increased risk.",
        "They have no personal history, they have no relatives with breast cancer.",
        "For those women truly at average risk, we recommend that they not undergo MRI.",
        "There is a middle group that you're talking about where currently there's not sufficient evidence for us to recommend strongly for or against.",
        "For those women, we think it's important that they talk to their doctors and weigh the potential benefits and harms of adding MRI.",
        "At this time, we don't recommend those women do undergo annual MRI, but it may be something they want to talk to their doctors about.",

        "I had a patient who had an annual physical exam and an annual mammogram, and her previous mammogram was in July 2006.",
        "She came in January 2007 saying that she thought her breasts felt a little unusual.",
        "So even though only six months had elapsed, I went ahead and got another mammogram plus an ultrasound, both of which were reported as completely negative.",
        "A month later, she continued to feel that the breast was somehow different even though the physical exam there was absolutely no finding.",
        "So in February, we got an MRI.",
        "The MRI of the breast didn't pick up the lesion, but it did pick up an ancillary lesion, and that was needle biopsied and showed breast cancer.",
        "So this is an excellent example of a negative mammogram, negative ultrasound, and a positive MRI.",
        "Al, thanks for your call.",
        "Dr. Lehman, that's the kind of story that probably scares a lot of women, that, you know, despite every test possible, it took this one patient coming back and back and back saying something doesn't quite feel right."

        "Right.",
        "I think that the work-up in that situation was very good, and we always encourage our patients to remember that they're partners with us.",
        "That this woman knew that her breast felt different, and she stayed in communication with her doctor to say, you know, I know the imaging has been negative, but this doesn't feel right.",
        "And sometimes in those cases we'll do a biopsy.",
        "It sounds like for this particular woman, I'm not sure if the area that she was feeling that was different ended up being the cancer or if the MRI found something that was unrelated and incidental.",
        "But, at any rate, going through and being very careful to sort of, quote, \"\"see things through to the end\"\" I think is important because none of our tools are perfect, neither clinical breast exam, mammography, ultrasound or MRI.",

        "Well, there are a few things.",
        "One, there is only one tool that we have that is proven to decrease breast cancer mortality.",
        "That is mammography.",
        "Screening mammography is, yes, imperfect, but it is absolutely without any question the best tool we have to date with proven reduction in breast cancer mortality.",
        "So we're very concerned that until we have something that can replace that proven effective tool, that we throw it out and leave many women with cancers undiagnosed and then end up in a situation where our breast cancer mortality starts to increase in the U.S.",
