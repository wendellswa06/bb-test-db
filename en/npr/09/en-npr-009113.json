        "So you deal with a lot of breast cancer patients.",
        "What's your recommendations on mammograms to most of them?",
        "Well, I think, as Dr. Lehman pointed out, there's no question that mammography really remains the gold standard at this time for diagnosing asymptomatic patients.",
        "It's a screening tool for patients who are not symptomatic for breast cancer.",
        "Really what we've been talking about, I think today, are you know, some of the subtle changes that, as Joanne Silberner pointed out, that will sort of bring our - probably narrow our guidelines or focus them a little bit.",
        "But mammography, without question, remains the screening tool of choice.",
        "We do certainly, for some patients, add in other imaging techniques.",
        "We also add in, for some people, more frequent examinations of the breast, etc. So it is individualized based on the individual patient, their cancer history and their individual risk.",
        "Do you think with this new study about MRIs that you will see more women come in requesting them?",
        "I already have.",
        "Oh really?",
        "Yeah, it's no question that those kind of things, you know, that sort of become quite a high profile in public knowledge really are - they become questions for our patients.",
        "You know, the issue with Elizabeth Edwards a couple of weeks ago certainly brought out anxieties in a lot of patients as well.",
        "So our patients, you know, read the news.",
        "They hear about it.",
        "And so I've had a lot of questions about MRI.",
        "You know, what we point out, as - I think as Dr. Lehman said, is that this is a new tool and how we're going to ultimately use it I don't think we have defined yet.",
        "That's true.",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255, email us, talk@ npr.org.",
        "And well, Ken, there's big news this week, not only Georgia, you're now a blogger, who would have thunk it?",
        "We certainly know there are some populations where there's definitely a benefit for using MRI.",
        "The group that we've been using it in for the longest period of time is in sort of the - is in the group that - in the American Cancer Society guidelines was the BRCA mutation carriers, those who have a mutation that puts them at a very high risk for breast cancer, a risk that's, you know, about ten times higher than the general population.",
        "So using a screening tool that is more costly, more complex, is worthwhile in that population.",
        "You know, as Becky called before and said, why don't we do MRI on everybody?",
        "And you know, it's not a piece of cake.",
        "You have to get an IV started.",
        "You have to have an injection.",
        "It is more than ten times more costly than mammography.",
        "And I think we certainly know that in people who aren't at high risk, you're going to open a Pandora's box.",
        "You'll see things that turn out not to be cancer but lead to things that are not particularly pleasant, like biopsies and more frequent exams and more frequent imaging."

        "We have not in studies to date on thermography shown any overall benefit in patients.",
        "So it's an area that needs more research, but it is not something that should be used clinically outside of a research study.",
        "Are there other technologies in the pipeline?",
        "There are.",
        "I think that what we know now the most of is mammography, and especially digital mammography.",
        "That's something that still many women in the U.S.",
        "do not have the benefit of, although we do have clear evidence that digital mammography will be improved over film screen in women who are younger and with dense breast tissue.",
        "I think MRI is receiving, as it should be, a lot of research and focus and how best to use it in clinical populations.",
        "And then we're very excited to see other methods, methods of - in the future we might have blood tests or ways to assess again which women are at very high risk.",

        "When I ask this young lady how her mother's doing, she mentions that - when I ask her if she's had a mammogram to protect herself, she says her physician says, oh, don't bother with that - this is her terminology - until you're in your 40s.",
        "And I say to her, well, why should you wait?",
        "Why not start now?",
        "And I wonder, is her physician correct - not being personal to her physician, of course, but in general, perhaps physicians are giving this advice still - or do I have something worthwhile to say?",

        "Thanks Ron.",
        "Dr. Armstrong?",
        "Yeah, well, you know, as you know, our general recommendations in the American Cancer Society guidelines include starting routine screening mammography at the age of 40.",
        "For women who have a family history of breast cancer, and Ron's colleague would now meet that criteria, we sometimes modify those recommendations and would give consideration to starting mammography at an age ten years younger than the earliest person in the family with breast cancer.",
        "Now, as it turns out, since her mother had breast cancer in her 60s, that would make the recommendations be in the 50s, and that's already going to fall within the guidelines.",
        "So we would probably not, unless there's other family members who have early onset breast cancer before the age of 50, would not recommend screening - routine screening with mammography before the age of 40.",
        "I think it should also be pointed out that very young women like this, who are around age 30, have dense breasts and mammography is going to be less sensitive in them, and you're now going to extend by ten years the period of time that they will be exposed to the radiation of mammographies.",
        "So I think that her doctor was right in his recommendation that she should follow the general guidelines.",
        "Given her mother's diagnosis, you know, she may get a little more attention, but that probably wouldn't include starting mammography at an age of 30.",
        "Well, I think the situation is probably a familiar one.",
        "If this woman sees what her mother is going through, is nervous about the disease herself and is told that she doesn't need to get any sort of a test for 15, 20 years, that's also 15, 20 years of getting sort of nervous.",
        "Do you find that women use mammography almost like flossing their teeth, that it's a preventative measure that makes them feel better?",
        "You know, I think in some cases people can be reassured by a mammogram.",
        "I think there are other situations in which women - you know, I have women who examine their breasts every day, they're so anxious about it, and I told them it's like watching your children grow.",
        "If you look at them every day, you don't see it, but you know, when somebody hasn't seen them in a year, they'll see changes.",
        "And I think, you know, being overly anxious about breast health, doing exams too frequently, getting imaging too frequently or too soon at an age when we don't know that it really helps reduce mortality is one of those things that probably requires more discussion with healthcare providers and reassurance.",
        "What I usually - and what we frequently see is, as when women approach the age of their family members with cancer is when the anxiety level increases.",
        "And fortunately Ron's friend and co-worker is still several decades away.",
        "Joanne?",
        "One of the questions - this was a woman with a history, but this issue of women in their 40s, this has gone back and forth so many times, it seems to me now that most of the groups recommend it for women in their 40s, and yet the American College of Physicians seems to recently be backing off, saying patients and physicians should talk to each other rather than us issuing a blanket recommendation.",
        "Are they just outlaws?",
        "Does everybody else think yes in your 40s?",
        "You know, you're right that when the original data came out - and Dr. Lehman can certainly speak to this as well - there were data that said that mammography in the 40s really was not particularly helpful.",
        "These are data now that go back, you know, more than two decades, and the quality of mammography at that time, the quality of the interpretation and the reading was really inferior to now.",
        "And so these sorts of evaluations do need to be updated, and that's really what the American College of Physicians recent paper did, was to try and update some of that."

        "I think that perhaps the most important issue with this was that they were really looking not so much at the diagnosis, but of the other things that can happened in somebody who doesn't have cancer when you do a screening test.",
        "And that really falls into the risk category as opposed to the benefit category.",
        "And really what they said was in this - from their data, evaluating the literature - that in the decade of the '40s, from age 40 to 59, that there probably is pretty close to a balance between those two.",
        "And frankly that's not surprising since cancer is - breast cancer included - is generally a disease of aging.",
        "The older you get, the more likely you are to have the thing you're screening for, and therefore the test is less likely to pick up the sort of red herrings and more likely to pick up what you're looking for.",

        "We do know what matters, the quality of the exam that's performed.",
        "But I'm very concerned that women are going to think that this is new information, new data that is suggesting that women not be screened in their forties.",
        "I think that would be a very unfortunate outcome.",
        "This has been the first year in the history of, you know, the past 15 years of mammography where we're seeing fewer women undergo screening mammography this year than last year and the years before.",
        "That concerns us.",
        "It's very exciting, the new methods that we have, but this is still our gold standard.",
        "This is the way we've decreased breast cancer mortality.",

        "Dr. Armstrong?",
        "Well, I think, you know, whenever you do a screening test, whatever it's for, you end up having to sort of assess the patient's understanding of what the screening test is for, their willingness to go along with the findings of the screening tests.",
        "And so certainly there are guidelines, but you really individualize your patient care.",
