        "Yes, to some degree.",
        "That's how it's being interpreted here.",
        "And perhaps also for the military, which spoke out against Erdogan's candidate for president two months ago that touched off a crisis, which led to these early elections, which we just had today.",
        "The secularists, they ran on a platform that basically accused Erdogan of being an Islamist.",
        "And they accused him of trying to transform Turkey's very strict secular system of government.",
