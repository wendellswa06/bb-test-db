        "Can the Republican Party get back into power if it is perceived as the anti-gay, anti-abortion and anti-immigration party?",
        "Well, I don't think that's how it really is perceived.",
        "I think the problem with the Republican Party, it advertised one thing and delivered something else.",
        "When it pushed that it was going to balance budgets and police corruption, it was going to serve competently, that it was going to make sure that people could keep even a greater portion of their paycheck, and that it was going to push government out to the local levels and not centralize so much in Washington.",
        "Well, it did everything exactly opposite of that.",
        "And like any product, when you advertise something and you deliver something different, the next time people reach for another product on the shelf, and that's exactly what's happened in the last two election cycles.",
        "Well, you're talking about big government conservatives, which a lot of people find an oxymoron, and I think you're going to find a lot of agreement in the Republican Party about smaller government and lower taxes.",
        "It's those social issues that seem to be divisive and which a lot of people looking at what happened in November say, well, that's what cost John McCain and Sarah Palin a lot of votes among independents in places like Pennsylvania.",
        "Well, actually, it's not.",
        "If you look at California, they voted for the marriage amendment, as did Florida.",
        "Barack Obama won both states.",
        "The marriage issue has been on the ballot in 30 states.",
        "It's won in all 30 states.",
        "This country is still not exactly pro-abortion.",
        "There are a lot of people that think there ought to be some legal avenues for it, but I don't know of many people who just think abortion is a wonderful idea.",
        "And also, the pro-life movement is beginning to do a better job of helping people to understand that it's not just about abortion.",
        "One of the key chapters in my new book is really about that, and it's called, \"\"What about created equal do you not understand?\"\" And it's the fact that real pro-life people are not anti-abortion.",
        "They just believe in the dignity, the worth, and they believe in the intrinsic value of every single human being.",
        "That's true whether a person is an 8-month-old unborn child, or an 80-year-old woman undergoing hospice care.",
        "Yet, the Republican Party platform clearly calls for the repeal of Roe v.",
        "Wade, and that is, well, not likely to happen, at least for the next four years.",
        "Probably not.",
        "But that doesn't mean that the issue goes away.",
        "There were people who thought slavery was a great idea, that it was OK for one person to own another person.",
        "And people argued for that.",
        "Really, if you look at the pro-life movement, many of us don't believe that a person should own another person, that one person can devalue another person to the point that we think their life is no longer worth living.",
        "And when we decide that a life is able to be terminated because it represents to us an inconvenience or an economic interruption, then we really have crossed sort of in a new definition of when things are right or when they're wrong.",
        "And if, in fact, we can decide that an unborn child represents an economic inconvenience or social interruption, and therefore we have the right to terminate that child, what, then, keeps us from having a future situation where the people of our children's generation decide that in our older years, when we're in our 70s and 80s and maybe 90s, we represent an economic inconvenience and a social interruption to our children's generation.",
        "They have every right, then, to terminate us because, after all, we've taught them that that's exactly what's permissible.",
        "And the way you stated this sounds like an issue of principle from which you would not waver.",
        "Is, from the party's point of view - are pro-choice Republicans acceptable?",
        "Are pro-choice Republicans acceptable as part of a national ticket?",
        "Well, people don't have to agree on every issue in order to be a part of the Republican Party.",
        "But like any political party, there are majorities that set in motion the platform.",
        "Not every Democrat is pro-abortion.",
        "There are pro-life Democrats and they still can be Democrats.",
        "That doesn't mean that they're thrown out of the party, although maybe they are.",
        "I don't know.",
        "My point is that there are some fundamental things that bring Republicans together.",
        "I think that historically, in the last 30 years, Republicans have been predominantly pro-life.",
        "I'm glad of that.",
        "It's caused a lot of people to come to the party.",
        "Many of the so-called Reagan Democrats, many pro-life Catholics and others found their home politically in the Republican Party because they could not just see themselves voting for people who did not respect each and every human life.",
        "And you're right, for some of us it is a principle issue.",
        "It's not a political issue.",
        "For me, it's never been political.",
        "You know, I may lose elections over it, but this is something that I hold as deeply and as dear as people would have believed 150 years ago - believed that the idea of owning another human being was also a moral issue, not just a political one.",

        "But what would the Republican convention have looked like if he had picked Lieberman or Ridge?",
        "Well, if he had picked Lieberman, it would have been a very empty room.",
        "He would have had the place to himself.",
        "It would have been a disaster.",

        "He talked to party chairmen across the country, talked to key Republican leaders, and he said, what do you think, would it be OK?",
        "And I don't know of a single person who told him anything other than, you've got to be kidding.",
        "And I think the pushback was so incredibly strong that by Monday of that week he gave up, and then he went to Sarah Palin and selected her.",
        "And when he did, frankly, she brought a lot of energy and excitement to the base of the party, because there was some level of relief that he had picked a pro-life running mate and somebody that did, in fact, relate to a large portion of the Republican base.",
        "One more from Ken, then let's check in with some callers on the line.",

        "Well, you know, I'm never going to say that it was better for us to lose an election, because I could never come to that point.",
        "I think it would have been a disastrous election, and the margin would have been a far greater spread had he picked Joe Lieberman, because a lot of people would have simply said, you know what, we might as well just vote for the Democrats.",
        "In fact, I'll be honest with you, had he picked Joe Lieberman, I would have voted for Senator McCain in the November election because I'd pledged that I would support the nominee regardless of who it was.",
        "I would not have spoken at the convention, and I would not have gone out and actively campaigned for him.",

        "I think it's arguable, but there may be points at which we would finally say there should not be a death penalty.",

        "Interestingly, the most recent analysis of the election shows that younger voters did not vote in any greater percentage than they voted four years ago.",
