        "Is it OK then?",

        "Would you be in favor of civil unions that would provide for same-sex couples to have, for example, the rights to visit each other when they're sick in the hospital, that sort of thing, the kind of thing that President-elect Obama supports?",
        "People generally can do a power of attorney and have all the rights that they want in some states where they've done civil unions.",
        "That's been the idea that that's going to solve it all as soon as they get it, then they say what we really want is marriage.",

        "I think it's typically been sort of the beginning toward moving to marriage, and particularly, in light of the fact that through other legal means, people can have visitation rights in the hospital, can have survivor benefits, and people have a right to do that.",
        "But if we're moving towards changing the definition of marriage or family, I have a problem with it.",

        "I think it was a simple matter of wanting everybody to have to play by the same rules.",

        "Can you expand on that a little bit?",
        "Well, it's a pretty minor part of the book.",
        "I mean, it's 240 pages, and I think there's a few references to Mitt Romney, mostly in the context of explaining why there was tension.",
        "And it wasn't just with Mitt Romney and myself.",
        "It was Mitt Romney and John McCain, Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney and most of the other candidates.",
        "And so, in the spirit of candor and explanation, tried to talk about why that existed.",
        "But the real focus of the book is not looking back, it's looking forward.",
        "And I think proportionally, it's more like a car where you have a rearview mirror in which you can glance backwards, but you have a lot more glass in the windshield, and that's - the focal point is looking ahead.",
        "I'd say that's really where the book is.",
        "The reason I called it \"\"Do the Right Thing\"\" is because I think that frankly, we need to understand that government starts with each of us individually.",
        "The best government of all is self-government, and so that's really the focus on the book.",
        "Some of the reviewers picked up on that and even the reviewer Michael Shera(ph), whose review was the basis of a lot of other of the commentaries.",
        "It was interesting.",
        "Many of the people who had talked about the whole Mitt Romney thing had never read the book.",
        "They read Michael Shera's review.",
        "If they'd read all the way to the end, Michael Shera said this was a very small part of the book.",
        "It wasn't the main focus.",
        "And Governor, just looking ahead quickly, when you were in Georgia, did you run into anybody who was not running for president in 2012?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Yeah, I don't know of anybody that said they were at that point.",
        "I don't think anybody wants to say they are, because four years ago all the people who were touted as the front-runners in the early stages, particularly the Republican primary, didn't even make it: Bill Frist and George Allen and Rudy Giuliani.",
        "And on the Democrats' side, Hillary was unbeatable.",
        "Nobody was going to get near her.",
