        "He's a very sort of an unflappable guy.",
        "He really knows the law.",
        "He can speak calmly about all kinds of legal issues.",
        "He can really talk circles around the senators.",
        "And I actually think there's a few areas where he actually said a little more than some of the Democrats think.",
        "He sort of distanced himself from Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas on the question of whether you are an originalist.",
        "That's a potentially very important matter because there are a lot of questions that come up to the Supreme Court about equal rights for gays and lesbians.",

        "How much power does the president have?",
        "And John Roberts continued to say that he likes the Youngstown case from 1953 and Justice Jackson, and that's sort of the famous case of where the Supreme Court reigned in the president and said, `President Truman went too far by seizing the steel mills during the Korean War.",
        "And Roberts said that two or three times and explained his view on that, and so I took it that he was telling them that `I'm not somebody who believes the president has this endless power as commander in chief, that sometimes the president's power can be reigned in by the courts.'",
        "My guest is David Savage, Supreme Court reporter for the Los Angeles Times.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Have you ever noticed anybody lined up to vote with a big hunk of corn beef in their hand?",
