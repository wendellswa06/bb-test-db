        "He was a spy for the British within the IRA for about a decade and a half.",

        "He's the son of Italian immigrants and he's head of what's known in the IRA as the nutting squad.",
        "What was that?",
        "Well, in northern Irish slang the nut is the head, and so the nutting squad, when they found a spy or a snitch, they would nut him by shooting him twice in the brain, and so they were sort of an internal security unit who would comb through the IRA ranks looking for a mole.",
        "And here was this guy in their midst who is a mole.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean it was a brilliant strategic maneuver.",
        "It set him up such that he almost couldn't be discovered because anytime there was a suspicion of double-dealing, it was him that would be reported to so he was able to cover his tracks or finger someone else, whatever he needed to do to keep his cover.",
        "Now, what's intriguing about the stories of both of these men, Scapiticci and Fulton, is how they keep their cover by continuing to kill.",
        "That's what's different about what the British did in Northern Ireland.",
        "Typically you think of a spy as someone who goes out, eavesdrops, gathers information, collects it and then reports back, whereas the British allowed their agents to become part of the organization, the IRA, to become active members and even to rise up to become leaders.",
        "The only difference between these agents and the terrorists that they were working against was that they, you know, called home after a mission.",
        "It opens up a gray area, in particular for the government.",
        "There's this one example where Fulton takes a trip to New York sponsored by his British intelligence handlers but he's going there to actually get bomb technology for the IRA."

        "David, the Judiciary Committee spent a lot of time trying to discern exactly what kind of chief justice Roberts would be.",
        "There was an interesting exchange on that that we're going to listen to now.",
        "We're going to hear Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, and Durbin is trying to find out whether Roberts would treat the wealthy, who often have better legal representation, any different than the less fortunate who may not have the same quality of representation.",
        "Let's hear that tape now.",
        "Is it important enough for you to say, `In some instances, I will not use my skills as a lawyer because I don't believe that that is a cause that is consistent with my values and belief'?",
        "That's what I have been asking of.",
        "Well, and the--I had someone ask me in this process--I don't remember who it was--but somebody asked me, you know, `Are you going to be on the side of (technical difficulties)?",
        "And you obviously want to give an immediate answer, but as you reflect on it, if the Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little guy is going to win in court before me.",
        "But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then the big guy's going to win, because my obligation is to the Constitution.",
        "David, did that answer, do you think, satisfy the Democrats who have been trying to push Judge Roberts to reveal himself more?",
        "No, I wouldn't think it would, but it was a classic and I'm glad you played it, Lynn, because it's what he said in a whole series of questions, which is, `Senator, my job is to follow the law.",
        "They would say, `Don't you think your job is to do justice?",
        "And he'd say, `No, Senator, my job is to follow the law.",

        "Roberts' view is much more that his oath is to follow the law as he understands the law.",
        "We heard him doing that again with both Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Charles Schumer, that emphasis again on the law.",
        "Here's another piece of tape.",
        "Let's listen to this.",
        "I appreciate that it's only been a little more than two years, but you do have 50 opinions.",
        "You can look at those.",

        "You may think they're not enough, you may think you need more of a sample; that's your judgment.",
        "But I think if you've looked at what I've done since I took the judicial oath, that should convince you that I'm not an ideologue.",
