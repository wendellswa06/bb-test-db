        "They had devised a method where they could wirelessly detonate bombs by using a photo-flash, but the problem with that was is it could be set off by any bright light, headlights at night or a tourist taking a photo, the flash could set off the bomb prematurely.",
        "So, they figured out a way to dial in a specific frequency that would set the bomb off.",

        "So the really only option you have is to follow through with the killing.",

        "It's hard to speak for them, but with Fulton, for instance, he said early on that he had more satisfaction than regret, because the way I term it in the story is that he was engaging in a calculus of souls, saying, you know, if I save 3,000 people by killing 300 or 30 or 3, then I've done the right thing.",
        "But as I spent more time with him there seemed to be some cracks in that façade and I asked him would someone have been able to serve the greater good by killing him when he started out, and he just very flatly said yes, it could've served the greater good if I had died, which really surprised me.",

        "The grand jury will be given a chance to review that and--but before they do, they will be charged by the prosecutor on what the operative legal principles are, essentially what the elements of the crime are; perhaps the grand jury will have questions about that.",
