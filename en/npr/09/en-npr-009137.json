        "Now, Imelda would deny this.",
        "She has declared that her current net worth is a measly $22 million.",

        "But Russian President Vladimir Putin told a Russian journalist that many of his most picturesque media appearances: shooting a tranquilizer dart into a tiger, who appeared about to pounce; tagging a wounded snow leopard; and wearing a feathery, white suit to pilot a glider to guide a group of cranes south for the winter, were staged.",
        "Of course, there are excesses, he told Masha Gessen in Bolshoi Gorod.",
        "But they were constructive deceits, he said, because they called attention to endangered wildlife.",
        "Now, a lot of Russians had been skeptical about President Putin's highly publicized displays of environmental daring.",
        "They thought the tiger looked a little glassy-eyed, and suggested he might have been trucked in from a zoo.",
        "But I thought up these tigers myself, Mr. Putin said.",
        "Twenty other countries where tigers live also started taking care of them.",
        "The leopards were also my idea.",

        "Well, of course, they were planted, he said.",
        "Why did I dive?",
        "Not to show off my gills, but to make sure people learn history.",
        "Of course it was a set-up.",
        "Actually, if President Putin has gills, I'd say he's entitled to show them off.",
        "If an American politician confessed to having gills, we'd see an attack ad that went: Can an aquatic organism really represent your interests in Washington, D.C.?",
        "There was a joke in the old Soviet Union about the two state-run Moscow newspapers, Pravda and Izvestia, whose names meant Truth and News.",
        "There is no truth in news, Russians used to say to each other, and there is no news in truth.",
        "There are many who charge Mr. Putin's state-run media may have restored those times, when Russians don't turn to the news for news, so much as clues to what people in power expect them to think."
