        "After a year, Kramer found the volume of their brains actually increased.",
        "And that translated into a better memory.",
        "Kramer points to earlier research that found significant changes in the brains of rodents when they exercised.",
        "It increases the number of new neurons, the computational factories in the brain; it increases the effectiveness of connections between different brain regions; and also increases the blood supply to various regions of the brain.",
        "So one more reason to get up and get moving.",
