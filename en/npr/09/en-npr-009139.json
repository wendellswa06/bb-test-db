        "Well, for two reasons.",
        "First, Kate Byroade is proud of the fact that she has surrounded herself with all kinds of diversity.",
        "She lives in a diverse neighborhood.",
        "She attends a diverse church.",
        "Her kids go to diverse Girl Scout troops; that's really important to her.",
        "But there's a different kind of - I guess, more complicated pride that's based on family lore.",
        "She's always known that her family has owned slaves, in the South.",
        "Where the pride comes in is the fact that the family took some sort of comfort in the idea that the slaves that worked for them were treated better than most; that their slaves were treated well.",
        "This is a story that she heard over and over again, especially from her Southern grandmother.",
        "So there's a lifelong financial impact from being stuck and struggling early in your career, when employers are forming judgments about you.",
        "But beyond that, the character of generations really can change.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "The Shah of Iran - now, there's a man who did not have an easy time finding asylum after the Iranian Revolution, even though he was dying of cancer.",
        "Where did he finally end up?",
        "Well, he is the record holder for being kicked out of the most countries.",
        "He first got asylum in Egypt, and then Morocco, the Bahamas, Mexico of course, the United States for an operation, Panama, Egypt again.",
        "So it was like a game of diplomatic hot potato, or hot lamb kabob, perhaps.",
        "So, A.J., do you think we will be compared Edward Snowden to the shah?",
        "I mean, he's having a hard time finding a home.",
        "Yeah, well, as far as I understand it, he does have some options in Latin America.",
        "So, he will be following in the footsteps of O.",
        "Henry and Leon Trotsky.",
        "A.J.",
        "Jacobs is an author.",
        "He is an editor at Esquire magazine, and he is an occasional know-it-all on our program.",

        "But the impact went way beyond pocketbook issues.",
        "American families were restructured, hemlines on skirts lengthened, and politics was transformed.",
        "In his new book, Don Peck shows how all these economic shocks affected the nation in finances, jobs and demographics, yes, but also shifts of culture, politics and the psyche of the nation.",
        "Aside from having less money in the bank, call and tell us about the unexpected ways the great recession has changed your life.",

        "And at times over the past few days, it seems a pity we've already used up that panic word as a title for one of these events.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "It certainly seems that way, you know.",
        "But I think the last few days really confirmed for me - and I'm sure for most of your listeners - the sentiment that, absent aggressive actions to change things, actions we have not yet been taking, we're nowhere near the end of this period.",
        "You know, I think the markets, in part, were simply ahead of the economy, which has shown very little sign of recovery.",

        "Yet this deal does it exactly the wrong way.",
        "The debt is a problem in the U.S.",
        "We need to address it in the long run.",
        "We need to do things now to make sure that the debt will be lower once the economy is healthy again.",
        "But cutting the deficit in the short run, moving towards austerity right now is a mistake that we've made again and again in the depths of recession in our history, and it simply doesn't work.",
        "I think the market plunge is - in some small part, at least - a referendum on that.",
        "Well, the aforementioned Panic of 1893, we didn't have the kind of governmental tools that you're talking about now.",
        "We did later, in 1929, and President Hoover famously said no, we need to balance the budget.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And we all know what happened then.",
        "There was a secondary crash, though, that I think is maybe even more apt for our times right now, and that's 1937.",
        "When you - it's funny.",
        "Whenever we have a big crash and things turn bearish, people become more money-conscious, more conservative, and they become much more concerned about the size of the debt.",

        "We saw it in the early '80s.",

        "You know, jobs were still not plentiful in that year, though they were coming back.",
        "And people were becoming more and more concerned about years of government debt.",
        "A large majority of the population was surveyed as saying the budget absolutely had to be balanced that year.",
        "So in 1937, the government raised taxes, cut spending, the market plunged, unemployment rose again to 19 percent, and it took five more years to recover.",
        "And really, the Second World War, when, of course, deficit spending was all the rage.",
        "That's what got us out of the Depression.",
        "But I wanted to talk - well, we'll talk more about some of the ways out of the crisis a little bit later, but I wanted to talk about some of the lessons you derived from studies of those previous eras.",
        "You write in your book: Once the character of a generation is fully formed, it cannot be unformed.",
        "Once reactionary sentiments come out of the bottle, they are hard to put back in.",

        "At first, this seemed OK to me because it was OK to her.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And it's been harder for her to come to terms with it, as she's gotten older.",
        "But even going back to her childhood, this is something that she struggled with - you know, when the things that she saw in textbooks, or the stories that she saw in TV and shows like the miniseries \"\"Roots,\"\" didn't necessarily square with the genteel stories that she heard at her family dinner table.",
        "And there's one particular incident that really left a psychological mark on her.",

        "They were doing an assignment on immigrant ancestors, and she shared that story with us.",
        "We should listen.",
        "And so we're there in class and actually, one of my best friends is a Mayflower descendant, but I am a Jamestown descendant.",
        "And I let drop that my family had owned slaves.",
        "Now, this school that I attended was probably about, at the time, 60 or 70 percent African-American in its population.",
        "And I did not think that I was boasting.",
        "Well, how did her fellow students respond to this disclosure, Michele?",
        "Not well.",
        "And what really left the strongest impression on her was not necessarily what happened in the classroom, but what happened when she left the classroom.",
        "And she was on her way home from school; a group of black students from her school - and their older brothers and sisters from a nearby middle school - went looking for her.",
        "And those children decided that I was - I don't know what they decided.",
        "But they decided they had to chase me, and they had to scream at me, and they had to yell at me.",
        "And they literally, did that."

        "And in the end, this left a mark on her.",
        "But instead of making slavery this subject that is taboo - something she never wanted to talk about - it actually deepened her interest in trying to understand this historical chasm in America and, you know, something that became even more difficult and even more complicated for her, the more she learned about her family's history.",
        "Well, what happened when some relations of hers - as we know from her submission to the Race Card Project - actually went looking for the details?",
        "Well, as she expected, it really shook her up.",
        "A distant cousin discovered that when Kate Byroade's five-times great-grandmother arrived in the U.S.",
        "in the 1800s from Ireland, a black child - immediately upon her arrival - was purchased to serve as a handmaiden.",
