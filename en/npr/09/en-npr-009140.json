        "We don't really know what was going on.",

        "And the other theory is that there are people at the center who are going after Bo Xilai.",
        "Bo Xilai is a very interesting character because he, in Chongqing, has started this campaign of going back to, sort of, Maoist values - of valuing the working class, supporting state-owned enterprises - just as everyone else is moving towards the middle class.",
        "But he's trying to make use of this wealth gap and the gap between the new middle class and the urban poor in order to raise his profile.",
        "So all sorts of machinations going on, and on top of this, you know, 10 years ago, 15 years ago certainly, no one would have even heard of this.",
        "Now, you've got websites that are buzzing with this and Chinese microblogs.",
        "Three-hundred million people are on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and you can bet that they were tweeting about the intrigue, about what's going on, is he defecting, who's up, who's down, who's in, who's out.",
        "It's real palace intrigue in Chin at the moment.",
        "And is there - is this evidence that there is a - well, as you suggest, a neo-Maoist element within the party but also a more doctrinaire part of the party that s a challenge to the - what we generally describe as the reformist wing, headed by people like Vice President Xi?",
        "I think there is, actually, and there is - it's very interesting because since 1989 and the killings in Tiananmen Square, what we've had in China is really a very united leadership.",
        "What happened in '89 was that the standing committee of the politburo, the top seven, now it's nine, men split and - into the reformers and the hard-liners.",
        "The reformers under Zhao Ziyang did not want to shoot the students.",
        "The hard-liners under Li Peng and Deng Xiaoping did, and that is eventually what happened.",
        "Since then, the Chinese leadership has been very, very united.",
        "Now just - we're just seeing after more than 20 years just a slight hint of some kind of division of the way in which China should go."

        "They're voting with their feet, if you like.",
