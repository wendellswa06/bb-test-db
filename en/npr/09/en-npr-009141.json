        "And here we see another, yet another of these extraordinary contractions that seem - the tension of which is right at the heart of China's modern development.",

        "The 1970s undid that.",
        "Inflation was the problem, and young boomers learned the opposite lesson, that in fact thrift was for fools, that debts were the thing to do, that big mortgages made sense because inflation would eat them away.",
        "China needs to shift away from its export model, away from fueling its economy through exporting stuff and indeed from investing, investment into infrastructure and things and needs to move towards a more consumption-based economy.",
        "It's trying to get these new middle class and indeed the rural and the urban less-well-off to spend money to become more like an American continental consumption-based economy.",
        "Here's the problem, though: What happens if they do become consumers like us?",
        "You put your finger on it.",
        "The world cannot sustain that taking place.",
        "We can't have that.",
        "You know, we consume at shocking levels while we continue to criticize other countries, but Western countries are using energy, you know, in massive amounts of energy every day.",
        "So China has a dilemma.",
        "It's trying to solve it by going into green, high-tech, green technology.",
        "And the government is pouring money into this because it knows that it's simply not sustainable.",
        "It's not possible to go on not only with consumption in all of these environmental areas, consumption generally, the balance is very difficult for it to keep.",
        "But in environmental issues, it is trying to develop solar power, develop wind power, to develop - we saw the building of the Three Gorges Dam, the massive dam on the Yangtze, hydroelectric power.",
        "But in the end, they need the power, they need the energy.",
        "What do they always default to?",
        "Coal-fueled power stations.",
        "And that is the problem, how to wean them off those coal-fired stations and onto other forms of energy.",

        "I mean, there's enough corruption in the United States and Western Europe, you know, to keep us going, and we have the checks and balances.",

        "As soon as the economy really hit the problems, I mean massive problems in that case, you know, but China's not immune from massive problems, there was - I mean, people were on the streets within days, within weeks, and Suharto was gone.",

        "In China, the road still gets built, and lots of money goes into the pocket of the official.",
        "So, you know, inasmuch as one can have levels, you know, compare corruption, say it's not as bad as, at least in China, stuff is getting done.",
        "That's no - that's no excuse, but I think there's no doubt, despite that, it's going to continue to be a massive problem.",
        "And the credibility of the government and the legitimacy of the government is called into question every single day by those people who are not participating in the boom.",
        "And unless they do more about it in some way, which does mean moving towards more checks and balances, I think it could be a part of this growing anger that could cause the government many, many problems in months and years to come.",

        "Both Britain and the United States in recent years experienced a terrible bubble in real estate that burst and caused tremendous problems, still does in this country.",
        "There are people who believe China is in the midst of a still-inflating real estate bubble that could cause enormous problems.",
        "Yes.",
        "The asset bubbles are a real issue for the Chinese and especially real estate.",
        "Again, you know, structural issues - you've raised the phrase several times, Neal.",
        "There are big structural issues, one of which it goes to the heart of the financial set-up, the way that interest rates are set.",
        "You simply can't get any return on money that is deposited in a bank, so money pours into the real estate market, they - as one of the only places that you can invest.",
        "The government is trying - is very aware of this.",
        "It knows that if there is a bursting of the bubble, those tens, hundreds of millions of new middle-class people who they cannot afford to be against them, they must keep them on side, on board with the whole project of Chinese economic development, they would get very angry indeed.",

        "And if there is some kind of demonstrations towards more freedom, would this new government, would they put him down in the same manner as Tiananmen Square?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, that's a big question.",

        "You talk about activists.",

        "What you have also is this middle class, and the middle class is not about to come out on the streets at the moment to demand democracy.",
        "It's more of a sort of slow burn towards a more mature populous who are on the Internet, who understand different forms of government, which perhaps was not so much the case in the 1980s.",
        "So in some ways, actually, I think it's probably - it could be more dangerous for the government because all these people are on their microblogs as well, and they're all much more mature.",
        "They understand the world a lot better.",
        "So yes, I think there is a danger there, and that is why the government has to keep the economy growing, to keep those people happy in the cities so they don't step outside the tent and start to push for more political, more political rights.",
