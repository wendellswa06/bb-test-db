        "And the idea behind that is if Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is going to be elected, let it be somebody who does not scar our movement or our party for decades to come, but rather somebody who we can legitimately oppose.",
        "So you're saying given that choice, you would prefer to have Hillary Clinton win the presidency than Donald Trump?",

        "You know, the sociologist Glen Elder at North Carolina who followed various age cohorts and - throughout their lives after the Depression to see how the Depression changed them.",
        "What he found was for people who were mostly adolescents during the Depression, there were really no lasting scars.",
        "In fact, adolescents were counted on for more.",
        "They were pampered less.",
        "And as you said, there was also - quite happily, in a sense - a big event which gave them employment as they were reaching adulthood and put them in good stead for the rest of their lives."

        "The Depression was unusual in that it tended to bring people together more than in most deep downturns.",
