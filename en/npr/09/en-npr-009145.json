        "The notion of terrorizing black people is central to your view of the subject here.",
        "You do not see the lynching of a black man in the South as a case of a mob imposing rough justice because people are impatient with the courts.",
        "You're saying the point was to demonstrate something to the black community at large.",
        "That's correct.",
        "I mean, in most of the places where these lynchings took place - in fact, in all of them there was a functioning criminal justice system that was deemed too good for African-Americans.",

        "Are you focusing on the South just to tighten that link between lynching and maintaining Jim Crow laws, or was the phenomenon just that much greater in the South?",
        "Well, it's both.",
        "I think that the South was recovering from enslavement and slavery.",
        "And my thesis is essentially that slavery - the evil of slavery wasn't involuntary servitude.",
        "It was this narrative of racial difference - this ideology white supremacy.",
        "And so when reconstruction collapsed, to restore the racial hierarchy, you had to use force and violence and intimidation.",
        "And in the South, that manifested itself with these lynchings.",
        "And it did have effects outside of the South.",
        "Obviously, the federal government tolerated this violence for decades.",

        "And the geography of black people in America today is largely shaped by the institution of lynching.",

        "That's probably, roughly, a 10th of the number of theaters that Sony had expected the picture to open in.",
