        "That's right.",
        "According to U.S.",
        "News and World Report, many colleges are rejecting women at rates much higher than those for men.",
        "The reason: Many more women than men are going to college these days, which is prompting many schools to favor men in the interest of gender balance.",

        "Alex, welcome.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Tell us what you found.",
        "What kind of advantage do men have in applying to colleges these days?",
        "The issue is that since women represent about 60 percent of all the college students in the United States, the schools that are selective - which is to say not open admissions, that they just let everybody in - are faced with a situation where they actually receive more female applicants than male applicants.",
        "And what that naturally means if you're trying to maintain a gender balance on campus of about, you know, say, 50-50, is that men stand a better chance of getting in.",
        "It's just basic statistics."

        "And what's the range of that advantage?",
        "What kind of advantage do they have?",
        "Well, it very much depends on the school.",

        "It's not so much the case at the top schools, say, Harvard, Princeton, Yale...",
        "Because they have enough applications from both men and women to choose whoever they want.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But at these slightly less selective schools - places like the University of Richmond, then William and Mary, and Pomona, and a couple, you know, many other schools around the country - there's an advantage, I guess, inherent in their application system.",
        "So at the College of William and Mary, for example, it can be around 12 percentage points over 10 years, so this was a lot of data that we looked at, and when, you know, we diagramed it all out, you could see that there was a persistent advantage over time.",
        "Alex, let's talk about why this is happening.",
        "As we mentioned, there are more women than men now going to college.",
        "What explains this?",
        "Well, it's a pipeline issue.",
        "It starts in the early grades and continues right up until the point in high school where women are applying to college.",
        "So from the early grades women tends to watch less television, participate in more extracurricular activities, less sports focus, and tend to excel in the very liberal arts studies that colleges are looking for when they select their incoming freshmen class.",
        "So in fact, and your story sort of make this point, that this is good news in a sense about women, especially when you consider that just a generation ago women were barred from some of the country's best universities.",
        "So in a sense they're sort of victims of their own success in this case.",
        "Short term memory, I guess we tend to think that higher education has been fully co-ed for a lot longer than it was.",
        "But up until, say, a generation ago, many of the country's top schools were - if not fully single sex, then not fully co-ed.",
        "So it very much depends, and women are in a sense now becoming victims of their own success in that the better they do as a group, the more difficult it is for women individually to get into a lot of these schools.",
        "What does the law say about all of this?",
        "Have the courts looked at consideration of gender, and are colleges and universities sort of walking into some potential legal hot water, I guess, in considering gender in this way?",
        "The Supreme Court has weighed in on the issue of the use of race in admissions.",
        "But even there, it was two 5-4 decisions that were split in the case of the University of Michigan.",
        "So it's a very ambiguous legal climate."
