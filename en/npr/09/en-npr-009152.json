        "There are, though, economists who argue that this is not the time for nuance, that the Fed should be even more open than it is.",
        "Rather than hint, the Fed should essentially make specific promises.",
        "Bernanke could say in order to promote a stronger economy, we will do whatever it takes to get the unemployment rate under, say, 6 percent.",
        "Or he could say I won't stop until the economy is really booming at this rate.",
        "Few expect the Fed to go that far today.",
        "It may be opening up, communicating more, but Fed habits change slowly.",

        "Democrats did do well, and they hope this will create momentum as they prepare for midterm elections in 2006.",

        "Let's start with the Detroit mayoral race, where Kwame Kilpatrick squeaked by the former Deputy Mayor Freeman Hendrix.",
        "Donna, what do you make of this?",
        "There was a last-minute surge in support for Kwame Kilpatrick.",
        "You know, I think voters looked at his record, they looked at some of the scandals and controversy and they said, `You know what?",
        "We're going to stay with the candidate that we know best.",
        "Kwame proved in the last closing hours of the campaign that he could rally Detroiters to support him, to give him a second chance to try to fix some of the problems that he said when he was elected four years ago that he would tackle.",
        "So this was a great opportunity for Kwame to really demonstrate leadership in getting Detroit back on its feet and changing the political climate in that city.",
        "Now Kwame has some major problems facing his city, like many other big city mayors.",
        "He's--loss of revenue, the business community is really not anxious to invest.",
        "I think Kwame will use this second term to try to improve the city's economic forecast as well improve its public schools.",
        "Robert Traynham, looking at this from the Republican side, there was really no substantial Republican challenger in a city like Detroit.",
        "What does it say to you about the state of the Democratic Party in a big city like Detroit?",
        "Is it the case of the business community, the white suburban communities just look at this and shake their heads?",
        "Well, I think it's more than that.",
        "I mean, look, Mayor Kilpatrick is a very energetic, dynamic individual.",
        "You know, granted, I do agree with Donna that he does or did bring to the table a lot of baggage.",
        "But listen, I mean, he is all about the future, and I think from a perception standpoint, that's what he was able to convey to his constituents in Detroit.",
        "The Republican Party knows that Detroit is 80 percent African-American.",
        "And having said that, it's overwhelmingly Democrat.",
        "And so to try to run a Republican for mayor in that city is almost, you know--literally, that person will be the sacrificial lamb, if you will.",
        "Let's look at two other mayoral elections that took place this week.",
        "In Atlanta, Shirley Franklin was easily re-elected, and in Houston, Bill White was easily re-elected.",
        "In cities that are struggling to accommodate large numbers of evacuees from New Orleans, Robert Traynham, why no challengers to these two big city mayors?",
        "Going back to my point about Mayor Kilpatrick, I mean, I will go first with Mayor Franklin.",
        "She is a very dynamic, charismatic speaker.",
        "She is still, I believe, struggling with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in terms of bringing in--or housing, rather, victims from New Orleans.",
        "And so she has a lot of goodwill with the business community as well as, obviously, with the residents of Atlanta in that city.",
        "We Republicans knew that it would be an uphill battle to try to unseat her and, quite frankly, I'm glad she won re-election because, again, she is a very, very solid pick for the Democrats.",
        "Donna Brazile, when you look at Shirley Franklin, when you look at Bill White, and you look at them trying to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, do you see people who are exhibiting strong leadership?",
        "Or do you see people who are politically insulated and it didn't matter how they handled a controversy like that?",
        "Well, first of all, both of these mayors are very popular in their cities.",
        "They are popular statewide.",
        "They're very confident.",
        "They have a great team around them.",
        "Their response to Katrina was, you know, `Bring 'em on.",
        "Bring the residents in.",
        "We'll accommodate them.",
        "So I applaud these two mayors.",
        "They're good mayors.",
        "They're good solid public servants.",
        "And let's hope that Shirley Franklin is thinking big and thinking big enough to run for governor one day or perhaps run for the United States Senate.",
        "All right, another mayoral race: in New York City.",
        "Mayor Mike Bloomberg wins re-election over challenger Fernando Ferrer, who would have been the first Hispanic mayor of New York City.",
        "And Ferrer tried so hard to appeal to black and Latino voters but was outspent, I believe, 10:1.",
        "So, Robert Traynham, when you look at a Republican mayor of New York City defeating someone who was appealing to the minority community, are we looking at now a political divide emerging along race lines in that city?",
        "Not at all.",
        "In fact, what Mayor Bloomberg tried to do, and I think he was very successful in it, is trying to reach across the racial lines to bring everyone together.",
        "Look, it's an open secret that New York City is a predominantly Democratic city.",
        "In fact, Democrats outnumber Republicans 5:1.",
        "It is a very diverse city ethnicwise.",
        "And what Mayor Bloomberg did, which was something that Mayor Giuliani did as well, which is to literally break down the racial barriers and says, `I am not necessarily a Republican running for re-election.",
        "I'm your mayor running for re-election.",
        "And we've done a lot of work.",
        "We've done a lot of good over the last four years.",
        "Let's continue on that effort.",
        "I mean, he relentlessly went through all the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and looked--and literally shook thousands of hands, not taking any votes for granted, and he should be commended for that."

        "Hillary will be the head of the ticket there in the state, and we have a great gubernatorial candidate and I think--in Eliot Spitzer.",
        "So I think Democrats are going to let this one go by the wayside and focus on 2006 and beyond.",
        "Let me just do a quick survey of the national results here.",
        "The big number came in, in terms of surprise, that Jon Corzine, the senator from New Jersey, was able to defeat Doug Forrester pretty handily; an even bigger surprise, Tim Kaine over Terry Kilgore, the Democrats winning both in New Jersey and Virginia, and then going out west to California, where you saw Governor Schwarzenegger's initiatives that would have limited state spending, given him more power to make budget cuts, to fire teachers, require public employee unions to get their members' consent before they use dues for political contributions.",
        "It looks like across the board here, we have Democrats doing well, Republicans not doing so well.",
        "So, Robert Traynham, how do you see these results?",
        "Well, some are troubling, some are not so troubling.",
        "I mean, keep in mind that New Jersey is a Democratic state and so, you know, everyone knew that the Kaine vs. Kilgore race was going to be neck-and-neck, no question about it.",
        "Going over to California, listen, Governor Schwarzenegger has an uphill battle to climb, if you will, just in terms of trying to curb state spending and trying to rein in the radical unions out there as well as obviously trying to police, if you will, teachers that may not be doing their jobs.",
        "And so I'm pretty confident that when Governor Schwarzenegger gets on the ballot himself, he will carry the day.",
        "Donna, do you think Schwarzenegger's star is fading?",
        "Well, first of all, he had no political capital.",
        "He had no momentum behind him.",
        "He didn't have a Gray Davis to beat up on.",
        "So I think the governator was up against the public employees union; he was up against public opinion.",
        "People rejected those initiatives and I think in the process it's time the governor go back to the drawing board and find ways to work with Democrats to get some of his initiatives through the Legislature and not circumvent the process.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thank you all.",
