        "(Director, Intelligence Project, Southern Poverty Law Center) Well, I think really what you're seeing is two things.",
        "On the one hand, certainly you see, and studies reflect this, that kids today, for instance, are vastly more accepting of interracial relationships.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "At the same time, I do believe, though, that a lot of things are happening in the larger society.",
        "I mean, there is no question that, for instance, families who are headed by a high school dropout or merely high school degree people but with not higher degrees are in very bad shape and doing worse.",

        "Of course, in many ways, it's essentially a loss of white privilege.",

        "And I also think that it's certainly true that only a tiny minority of people who engage in hate crimes are actually members of hate groups.",

        "And, Mark, we should note for those how aren't familiar, the white power music scene.",
        "What we have seen over the course of last few years is these groups finding ways to indoctrinate these young people through music, literally.",
        "Well, the white power music scene began as essentially a tiny cottage industry; it largely came out of Britain.",
        "It really has exploded into a kind of multinational major business operation.",
        "Many of these kids who actually become part of the movement, the white power movement, the white supremacy movement, really come in not so much on the basis of the racism - it's fairly thin with them - they're really looking for a kind of alternative family.",
        "They have got often problems at home for one reason or another, and they're essentially looking to create another life.",

        "Particularly after 9/11, we saw an increase in hate crimes.",
        "Of course, the ongoing immigration debate, the question of affirmative action - all of this plays out to the fears of not necessarily the these young people, but their parents and usually by extension to them.",
        "I think their parents, as well, and as noted to politicians who use some of these things, who have anti-gay agendas and so on, will help legitimate these young people hating particular groups.",
        "There's no question in my mind that the immigration is fueling it.",
        "I think 9/11 fueled a lot of it, so there's this anger towards Muslims.",
        "We don't yet have the statistics, that I know of, on how many hate crimes in the last couple of years were directly against Muslims, as a religious group.",
        "Usually, it's directed about 40 percent of these religious hate crimes against Jewish organizations and Jewish people.",
        "Mark how optimistic are you, if at all, when you decipher these numbers.",
        "Well, first of all, I don't think the numbers are essentially any good.",
        "Hate crime statistics have shown between about 6,000 and 10,000 hate crimes a year.",
        "A study came out last fall, very important study, out of the Department of Justice that showed the real level's probably about 190,000 hate crimes a year.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Because of the way they're reported, under reported, the fine line between a hate crime and just a crime.",
        "Well there're a whole series of reasons, but the probably most important reason is that the whole reporting system is voluntary.",
        "There's not even a pretense, in fact, that they're collecting all of the data from all across the nation, in fact.",
        "There's designated agencies reporting to the FBI, so the data their getting is rather limited.",
        "And so I agree, we really don't know what the number is and it could be quite high."
