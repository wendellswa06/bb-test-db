        "So far.",
        "And it feels to me, driving around, as if there really is no impact at all on, you know, how safe I am, how careful I am, how much attention I'm paying to the road.",
        "I'm doing, you know, I'm doing just fine.",
        "And like I said, I think, if anything, the impact is to make me - I know when I just have no reason to rush, you know, if there's a red light and it's going to be red when I get there, you know, just cruise up.",
        "It's fine, so...",

        "Good day.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So I guess I was listening to the prior caller and he was mentioning some of the drawbacks to the system, but I wanted to kind of touch on the idea that emergency systems such as police and fire and ambulance might really benefit from systems such as this.",
        "And indeed, there are sadly too many - all too many accidents that involve either police cars racing to a scene or ambulances trying to get to the hospital and trying to get through red lights.",

        "...often, you know, what I was kind of wonder - or what I was going to ask about was basically notification system for when and where the red lights are going to take place - so it's not necessarily GPS system calculating, you know, how you go around it is in, can you clarify that?",
        "Matthew Ginsberg, two questions.",
        "Obviously, would emergency vehicles like ambulances have access to this?",
        "Do they already?",
        "And that other part of Jesse's question?",
        "So I understood the first question.",
        "I don't think I understood the second question.",
        "As far as emergency vehicles, at least in Eugene, they already control the lights.",
        "So if a police car goes by, it will actually set the light to green for it.",
        "But one of the nice features of this technology is that as we build it out, if there is an emergency vehicle going on a particular route and we get that information from the city, we can actually route our drivers away from that.",
        "So we actually reduce all sorts of congestion.",
        "As far as...",
        "Wow, that's fabulous.",
        "As far as your second question about the GPS interaction, I mean, what's happening is that the information we get from the city on the lights is not GPS based.",
        "We just have this big database of all the lights and what they're currently doing and what they're going to be doing in five, and 10 and 15, 20 seconds and so on.",
        "The only thing we use the GPS for is the individual iPhones.",
        "Obviously, we need to know where the drivers are, where they're intending to go so that we can sort of couple that with the information we have about the lights and make routing recommendations to them.",
        "Oh, so you have to tell your iPhone in advance, I'm going on my way to the office, and then it'll engage the system.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Just like any other GPS thing.",
        "It's got to know where you're going so that it can tell you how to get there.",
        "All right.",

        "Perfect.",
        "So that answers the question, the second question, because basically I was wondering if I'm coming to a major intersection and I want to make a left at this major intersection but I know that left-hand turn lane is going to take forever, I make a left maybe before the intersection and then a right and another left onto that major road that I was trying to make a left on in the first place.",
        "It's kind of like avoiding the light where I'm just going through stop (technical difficulty).",
        "Is that the kind of thing that a GPS would be activating?",
        "The system certainly can do that.",
        "You have to be a little bit careful not to be sort of too aggressive so when we first developed it, it loved - if you were trying to go through a light that was red, it would dump you on a right filter and have you make this illegal U-turn and then turn right on the same light and sort of cut it out in a way that was guaranteed to get you a ticket.",
        "So you want to be a little bit careful not to go overboard on that kind of stuff.",
        "And don't assume that it's telling you to do something legal.",
        "Nowadays, it's pretty good, but obviously, as the first caller said, you are the captain of the ship.",
        "But we do, you know, we do know that, you know, turning left on this light is very hard or this light tends to be red for a long time and all of that is folded in as we compute the most time-efficient routes to get where you're going.",
        "Got it, got it.",
        "Now, you've mentioned - real quick, this is the last thing I wanted to touch on was the emergency system such as ambulance and police, they come to a light that's red, somehow the light knows that they're approaching and it turns green for them.",
        "Do you know any more details about those systems because I have a bet here with a friend who says that it isn't the brights, but I kind of seem to think that it's the flashing lights that -and the bright lights that has to do with that.",
        "The bubbletop, what is it?",
        "My understanding, and this is just very vague and - arguably, only Eugene, is they actually transmit on a particular radio frequency, and that controls the lights.",
        "So it's nothing that you could sort of see and watch if you put your brights on, it doesn't change the light.",
        "And you could put whatever you want on the top of your car and...",
        "Might get it - receive it in your filling, but otherwise you're not going to be able to detect it.",
        "Jesse, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We're talking with Matthew Ginsberg, CEO of On Time Systems, about the app that will help drivers avoid red lights, with us from KLCC in Eugene.",

        "You can't - it's hard to measure.",
        "I can tell you that pretty much every domain we have looked at, when you bring optimization technology to bear, you save - it's very rare that you save outside, sort of, the three to 5 percent range.",
        "So I would expect that here you're going to cut your gas consumption and your time probably by something between three and five percent.",
        "Okay.",
