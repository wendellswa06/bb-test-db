        "This spot was part of a $23 million campaign promoting pre-school that was paid for by First 5 California, the state commission Reiner heads.",
        "What outraged his critics was that the commercials aired at the same time Reiner was gathering signatures for another initiative to have state funded pre-school for all four-year olds.",
        "That's kind of been the theme from most of the Republicans, particularly Republicans who have to run for re-election again and have to answer to voters in a base that really continues to support President Trump.",
        "Speaker Ryan said something very similar to what McConnell said.",
        "But they were also similar in that they never criticized Trump by name.",
        "They focused on what he said about the intelligence community assessment about interference in the election.",
        "Well, if Republicans aren't satisfied with the way President Trump sort of cleaned up his remarks from yesterday, what steps can lawmakers actually take at this point?",
        "One thing on the table is the idea of passing more sanctions.",
        "Democrats have raised that.",
        "Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been pressing for more sanctions, and Republican leaders acknowledge that those could happen if the committees of jurisdiction decide to go that route.",
        "But they didn't go anywhere near guaranteeing that new sanctions were imminent.",
        "But basically the only legislative option on the table right now is a bipartisan bill from Senators Marco Rubio and Chris Van Hollen.",
        "Rubio's a Republican from Florida, and Chris Van Hollen is a Democrat from Maryland.",
        "It would require the director of National Intelligence to report to Congress on any election interference within a month of the election.",
        "If interference is found, then sanctions would be automatically applied.",
        "And Senate Majority Leader McConnell did mention that bill when he was talking about options.",

        "How does that affect women who are pregnant?",
        "Well, I think first of all, black women in general, we tend to be nurturers, we tend to be caretakers for a lot of people in our families and our extended families, and so pregnancy is just an extension of our lives and we don't know how to turn it off.",
        "We don't know how to take off that red cape and those boots for those nine months and say, You know what, I can't really do this.",
        "And so what happens is you create unnecessary stress for yourself, which, again, goes to your baby, and has been linked through many studies with some of the poor birth outcomes that we're seeing amongst black women.",
        "So, in my book, I ask women to learn how to, one, set more realistic expectations for yourself, learn to delegate, and learn to say now.",
        "What about when pregnancies either are terminated or people lose the baby?",
        "You write about abortion, depression, loss.",
        "How do you write about those issues that a lot of women don't want to talk about, and what are some of the key issues that women need to look out for?",
        "Well, I think that's the key to why The Mocha Manual is so unique, because it does show the full spectrum of the pregnancy experiences.",
        "And sometimes it can be very difficult when you look in these pregnancy magazines and you see all the smiling faces and laying in the meadow.",
        "And sometimes that's not your experience.",

        "Sometimes there is loss.",

        "What are some of the medical issues that black mothers-to-be face in particular?",
        "Black women not only are more likely to have pre-term birth and low birth weight babies as a consequence, but also issues such as gestational diabetes or diabetes of pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension and all its different forms.",
        "We're more likely to have fibroids, which can also affect the pregnancy and cause pre-term labor and delivery, and the list goes on.",
        "And nutritional status also plays a big role, as well.",
        "And what about just medical conditions in general that affect black women.",

        "Other medical issues such as multiple sclerosis, or asthma, or lung disease can play a factor."
