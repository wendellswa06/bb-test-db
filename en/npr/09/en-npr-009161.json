        "First all, there are academics and there are academics.",
        "And as Levi, the president, I should say, of the University of Chicago, David's College, was a very effective leader and he was very effective politically.",
        "So I think some academics are effective.",
        "But I think that if the president wants to avoid ongoing congressional hearings trying to figure out what happened in the Gonzales Justice Department, he's going to be much better off with a less political figure, somebody respected across party lines.",
        "Then if he nominates someone who clearly comes out of the Republican camp, then I think we simply go back to the same fight we were having the day before Alberto Gonzales left his job.",
        "Well, often, the last refuge of the president in trouble with the Senate is to nominate a senator or a former senator.",
        "And Oren Hatch has been mentioned.",
        "Whose best friend in the Senate is Ted Kennedy, in some ways.",
        "So he clearly has some appeal across the aisle.",
        "So yes, certain senators could be very effective.",
        "Not all senators.",
        "We recall Senator Tower ran into a little trouble at the Defense Department.",
        "But Hatch would be a logical choice.",
        "When President Bush, David, says, as he did today, that this was a case of a good man who was dragged through the mud for political reasons, you see, being a devoted friend and sponsor to Alberto Gonzales on the day of his - the announcement of his retirement, his resignation, do you think that's the way president Bush actually saw this conflict between his attorney general and the Senate?",
        "I'm sure he absolutely saw it that way.",
        "One of the things you notice about the Bush leadership style, whether it's with Gonzales or with the generals in Iraq.",
        "He looks at the quality of the character.",
        "And he says - if he says so and so is good man or a good woman, he will stick with that person through thick and thin without really reference to the positions that person has taken or the judgments they've made.",
        "He judges character, not the decisions that have been taken.",
        "So if he's loyal to someone with good character, he will stay loyal to that person.",
        "I think that's been the case with Gonzales.",
        "Someone he and most other people generally think has very good character and is a good, nice person - a person you'd want to be around.",
        "And so I think that loyalty is real.",
        "Nonetheless, I think there's a sense in the administration greater awareness over the past year or two that you really have to do business in Washington.",
        "And effectiveness really matters.",
        "And so they've gotten rid of a whole series of people, starting with Donald Rumsfeld, who have become ineffective in Washington.",
        "Last question to both of you.",
        "First, E.J., what, in balance, what do you think is the bottom line of the Gonzales era at the Department of Justice?",
        "Is it - was it an unusually unsuccessful tenure?",
        "Does it leave any dangerous residue for future attorneys general?",
        "I think the answer is yes and yes.",
        "I think one of the most troubling things is how much more politicized this Justice Department seemed under Alberto Gonzales.",
        "The civil rights division, in every case involving reapportionment, made the decisions in ways that helped the Republican Party.",
        "All of these interests in voter fraud - where even studies by the Justice Department suggested this problem as exaggerated, in taking - making voter fraud a big issue is really a way of decreasing participation by groups that supported them across the lower income groups.",
        "And then these firings, which were still never adequately explained.",
        "So I think there's a huge problem here, and the civil liberties issues.",
        "You couldn't have this kind of partisanship.",
        "You shouldn't have had it over a question where you're balancing national security and civil liberties."
