        "Well, I have a lot of concerns over the fact that the secretary of state nominee has praised Putin, has actually called for the lessening or elimination of sanctions, something that we think is really important for these Baltic countries and for America standing up against Russian aggression.",
        "So these are things that are going to be explored in these hearings at length.",
        "I find solace in the fact that there are some Republicans like Senator McCain and Senator Graham who are withholding judgment on the nominee because they want to get to the bottom of this.",
        "What kinds of conversations have you been having with Eastern European leaders?",
        "Because these sanctions are coming at this already tense time between the U.S.",
