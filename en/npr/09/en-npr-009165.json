        "They are highly leveraged financial institutions, which are very beholden to the market for their day-to-day funding requirements, which makes them subject to the swings in market psychology.",
        "And Sprinzen says Lehman's underlying business is strong, and a sale of the company is being driven largely by that market psychology.",
