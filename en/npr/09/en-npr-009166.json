        "And let's begin with Barry Bonds and the notion that if anybody else was about to pass Babe Ruth, the game would be more than thrilled to celebrate one of its biggest stars.",
        "Well, I don't necessarily agree with that.",
        "I think that they don't usually celebrate people moving into second place.",
        "And yes, it's Babe Ruth.",
        "And yes, that carries all sorts of connotations, and there are a lot of question marks having to do with Barry Bonds, etc., etc., etc. But it's still just second place, and the person who holds second place, you know, he's also been dead for 58 years.",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, I mean, I just think we have to maintain a little perspective here, and you know, we don't need to celebrate when someone moves into second place no matter who he's passing.",
        "Yeah, we don't need to, but I'm just suggesting that if this were, I don't want to, anybody else at this point other than Barry Bonds, they would take the opportunity to say, this is one of our greatest stars.",
        "Let's celebrate.",
        "Well, I don't know what that celebration would necessarily entail.",
        "I mean, it's certainly not going to be fireworks and stopping the game, necessarily, or making a big fuss like they did back when Mark McGuire hit his 70, his 60, I guess it was 62nd homerun.",
        "Right.",
        "And I was also there the night that Barry Bonds hit his 71st homerun against the Dodgers in 2001.",
        "And that was when you were breaking a record.",
        "He's not breaking a record.",
        "And, look, are they getting a convenient reason here to not do anything?",
        "Yes.",
        "But I don't think we should therefore overestimate what they might have done had it been somebody else."

        "One thing that we do need to remember though is that that 714 mark--obviously not 755--which, of course, is the record.",
        "But it's something that baseball conjured with--I think probably more baseball fans know the 714 number then know 755.",
        "Well, I think it's important to realize why they know that.",
        "They certainly don't know it because they were there in 1935 when Babe Ruth hit his last three homeruns.",
        "To have 714, they know about it in large part because of the ordeal that Hank Aaron went through in the early ‘70s, and specifically before he broke the record in 1974.",
        "When passing the legendary Babe Ruth, a white man, okay?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That had a lot of to do with it, of course.",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, added to, you know, just the--he had the racist letters and the death threats and just the incredible, just hounding unpleasantness that he was, had the temerity to break Babe Ruth's record--not unlike what Roger Maris went through, but Roger Maris had the convenience of being white.",
        "And Hank Aaron did not.",
        "And so, he had just this extra ordeal to have to go through.",

        "It's a daisy chain in which you have stations that the government would send out a message to in an emergency.",
