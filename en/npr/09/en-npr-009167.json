        "And so we all learned--I mean I didn't, I wasn't following baseball at the time--but we all learned how important the number 714 was because it belonged to Babe Ruth.",
        "Well, you know what?",
        "It doesn't matter as much anymore because it's not the record.",
        "And we remember 714 in large part for reasons that we should really, as a culture, be ashamed of, not necessarily celebratory of.",
        "There was also the drama of Hank Aaron being right on the cusp of breaking the mark, until, at the end of one season--waiting all winter long to see if he would do it the, when he would do it the next season.",

        "How is it--I have a question for you.",
        "He's innocent until proven guilty, but we should treat him as guilty, anyway?",
        "No, I think that he actually should still be--I think he should be suspended just for the simple fact of his comments towards baseball on that new show that he's on.",

        "You know, the Baseball Association has always regulated their people to put baseball in the best light, and there have been many people suspended who haven't done that.",

        "There's a lot of money that's being invested as he goes towards this title.",
