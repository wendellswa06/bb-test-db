        "So this is research he's done in Africa?",
        "Yes, in Kenya.",
        "And what he was looking at are these habitats that they have there called dambos.",
        "They're basically just low-lying areas.",
        "And when it rains, and it rains for a long time, these dambos flood and you get giant puddles.",
        "And you know, when you have puddles, you have mosquitoes.",
        "Can you explain how we get from research in Africa on the ground to weather satellites at NASA?",
        "Well, that is actually what I went out to NASA to find out.",
        "Dr. Linthicum had had colleagues that worked on weather satellite imagery and he realized that you could use some of the satellite data to predict climate patterns, to predict rainfall.",
        "So when I went out to NASA I spoke to a scientist Assaf Anyamba.",
        "Dr. Anyamba works on a lot of these data.",
        "And he told me that the two most important factors in predicting rainfall are sea surface temperatures and cloud cover.",
        "Which they can all get from the weather satellite.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's the kind of thing you can get from a weather satellite.",
        "So when you have warm ocean surfaces in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and you have a lot of clouds, that's almost a perfect predictor of heavy rains.",
        "And he said it's a pattern that you see a lot with an El Nino.",
        "I usually like to use this whole idea that when you have the Indian Ocean and the Pacific dancing to the same tune, you are going to generate enough rainfall to flood the dambo habitats in East Africa.",
        "And basically, that is an early indicator of the disease.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I know exactly what you're saying, and I am not kidding, I just said that to somebody this morning.",
        "That at least, at the very least, we're talking about some of the challenges, especially with autism.",
        "I think, basically what's happening is, had we had these challenges 20 years ago, we would had to have had little access to any resources.",
        "And it would have been a much more difficult landscape.",
        "But now we have the internet, we have people more open to talking about certain things, we have more information.",
        "And I think it is a positive time.",
        "There're still people out there struggling with it, but the positive is that, yes, it's a very good time to talk about, or if you get this diagnosis of autism, it's not the end of the world.",
        "There are treatments that we didn't even know about when we got our diagnosis, you know, eight or nine years ago.",
        "So there's some positive things happening right now.",
        "You've also been able in the past to turn some of the challenges that you've faced into outreach to other people.",
        "And I'm thinking of your father, who passed away from Parkinson's, which degenerates the nervous system and eventually causes death.",
        "And I'm sure it was horrific to watch him go through that, but at the same time you were able to take that and turn it into a foundation.",
        "Tell us a little bit about how you decided to take the inspiration from your father's passing and turn it into something positive."

        "Well, actually, the inspiration came before he passed away, when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.",
        "He was only in his 40s.",
        "I was a freshman in college, and I was wondering what this limp was, he was limping.",
        "And he - my father was the original Gordon on \"\"Sesame Street,\"\" and if you're sort of between 30 and 40-plus, you remember him as the very original Gordon.",
        "And he's just a brilliant man.",
        "He went on to write and produce \"\"The Cosby Show\"\" for the whole run of the show, and wrote a lot of sitcoms.",
        "And one of the sitcoms that he was a writer on was \"\"Sanford & Son.\"\" And I remember being at Sarah Lawrence College in the early '80s, and watching my daddy - he dropped me of at school, and he walked away from me and he was limping.",
        "And I said, hey, Dad, why are you walking like Fred Sanford?",
        "And my dad, who was very, very funny and quick on his feet, was saying, listen, don't worry about me.",
        "You just do your studies and pay attention in class or you'll be running a junkyard, too.",
        "And we laughed about it and he kind of played it off, but when I came home for Christmas that year, he had a case of Bell's palsy and his face was slouchy and that's when we got the diagnosis that he had Parkinson's.",
        "He was only 46 years old.",
        "So for about ten years, I was sort of in denial, in this really ugly slump about the situation.",
        "But when I met my husband, he told me that we need to help people with this disease.",
        "So that's how the HollyRod Foundation got started, and we basically help elevate the quality of life of people with Parkinson's.",
        "And then - as we got the diagnosis for autism, we sort of incorporated that within our mission and we have what's called HollyRod 4 Kids, where we help raise money for the quality of life of children as well.",
        "All right.",
        "Before we let you go, I have to ask about \"\"21 Jump Street.",

        "There - you have done some, you know, you've done so many amazing things in life, you know, playing Diana Ross, all these things that people would consider a dream, but at, you know, being in the demo that I am in...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Which is the same demo you mentioned around \"\"Sesame Street,\"\" I totally adored \"\"21 Jump Street.\"\" What did you learn from doing that?",
        "And do people still come up to you and talk to you about it?",
        "Everywhere I go.",
        "Everywhere I go someone remembers \"\"21 Jump Street,\"\" and then, of course, there are the younger, younger generation, like the 'tween-set, like my kids, it's not really on their radar.",
        "When they think of Johnny Depp, they think of, you know, the whole \"\"Pirates\"\" series, and they are like, wow, you were in a movie with Captain - you were in a TV show with Captain Jack Sparrow?",
        "And so people still really love it and the - I really felt like we were a groundbreaking show.",
        "We shot everything on location in Canada.",
        "It was just a young, heady time.",
        "We had everyone on the show before they were stars from Brad Pitt to Jada Pinkett-Smith, and many others, and it was, I believe, a show that was ahead of its time."
