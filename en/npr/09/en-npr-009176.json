        "Every run of salmon in the Snake River today is either extinct or listed under the Endangered Species Act, and we're at a place where we might see the remaining populations wink out.",
        "Some environmental groups say the only way to save the upriver salmon is to remove at least four major dams on the Columbia system, but so far, there's little political will for a solution that drastic.",
        "Witt Anderson is chief of the Columbia River fish management office at the Army Corps of Engineers.",
