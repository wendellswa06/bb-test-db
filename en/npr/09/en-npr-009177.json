        "That's right.",
        "It is an inherited condition.",
        "Mm hm.",
        "So does that make it amenable for gene therapy?",
        "Well, gene therapy can actually be used for both inherited conditions, genetic diseases, and also for acquired disorders.",
        "But it's most commonly thought of in the setting of genetic diseases because, in a very straightforward way, we think if we could just supply the missing gene, we may be able to reconstitute a missing or defective important pathway.",
        "So you must have tried this out in animals first there, I would imagine, with good results, before you went to humans.",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "Other members of this team led the work in both a mouse model of the disease, and there is also, actually, a naturally-occurring dog model of this disease.",
        "So Jean Bennett, who is a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania, had, along with her colleagues, published a paper in 2001 showing that exactly the same procedures, subretinal injection of this modified virus carrying the gene sequence for the missing enzyme, could restore sight in dogs with the same condition.",

        "That's right.",
        "And did they present any different kind of a challenge?",
        "Well, you know, what's really interesting, people have been attempting gene therapy for genetic disease using this sort of approach, where the gene-therapy vector is directly injected into the patient, for a number of years now, but it's been very difficult to move it to a successful conclusion, and one problem after another has occurred.",
        "One of the most prominent problems that's occurred, with this particular vector, has been, in some circumstances, an immune response that seems to get in the way of effective expression of the donated gene.",
        "But the retina is, in that sense, a very special place to try to put a donated gene because, relative to many other tissues in the body, it's relatively immunoprivileged, so the immune system can't get to it quite as well.",
