        "And if we don't see it's on mainstream, we don't aspire to go to mainstream.",
        "So I really feel that we've got to not only close the gap, but what we've got to do is begin to combine our efforts.",

        "We do not say it's an African-American news site.",
        "And the reason for that is because we feel that the African-American perspective is one that is valued with all Americans.",
        "And so, I - you know, you don't have to be black to visit the Grio.",
        "So that's one thing.",
        "I actually think we also enrich mainstream media because we have an audience and we have reach, particularly at the Grio and I would imagine the same thing would happen at HuffPo Black Voices, where we are attached to a bigger media arm.",
        "We are able to get stories that come from the community that would otherwise go unnoticed, and we're able to push those up to bigger outlets.",
        "So, you know, I don't buy the argument that we're separated.",

        "So we are trying to connect our communities together, and we're trying to even serve the mainstream media by providing them such an important information about our community.",

        "And what are some of the differences you see among the groups that consume your different media sources?",
        "Well, you know, the audience is very diverse, but the media outlets themselves are diverse.",
