        "Of course you have immigrant communities.",
        "You have ethnic minority communities that have been in this country for many years.",
        "But we also see ourselves very much as serving and representing, in a nutshell, really the voices of those communities that, you know, have been left out of the mainstream national discourse.",
        "You know, youth, young voices are very much a part of our strategy and our mandate and what we're trying to do, as are the voices of elders, in addition to ethnic communities.",

        "At 5 o'clock, I watch (unintelligible) on Univision; and then at 6:00, my local American news; and then at 6:30, Diane Sawyer to get my world news.",
        "And that's a daily process I go through to get a full spectrum of what's actually going on.",
        "And I do that every single day to make sure that I do get a full amount of information and news for everything that I'm interested in.",
        "And what do you think in particular is - do you find in the Univision cast that you're missing in the other sources?",
        "They're more specific of what's going on in South American countries.",
        "My parents came here legally from Colombia, but we lived in many, many different countries while I was growing up - South America, Central America.",
        "And things that are going around in Honduras, in El Salvador, in Venezuela, those things are not focused on in the American news media unless it's something serious that might be happening.",
        "But just, you know, the guerillas attacking, you know, small towns and people getting killed in Mexico and things like that, that unless it's something spectacular that the mainstream media has to capture to be a part with everybody else, Univision gets it every single day in their newscast.",
        "And that is one of the biggest reasons why I do watch Univision as my 5 o'clock news.",
        "Rose, thank you for your call.",
        "And, Jacob Simas, as I imagine, you hear this again and again that there - stories just don't rise to the level of a national newscast on a daily basis."

        "That's absolutely correct.",
        "And, you know, I've been listening to some of the comments that David and Osama made earlier.",
        "And it's very true that, you know, these communities are very often isolated in a sense that the stories aren't being told.",
        "But, you know, the relevance of that is, you know, not only that people need to have a platform to see themselves reflected in the media, but I would also say that the decision makers and the power brokers and the people that are influencing these communities, need to hear those stories just as much as the actual communities do.",
        "Which is why it's so important to fill the gap and make those connections between, you know, communities who are often living in the shadows and who don't have a voice, because of language or because of other things, and connect those people to the very people who are making the decisions that are influencing their lives.",

        "So I think that the variety of ethnic media sources really is a great benefit for me because, you know, I can connect with maybe my Indian cultural roots, as well as my Muslim and then, of course, you know, with our mainstream media.",
        "So the retina is the situation where you can use very small doses in a relatively immunoprivileged site.",
        "And so, this was an instance where what happened in the dog model of the disease predicted quite accurately what happened in human subjects, at least so far.",
        "And I don't really think it's a bad thing at all.",
        "I think it would be, I guess, nice if maybe we could incorporate some more ethnic-related stories in the mainstream media.",
        "But, you know, I think that the main point is that these other sources give a lot of different perspectives, and also they can give a lot of different, you know, sources and depth to, maybe even our mainstream media stories.",
        "Samina, thanks for your call.",
        "And, Osama Siblani, Samina's sources, you know, are almost entirely online, an option that didn't exist when you started The Arab American News.",

        "So even though with all the junk that we have over the Internet, things are, right now, coming down and people are really looking for trusted sources.",
        "And when it comes to trusted sources, you have to establish yourself, you know, first, and people have to trust you.",
        "We have established our self as a - for the last 27 years - as an ethnic media.",
        "And our website right now is visited from all around - we have, like, 112 countries - visitors from 112 countries to our website.",
        "Some country, like, we have six or seven, but in general, we have a large viewer and people who read.",
        "But there is one thing that I would like to mention as far as the ethnic media that the things that we have that mainstream media don't have."

        "How do certain words catch on when other words don't?",
        "It seems to me that the words that catch on are those that are probably least clever, that call least attention to themselves and that really kind of percolate from general usage, whereas the words that are particularly fun or funny, they may come into existence, and they may go viral, but they tend to die out almost as quickly as they came about.",
        "Do you have some favorite new words from this year?",
        "Yes, I've been watching, as a result of my work in Wired, and one word that I really like right now is hygroelectricity, which is not hydroelectricity, it's spelled H-Y-G-R-O, and what it refers to is electricity that is taken from the humidity in the air, much as lightning is a lightening is a manifestation of this.",
        "And what I like about it is that it makes concrete in a word an idea that is very new and really right now is in the earliest prototyping stage in a laboratory.",
        "And it has, I think, great potential as an alternative energy source, and because there is a word, there is something that we can call it, we can start talking about it and promoting it, tweeting it, if you will, and I think that that can really be as important as the technology itself in terms of whether it catches on.",
