        "It's very hard to see the opposition now moving ahead, hoping to receive the IMF, trying to get the country back on a viable if not stable economic footing, returning to this agreement that would leave Mr. Yanukovych in power through December in a much longer time frame.",

        "Well, I think the most likely case is that there're minor differences in the vectors.",

        "Well, that's a really good question, and it may prove to be a limiting factor in some circumstances.",
        "A fortunate circumstance in these initial subjects, who were studied here in Philadelphia, was that two of them, at least, had sight when they were children.",
        "So they had, for example, gone to school, to regular school.",
        "And so all of the neural pathways and connections required for sight were more or less in place.",

        "Or is it something different about this virus?",
        "Well, yeah, what's really interesting, of all the - you know, viruses, as you know, are great at getting into cells and harnessing the synthetic capacity of these cells for their own purposes.",
        "So, in some ways, they are ideal gene-delivery vehicles, but you're right.",

        "It's been very successful in mice, dogs, non-human primates.",
        "And it's not rejected by their immune systems.",
        "But earlier work, in which the same vector had been injected into different sites, like skeletal muscle, like the liver, had shown that in humans, as opposed to all those other animals, occasionally one does see an immune response that seems to wipe out the expression.",
        "But that's the great thing, as I mentioned earlier, about the retina, is that compared to many of the other tissues in the body, it's relatively shielded from the immune response.",

        "Well, I have to say, Christie, that I've learned not to try to make prognostications about the speed of development of novel therapeutics.",
        "But I do think that this is encouraging, and you know, as I've mentioned before, there are many potential defective genes.",
        "And so, the answer to your question depends on all sorts of things, like is the gene that's defective in this case small enough to fit into this vector?",
        "We can't really put things into it that are much smaller than five kilobases in length.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you know, all sorts of things like that will enter in the answer to your question.",
        "In this situation, there is an important element to the age, just in the sense that, over time, the cells that you're trying to target deteriorate, and there's not really a target cell toward the gene to go to.",
        "And so the ideal situation, in this condition, is probably to try to treat individuals as soon as it's feasible after the time that they're diagnosed, which is usually in infancy or early childhood."
