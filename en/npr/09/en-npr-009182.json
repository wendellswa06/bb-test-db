        "The trials have started out within individuals at least eight years of age, and as I've said, the youngest subjects injected so far have been age 17, but the eventual goal, if the work continues to prove to be safe, would be to try to extend to younger subjects who really have the best chance for a good outcome.",
        "Now, ever since the death of Jesse Gelsinger, the field has been slowed.",
        "Do you feel that successes like these might help things pick up a bit?",
        "Again?",
        "Well, I think, in any type of novel therapeutic, not necessarily just gene therapy, but you know, there's always slow development at the beginning, because what one finds is that not every single problem or every single issue for human therapeutics will have been accurately predicted by work in animals.",
        "So at the beginning, as the clinical work starts, problems are uncovered.",
        "And sometimes it means the people have to go back to the laboratory and sort out what's going on and make a new attempt.",
        "But as experience accumulates, these problems are overcome and worked through more rapidly.",
        "And so I think that we can expect that the pace of this sort of work will pick up as more experience is gained.",
        "You know, why use viruses at all?",
        "In this age of polymers and nanotechnology and things like that, could we not design a nanoparticle or something that could carry the gene in?",
        "Well, you know, that's a really good question, too.",
        "And I have to say that, you know, when you think about it, viruses have evolved over millions of years to be really good at what they do.",
        "So they have a pretty good head start on us in the laboratory.",
        "So you know, this viral vector, for example, was actually a fairly simple sort of thing.",
        "It's got 60 molecules that assemble together to make a little capsid, and then you just put a piece of DNA inside that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, you know, it's hard to imagine that you could come up with something simpler than that would work so well.",
        "So if this is working so well in the eye, why not use it for other gene therapy?"

        "Because right now, on average, whenever we have a good promising research, it takes about 17 years for it to get in to practice.",
        "So, right now, to fill the gaps, they've been doing away with a lot of the masters', like nurse practitioners, and they've been making them doctorate level.",
        "Like, I know the University of Washington has gotten rid of their master's level and there're just doctorate-level nurse practitioners now.",
        "And the hope is, is that they'll help fill the gap and get some of this research in to the practical application a lot quicker than the 17 years it takes now.",

        "I think it's probably important to point out that for rare conditions like this, typically, the drug or the therapeutic can be licensed, following a relatively small trial.",
        "So, for example, some of the drugs that we used to treat hemophilia were licensed on trials of 50 patients.",
        "And I would expect that for this sort of condition, which is much rarer than hemophilia, that a relatively small trial, if it continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy, would be acceptable for licensing of the therapy.",

        "Is it all possible that a vector could mutate or affect a person who is not getting the therapy?",
        "Well, that's a really good question, but the way this particular viral vector is made, the genes that are usually part of the virus and that are required in order for a virus to replicate have been completely deleted.",
        "So, they are not present.",
        "The only piece of DNA there is the DNA encoding this protein that should be in the retinal-pigment epithelial cells.",

        "In the dog studies, the dog that was first treated was treated eight years ago, and a single treatment, eight years ago, which is long in a life of a dog, and that animal still has vision.",
        "So, certainly it's been the case in animal studies that gene expression from these vectors has been very long-lasting.",
        "But of course, we all know that the FDA doesn't license drugs based on results in animals, and that's why it's important to do clinical trials in human subjects, and we'll have to see.",
