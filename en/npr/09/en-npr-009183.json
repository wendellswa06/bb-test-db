        "Yeah, to make - to hide the virus from knowing the immune system knows that it's even there.",
        "Right.",

        "Heart researchers like Steven Nissen, head of the American College of Cardiology, had great hopes for torcetrapib.",
        "The drug raised the good cholesterol, HDL, by at least 50 percent in most clinical trials.",
        "So manufacturer Pfizer has poured a lot of effort into testing the drugs and has since headed a multi-center trial to see if the drug could reduce cholesterol buildup in arteries.",

        "It involved 15,000 people.",

        "The other half just took Lipitor.",

        "Again, Steven Nissen:",
        "Either something else was causing harm or the cholesterol, the HDL levels that we were building up weren't protecting the patients.",
        "The company immediately stopped the trial and is studying the data to see what caused the extra deaths.",
        "They'll look especially hard at conditions related to hypertension since the drug is known to slightly elevate blood pressure.",

        "She's an expert on cholesterol and heads MedStar Research Institute, part of a consortium of nonprofit hospitals in the Washington area.",
        "Now that we have very good drugs that lower LDL like statin, that's not the whole picture in the control of heart disease through lipids.",
        "The other piece is the good cholesterol, HDL.",
        "A lot of people have low levels of it and we've never had good agents to raise it.",
        "She says there are lots of options yet to try and in fact, a Pfizer spokesman says the company has several similar drugs in the pipeline.",
        "They're trying to figure out now whether the problems with torcetrapib come from lowering HDL cholesterol, lowering a certain type of HDL cholesterol or from some unique characteristic of the torcetrapib molecule itself, something that may not be in other, similar molecules."
