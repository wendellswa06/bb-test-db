        "Weeds\"\" began its third season on Showtime last week.",
        "And today, we're joined by Jenji Kohan, the creator and executive producer of \"\"Weeds.\"\" She's at the studios in Marketplace Productions in Los Angeles.",
        "And welcome to TALK OF THE NATION today.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "I'm thrilled to be here.",
        "If you have questions for the creator of \"\"Weeds,\"\" about the show or about writing for television, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK.",
        "E-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "And Jenji Kohan, I guess people would immediately see the gimmick and think this is a story about marijuana and about dealing drugs - and to some degree it is.",
        "But as that short seem - sounded - illustrated that the heart of the show is really it's a family show.",
        "It's a family show and it's also an outlaw show.",
        "I really wanted to create a show, my own version of an outlaw show.",
        "I've been watching things like \"\"The Shield\"\" and \"\"The Sopranos\"\" and I wanted to do my version of that.",
        "So that was sort of the impetus.",
        "A version set in a very - well, I guess not that different a neighborhood from Tony Soprano's, really.",
        "Not really.",
        "But yes, at the heart, at the core is a family, a deeply flawed family, as I think most families are.",
        "Deeply.",
        "And I was fascinated to read - you, of course, are married and have kids.",
        "Do you let them watch the show?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "My kids are very young, and, no. And actually, my daughter was in the first episode of the season.",
        "She played 5-year-old who peed her pants, and we could show her her dailies but not much beyond that because it's highly inappropriate.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Like the character played - the mom, played by Mary-Louise Parker, who eventually has to tell her kids what it is she's doing.",

        "Oh, they're pretty aware of what I do.",
        "And, you know, they come to the office and there's a lot of fake marijuana plants as sort of decoration.",
        "And my oldest son was at summer camp, and I came to pick him up and he told me in front of his counselor how they've gone on a hike through the woods and he saw wild marijuana.",
        "And the counselor kind of looked at me sideways and said, why does your 7-year-old know marijuana looks like?",
        "When you came up with the idea for this show - a suburban mom who sells drugs to support her family - was this a tough sell for Showtime?",
        "No, it wasn't.",
        "It was surprisingly easy.",
        "At the time, I think Showtime had a mandate.",
        "They really wanted to make some noise, and I came in with the one-line, suburban widowed, pot-dealing mom, and that was a noisy pitch and they picked up on it right away.",
        "And what we are able to find are the changes in the activity in different parts of the brain, how the different parts of the brain turn on or turn off, depending on the kind of practice and depending on the kind of experiences that they have.",
        "So this has really given us a remarkable window into what it means for people to be religious or spiritual or to do these kinds of practices.",
        "I've only had an MRI, but I found it hard to remember to breathe in an MRI.",
        "I might have found it pretty difficult to enter an ecstatic religious state.",
        "Well absolutely.",
        "And actually that's been to me part of the fun and part of the challenge of doing this kind of research.",
        "A lot of the studies that we actually started out doing used a different kind of technique, something called SPECT imaging.",
        "And what this involves is that we start off the study by putting in a small intravenous catheter in somebody's arm so that during their particular practice, we can infuse, without them knowing it, a little bit of a radioactive material.",
        "So they don't feel it at all.",
        "It doesn't distract them at all, and they can be in whatever state, whatever posture, whatever, if they're moving around, whatever they need to do, they can do it in as kind of conducive way to possible for them to replicate the kind of practices that they do in their usual spiritual place, in their church or synagogue or mosque, for example.",
        "So what's really nice about this particular technique is that it doesn't interfere with their particular practice, and it doesn't distract them, but what's also nice about it is that when we do infuse this small amount of radioactive material, it gets up in the brain, and it gets locked into the brain so that when we actually do put them into the scanner, the picture that we get tells us what was happening at the time that they were doing their practice.",
        "So, for example, if I was to inject you right now and then bring you up to Philadelphia and put you into the scanner, it would - a couple hours later, it would tell me what your brain was doing right now, while we were on the radio."

        "So it's like a snapshot in time.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's a snapshot in time, and it's a very sensitive way and a very elegant way for capturing a particular brain state.",
        "And by doing this, we have been able to compare lots of different kinds of practices.",
        "Now, you mentioned the MRI scanner.",
        "We have experimented with that, and, you know, it is difficult for people to do these kinds of practices.",
        "But sometimes if you get the real experts at it, the people who have been doing it for many, many years, they are able to overcome the barriers of having to lie down and the noise and all the things that you experienced in the scanner.",
        "And we can still get some good data.",
        "Yet, does this not suggest that you're going after a very select group, those who are masters of entering this state?",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "And to some degree, that is how we started, for the most reason is that we wanted people who we felt would be able to achieve the kind of states and do the practices appropriately the way they've always done it.",
        "And to that extent, it was important for us to take people who were very experienced.",
        "In fact, most of the people that we've studied have had at least 15 or 20 years of experience in their particular tradition and doing that particular practice.",
        "But more recently, we actually have started to work with individuals who have never done these practices before.",
        "And what we're looking at there is to scan their brain today, what they're like in just kind of the raw, how-do-they-present-to-us state, send them on a path towards doing a particular practice for several months or even years and then see what happens in their brain at some point later.",
        "So we're actually seeing whether or not there are changes that occur not just while the person is doing the practice, but does this practice cause a change in the long term, over many, many weeks, months or even years.",
        "And it does look like there are many changes that go on.",
        "So can you make your brain, you'll excuse the expression, stronger or shape your brain as you might shape your abdomen by doing sit-ups every morning?",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "One of the studies that we've just recently published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease actually took older individuals who are having memory problems, and we had them do a particular kind of meditation.",
        "It was called Kirtan Kriya.",
        "And it's kind of a mantra-based practice where you repeat certain phrases, and you have to move your fingers a little bit."

        "What we did was we took them and scanned them day one to see what they looked like.",
        "We actually taught them how to do the meditation day one and scanned them while they were doing the meditation.",
        "Then we sent them home for eight weeks to do the practice 12 minutes a day and scanned them again when they came back, about eight weeks later.",
        "And we found some very significant and profound changes in their brain just at rest, particularly in the areas of the brain that help us to focus our mind and to focus our attention.",
        "And in fact, many of the people related to us just subjectively that they felt that they were thinking clearer and that they were able to remember things better.",
        "And we had the scans to show us that we actually had changes in their brain in those areas that support those kinds of functions, and we also tested their memory and showed that they had improvements of about 10 or 15 percent in several different memory tasks.",
        "And this is only after eight weeks at 12 minutes a day.",

        "I took a mindfulness-based stress-reduction class quite a few years ago, working on my graduate work.",
        "And I know for me, what it does is, it's not just the moment, but it's the peacefulness and the perception of the world changes for me.",
        "So just like each sentence that we speak has a beginning and an end and a space between the sentences, our thoughts have that space.",
        "And when I meditate, my job is to simply expand the space between thoughts.",
        "And that's the old Zen of nothingness, if you will.",

        "Oh no, that's all.",
        "I was just going to say it carries over.",
        "What's great is the post-meditative process because when conflicts do arise, as they're naturally going to in our lives, I find that I'm just not triggered anymore.",
        "I mean, the things that might have set me off five years ago, six months ago, don't anymore.",
        "And I think more calmly through and find a more middle ground, if you will.",
        "And so it's been a wonderful experience.",
        "Oh, that's great.",
        "And I pass it on to a lot of people.",
        "And Dr. - go ahead, I'm sorry.",
        "I was going to say, the brain-scan studies that we've done really support that kind of response that people have had.",
        "On one hand, one of the things that we see are changes not only in the parts of the brain that help us to focus our attention but the parts of our brain that help us with our emotional responses, to help to lower our levels of anxiety and depression and make us feel better.",
        "And as the caller just mentioned, part of what we're seeing is not only an effect that occurs while you're doing the practice but an effect that lasts and actually has a change - causes a change in these areas of the brain even while you are at rest, when you're not meditating.",
        "So it speaks to the idea that as you do this practice, you not only change what's happening in your brain and in the way you look at the world while you're doing it, but it actually has a long-term effect.",
        "And one of the other areas of the brain that seems to be very involved in these practices is a very interesting structure called the thalamus, a very central structure in the brain that really helps us with our perceptions of reality and how we think about reality.",
        "So again, it's no surprise that these practices really change people and change the ways they look at themselves and change the ways they look at the world.",
        "I find that - you know, I find that's true, I mean, because you are looking for that space between your thoughts, you begin to recognize the thoughts in a more mindful manner when they do arise, and then for me personally, your perception of yourself, that tape loop that we play about how we feel, how we see someone, how we see ourselves, how we see the world, we're altering that tape loop.",
        "And we're learning to shut it off, actually, I mean, because our parents, our educators have always looked for ways to make the neuronal connections, but nobody ever showed us the off switch or the pause switch, and this is the pause switch.",
        "This is the switch that shuts it all down for a while and gives you peace.",
        "Richard, thanks very much for the call, good luck."
