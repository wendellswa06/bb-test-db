        "Andrew Newberg explains this relatively new field and the questions he hopes to answer in a new book, \"\"Principles of Neurotheology.\"\" It's not exactly a page-turner.",

        "Sam is a prominent neuroscientist and outspoken atheist and suggests that our religious experiences can all be explained through the sciences of brain chemistry and activity.",
        "Does he worry about the implications of such studies, i.e., if they suggest that there is something non-physical about our religious experience?",
        "And how do you separate your own religious biases from your experiments?"

        "Some great questions.",
        "Well, I think one of the main points that I tried to bring up in \"\"Principles of Neurotheology\"\" is the idea that for neurotheology to really work as a field, it needs to be very respectful and open to both perspectives, to both the scientific side that encompasses the neuro- part and the religious and spiritual side that comprises the theology part.",
        "For those individuals who want to go down the path of arguing that all of our religious and spiritual experiences are nothing more than biological phenomena, some of this data does support that kind of a conclusion.",
        "But the data also does not specifically eliminate the notion that there is a religious or spiritual or divine presence in the world that we somehow connect into.",
        "And going back to our brain scans, when we see a change in the brain when someone experiences being in God's presence, what we can say is that this is the change that we see when they experience being in God's presence.",
        "One could try to conclude, one way or the other, that maybe it's just the biology, or maybe God's really in the room, but the scan itself doesn't really show that.",
        "And part of what I've tried to explain and extrapolate a little bit more is how careful we have to be with our conclusions because as the emailer suggested, these are not simple answers, and these are not simple problems for us to resolve, and I think we have to be careful about concluding too fast one way or the other, either for the pro-religious or for the anti-religious, what the nature of these experiences are and how they affect us and what the true nature of the reality is, which in my mind is one of the most fundamental questions and also one of the things that I always try to bring up whenever we look at the topic of neurotheology because it has some very important things to say about our views of reality and how we perceive that reality and make sense of it.",
        "Have you scanned the brains of mathematicians who are accustomed to studying, you know, just thinking in-depth about complex problems?",
        "Do their brains look different than people who are speaking in tongues?",
        "Well, I personally have not.",
        "However, when people have studied mathematicians and other individuals who deeply engage in certain practices, they do show some similarities.",
        "But they also show some very fundamental differences.",
        "And when we look at people who engage in religious and spiritual practices, what our research points out is that there are many more areas of the brain that start to become active, because it's not just a cognitive process.",
        "It's not just a thinking about God, but there are the emotions, the behaviors.",
        "There's the ways in which it actually changes your thoughts and feelings about the world, that all seem to add together, that make it in some ways, I guess, a deeper or richer experience for that individual.",
        "Now again, that's not true across the board, but that's one of the things that we tend to find is the distinction that when people are religious or spiritual, they engage many different parts of their brain, more so than what other people will engage when they're just doing other kinds of practices or having other kinds of experiences.",
        "So we do see - and I think the other thing that we've studied is we actually have studied some people who are atheists, and we do see differences in the brains of an atheist than we do an individual who is religious."

        "In fact, one of our cute little studies that we did was we had a few atheists come in and actually had them try to contemplate God and asked them to focus on God.",
        "And we got a very different kind of response in their brain, obviously, than a religious person.",
        "In fact, their brain didn't really turn on very much when they focused on God, most likely because it was kind of a form of cognitive dissonance.",
        "They really couldn't grasp the concept very well because they didn't believe in it, whereas the religious person really turns their brain on and really gets very active inside their head when they engage the concept of God.",

        "Yes, I was just going to tell you all that I have - do my own meditation.",

        "So - but that part about perception of your place in the world, yes, Dr. Newberg, you found that blood flow increased to the frontal cortex, the place where we're, of course, focusing on problems.",
        "But it also decreased to other areas of the brain.",
        "Absolutely, and you're absolutely right that one of the most interesting findings that we've had is a decrease of activity in an area of the brain called the parietal lobe, which is located in the back part of the brain.",
        "And that's part of our brain that takes our sensory information and helps us to create our sense of self and how we relate that self to the world.",
        "So what we're seeing is a very profound decrease of activity in that area, which we have thought is associated with the kinds of experiences that the different listeners are relating to us, the sense of connecting to oneself, connecting to the world, kind of letting or sometimes feeling that the world goes away, or yourself goes away.",
        "And interestingly, even though they sounds like they might be disturbing kinds of experiences for people, they ultimately are very powerful experiences for people.",
        "They are very calming, very relaxing, also very alerting and very exciting, as well, which is kind of interesting because they have kind of these mixes of emotional responses, depending on what people are doing or how they're getting into that particular state.",
        "But it really speaks very significantly to the notion that their sense of who they are and how they relate to the world is being changed by these practices in very compelling and powerful ways.",

        "I studied some evolutionary psychology down at UCSD with a guy named Don MacLeod, and I was wondering if your guest could sort of weigh in on something that I had wondered about.",
        "And this is - this may sound sort of atheistic, but I was wondering if maybe a lot of our so-called God module and our tendency towards religion and feeling calmed and soothed by those types of experiences, praying, meditating and so forth, might have been an adaptive measure that we sort of selected for, if you will, because of our ability to conceptualize our own mortality.",
        "And I'll take the response off the air, thanks.",

        "And all of those may be true, and all of those may contribute to how religion helps us as individuals - not just as individuals but as a species, that really has a deep impact and in part helps us to understand why religion and spirituality has been with us for so long.",
        "It doesn't go away very easily because it seems so rooted in who we are biologically, socially, culturally and perhaps evolutionarily, as well.",
        "And to pick up on one thing that the caller just said, I don't think that that means that there's purely an atheistic or non-spiritual interpretation of that.",
        "You know, there are many individuals who are religious believers who would say, well, sure it makes sense that it's in our biology.",
        "This is how we connect with God.",
        "This is how it began to be a part of who we were as human beings.",
        "So you can take different perspectives depending on your own beliefs that you have about religious or non-religious ideas about the world, but still try to understand how and why these experiences and these practices and this biology of who we are all has come together to enable us as human beings to be - to look to religious and spiritual ideas and concepts and experiences as being very, very important and very meaningful.",

        "Oh, God module.",
