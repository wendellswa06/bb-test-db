        "Yes, yes.",

        "Yes.",
        "That - now, that's also another thing that, over time, several people who have looked at this relationship between the brain and religion have tried to make an argument that religion is really housed in one little area of the brain.",
        "I think what most of - at least my research - shows is that if there is a God part of ourselves, it's really all of us.",
        "It's the whole brain.",
        "Many different parts of the brain turn on or turn off during different kinds of religious or spiritual practices or states.",
        "We see, as we've mentioned, the frontal lobes and the thalamus and the parietal lobes, all these different areas of the brain, the emotional areas of the brain, all doing different things, depending on the practice.",
        "So it seems to me that there are many different elements of who we are that ultimately enable us to experience and/or express our religious and spiritual feelings.",
        "In fact, one very interesting study that we've been running is an online survey of spiritual experiences.",
        "And we find so much diversity in how people describe what is religious and spiritual to them - into their own lives.",
        "Some people will describe God.",
        "Some people will call it a force, a feeling of love, a feeling of energy.",
        "And what we don't know is whether those are the same experiences interpreted differently, or whether they're fundamentally different kinds of experiences.",
        "Ultimately, the people all describe them as being spiritual.",
        "So it's very - raises some very interesting questions for us to tackle as the years - in the future of this field of neurotheology.",
        "And perhaps denominational questions, too.",
        "Does a Catholic relate to the experience the same as a Protestant to a Jew, a Muslim or a Sikh or a Buddhist?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, again, this is something that really has just - we've just scratched the surface.",
        "We've done over 100 different scans of people of a variety of different traditions, but there are so many different traditions within traditions.",
        "There are many different kinds of practices and different kinds of experiences.",
        "It would be wonderful to try to really tease out - in fact, a term that I've tried to consider is the idea of a religionome, almost like the human genome, but trying to understand all the different aspects of what it means to be religious or spiritual, both from a doctrinal, theological perspective, as well as a biological one.",
        "And there's a lot for us to learn yet.",
        "And that, to me, is exciting, because it gives me a lot of things to look forward to.",
        "We're talking with Dr. Andrew Newberg, his new book, \"\"Principles of Neurotheology.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let's go next to Carla, Carla with us from Honaunau - is that right?",

        "I've been an obsessive-compulsive painter for the past 30 years, as well as a meditator.",
        "And what's solved the religious-science debate for me was studying a little quantum physics and having some pretty phenomenal experiences and realizing that if I just defined God or the universe -whatever you want to call it, as having infinite possibilities - then when you define God that way, then the whole universe becomes that way and the world becomes that way.",
        "And then there could be multiple realities, multiple universes.",

        "Well, for me, what happened was I had a kind of a spiritual experience.",
        "I was trying to paint with my right brain, and that means that you paint negative space.",
        "And I realized that the negative space was the space around the thought, okay?",
        "So I was looking at the figure I was trying to draw, and that was the thought.",
        "And the space around the thought, I thought, oh, my God.",
        "It's not - you're not the blissful spaces between the thoughts.",
        "You're the blissful space between - not between the thoughts, but around the thought.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Have you considered studying artists, as well?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "We - actually, some of our current studies have not so much looked at artists, per se, but the effect of music on the brain.",
        "And absolutely, what to me is also a very important element of religious and spiritual feelings for people is that they can manifest in so many different ways.",
        "And there's artistic creativity.",
        "There can be being out in nature, practices like meditation, formal practices like the ceremonial rituals in churches and synagogues.",
        "They're all different ways in which we can engage in these kinds of experiences.",
        "And there - I don't think that there's a right or a wrong way.",
        "Each person ultimately has to kind of find what works best for them and how they best understand it.",
        "And that, I think, also leads into what the caller had just mentioned about how do we define things.",
        "And this is something that I also take up in the book, \"\"Principles of Neurotheology,\"\" because so oftentimes, we hear people who are nonreligious say something about, well, God can't exist or there can't be a soul, or we'll have disagreements within religious individuals.",
        "And part of the problem is, is that sometimes we're not even saying - we're not even talking about the same thing.",
        "We're talking about God, but somebody may mean one thing and somebody may mean something entirely different.",
        "So that's part of the question, too, that we have to look at, is how are we really thinking about these questions?",
        "How are we really grasping them, understanding them?",
        "What does it mean for us when we talk about something that's spiritual or religious?",
        "In fact, one of the studies that we've done is ask people to draw a picture of God, and something that all the listeners could think about doing is just go home, and what would you draw if I said draw a picture of God?",
        "And what would it look like?",
        "Because everybody draws something a little different.",
        "But that's how we try to visualize what that spiritual realm is, for the people who are spiritual.",
        "So there's some real interesting things that we could start to look at and try to better understand about who we are as people, as human beings, and how that spiritual urge affects us."
