        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "What makes a great building?",
        "Well, what makes a great tall building is a building that stands out from the normal run of the mill stuff which is - which makes up most of the tall buildings that are being built in cities around the world.",
        "The four buildings this year that we've honored from each region are definitely breaking away from the norm.",
        "Let's talk about - let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "Let's talk about the Absolute Towers in a suburb of Toronto.",
        "These towers were named best tall buildings of Americas.",
        "They've been named the Marilyn Monroe Towers because of their sky-high curves.",
        "They're curvy-looking, yet they - the curves serve a function.",
        "The curves do serve a function.",
        "And what's unique about these buildings is, again, against the backdrop of 99 percent of tall buildings being fairly boring rectilinear boxes, these are very curving organic towers, which look iconic and look incredible, but they serve a purpose.",
        "You know, one of the main forces on a tall building are wind pressures.",
        "It's not gravity.",
        "It's about wind, you know, counteracting the wind and in some areas seismic.",
        "And so a curvilinear building helps to kind of confuse the wind and split the wind around it as opposed to creating a vertical face for the wind to blow on.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "A skyscraper overlooking the Sydney Harbor was named best tall building from Asia and Australia.",
        "Why?",
        "Why was this tall building a standout?",
        "Well, this, again, is a very beautiful tower, but that is innovating in that a large part of the building is naturally ventilated.",
        "And we lost our way with tall buildings in architecture generally maybe 60, 70 years ago when we had the freedom to disconnect them from their environment by creating enclosed, mechanically ventilated boxes.",
        "So this is a, you know, a 60-story tower in Sydney which uses the wind, the ventilation, to naturally ventilate a huge atrium, which runs the full height of the building.",
        "Quite innovative.",
        "You say that 95 percent of the tall buildings in the world are terribly designed."

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, you know, tall buildings tend to be designed in one or two ways.",
        "They're either extruded efficient floor plans - really, they're just commercially clad space - or they tend to be just sculptural icons.",
        "And what concerns me about that is that, you know, I'm interested in the differences between cities, the differences between cultures, not necessarily the similarities.",
        "And architecture is homogenizing cities around the world, and tall buildings are homogenizing cities.",
        "A tall building may become synonymous with a place, but it doesn't mean that it's born of that place.",
        "You can almost pick it up and put it in any city around the world and it would become synonymous with that city.",
        "And it denying thousands of years of vernacular architectural tradition, you know...",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "...to relate to environment and all these other things.",
        "So that's where the 95 percent figure, an arbitrary figure, comes from.",
        "The Twin Towers in Abu Dhabi received the tall building innovation award.",
        "These buildings carry their own sunscreen, in a sense.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is, again, completely innovative.",
        "You know, part of the problem that we have with tall buildings is building them all out of glass and then having to go to gymnastics to kind of cover them up on the outside, and we see that in America.",
        "But in intense solar environments like the desert, it makes even less sense.",
        "This is an innovative way to control this.",
        "It actually, to my knowledge, for the first time creates this skin on the outside made up of, you know, hundreds of modules, which can open and close by computer control, depending on the angle of incident sun.",
        "So if the sun's on the other side of the building, the modules open up and allow natural daylight into the space.",
        "And if the sun is incident on the building, then those modules close up and block the sun from entering.",
        "Yeah, you'll be out of work.",
        "So…"

        "It's a new kind of politics, but it's not warfare.",
        "People get excited about things like this, but the denial-of-service attacks that we see are the most basic form of attacks.",
        "This is nothing compared to warfare, but it is like a big demonstration.",
        "It is like those anarchists who march in front of the IMF and throw bricks and wear black scarves, so, you know, there's an effect.",
        "Denial-of-service attacks, this is flooding someone's website with requests and basically overwhelming it.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And the people who set this up, the Anonymous folks, have done a pretty good job of recruiting a lot of people to install something on their computers that will let them attack whatever the target of the moment is.",
        "Well, we've been accustomed to this being used by spammers who seize your computer illicitly and secretly and you become part of a botnet.",
        "That's correct, and, you know, this is not a new technique.",
        "When the Russians were annoyed with Estonia a few years ago, because they had moved a statue of a World War II Soviet solider, this is what they did.",
        "They did a denial-of-service attack, and it - you know, again, it wasn't war.",

        "You saw it against the Georgians, so denial of service is basic.",
        "It's common.",
        "It happens all the time, and it's a way to make a statement.",
        "And is it effective?",
        "No, no. In fact, one good test about whether the agency or the target has been awake for the last two or three years is if they have any trouble with the denial-of-service attack, and if they do, that's a bad sign because this has been around for years.",
        "People should know how to deal with it.",
        "And the - tell us about who is behind it, this group Anonymous.",
        "Well, it looks like another one of these coalitions that form on the Internet of people with shared political beliefs and common views and they find a way to communicate.",
        "Some people talk about a website called 4chan, and that was a place where they all got together, and they feel very strongly - they have a strong anarchistic streak, and they feel strongly about Assange and decided to make a statement.",
        "The group had been associated with disputes with the Church of Scientology."
