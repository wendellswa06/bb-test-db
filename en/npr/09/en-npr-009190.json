        "An image forum is basically a place where you post a picture of something and then you write some kind of blurb about it.",

        "Well, you'd think being stamped \"\"secret\"\" would be protection enough.",

        "And if you could move these documents into the IP protections, maybe you could have a better hook for going after them.",
        "But just a hard process.",
        "And so, you know, WikiLeaks exploited a vulnerability that has existed in the system, and we'll probably find some way to fix it.",
        "IP might just be too hard because of all the economic issues around it.",
        "Well, a lot of people are saying, yes, WikiLeaks has been the purveyor of all of this, but the State Department is responsible for lax security and making these things too easy to get.",
        "Yeah, that was the big problem, is a single private should not have been able to download 250,000 cables onto a Lady Gaga CD.",
