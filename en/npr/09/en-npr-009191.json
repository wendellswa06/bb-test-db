        "As a commentator earlier was saying, oh, these aren't effective at all.",
        "And arguably that's true, you could say that the sit-ins were not effective and they didn't really hurt people's business or anything along those lines.",
        "But in the court of public opinion, it does change people's attitudes and points of view to the situation at hand.",
        "Just to point out, a lot of the sit-ins were consciously illegal, trespassing among other things and that was partly the point, but...",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yes, but when we talk about them now, do we talk about them as criminals, say, in a North Carolina luncheonette, or do we talk about them as activists?",

And that's what's great about the Doha Tower, which we didn't discuss yet, which is the winner of the Middle East region, a project by Jean Nouvel Architects, which have a fantastic, beautiful Islamic fretwork on the outside of the building which is doing two things - one, again, it's protecting from that intense solar environment, but it's also a beautiful expression of the local culture.",

        "But it's tended to be regionally concentrated.",
        "You could think late 19th-century Chicago or Art Deco New York or post-Second World War Europe.",
        "But what we've seen in the last 15 years is the simultaneous construction of more and taller tall buildings across virtually the entire globe.",
        "And although that has been, you know, held a little bit in check by the economic recession, certainly in Western countries, the interesting thing is that the global numbers of tall buildings being completed every year has continued to rise year on year, every year for the last 15 years, and will continue to do so for the next few years, despite the recession, because of Asia.",
        "I mean the tall buildings that are coming online in China, India, Indonesia and places like that is incredible, so in terms of global numbers, absolutely increasing the number buildings and great height.",
