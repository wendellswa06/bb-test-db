        "You're on the air.",
        "Yeah.",
        "My question is for Jenji.",
        "I recently discovered your show through my roommate, who was watching the second season, and I absolutely love it.",
        "I really like the - the comedy seemed, you know, realistic and dark and good.",
        "And then, I - you know, backtracked and started watching season one and I saw a pretty marked difference between the two seasons.",
        "In my own view, it seems like season one was maybe a little more character-focused than - and season two a little more, I don't know, comedy-driven.",
        "What are your thoughts on that?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Okay, Chris.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, when we set out to do this show, we really wanted each season to be its own thing.",
        "We didn't want to find a good template for a show and then write the same show over and over again.",
        "So every season is markedly different.",
        "And what we like to do is look at the finale of the previous season as sort of a pilot for the upcoming season, and the tone should feel different.",
        "It's a new adventure.",
        "It's a new year.",
        "And we want to keep it fresh for ourselves in the writer's room, so we reinvent the show to a certain extent every season.",
        "And some people have said this third season is much darker than the previous two.",
        "Yeah, it's definitely dark.",
        "I mean, we finished the previous season on a very sort of Tarantino-suspenseful note.",
        "And the stakes are higher this season and the tension is higher.",
        "And to some degree, I guess the question has to be raised.",
        "Your lead character sells marijuana.",
        "Would she - is she meant to be sympathetic and would she be as sympathetic if she were selling meth?",
        "No, I definitely think that marijuana was the perfect vehicle for this show.",
        "While it's a Schedule I narcotic, I don't think it's perceived as such.",
        "I think it's the funny drug.",
        "I think it's a substance that you find in every family across every economic, social, political, gender line - you know, there's a pot smoker in every family.",
        "There's a certain familiarity with it.",
        "It's not linked to crime and addiction - although that's debatable - and it's a really good tool for us because it's illegal, but it's illegal-light.",
        "Let's get Steve(ph) on the line and Steve is with us from Flint, Michigan."

        "I've been watching it since the first season, and in my opinion, it's right up there with \"\"Curb\"\" and the other shows on the premium channels \"\"The Wire\"\" and \"\"The Sopranos.\"\" So I think - I mean, you've well accomplished your goal of wanting to have a show of that caliber.",
        "Oh, thank you very much.",
        "And my question was do you think you'll be exploring, you know, some of the more political issues as far as, you know, the laws and things of that with marijuana and so on and so forth?",
        "Well, you know, we are political.",
        "We do definitely tip the sacred cows.",
        "But in terms of marijuana, we don't necessarily have an agenda.",
        "We don't have a political agenda concerning the drug.",
        "We work really hard to be neutral.",
        "We want to present it as something that just is, and this is how our characters are dealing with it and responding to it.",
        "We don't want to say, you know, it's the gateway to hard drugs and we don't want to say it's the savior of mankind.",
        "It's a tool.",
        "And I think for us to be effective in our storytelling, we have to stay neutral.",
        "Some of the characters as they have experienced the drug - I mean, they seem to have a good time, on the other hand, they also seem to get pretty stupid.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, everyone responds differently.",
        "And, you know, for some people, it's a wonderful medication.",
        "For other people, it's recreation.",
        "And for other people, it's escape and damaging.",
        "You know, I think it's a case-by-case thing and I'm certainly not prepared to climb onto a soapbox and take a stand.",
        "Although personally, I think it should be legalized and regulated and taxed and - but that would be the end of the show.",

        "And then Malvina came through, but we had all this cover versions, and one of our producers, Mark Burley, said, you know, some of these are really good, maybe we should try to get more.",

        "We had a lot of blind submissions, we even made some requests, and we can't pay a lot for the covers but people are doing, you know, their sort of labor of love, and it's been very, very exciting because we're all music heads over at \"\"Weeds\"\" so when we…",

        "I don't know if we pursued her, but when her version came in, we just loved it.",
        "Yeah.",
