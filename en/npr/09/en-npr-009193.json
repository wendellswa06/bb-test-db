        "You know, we were - her room was there to help but, especially first season, that was her brainchild and, you know, I like to think I helped break stories and stuff, but I can't take much credit for \"\"Gilmore Girls\"\" or say that I had a great influence on the show.",
        "It was another job that I enjoyed and then moved on.",
        "The show is half an hour.",
        "I guess there have been other shows on primetime cable outlets that - there are half an hour - \"\"Sex and the City,\"\" you think of, but why was the decision made to make it a half-hour show?",
        "Showtime was in the market for a \"\"comedy,\"\" quote, unquote.",
        "And the perception is that comedy is a half-hour.",
        "And while I think we're a mix of comedy and drama - come-drama as one of our producers calls it - they wanted a half-hour show.",
        "At first, I'd asked for an hour and they said no. In the end, I'm actually glad it's a half-hour.",
        "I think there's a certain economy that we're forced to stick with.",
        "And the storytelling is minimal and brisk and it's kind of exciting to get as much as we can into those 30 minutes.",
        "It's a dense program.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's very, very dense.",
        "And this is a program - it's hard to imagine it airing in any version on - even on basic cable.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There was some discussion of doing alternate versions for things, but I think it would be too overwhelming for us to replace everything that might be construed as inappropriate for mainstream.",
        "Although you have networks like Comedy Central and FX that are taking more and more risks.",
        "On the other hand, they still have advertisers to answer to and that the slippery slope.",

        "They mobilized thousands of security personnel to hedge their bet, but in the end none of it worked.",
        "And we had this extraordinary sight today of hundreds, maybe thousands, of these red-shirted demonstrators streaming through the conference center unhindered.",
        "And I have to say, the Oxford-educated Abhisit, who's normally very smooth, looked a bit rattled.",

        "No, no. The people who closed the airport represent the other extreme in Thailand - deeply polarized political scene.",

        "I don't know if you remember, but they occupied the prime minister's office for a couple of months last year, then went after the airports in a successful effort to force what was then a Thaksin-friendly government from office with the connivance, Thaksin supporters claim, of the military and the courts.",
