        "The Colts, of course, are last year's Super Bowl champions, and so far this season, are undefeated at 7-and-0.",
        "The Patriots are a perfect 8-and-0, and this will be the first time in NFL history that two undefeated teams have met so late in the season.",
        "And with their star quarterbacks - Peyton Manning of the Colts, Tom Brady for the Patriots - this one should be a shootout.",
        "But it's remarkable the Patriots are favorite by as many as five points to win in Indianapolis.",

        "Well, think about this.",

        "This is the thing about the tax code.",
        "Everyone wants it to be more efficient and simpler, but you don't want to lose the things that benefit you personally.",
        "The argument Republicans are going to make to try to counter that is that it's much simpler - that 90 percent of families now will be able to file their taxes on a postcard because it doubles the standard deduction and they're not going to take itemized deductions anymore.",
        "It's going to be easy and hopefully - and for the bulk of American families, I should say, a tax cut.",
