        "So this is a case where the Occupy Wall Street protesters have distorted the details, but they really have it right in spirit.",
        "That was a case in which the Southern Pacific Railroad was protesting taxes that had been placed on it by California and by counties in California.",
        "And in that case, the chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, Morrison Waite, stood up in January of 1886 and said what pretty much everybody in the courthouse thought, which was that corporations were persons for the purposes of the 14th Amendment.",
        "The 14th Amendment dating from right after the Civil War; the Equal Protection Clause is what we're talking about.",
        "Yeah, the Equal Protection Clause applies to all persons.",
        "It provides that all persons have a right to equal protection under the laws.",
        "And that question wasn't controversial at the time.",
        "What mattered, really, was what happened later.",
        "Meaning what, exactly?",
        "What the court started to do around the turn of the 20th century and into the 20th century was to begin to force legislatures at the state level and the federal Congress to treat metaphysical persons - that is to say, corporations - the same as natural persons for purposes of contracting and rights to property.",
        "And more recently in this century, we do see the term corporate personhood also applied to the landmark Citizens United case - the Supreme Court lifting restrictions on corporate spending for political campaigns.",
        "Was that case also argued on these same grounds of corporate personhood?",
        "Well, for the Citizens United case, corporate personhood wasn't required for purposes of the majority's decision to strike down the regulations on campaign spending.",
        "Corporate personhood was invoked by the four dissenters in Citizens United.",
        "What the dissenters said was that the differences - which are very real, of course - between natural persons and metaphysical persons, or corporations, might be a good reason to distinguish between natural persons and corporations for purposes of regulating speech.",
        "Well, Professor Witt, I wonder what you think when protesters and Occupy Wall Street talk about ending corporate personhood.",
        "What would that mean from a legal point of view?",
        "I don't think we'd want to end corporate personhood in the sense that ordinary people - including people in the Occupy Wall Street movement - may want to get together and form groups, which should have respect of the legal process.",
        "What we might want to do - and this is what the Occupy Wall Street folks have right - is recognize the different characteristic features of large groups invested with powerful amounts of capital in our political process.",
        "What Waite was attentive to in 1886, in the Santa Clara County case, was that corporations didn't have to be treated the same as natural persons.",
        "They were metaphysical persons.",
        "And that fact was something that the law could take into account."

        "We're coming to the end of a summer of fierce debate over health care.",
        "It may be followed by an autumn of fierce debate over health care.",
        "Even if you've only paid passing attention, you probably heard warnings like this from the conservative group 60 Plus.",

        "Seniors may lose their own doctors.",
        "The government, not doctors, will decide if older patients are worth the cost.",
        "These claims are not strictly accurate, but they do scare people.",
        "And NPR's Julie Rovner says experts agree on one thing: fear works.",
        "Health care historian Jonathan Oberlander of the University of North Carolina says there's one main reason every health overhaul effort for the past century has ended in failure.",
        "The opponents of reform have used fear, and they have used fear very successfully.",
        "As early as 1915, the first time the idea of National Health Insurance was broached, opponents scared the public by tying would-be health care reformers to the U.S.'s biggest overseas opponent of the day."

        "And they said that national health insurance was a plot by the German emperor to take over the United States, and that was the first time people really used scare tactics in this debate, and that has happened again and again.",
        "When Harry Truman tried to push national health insurance in the late 1940s, American's biggest fear was no longer Germany, so the argument changed accordingly.",
        "And the opponents of reform said that if we adopt a national health insurance, they suggested the Red Army would be marching through the streets of the United States, as this was the first step to communism.",
        "And again, they connected health reformers to another country we don't like very much, which was the Soviet Union.",
        "Yeah, I did it.",

        "I have been, of course, talking to Chinese leaders for 40 years, now.",

        "We are going to be the two strongest societies in the world - countries in the world.",
        "We're going to impinge on each other in every part of the world.",
        "And there are many problems that have arisen that can only be dealt with on a global basis.",
        "So what - how this relationship will evolve will be of crucial importance.",
        "So about three - two, three years ago, I began to consider whether I could draw, from the conversations that I have had or participated in, some conclusions with respect to these questions.",
        "As I reflected about that, it seemed to me necessary to go back to the history, so that it is not a book about my experiences in China, but it is a book about the way two societies that have had a different cultural background and a different trajectory in their history can interact with each other.",
        "And that evolved over the last three or four years.",
        "If you look back at the moment in 1969, just before the first moves were made by Mao and then responded to by Nixon, or the other way around - I mean, President Nixon made a couple of very tentative moves toward the Chinese.",
        "At that moment, there were a million Soviet troops on China's northern border.",
        "There had actually been some rather fierce battles - I remember reporting on them from Hong Kong in 1969.",
        "And at the same time, on their southern border, in Vietnam, you had half a million U.S.",
        "troops.",
        "Had you looked at things differently - you had just come into your new office as the president's national security advisor.",
        "Had you looked at things from more of a Chinese point of view back then, I am forced to the conclusion that we could have been out of Vietnam a lot sooner.",
        "I'd like your response.",
        "Well, it's a conclusion that was certainly hidden from us, and I don't remember anyone arguing that point.",
        "But how exactly could we have accomplished this?",
        "Well, what I'm saying is, if you - if instead of looking at China as being the threat, where Chinese communism was going to, first of all, overrun Vietnam and then eventually move westwards until they reached Hawaii, you might have looked at China as being a country that regarded itself as being threatened by the Soviets in the north and by the Americans in the south."

        "Well, first of all, the administration which I served was not the administration that made the American commitment to Vietnam.",
        "The administration in which I served came into office and found 550,000 troops already in place, and they had been put there on the basis of a theory in the two previous administrations, from a different party, which argued that there was a unified communist conspiracy moving from Moscow to Beijing to Hanoi that was threatening American security.",
        "When the Nixon administration came into office, we concluded fairly quickly that this was not the - probably - the correct interpretation, and we began removing troops from Vietnam within the first three months.",
        "And in the first two years, we ended all combat involvement of ground forces in Vietnam, and withdrew at a rate of about 150,000 a year.",

        "And the signals - one signal occurred in the Johnson administration, and the other signal occurred in the Nixon administration.",
        "But one shouldn't think of foreign policy like a detective story, in which the other side throws out vague signals and you have to guess at the answer.",
        "What happened was that China and the United States had not had any contact with each other for 20 years.",
        "In each country - certainly in ours and probably in China, there were elements who believed that the relationship between the two countries would be irreconcilably hostile.",
        "So each side had the problem of how to make an overture without, at the same time, embarrassing itself by a rejection.",
        "We went to Romania and asked Romania to pass messages to Beijing.",
