        "I would say the most significant conversation about the subject that you raise didn't occur on the plane.",
        "On the plane going out, the president was preoccupied with trying to deal with the public reaction to the visit and the various reports that were coming in about senatorial and congressional and media attitudes.",
        "But on the night after the final dinner, I - Nixon asked me to come to his room, and that had a veranda attached to it, overlooking Shanghai.",
        "And there, he was reflecting, and I would say we were both reflecting about the significance of this visit and the impact it might have on international affairs.",
        "Can you let us into some of the details of that now, 40 years later?",
        "Well, there was nothing spectacularly secret about them.",
        "We were not - we had discussed the details of the relationship already during the meetings with the Chinese.",
        "What we were mostly reflecting about is what impact it might have on Soviet relations, on the probability of ending the war in Vietnam, and what might happen if a triangular relationship, in fact, developed between China, the United States and Soviet Union, what consequences it should have for American foreign policy.",
        "And one conclusion to which we came was that it was in the American national interest to stay closer to each of these great communist powers than they were to each other.",
        "Here's an email we have from a listener, Kate, in Santa Barbara, California, who says: I'm a young reporter for all-news WINS in New York City, out in Queens, covering a hostage situation - big news.",
        "I'm catching cops, sneaking around the back of the project, begging locals for use of their home phones to plug in my alligator clips - remember them - going live three times an hour.",
        "Then I call in breathless to hear: Can't take you now.",
        "You can stand down.",
        "Henry Kissinger has just gone to China.",

        "Yeah.",
        "My question is for Henry Kissinger.",
        "If we believe in democracy and that legitimate representation only comes through the electoral process, does it work against our best interests by pretending that leaders, like in China, represent the Chinese people?",
        "We are not pretending - we are not making any claim, or we were - as to who represents the Chinese people.",
        "Our oblig-- necessity at that time was to deal with the Chinese leaders that existed and with the Chinese that had been in power for 30 years and that represented the impact on the security situation in the world.",
        "The United States...",

        "Let me just follow up on that, for a moment.",
        "When you talk about dealing with governments that were not elected by the people, we have to go a little bit further with Mao Zedong.",
        "He was, arguably, the greatest killer of the 20th century.",
        "During the course of both the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, arguably, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 million people or more died.",
        "And they died as a direct consequence of policies that he implemented.",
        "When you deal with someone like that, can you allow that even to become a part of the equation?",
        "We didn't know the exact magnitude of the deaths, but we know that a horrendous famine had occurred in China, and that the casualties were huge.",
        "Now, it - the problem that existed at the time was to deal with a situation in which the Soviet Union might attack China.",
        "China, which had been a fundamental enemy of the United States, was in a position in which, for its own reasons, it chose to soften relations and to take off the pressures where it was exercising pressures.",
        "And it was therefore thought to be in the national interest of the United States to deal with them.",
        "And every succeeding presidency from both political parties has come to the same conclusion.",
        "Gary, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And if I could just follow up, as you know, your book has attracted some criticism, including - just to follow up on Ted's point - some who argue that you considerably low-ball the casualties in the Cultural Revolution, that it was, you say, more than 20 million.",
        "Others say at least 30, maybe 40 million people.",
        "And as you've probably read in the Sunday Times, the reviewer, Frank Dikotter, said the book comes alarmingly close to reading like an official Communist Party version of the country's history.",
        "Hard to avoid the conclusion that Kissinger is extraordinarily blinkered and apologetic.",
        "Well, I didn't see that particular review, because most of the other reviews did not make anything like that point.",
        "I fail to understand - I was saying that the casualties were over 20 million.",
        "This is not a book about the details.",
        "And I would make that you cannot make a moral distinction between whether it was 20 million or 40 million.",
        "The condemnation is equally great.",
        "I have no difficulty accepting the higher figure.",
        "I'll accept whatever figure is demonstrated.",
        "The research that I did led me to believe that over 20 million was accurate enough.",
        "I draw no moral conclusion from whether it's the difference is 20 million or 40 million.",
        "And from the moral point of view, the condemnation is equally strong, whether it was 40 million or 20 million.",
        "And I'm happy to join the condemnation at the level of 40 million.",
        "That is not - I certainly made clear that it was an unmitigated disaster, and that there were huge casualties.",
        "And this, I think, is one of these reviewing points that people make to press home some other issue.",
        "It is not an issue with me.",
        "...and I got to my plate and popped one of the bubbles that was on the plate, and yeah, the ring shows up.",
        "Right.",
        "But no one knew to look for them before.",
        "I think you can understand, Dr. Kissinger, that it's relevant in the current climate, when the question is raised: Should the United States be involving itself actively in what's happening in Syria, or in places like Zimbabwe?",
        "Or whether we should have involved ourselves actively in Libya.",
        "These are all issues in which the question of human rights is raised and the larger question is then raised whether, when human rights are being abrogated in a country like that, whether the United States has a moral or practical obligation to become involved.",
        "What would your answer be?"

        "And I'm tracing that, in the book, through the various administrations.",
        "But when you're dealing with a country which is a continuing element in the international equation, you have to consider the consequences, not just of your rhetoric, but of the specific actions you can undertake.",
        "A number of American presidents - President Bush, President Clinton - undertook sanctions against China in order to vindicate their human rights views.",
        "And in both cases, they were gradually abandoned because it was felt that the consequences - that the benefits did not match the price one paid for it.",

        "There was no delay in the peace efforts in Vietnam in order to conduct diplomacy with China.",
        "On the contrary, we started negotiations with the Vietnamese almost immediately that the administration came into office.",
        "And these negotiations stalled on one point and one principal point only, which was the right of the people of Vietnam to choose their own future.",
        "The North Vietnamese insisted that we turn them over to a communist regime.",
        "And that is a condition we were not willing to meet.",
        "And once the Vietnamese accepted the principle of their free determination, we settled very quickly.",
        "Secondly, let me tell you a bit about secret bombing.",
        "The so-called secret bombing took place in a strip 10 miles wide along the Cambodian-Vietnamese border, in which four Vietnamese divisions sat, concentrated on the Cambodian side, launched attacks into Vietnam.",
        "The bombing occurred after 2,500 Americans had been killed in one month at the very beginning of the Nixon administration, before any peace movement could even have taken effect.",
        "And we were bombing Cambodia - Vietnamese concentrations on Cambodian soil, in territory that was essentially unpopulated, something we do every day in populated territory in Pakistan.",
        "And the issue is the same.",
        "When there are sanctuaries from which American and other forces are being attacked, what should do the United States do and what should a president do?",

        "And, Secretary Kissinger, fascinating to read in your book about the long history of a China that was very largely self-sufficient and needed very little from the outside world.",
        "That, of course, is not the case today when China is terribly interested in acquiring all sorts of commodities - and, principally, oil - from many places in the world.",

        "The South China - from around the world, the South China Sea problem is a different one.",
