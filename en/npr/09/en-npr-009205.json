        "So we have to make at least the attempt to avoid drifting into a series of confrontations on local issues, which will gradually escalate into a new Cold War-type situation, now conducted on an absolutely global basis and in a much more complex way.",
        "Yes, I can conceive that tensions will arise, and if they end - as I pointed out in the book - both sides has have to practice this collaborative approach for it to work.",
        "It cannot be done by one side unilaterally.",
        "Following up on exactly that point - and interestingly, on the same point you confronted 40 years ago in Beijing - Joe(ph) in Minneapolis sends an email: What's the future for Taiwan?",
        "What are the odds that it will come into conflict with Mainland China?",
        "Zero?",
        "Near zero?",
        "Could anything happen?",
        "What are the odds of their reunification?",
        "Never or maybe, if the right circumstances develop?",
        "Right now, the two sides are operating on three principles.",
        "The United States has accepted the notion of one China.",
        "It has also insisted on a peaceful solution, and it has also urged both sides to avoid unilateral acts that increase tensions.",
        "On the basis of these general principles and as they've been expressed in the Shanghai Communique, there have been 40 years in which the military tension has been minimal.",
        "As time goes on, one can hope that negotiations between the two sides will take place in which the autonomy of Taiwan and its ability to develop in its own direction will be respected.",
        "And until that is achieved, the principles that I have outlined should govern our conduct.",
        "I see no American government that is - that will abandon the principle of a peaceful resolution.",
        "Let's see if we could get Mark(ph) on the line, Mark with us from Los Gatos in California.",
        "Hello, Dr. Kissinger; Ted.",
        "Great to be a part of the conversation.",
        "I'd like to say, to begin with, I respect Dr. Kissinger tremendously.",
        "I think that his knowledge and prowess in the political arena is something that we could sorely use today.",
        "A very quick question to deviate from China, what are his views on the Middle East peace situation between Palestine and Israel, and how would he conduct things if he was in a position to do so at the moment?",
        "The - that's not a question that one can answer in a few minutes.",
        "The Palestinian issue is embedded in the overall Arab attitude towards Israel and in the Israeli perception of the threat to it.",
        "What is needed in a peace settlement, the basic outline, despite the disputes between the president and Netanyahu has been pretty well established, namely that the settlement will follow more or less the '67 lines except for the settlements that are located around Jerusalem so that some defensive depths can be created.",
        "On the Palestinian side, it is necessary to give some content to the word peace.",
        "It isn't enough, simply, to recognize the state of Israel as a state.",
        "There has to be a reduction of the propaganda that seeks the extermination of Israel and some increase in local contact and contact within the region.",
        "These objectives, at times, seem close to realization.",
        "At this moment, with the various revolutions sweeping the Arab world, it is very difficult to find a partner whose assurances can be extended over a long enough period of time to make up for the territorial reductions that Israel will suffer by withdrawing from most of the occupied territory.",
        "Doesn't Israel have a responsibility to do something on its behalf too?",
        "Is it all on the Arabs?"

        "Right.",

        "national interest?",
        "And what is it about Libya then that engages it more, for example, than what is going on in Syria?",
        "Well, I have stated publicly that I was very uneasy about the Libyan enterprise.",
        "What engaged the American interest was the fear of a massacre in the Benghazi region and the conviction that we could not stand by in the face of the threat by Gadhafi that they would go house by house and cleanse out the opponents.",
        "It's gone, however, now from this essentially humanitarian mission to an attempt to - which will be successful - to overthrow Gadhafi.",
        "And my concern is that we will be obliged - will be obliged to go into another nation-building exercise in a state that has not been a state really for all of its history, that has been run as the personal possession of Gadhafi.",
        "And having said all of this, now that we are engaged in this enterprise, we at least ought to achieve the objective of removing Gadhafi, although I probably would not have recommended this as a military operation.",
        "But if the humanitarian reasons for going into Libya were sufficient for U.S.",
        "engagement, why does not the same imperative apply to Syria and any number of other countries around the world?"

        "Because we don't have the resources nor the willingness to engage in every civil war.",
        "We have to understand it's about humanitarian intervention.",
        "If we intervene militarily in a humanitarian case, it will almost inevitably lead to an attempt to bring about regime change, because one is intervening against a government's action against its people.",
        "I favor that as a principle.",
        "But as a practical matter, one is then engaged in a war to the death with the government concerned.",
        "Now, if the government is sufficiently small, if its - if the casualties we would suffer are acceptable to the American public, it is absolutely the moral thing to do.",
        "But if one is dealing with a country of the magnitude of China, and maybe even of Syria, then the idea of American military intervention as a general principle will exhaust us and draw us into the kind of conflict that tore us apart in Vietnam.",

        "And, therefore, I think, the Libyan military part should be brought to a rapid conclusion, recognizing that at the end of it, we will face a very painful process of nation-building, which will - I would not have stated as the principal American goal three months ago.",

        "Would they have gotten into war or would they have try to find some means of settling the disputes that led to war and which had written out of a consciousness and a belief that conflict was the inevitable nature of foreign policy?",
        "And I say this as somebody who started on international relations by studying strategy and who is generally considered a defense hawk and maybe even a hardliner.",
        "But the world that we are facing now obliges us to try to avoid sliding into this.",
