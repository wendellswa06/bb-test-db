        "What are you going to use these pigs to do?",

        "You see, Ross wants to grow human organs inside pigs, sheep and cows, organs like pancreases, livers, kidneys, even hearts.",
        "This could be one of the possible solution for shortages of organs - so potentially could save many, many people.",
        "But to do that, Ross has to first try to make embryos that are part human, part animal, and that's something critics like Stuart Newman at New York Medical College say should be off-limits.",
        "You're getting into unsettling ground that I think is damaging to our sense of humanity.",
        "Because, Newman says, it blurs the line between humans and other species and raises all kinds of possibilities that start to sound like something straight out of science fiction.",
        "We'll get into all that in a moment.",
        "But first, Professor Ross takes me to his lab to show me exactly what he's doing.",
        "He pulls open a thick, black curtain.",
        "On the other side is an eerie scene.",
        "There's a big microscope.",
        "Something under the microscope's glowing orange and yellow.",

        "So there is 15 embryos there in the dish.",
        "Fifteen pig embryos, embryos that have been genetically engineered so they can't grow their own pancreases.",
        "The idea is to put human cells into the pig embryos so a human pancreas will grow instead.",
        "Everything on the microscope is projected onto a big computer screen.",
        "The embryos look like big circles.",
        "Ross uses the tip of a thin glass tube to hold one of the embryos by its shell.",
        "We are going to use a laser to make a hole in that shell.",
        "After he makes the hole, Ross moves to a cluster of little black dots on the screen.",
        "What are those?",
        "So those are human stem cells.",
        "Human stem cells, which can be made from anyone's own skin cells and then can become anything in the body.",
        "Ross hopes they'll become a human pancreas.",
        "He pulls five of the stem cells into a tiny needle under the microscope.",
        "And then through that small hole, I can advance my needle containing the cells, and now we're putting two, three, four, five cells into the cavity of the embryo.",
        "And with that, he's created a part pig, part human embryo - a pig-human chimera.",
        "He does this over and over again.",
        "In less than an hour, he's got 50 chimera embryos."

        "By putting these cells inside the embryo, we hope that they will contribute to the tissues of the developing embryo.",
        "And hopefully do something that's never been done before - start to grow a human organ inside a pig embryo.",
        "After the animal's born and matures, it would be sacrificed to remove the human organ so surgeons could transplant a perfectly matched pancreas into a patient with diabetes.",
        "But for any of that to happen, Ross has to take the next step - put the chimera embryos into the wombs of female pigs.",
        "He does that across the street in a big operating room.",
        "But then he heard about a company called PayActiv.",
        "It's a tech startup that helps businesses to get their workers emergency cash for very small fees.",
        "And he signed up.",
        "Safwan Shah is the founder of PayActiv.",
        "He says the need out there is huge with so many Americans paying really high fees in interest when they're short of cash.",
        "Our data analysis showed that it was close to $150 a month being paid by the working poor - poor employee or poor hourly worker in this country.",
        "That's a substantial sum of money because it's about $1,800 to $2,000 a year.",
        "And Shah realized that often people don't need to borrow very much money, and he says actually workers have usually already earned the cash that they need by working enough hours.",
        "They just hadn't been paid yet.",
        "So we said the problem is really a between paychecks problem.",
        "So his PayActiv company lets workers get access to that money that they've already earned.",
        "Workers at many companies now, including Walmart, download an app to their phone and that's linked to the employer's payroll system.",
        "So if they've worked, you know, nine days and they got to $100 each day, so let's say they've already earned $900 but payroll is still five days away.",
        "So they will see a number which is half of the amount they have earned that is accessible to them.",
        "So if they need that $400 for a car repair or a trip to visit a sick brother, they tap a few buttons, and the money gets zapped to their checking account or a prepaid card.",
        "And the fee is $5, which sounds a lot better than getting stuck in a cycle of debt with costly payday loans.",
        "The app also has some creative ways to nudge employees to build up a savings account so that they're not chronically strapped for cash."
