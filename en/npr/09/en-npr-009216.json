        "One is the memoir who says, here's why everything was so great.",
        "A second category is what you could think of as the if only they'd listened to me memoir - that is, explaining failures by saying, you know, I had the right view all along.",
        "And finally, there is the fighting memoir, saying we were right, we're still right, and here is the case why.",
        "And that certainly is the genre that Karl Rove's book seems to be in.",
        "Interestingly, his surface case about the Bush administration policies, whether it's going into Iraq or Scooter Libby and Joe Wilson or whatever, that may be less significant than his political argument - a kind of defense of Rovian politics, of divisiveness and polarization that seemed to be in eclipse a year ago, after President Obama was elected, but it now is sort of coming back as the main battle plan for the Republicans.",
        "And somehow, Karl Rove seems to tap into the zeitgeist more often than not.",
        "It's true.",

        "And that was my bad.",
        "Mr. Welin is correct.",
        "He goes on to say one of the things that makes the aviation community of the United States unique is the base assumption that anyone and everyone has the right to get a pilot's license and make use of the air traffic infrastructure so long as you meet the basic requirements.",
        "Laura Bundy(ph) of Fort Payne, Alabama, adds this perspective.",
        "Our general aviation airports with flight schools and flying clubs are the reason America has the most skilled and well-trained pilots in the world.",
