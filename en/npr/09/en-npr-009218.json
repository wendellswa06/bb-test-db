        "And even if we don't send an astronaut to Mars, we're still making amazing discoveries.",
        "We have discoveries every single day.",
        "One of the recent things that we discovered with Hubble is an observation from something called the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and this was an observation where Hubble stared in one part of the sky for a long time to bring out a time-lapse picture of the ancient universe.",
        "And we've observed now a galaxy - and actually, there's more than just one galaxy - that existed when the universe was only about 500 million years old.",
        "And so we're seeing for the very first time the baby pictures of the universe.",
        "Baby pictures of the universe.",

        "The science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, author of \"\"The Martian Chronicles\"\" and many other books, died last summer.",
        "He was born in 1920 and definitely came from a time when space exploration was only a dream, but it was something he deeply believed in.",
