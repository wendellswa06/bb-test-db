        "Hey, thanks for taking my call a while.",
        "I'm just kind of shocked that the biasness of the reporter so far.",
        "Being a lifelong Indianapolis Colts fan and the fact that we are the reigning Super Bowl champions, you know, it feels like the good guys are really not getting the respect that they deserve here.",
        "The blue nation is not just getting a representation that New England, it's, granted the Boston Red Sox found their way to the World Series and won again, but come on, guys.",
        "We're still 7-and-0, and we are the reigning Super Bowl champs.",
        "And we have, undoubtedly, three or four of the greatest offensive players in the NFL on the Indianapolis Colts.",
        "And right now, this doesn't seem like we're getting any love.",

        "You know, it wasn't you, Derek, you know?",
        "Congratulations on your Super Bowl.",
        "Thanks for intensifying the rivalry last January.",
        "Everyone knows that number one, that the referees and the league had to send several letters to the Patriots apologizing for some of the atrocious calls that they made in the game.",
        "You think video gate was a scandal?",
        "I think January 21st gate, when the league handed that game over to the Colts to make the Super Bowl ratings better gate is much more of a scandal.",
        "So I hope you've enjoyed your trophy for a while.",
        "Thanks for keeping Lombardi warm for us.",
        "As Drew Rosenhaus, the super agent, says, next question.",
        "Well, Derek, I think there were some listeners in Baltimore who may have chafed when you described yourself as a lifelong Colts fan.",
        "Well, that's, that's true.",
        "I didn't grow up in Baltimore, and I have lived in Indiana all of my life.",
        "And when they have come here, it's been a lifelong for the life of the Colts being in Indianapolis.",
        "So we can use that little caveat for the lifelong.",
        "But, you know, we in Indianapolis are very proud and, in the end, I think, very proud of the team we have.",
        "And it's been, you know, longtime since they've been in Indiana.",
        "We suffered through a lot of dismal seasons, and it's nice to see that the Colts are able to be successful.",
        "But it would be nice for all the national to get a little bit more respect for, you know, what Peyton Manning and Bill Polian have been able to do for Indiana.",
        "Well, good luck on Sunday.",

        "If you were 7-and-0 and the defending Super Bowl champion, I think you might be a little miffed that the visiting team was ranked the favorite.",
        "Sure.",
        "I'm not the guy who made this spread.",
        "And I actually think the game is going to be a bit more of a defensive struggle than a lot of other people think.",

        "And the Colts have not lost a game since, you know what, since late last year.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "The Red Sox, basically, for the rest of the nation, the Red Sox began Boston's sports super sweep.",

        "We've already got one trophy, one championship in our pocket, we got BC number two and the BCS, of course, you know I call (unintelligible).",
