        "Let me ask you, Dr. Schaffner first.",
        "Why this paper on the resistant staph infection, MRSA - so why is it such a big deal?",
        "It's a big deal because it documents with great certainty that over the past five or six years, this MRSA, MRSA staph infection, has become a major public health problem throughout the United States.",
        "And it documents, really, very importantly that what used to be thought of exclusively as a problem for older frail patients in intensive care units in hospitals has now become also a problem, in fact, in many ways, the more dominant problem of younger people in the community.",
        "So it's a real public health issue today, and public health departments and clinicians, both, need more awareness about this problem as we go forward.",
        "How - did it escape the hospital and spread to the community or is it out there just waiting to show up?",
        "Two things happened.",
        "Exactly as you say, the staph infection in the hospital escaped out into the community.",
        "And that's where a lot of us in public health think many of the cases are still related to previous exposure to the health care environment.",
        "But also, we have a new strain of MRSA that's community associated that's spreading in the community causing an awful lot of skin infections.",
        "I'm sure this is true and Mike's Rochester.",
        "It's certainly true in Nashville.",
        "It now causes the majority of skin infections coming into doctors' offices and into the emergency rooms.",
        "And they can get from the skin, the bug can get from the skin, into the bloodstream and then it can cause very serious disease.",
        "That's when a Texas homemaker sent her now-legendary cake recipe to a Dallas newspaper.",
        "The recipe was so popular that German's Chocolate sales shot up to 73 percent in one year.",
        "Newspapers across the country reprinted the recipe.",
        "But somewhere along the way, German's Chocolate Cake lost its apostrophe-S, leaving Germany holding the credit for a classic American dessert.",

        "(Soundbite of spike driver transmitted through the rails)",
        "It's the freakiest sound in the world if you didn't actually happen to see the machine that's making it, because there you are, standing in the middle of River Valley in western Pennsylvania, and it sounds like you're sitting next to a jungle, or something out of - I don't know - like a 1950's sci-fi movie.",

        "Zinedine Zidane, the French hero, who had come out of retirement to play in this tournament, he got sent off and I think the psychological - the psychological boost to the Italians of being one man up maybe just pushed them through the penalties.",
        "Italian soccer has been engulfed in some kind of scandal lately involving game fixing.",

        "And that's wrong.",
        "The whole problem has been the overuse and abuse of antibiotics, and that has driven the emergence of this MRSA strain into the community, and it's also what's driven the emergence of a superbug ear infection, a pneumococcus, that we've identified here in Rochester, New York.",

        "I can't let you doctors get away with blaming everything on, you know, the use of antibiotics, because I've heard other doctors say that one of the reasons they spread out of the hospital or spreads around the hospital is because you doctors don't wash your hands enough.",
