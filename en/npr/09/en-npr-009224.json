        "Ear infections are the most common reason a child receives an antibiotic and it's the second most common reason that medical care is sought for a child after the common cold.",
        "What we found is it's not common now.",
        "Our worry is that the possibility exists that the superbug we found, the Legacy strain we're calling it, could spread to other communities, may actually be in other communities.",
        "And it could spread from the nose and the ears to the lungs and the bloodstream and that could mean possibly drug-resistant meningitis and pneumonia.",
        "And we're very worried about that and that's why we took this article to the Journal of the AMA to warn doctors about that possibility.",
        "Well, when you say warn them, what are they to do with that knowledge?",
        "Unfortunately, as our article says, the superbug we've identified is resistant to all 18 FDA-approved antibiotics for kids.",
        "They would not normally reach for the adult antibiotic we found effective named Levoquin.",
        "And if they don't think of the superbug and they don't find it in the proper way by doing an ear tap on the child and discovering its presence, that child may end up with permanent hearing loss.",
        "And if it spreads to the blood and the lungs, we could be talking about very serious disease here.",
        "So if you're an M.D. or a pediatrician and you see an ear infection come in, you should assume that it might be one of these kinds of bugs?",
        "The pneumococcus that we discovered was 1.5 percent of all ear infections, so no, you don't presume that it's there.",
        "You worry about it.",
        "And if you treat the child properly with two rounds of antibiotics and they still haven't come around, then you need to do an ear tap procedure or have an ear, nose and throat doctor do an ear tap procedure to pursue the possibility of a superbug, and to determine that it's absolutely necessary to use this off label adult antibiotic to stop it.",
        "And you cannot just go and use that off label antibiotic willy-nilly because we know that the bacteria will mutate again and then we will have no antibiotic to treat these children well.",
        "Wow, so you'd better use it carefully.",
        "Yes, and I think to come back to your earlier comment, Ira, the doctors have capitulated to a society that demands quick solutions.",
        "Parents bring their children in with colds and coughs.",
        "They want antibiotics.",
        "And the doctors find it a lot easier to write a prescription than to argue with the parents or spend time counseling the parent about the fact that colds and coughs don't need antibiotics."

        "And I - there was an article, I think, in the New York Times today about a school hygienist taking a baseball bat into the locker room to make sure that the football players wash those jerseys, and the equipment.",
        "Wash the jerseys, wash the equipment.",
        "But even more important -wash themselves.",
        "A lot of these fellows - and they're mostly fellows - they go home without taking a shower.",
        "And if they take a shower, they don't use soap.",
        "They'll use the same towels throughout the season.",
        "Schools may have to decide that they're going to, like the YMCA that I go to, provide towels and the laundry of the towels, and explicit education about hygiene as well as how to do various football plays.",
        "All of them are important.",
