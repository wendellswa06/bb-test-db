        "Take us back to the 1970s.",
        "When you first thought of 401(k)s, did you assume that they would be a substitute for traditional-defined benefit pension plans or a supplement to them?",
        "Well, actually, the original plans were culmination of an enhancement for companies that had defined benefit plans to supplement those plans, plus Social Security.",
        "However, the larger usage of 401(k)s has been in smaller companies with less than 100 employees who have never had a traditional pension plan.",
        "Does the 401(k) system actually require that there be far more geniuses in those terms than there actually are in the workforce?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Robert, it definitely doesn't.",
        "In fact, those who make a decision stick with it, tend to do better than those who are constantly watching and looking to change.",
        "And you don't need to be a genius.",
        "In fact, you're better off probably if you aren't.",
        "Given the decline of the defined benefit pension and the stress on Social Security, is the 401(k) here at the center of the triple crown of a failed national retirement policy?",
        "Well, it's definitely an interesting question.",
        "And the reality is that every retirement system in the country today; whether it's a pension type; whether it's a defined contribution plan, like 401(k); or government-run plan or a private plan, all are facing very huge financial challenges.",
        "You're a consultant; you talk to people, companies about their benefits packages and individuals.",
        "Do you get the sense that they'd really like to get out from under this commitment?",
        "They have been looking to do that for many years.",
        "You know, one of the key issues we're dealing with is that life expectancy of 30 years or so in retirement has resulted in a cost that companies and even governments are struggling to be able to financially handle that kind of commitment.",
        "Yeah, takes us back to the '70s.",
        "Typically, how long did the 65-year- old who retired from work - how much longer did that person live and how much longer would that person need retirement income for?"

        "We were looking at retirement typically being a 10 to 12-year period of time.",
        "We kind of developed an expectation that we're going to be able to retire in our mid 50s and live happily ever after for another 30 years or so.",
        "And then there's the notion that we should live well during that time.",
        "Sure.",
        "We should all be able to sit on the beach or play golf and whatever, and the hard reality that we're coming to face is that - I can't afford to have a huge segment of a workplace sitting idle for 20 to 30 years.",
