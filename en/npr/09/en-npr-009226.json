        "So was it just being dazzled by being in a foreign country or is there really a difference between the produce that Americans have gotten to accept and what happens elsewhere?",
        "Well, I think there was a big difference especially when we were kids.",
        "I think now, more and more people are finding that kind of experience just by going to their neighborhood farmers market or to, you know, even good produce departments in supermarkets are having much better luck.",
        "But, you know, when - the way this whole thing started, it's kind of - it's just the - it's the law of unintended consequences again, because what happened was that a system was built to make sure that everybody had good, plenty of good, inexpensive fruits and vegetables - which we do.",
        "I mean, malnutrition is no longer nearly a problem that was.",
        "Obesity is a problem now.",
        "And lack of flavor became a huge problem.",
        "And it's all built into the system because the system - in the old days in the United States, every major city was surrounded by a farm belt, and that farm belt supplied the fruits and vegetables that the people in the city ate.",
        "Right.",

        "Actually, it was a Democrat, then-Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was her angel.",
        "And her nomination went forward under an agreement of alternating nominations between Moynihan and Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato.",
        "Today, President Obama alluded to one of her most famous cases as a trial judge.",

        "And we ended up with what was all, too often, pretty undistinguished fruits and vegetables.",
        "What's happened now, though, that I'm really excited about in the last 30 years is the impact that farmers markets have had on the produce distribution.",
        "Because under the old system, there was no way for a farmer to get any kind of financial incentive for growing great fruits and vegetables.",

        "Financial disincentive for coming up with a good tasting peach that you didn't have a lot of.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And so with farmers markets, that kind of turned out all the way around because a farmer could say taste this.",
