        "Yeah.",
        "The thing that's really happened since then, though, is that ethos has kind of created a second commodity stream for produce, where there are -especially produce distributors all over the country now who are selecting local or high quality things and putting them in restaurants and supermarkets.",
        "And charging a premium for them, I presume.",

        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, I guess the question is you refer to it in the book - in a way, we consumers were complicit with this because we said, yeah, okay, you know, we'll buy strawberries year-round even though they don't grow year-round, and so we wound up having to take stuff that was produced with the intention of having it stick around for a long time.",
        "Well, I think a lot of times, you know, we want what we want, and we want it now.",
        "And, you know, usually, we wanted...",
        "That was cognitive dissonance.",
        "We were just talking about that.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And it doesn't matter, you know.",
        "I mean, the original strawberry was - it was a six-week crop.",
        "And so in order to have strawberries year-round, I mean, California produces strawberries 11 months under the year now.",
        "In order to produce that because - you know, people in New York hotels want to have sliced strawberries in January when they're eating their breakfast.",
        "In order -there was a market there, and so agriculture evolved to supply that market."

        "All right.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me ask you another question.",
        "I mean, in terms - let's focus on the peach for a minute.",
        "Now, you hinted that growing techniques affect the way the peach is produced, and I was just working with a producer who said she had a job in Israel where they were making peaches of rubbing the peach plants so that it would - what's the word I'm looking for?",
        "Pollinate?",
        "Pollinate, yes, more effectively.",
        "And she still has the blisters from it, she said.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But the idea was to reduce the yield so you'd only get the very best peaches.",
        "Is the - can you take the same fruit and ruin it or is it different varieties that are chosen for specific qualities?",
        "No.",
        "You know, it's - in fact, that's one of the things I really, I think, people are still a little naive about because you have to remember that produce - fruits and vegetables - they're grown, they're not manufactured.",
        "And so when you're buying a variety, you know, if you're buying a great Alberta peach, it's not the same thing as buying Lincoln, you know.",
        "A good farmer can take a mediocre variety and grow good fruit.",
        "A bad farmer could take a great variety and grow mediocre fruit.",
        "So what you need to look for is, first of all, you need to follow the farmer and then you need to hope that that farmer has - picks a great variety because when you get those two things in sequence, that's when you get that kind of, you know that peach that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck.",
        "And it's an expensive proposition because what they have to do - a lot of the steps that they have to take in order to get great fruits and vegetables are things that cost money, starting with really rigorous thinning...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now, the complication is the produce managers usually think that that's a flaw and so they'll wash it all off.",
        "And then, you know, letting the fruit hang on the tree longer so that it becomes more and more mature at the same time that it's beginning to ripen.",
        "At that stage, the fruit's becoming more tender, more fragile and all kinds of things can happen to it from, you know, I mean, the obvious disasters like a summer hail storm to, you know, just like naughty birds.",
        "I mean, how many times have you, you know - if you've ever had a tree in your backyard, you know you lose a certain percentage of the - a certain percentage of your crop to the birds, and that happens in farms as well."

        "Although in recent years, I would say that some kind of genetic engineering or whatever has actually crept into that country and suddenly we're getting tomatoes the size of our heads and things that we never used to see before.",
        "But my husband's rule of thumb that he always tells people is that if you cannot smell the fruit, it's probably not worth buying.",
        "So if you, you know, if you put your nose up to it and there's no apple smell or orange smell wafting out of it, then it's probably not worth buying.",
        "And actually, the fruits he likes to buy the best are the ones that you can actually smell from about 15 feet away.",

        "So this - it's very interesting and I don't know if, you know, this is going to be a worldwide phenomenon or not, but I hope that we can continue to, at least, travel abroad and get some excellent fruits and vegetables even when we have a difficult time finding them here.",
        "Jennifer, thanks for that call.",
        "What about that?",
        "Is the nose reliable?",
        "The nose is nine times out of ten - yeah, probably nine times out ten, that's one of the great, great indicators.",
        "There are two basic things.",
        "One of them is the perfume, because, remember, fruits are - fruits exist to carry seeds.",
        "And the farther from the tree the seed is carried, you know, so fruit -the fruit that surrounds the seed is delicious so that it will be eaten and the seed will be carried farther away.",
        "And one of the ways it attracts is through the perfume.",
        "Another really great tip that I think that people don't focus on enough is, you know, pick the stuff up.",
        "Fruit that's heavier for its size is always going to be better because one of the things that happens after a fruit's picked is it starts giving up moisture.",
        "And as it gives up moisture, the fruit becomes lighter and lighter.",
        "Now, there are some things that don't - where smelling doesn't work, you know.",
        "For example, with melons, if you've got a netted melon like a cantaloupe or a muskmelon, I mean, those things, when they are ripe, the perfume is just like -it'll knock you over from 10 feet away.",
        "But a honeydew melon, there's no smell whatsoever.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And what's funny is, the Latin name for the family of the honeydew melon is Inodorous...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Instead of being kind of a hard, bright color, the color should be rich and creamy.",
