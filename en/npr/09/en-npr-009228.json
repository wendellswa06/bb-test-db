        "It's - the French call it the couche, and that's where the melon rested when it was on the ground.",
        "Check the color of that because if it's bright white, that the melon's underripe.",
        "It should be getting creamy going to golden.",
        "Those were the best one.",
        "The absolute, you know, the honeydew melon that's going to completely knock you over all summer, if you find them that - where the surface is sticky, or if you find them where there are little brown speckles on the surface, those are going to be amazing because the honeydew is - when it gets really ripe and it's really sweet, the sugar starts to bleed through the rind.",

        "And I was going to say look for the blemishes, the imperfections and above all, the sign of a worm, which is a sure sign of a good organic fruit - and of course, the smell.",
        "But Mr. Palca, I wanted to ask, why do we never hear - speaking of the last segment, cognitive dissonance, I would say 9/11 is about the biggest example of mass psychotic cognitive dissonance.",
        "And why doesn't SCIENCE FRIDAY ever show films of - those building exploding due to planted explosives indicating an inside job...",
        "Well, that's an interesting question, Steve, but we don't show films on SCIENCE FRIDAY primarily because this is a radio program and that would be a little awkward.",
        "But I do like the idea of the fruit and I'm not quite sure why the blemishes.",
        "He mentioned blemishes are a good thing, Russ Parsons.",
        "Well, you know, I think that the blemishes are not necessarily a good thing, but the absence of blemishes aren't necessarily a good thing either.",
        "You can't believe the amount of work that goes into commercial agriculture, trying to produce fruit that looks beautiful.",
        "If half of that energy was directed towards producing fruit that had great flavor, we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.",
        "So, you know, your book talks about the fact that most of the fruit in America is grown in California.",

        "Or can we really hope to get good fruit over here?",
        "No, you can get great fruit over there.",
        "One of the problems on the East Coast is you have to recognize that it's more difficult to grow fruit on the East Coast, which is why it moved to the West Coast.",
        "On the West Coast, their summers are really hot and they're really, really dry.",
        "On the East Coast, the summers may be really hot, but they're really humid.",
        "And that humidity encourages all kinds of problems.",
        "But you can get great fruit if you - you just have to work a little harder for it - by going to the farmer's market, by tasting, by, you know, by shopping around.",

        "And I also don't want to imply that everything that's grown commercially in California is bad.",
        "Because if you know what you're doing, you know, the first step is just paying attention to what you're shopping for instead of picking things up as if they were tube socks, you know.",
        "I hate to...",
