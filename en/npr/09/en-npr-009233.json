        "He was a deputy.",

        "So the outlook is for some instability in Israel, maybe a lot, and maybe the Likud hawks may make a comeback.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Of course, that party headed by Benjamin Netanyahu.",
        "I was struck by a phrase I isolated for you that the Jerusalem Post writes this morning, where in speaking of General Sharon, they say, `Affinity--there is affinity for the man whose image somehow transformed over the years from Tarzan to Santa Claus.'",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't know if I would have phrased it that way, but I certainly admire a good phrase.",
        "Was--your estimation of the region is so deep.",
        "Did you sense that there was, if not a change in General Sharon, perhaps a change in the country to view the two-state solution as being optimal?",
        "Oh, there's a big change in General Sharon.",
        "I mean, this person who practically was a founding member of the Likud, and who for a long, long time insisted--started the movement to put Jewish settlements on the West Bank, and now he was the one who withdrew from Gaza and a little bit of the West Bank as well.",
        "That was a profound change, but apparently a profound change that seems to have been generally welcome in Israel, where the left hasn't done much for them and the right hasn't done much for them, so why not--let's try the center.",
        "At the same time that this drama is unfolding in Jerusalem, you have a Palestinian election campaign, where elections are scheduled later this month.",
        "That's right.",
        "You have the Palestinian election, and this will be another source of instability.",
        "Things apparently seem to be quite chaotic in Gaza now, and the question is, what's going to happen?",
        "The Hamas, which is the militant faction in Israel, seems to be gaining, and the question is, what happens if there is an election and the wrong guys win, so to speak?",
        "There is a sense of volatility entering into affairs now.",
        "It reminds me a little bit of what happened after the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin.",
        "Israel prizes its leaders, and so, for whatever reason, when it loses a leader, it is very nervous.",
        "Mahmoud Abbas is talking about postponing the election.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's...",

        "It's a possibility, but that's opposed by the Bush administration, for one.",
        "I don't know if Israel's taking a position on it.",
        "There's good reason to want to postpone it, because the Hamas, which is the opposition to him, is coming up.",
        "What will happen if you do postpone it?",
        "Is that itself a sign of instability?",
        "It means that all the matters there are going to be worked out in the next few months.",

        "The losses because of violence were just terrific.",
        "Suicide bombings in locations killed as many as 130 people alone on Thursday.",
        "Shiite pilgrims seem to have mainly been the target, and sectarian unrest is stirring.",
        "What do you see as the cause and effect of these bombings?",
        "Well, they're all waiting to see how the vote comes out in the recent election, but even the results so far would indicate that the Shiites have a commanding edge and will probably form the government.",
        "The problem now, or one of many problems, seems to be getting the Shiites to make enough concessions to the Sunnis to avoid what looks like a threatening civil war.",
        "There's even been some fighting among rival factions of the insurgents.",
        "There are the native Iraqi ones, and then there are ones who come from abroad, the al-Qaeda supporters from elsewhere.",
        "And very interestingly, The New York Times today says that the United States has opened up discussions with insurgents in the field and has also made communication with insurgents elsewhere outside Iraq in--through third parties.",
        "Now here in the United States, Dan, Jack Abramoff has pled guilty to three counts of corruption and tax evasion...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...essentially turning state's evidence.",
        "He's going to cooperate with authorities on a wider probe into his dealings with lawmakers.",
        "And then there's news that Tom DeLay has decided to give up his position as House majority leader permanently.",
        "Now there's absolutely no suggestion these two events are related, but together, do they foretell some real changes in Congress?",
        "Well, I think so, because Tom DeLay was basically the symbol of the way they were riding roughshod in Congress, anti-regulation, anti-Democratic, and the result of that is that some Republicans submitted a petition asking to have a change, and I think he saw the handwriting on the wall.",
        "I think that Congress has really sort of looked at itself and didn't like what it saw in the mirror.",
        "That was the kind of a regime that was run by Tom DeLay.",
        "I think that that augurs a lot of other changes as well.",
        "OK.",
        "Dan, nice talking to you.",

        "My pleasure."

        "We have been talking about energy independence since the early 1970s, and I think one of the ironies of this is that every person running for the presidency has claimed that they were going to make America more independent if they were elected, and every one of them has left with America more dependent than when they got in.",
        "So when people say but it could increase U.S.",
        "oil production by seven percent or something like that, that's good news for Americans in the oil-production business, but it doesn't affect the price of oil for consumers here.",
        "No, it doesn't have a - it is the impact on the world oil market that will affect the price, not the impact on the U.S.",
        "market, except as you point out, for the people who are actually producing that oil.",

        "What does the Bush administration say about these allegations?",

        "Officials just keep saying that they need to battle terrorism and sometimes this means unconventional but they say always lawful ways.",

        "He just once again said that the US does not torture detainees.",
        "We've long heard that, you know, the US has been sending suspected terrorists over to places like Egypt, like Saudi Arabia, which have long track records in torture, but this is on European soil.",
        "And in many ways, these are former Soviet prisons and that sends its own signal as well.",
        "And there are several perspectives on whether this is helpful and productive or counterproductive to US intelligence.",
        "Has this done damage?",
        "You know, you talk to former and current CIA agents and foreign policy specialists and experts on the Arab and Islamic world and they say every time there's a revelation like this about how the US uses secret prisons to interrogate people, how they send them off to foreign countries that had long track records in torture, even Guantanamo, each time a new revelation comes out, it erodes confidence and it actually creates, they say, anger and resentment.",
        "Now administration officials say this is a different type of war, it's a war on terrorism, and they can't have their hands tied.",
        "And they point to somebody like Khalid Sheik Mohammed, you know, one of the masterminds of the 9/11 attacks, who they've managed to get a lot of information out of because they've used these aggressive interrogation techniques.",
