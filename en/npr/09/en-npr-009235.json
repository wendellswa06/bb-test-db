        "The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the measure's provisions were in fact intended to target African-American voters.",
        "Here to tell us more about the case in North Carolina and similar cases across the country is Richard Hasen.",
        "He's a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine, and he's with us now via Skype.",
        "Professor Hasen, thanks so much for speaking with us.",
        "It's a pleasure to be with you.",
        "Now, the photo ID requirement is one that gets a lot of attention, but could you tell us more about what made the voting law in North Carolina so noxious to voting rights advocates?",
        "Yes.",
        "It came from listener Mike Shteyman of Reisterstown, Maryland.",
        "I said: Take the first seven letters of the alphabet - A through G - change one of these letters to another that's also either A-B-C-D-E-F or G, rearrange the result to spell a familiar seven-letter word.",

        "And your answer?",
        "Answer is feedbag.",
        "Well, it wasn't too hard, I guess, because we received more than 1,200 entries, and that's a little more than we've been receiving in a while.",
        "And out of those entries, our winner is Barbara Larcom from Baltimore, Maryland.",
