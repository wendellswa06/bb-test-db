        "And if it is malignant, as they say, is there any kind of prognosis that we can talk about usefully?",
        "Well, on average, survival can range from anywhere as short as a year, if it's extremely aggressive, if it's a fast moving, fast growing tumor.",
        "Or sometimes if it's one of the slower growing, but yet still malignant tumors, people may live from three to five years, and again it depends on how successful the treatment is, and a number of factors.",
        "It's really too early to say.",
        "Chemo and radiation are unpleasant in and of themselves.",
        "Yes.",
        "Not pleasant at all."
