        "Fine, thank you.",
        "Well, before we get into this report, let's talk about what is actually in cough medicine and how it is supposed to work.",
        "Well, actually, cough medicines contain a lot of different ingredients.",
        "Probably the most important ones are the sugar and the flavoring agents.",
        "Pretty colors are in it; I think red always works best for a cough.",
        "They also contain some ingredients that are thought to be or have been--until recently, thought to be active ingredients.",
        "For instance, there are medicines called expectorants, things that make you spit, which are supposed to loosen mucus or increase mucus flow.",
        "And then other medicines are antihistamines, and one that we know a lot about is diphenhydramine, which is the active ingredient in Benadryl.",
        "There are decongestants that dry up your nose.",
        "And then there are some medications which are intended to suppress cough.",
        "They're supposed to turn off the cough reflex.",
        "One is called dextromethorphan, DM.",
        "And that may or may not suppress cough.",
        "There's some evidence that at least it does so for a short time.",
        "And then finally there are things which just coat everything, that smooth everything up, the high-viscosity agents.",
        "My mother used to favor honey and butter.",
        "Oh.",
        "It's hard to analyze the effect of any one ingredient because, you know, a lot of cough is in our head, and placebo effects are very strong here.",
        "Well, what do you mean `in our head'?",
        "Well...",
        "There's actually physical coughing.",
        "Every piece of this law had appeared somewhere else.",
        "But nowhere else but North Carolina did we see all of these rules meant to roll back voting and registration embodied in a single law.",
        "In the past, states and localities with a history of racial discrimination had to get approval.",
        "The Supreme Court in the Shelby County case in 2013 said, no, you don't need it anymore because racial discrimination is kind of a thing of the past, and so you have to take each case case by case.",
        "North Carolina comes in, passes this omnibus bill that makes it harder to register and vote.",
        "And that's what the 4th Circuit struck down in the opinion issued last week.",
        "What drove the federal appeals court decision?",
        "Was it the manner in which the legislature crafted the vote?",
        "I note that you noted the timing, but I also make note of the fact that the court ruling talked about the fact that the legislature had requested the data on the use - by race - of a number of voting practices.",
        "What if they hadn't compiled this data and only used data on how Democrats voted, for example?",
        "Do you think they would've been the same result?"

        "That's a great question.",
        "And what's really hard about these cases is that the claim is, well, we weren't discriminating against anyone.",
        "We certainly weren't discriminating on the basis of race.",
        "But at worst, we were discriminating against Democrats.",
        "These are all laws that are passed by Republican legislatures against the views of Democrats.",
        "And so how do you decide whether discrimination against Democrats is the same thing as discrimination against, say, African-Americans or Latinos?",
        "And that's something that the 4th Circuit, in its opinion, struggled with and said, look, if you target a party knowing that this is the party that is favored by minority voters, that's race discrimination even if it's not driven by racial hatred or racial animus.",
        "Now, of course, the Republicans say that the challenge to these laws is politically motivated, motivated and intended to boost Democratic voters showing up at the polls.",
        "And the lead attorney on these cases does work for the Hillary Clinton campaign.",
        "So can you separate out the political motivation on either side?",
        "Well, I certainly think that it's true that Democrats and Republicans have the same view that if you make it easier to register and vote, that's going to help poor and minority voters, who tend to vote for Democrats.",
        "But I tend to look at these cases differently and take it from the point of view of the voter and ask the question, does the state have a good reason to burden voters, to make it harder to register and vote?",
        "And if the state has a good reason for that, then maybe its law is OK.",
        "But if the state's reasons are made up or pretextual, then that's not a reason to make it harder to register and vote.",
        "And in this case, the court said that the laws were not really justified by preventing fraud.",
        "They didn't really act to prevent fraud.",
        "They seem to be motivated instead to drive down turnout of groups that tend to vote for the minority party.",
        "So what does this mean for this year's presidential election?",
        "Does this mean that the rules that were in place before these laws were put into effect now have to prevail?",
        "Can we say?",
        "It depends on the place.",
        "So in Texas, the voter ID law is still going to be in effect there.",
        "It does mean as a whole that more people who are eligible to vote who want to register and vote will actually be able to vote in November, assuming that these rulings stand the way they are right now.",
        "That was Richard Hasen.",
        "He's a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine.",
