        "...there is physical coughing, although sometimes it turns out that for a lot of the studies that have been done, if you give patients sugar syrup, it seems to work just as about well as the things that are labeled `cough syrup' and sold as cough syrups.",

        "You know, if you give them nothing, the cough gets worse or remains the same, although in some of the studies that have been done, just waiting a day or two also helps a lot.",
