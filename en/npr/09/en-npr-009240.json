        "It can be very deceptive.",
        "I think part of the reason why the tour has become kind of a phenomenon unto itself is because comedy and humor is really the antidote to fear.",
        "You know, we talk to people and through our show, particularly non-Muslims will come out and say, `God, you know, I had no idea that, you know, Muslims could be funny or, you know, that you have a humor tradition within Islam or, you know, that this is what Muslims are all about,' etc., etc. And it's because they feared something they didn't know.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And what I'm finding is that the opposite is also true.",
        "I just got back from a two-week trip to Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, spoke to a lot of indigenous Muslims in those parts of the world, and again, it's this idea that people fear America and Americans and, `The Americans are coming, and they're going to come and round us all up,' and I hear Muslims talking like this even in the United States.",
        "So this fear has begun to dominate in people's psychologies, and I think that people tend to fear that which they do not know.",
        "So if we can educate people, hopefully that begins to dispel some of that fear, and humor is a great way to do that.",
        "You mentioned a tradition of humor in Islam.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Yes.",
        "In fact, I wrote a paper which, thankfully, was asked to be part of an international academic journal called Humor(ph).",
        "And as I researched that paper, I began to discover that there's actually--there already is a humor tradition within the body of Islam dating back to the prophet Muhammad himself, who told jokes and played practical jokes.",
        "Really?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "He played practical..."

        "And there's two entire chapters.",

        "Sure.",
        "I mean, this is a really--you know, once this woman, this old woman, had lost her husband, and she came to the prophet Muhammad and she said, `Please, oh, messenger of God, can you make a prayer for me that I go to heaven?",
        "And then he said, `Well, there'll be no old women in heaven.",
        "And she began to cry.",

        "Are there still, though, some jokes you just can't make?",
        "I don't look at jokes you can't make; I look at jokes you can't make successfully.",
        "And I think that's the criteria for everything we do on the tour.",
        "You know, we don't want to offend anybody.",
        "Is it true?",
        "Is it relevant?",
        "Have you done your homework?",
