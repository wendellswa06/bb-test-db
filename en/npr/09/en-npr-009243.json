        "That's right.",
        "But it's not a slam dunk, and Democrats do want to try to make this a race because, as you said, Roy Moore is so outside the mainstream.",
        "The other takeaway is that it's a huge shot in the arm for the anti-establishment wing of the Republican Party.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It means that Donald Trump has a loyal base, but it's not necessarily transferable to other candidates.",
        "Alabama voters love Trump, but they can't stand the Republican establishment.",
        "And Roy Moore ran against Mitch McConnell almost more than he did Luther Strange.",
        "It also means that every Republican senator thinking about retiring is now going to think a little harder.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "And every nationalist, populist, anti-establishment challenger is going to be emboldened.",
        "I think it probably means that Republicans will have to spend a lot more money fighting off primary challengers at the same time they're trying to expand their majority."
