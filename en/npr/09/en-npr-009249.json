        "Charges against the demonstrators were later dropped, and the city allowed them to hold up the don't-honk signs.",
        "But Cotello and four others are suing the city, claiming that the compromise violates First Amendment rights.",
        "It's just as simple as this, if the people have the right to honk their horns in support of like a union picket line or a wedding or a Bar Mitzvah or anything, if they had the right to honk their horn in the celebration of a sporting event or anything like that, then they have the right to honk their horns and we're within our rights to ask them.",

        "What are the chances that this will be a free and fair election?",

        "By contrast, in Mashonaland, where Mugabe is strong, there are enough polling places, and folks will have a much more extended period of time in which to cast their own personal vote.",

        "So in some ways, these questions of fairness, they arise in the worst of circumstances and then in much better circumstances.",
        "But on that note, let's broaden this a little bit to talk about elections in Africa.",
        "How many African nations, or what portion of African nations, seem to have an electoral process that is stable and that works for the citizens versus other ones that are either dictatorships or where elections are unpredictable, not free and not fair?",
        "There are not many military dictatorships in Africa, as opposed to 20 years ago.",
        "There are multi-party systems throughout the continent, but we have to remember that elections do not necessarily equal democracy.",
        "But there have been - you know, I think that, you know, the places where there have been successful turnovers of incumbent regimes under a multi-party system are not given enough credit.",
        "They are many more than they are not.",
        "The balance we saw in Kenya was unexpected.",
        "Kenya had had a smooth transition from the rule of Daniel arap Moi to the rule of Mwai Kibaki, and it could very well have turned out that we had two, if it wasn't for some electoral rigging and planning on the part of the two different camps to destabilize the country after these elections.",
        "Ghana's had a smooth transition eight years ago and is going to have another election pretty soon, and it's expected that that will be a free and fair election.",
        "Benin is a good place to think about, Madagascar, Mauritius.",
        "So I think that, you know, it's important to realize that even though it looks like Africans are always at each others' throats surrounding elections, it's not as dire as we might think.",
        "You mentioned that you believe that elections don't equal democracy.",
        "How do you distinguish the two of those?",
        "Well, you know, elections are procedures that we find in democracies.",
        "But, you know, there has to be a culture of democracy.",
        "If you had a free and fair election, there wouldn't be rigging.",
        "There wouldn't be ballot-stuffing and intimidation.",
        "So democracy has more components than just elections.",
        "Well, that's a term that's been coined by American political scientists, and it relates to the fact that once you have - you had the move away from single-party systems to multi-party systems, and even if the incumbent in the single-party system became a contestant in the two-party system or multi-party system, there would be, now, term limits, as opposed to in the past.",
        "So let's say - for example, Jerry Rowlings introduced multi-party democracy in Ghana.",
        "He stood for two terms.",
        "He won in both of those terms, but now he's been succeeded by this businessman, John Kufour.",
        "If these elections come off without a hitch, well then we'll be seeing that transitions have been orderly.",
        "And if Kufour is thrown out, of course, or his successor is thrown out, then that would be further sign of the consolidation and deepening of democracy.",
        "So that's basically what that essentially means."
