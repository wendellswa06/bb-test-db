        "We are freedom-loving nation that is right now under attack.",
        "And we've always been warned.",
        "If you got too close to America, if you continue up - down to this path, you will have problems.",
        "But what's happening now is beyond what I could have imagined.",

        "And Lawrence, let's start with this first, basic question.",
        "And I know this is complicated, but if you could just boil it down for us, what is this conflict about?",
        "Well, this started as a separatist conference back in the early 1990s, when the 25,000 or 35,000 or so ethnic Ossetians living in South Ossetia declared independence.",
        "They did not want to be part of Georgia, in which they saw minority rights at risk.",
        "The Ossetians won that war with quite a lot of help from volunteers from Russia's North Caucasus region.",
        "The Georgians were repelled, and for the next 10 years, South Ossetia was simply forgotten by the Georgian political establishment.",
        "What's happened in the last few years is that Georgia has made moves to try and reassert control some way over South Ossetia, try to find a compromise, a political compromise, offer the Ossetians all sorts of autonomy.",
        "But they've also seen Russia getting increasingly involved.",
        "Russia has given passports to the entire South Ossetian population.",
        "The Russian - Russian officials run many of the separatist institutions.",
        "The Russian flag flies over South Ossetia these days.",
        "And over the last year, we've had many, many minor clashes between the Ossetians and Georgian troops, and just over the last two days, some very serious fighting in which ethnic Georgian villages were attacked.",
        "Russia has always said that it would fight on the Ossetians side, if Georgia made any moves to reassert its control.",
        "And yesterday Russia - Georgia over the last 24 hours, took control of the separatist capital of Tskhinvali.",
        "So, what we have now are two divisions of the Russian army which have marched across the international frontier and right into Georgia, and they are staring down Georgian troops who are also in that city.",
        "So, why is Russia so heavily involved in this?",
        "There are many reasons.",
        "Ossetians have more of an affinity for Russia than for Georgia.",
        "At times they talked about joining Russia.",
        "But this is also seen as a geopolitical game.",
        "Georgia wants to become a member of NATO.",
        "Georgia ousted Russian military bases from its territory.",
        "This comes after Russia's position on Kosovo was ignored.",
        "And after that, Russia began even - stepping up its relations even more with the separatist parts of Georgia.",
        "Many people see this as Russia punishing Georgia for its aspirations to be pro-Western and to be part of the NATO alliance, which would bring the NATO alliance right to Russia's southern border, which it regards it as its backyard.",
        "So, maybe people - people see this as a punitive position on the side of Russia.",
        "So, this is really now not just a separatist as rebellion.",
        "It's really a conflict between two states.",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan, in Washington.",
        "As the summer travel season approaches, we look forward to time away, the lure of the open road and the delights of difference, but we can also get bogged down in finances and logistics, especially if there are children involved."

        "Harford has a new book out this week.",

        "In the United States, the definition is an idea of absolute poverty.",
        "And what that means is we're looking at how much money you need to support a particular standard of living, to buy a certain number of calories, a certain amount of vitamins, to buy a certain standard of housing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And how much does that cost?",
        "And somewhat controversially, that is based on a basket of goods that was worked out by a researcher called Mollie Orshansky over 50 years ago, and while the prices have been tweaked, what's in that basket of goods hasn't been tweaked at all.",
        "It's things like potatoes, right?",
        "I mean, how many potatoes you can afford to buy.",
        "Yeah, potatoes, onions.",
        "So it's actually based on food, and then there's a rule of thumb that says if this is how much the food costs then you need another allowance for accommodation and for clothes and so on.",
        "It's all about the basic standards of living, but it doesn't incorporate any changes in the economy that have happened since the early 1960s.",
        "OK.",
        "So it's adjusted for the change in prices in objects, like potatoes.",
        "The problem is it doesn't include things like cell phones, televisions.",
        "Which leads to something that you write about in the book, and that is that poverty can really be a social condition.",
        "Explain briefly what you mean by that.",
        "Well, this goes back to Adam Smith writing in the late 18th century.",
        "And Smith said that a man would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt.",
        "And then he pointed out that, you know, the Greeks and the Romans - even the emperors - didn't have linen shirts.",
        "His point is that poverty is partly about not having enough money to buy what society expects you to have.",
        "And if you don't have enough money to meet those social expectations, people will think of you as poor and you will think of yourself as poor.",
        "That's not to say that poverty is totally relative, but it is saying it's subjective - it's a social condition.",
        "And he's got to be right in some fundamental way about that."

        "What role does inequality play as we're looking at things like poverty and the state of a country's economy?",
        "Well, poverty and inequality are connected.",
        "Income inequality is just some kind of measure of the gap between the rich and the poor.",
        "And it's very contested because there were just so many different ways to think about it.",
        "Are you comparing the very richest to the very poorest?",
        "Are you looking at the assets that people have?",
        "Or are you just looking at their income?",

        "Yeah.",
        "Why should we care, I guess is the question.",
        "So one reason that you might want to care is just to say well, someone who is on the bread line, they could use the dollar much more than someone who is a millionaire.",
        "Right.",
        "And I think that's pretty intuitive.",
        "Whether inequality really damages a country as a whole is less clear.",
        "I think the main argument that it's a problem is that it starts to corrode your political system.",
        "As you get fewer and fewer people with more and more money who were able to have a disproportionate influence on political priorities through their campaigning, their lobbying, they're political donations.",
        "And if that happens, then you're moving further and further away from the ideals of a democracy.",
        "One thing that you wrote about that really struck me.",
        "You said that people who are looking for a job when an economy is not doing well, there can be a lasting impact on that person for many years in their career and in their life.",
