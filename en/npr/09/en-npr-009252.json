        "One of the questions it raises, it's an arrangement of 15 rocks - some say the 15 islands of Japan, others say no, no, no. It's something else entirely.",

        "And those are the people who get you - get into your system and get under your skin, and then you can't get them out of your head.",
        "And we'll leave you to decide which of those adjectives might apply to our next case - next guest, author Paul Theroux, who's been writing about travel for decades.",

        "And she's written many books since.",
        "And there's a chapter in my book, which is \"\"Murphy's Rules of Travel,\"\" where she has 10 rules of just things that you might think of if you travel, and one of them is very unexpected, which is that she says: If you have a child with you, say you have a five-year-old child, take her along on your bike or have, you know, on her - on your back.",

        "This is written by Alexander McCall Smith, who describes this as an almost unpopulated place of great loss.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I love what Joe said, because I find that the more the world moves towards movement and acceleration and data, the more something in us cries out for silence and stillness and spaciousness.",
        "And so when I was listening to Joe in the Sierra Nevadas, I was remember how I've been to monasteries for 20 years just to get away from the cell phone and get away from the laptop.",
        "And it's amazing how liberating it is, and luxurious, in fact.",
        "When I went into a monastery first, I heard the three principles there were poverty, chastity and obedience, and I felt that it was really about richness, sensuality and freedom.",
        "It was, you know, wonderfully nice to be away from distraction.",
        "So, as you were saying, even in many parts of the world, I spent a lot of time in Big Sur, California, and as with Morvern, all you have to do is just leave the road signs and skyscrapers and golden arches behind, and suddenly something in you really opens up.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "I mean, I think that what Joe is saying is - it's true.",

        "When I joined the Peace Corps, I went to Malawi, and I found that I loved living in Malawi because I lived in a village, and there were mud huts, and people were learning English, and they were all studying, but it was simple.",
