        "And basically what we did is we lived with the monks for a week and experienced the monastic lifestyle, going to church, you know, six times a day and eating with them and spending periods in silence, and it was just definitely something that I've thought about a lot even 10 years later.",
        "Hi.",
        "And I'm Robert Siegel.",
        "And one of the really distinctive things about Taize is the music, and I think maybe some of the listeners have perhaps experienced it in their church.",

        "That's interesting, to make it a family experience."

        "It seems more in the area of dilettantism, of you go, you sample it, and you go away.",
        "And you have - it's a good experience, but my notion of travel is slightly more harrowing than that, and I think of it as something that, well, is meaningful in retrospect, that you have a spiritual experience which isn't spiritual at the time necessarily, but you're tested by it the way monks are tested.",

        "And I like what Paul was saying about being harrowed, though I must say I've been to my monastery 50 times now, and I often do feel harrowed there, even though I'm not a monk.",
        "You know, sometimes you're sitting in this very simple place, the electricity has gone out, you're alone on a hillside, the storm is blowing all around you, and you're pushed back to some very essential, almost primal kind of fear or isolation that is, as Paul was saying, part of the beauty of the experience.",
        "I've been spending a lot of time in Jerusalem recently, and that really bears out the difference between a charismatic place and a pleasant place, because I would never call Jerusalem beautiful or comfortable or consoling, but there's something about it that you can't turn away from.",
        "Yeah, I would also say that in one of my, say, 50 favorite travel books, which I quote in \"\"The Tao of Travel,\"\" is \"\"Tristes Tropiques\"\" by Claude Levi-Strauss.",
        "There's a chapter in that, I think it's chapter six or seven, early in the book, where he - the whole chapter is a seven-and-a-half or eight-page description of a sunset.",

        "And speaking of light, Clayton(ph) in San Francisco emails: Going far north to see the Aurora Borealis has been my most spiritual and meaningful trip.",
        "There is something awe-inspiring to see the threads and sheets of colored light dancing across the sky.",

        "That's right.",
        "it's one of the 100 sights.",
        "And one thing that makes me very excited listening to those emails is that I sometimes find myself a bit of an evangelist for travel here in California because I still feel that ours is the only developed country in the world that's not full of travelers, that as Paul knows, whenever you take yourself to some magical space, you meet lots of Canadians and Australians and Koreans and nowadays Chinese and Indians, but the one people you tend not to see are Americans.",
        "So I'm so glad that we have a lot of Americans on this show who are taking the time and trouble to seek out these transporting places across the planet.",
        "I'll just say the bad ones then, OK?",

        "So I go to the little town square, and the town band is playing, and people were kind of promenading around.",
        "Anyway, after the concert - I used to play French horn, so I got together with the French horn player and a couple of musicians, and we had a few drinks and talked, and they missed their bus home."
