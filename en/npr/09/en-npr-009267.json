        "And joining us now to discuss this is Gregory Johnsen.",

        "And what are we learning about the terrorism network in Yemen after Osama bin Laden's death?",
        "Well, I think it's important to remember that the reported treasure trove of documents is a huge sea and we're only getting a few drops that are coming out in the press.",
        "That being said, we've learned a couple of different things.",
        "One is that Osama bin Laden was in touch with different branches around the world, including the organization within Yemen.",
        "We've also learned about his views of Anwar al-Awlaki, the prominent American cleric who's been targeted for assassination by the Obama administration, someone who speaks fluent in idiomatic English and has a very large following in the West.",
        "We know that the head of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, a former student of bin Laden, actually offered to step down in favor of Anwar al-Awlaki a few months ago and bin Laden essentially nixed the idea.",
        "He told the current leader, I know you, I trust you.",
        "This is not a relationship that he has with Anwar al-Awlaki.",
        "Someone like Anwar al-Awlaki wasn't even known in the Arabic-speaking world two years ago and now he's become someone who's rumored to be next in line to head al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.",
        "And this, I think, suggests that the more the Obama administration talks about him, the more the media focuses on him, the more that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula pushes him to the front, really, in essence, taking advantage of free advertising.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "I had read two different takes on Awlaki.",
        "One was very - from American counterterrorism officials who regard him as a very important character and the other, people saying, no, he really isn't that significant in Yemen itself; he's someone whom the Americans take seriously because he speaks English like an American native.",
        "You're saying that the very perception of him and the comments about him in the United States may well have altered and improved his standing among his al-Qaida colleagues in Yemen.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's because of the focused and sustained U.S.",
        "attention on him, he's become someone that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula think they can use on really their two cornerstone issues.",
        "And that is fundraising and recruiting."

        "I want to ask you a bit about what's been happening in Yemen otherwise.",

        "For a long time, the U.S.",
        "has run most of its counter-terrorism operations not only through him, but through his sons and his nephews, which control many of the armed forces.",
        "Over the recent weeks, what we've seen in Yemen is that the military has split down the middle, with a large portion of the army defecting and joining the protesters, while many of the specialized groups, and particularly the groups that the U.S.",
        "puts money, funding and training into have stayed loyal to President Saleh and are continuing to protect the presidency.",
        "What this means for the fight against al-Qaida is simply this.",
        "There's no one out in the hinterlands that's fighting al-Qaida in a way that they were fighting them last year.",

        "It was a good bargaining chip.",
        "If indeed it was a bargaining chip, what do you make of the stated rationale for this decision, that it's response to new intelligence about Iranian missile programs and about new developments in U.S.",
        "anti-missile programs?",
        "Essentially, I think the Obama administration has got to show us that this is so.",
        "I'm not aware of any new intelligence on Iran's missile capabilities.",
        "We've known for a long time that they're having problems developing long-range missiles and they're sure to go with shorter and-medium range missiles.",
        "And we've known all along that they had no plans to attack Eastern Europe.",
        "That was a fictitious rationale for those deployments.",
        "So, I think basically the Obama administration was looking to correct what it believes was a strategic mistake, knows that the Poles and the Czechs won't be happy about our backing down on it now, and is looking to explain it in a way that causes the least problems.",
        "Are the problems that this causes in Eastern Europe political and strategic as well, or only political?"

        "That's a good question.",

        "I think President Obama will be accused of doing just that by Republicans and by Eastern Europeans who don't like our walking this cat back.",

        "In fact, the anti-missile system that the U.S.",
        "is now going to look to could actually be a good deal closer to Iran than this system in Eastern Europe that…",
        "There's no question about it.",
        "And the fact of the matter is the Shipboard Missile Defenses are probably the best anti-missile system we have today.",

        "Because I think that one of the defining characteristics of Western civilization - and I guess even more in America than here in England -is the fact that we presume that church should be separate from state.",
        "But the thing is that back in the 11th century, that wasn't taken for granted at all.",
        "And what Gregory was doing was saying to the Holy Roman emperor, who had always taken for granted that he not only had the right, but he had a positive duty to poke his nose into the affairs of the church, that he had to back off, that the business of the church was that of the church alone.",
