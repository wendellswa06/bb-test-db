        "And one thing I was wondering, how do you attach a boom in this weather and what do you attach it to?",
        "Well, you got to tie it off on an anchor with a rope, you know, going to the boom and you throw the anchor out and run a boom and throw an anchor out at the other end of it.",

        "A crew of fishermen using three boats are laying boom.",
        "Third generation fisherman Casey Keith(ph) says it's boom that's specially designed for absorbing oil.",
        "So they're trying to use the islands and the boom to keep it from going the rest of the way to marsh.",
        "Hopefully this will keep it out, keep it away from it, get it back out on the gulf, only way they can do something until they shut it off.",
        "The largest vessel is owned by Shane Peskay(ph).",
        "It's a 42-foot boat that usually services the offshore oil rigs.",
        "He and the other fishermen are working in an area where there are several small islands, home to dozens of pelicans and gulls.",
        "The important thing, Peskay says, is to keep the oil from getting beyond the islands to the miles and miles of coastal marshes.",
        "The section we got to cordon off here is 6,000 feet.",
        "And by putting it there, what are you going to be protecting?",
        "More of the interior marsh.",
        "You know, we're right on the edge now.",
        "There's some islands in the south end, that's just too big a gap, trying to cordon off all of that.",
        "For every fisherman out on the water laying boom, there are 10 more eager to get to work at $48 per hour.",
        "In St. Bernard, Plaquemines and just about every coastal parish, BP is holding training sessions.",
        "At the Parish administration building in St. Bernard, trainer Jimmy Keen(ph) warns about 150 fishermen that they may hear things in the training session they already now.",
        "This class is billed basic safety class.",
        "Lot of issues.",
        "I mean, were going to talk about mosquitoes, I mean, because, you know, and alligators and things like that, that you all know about and deal with every day of your lives.",

        "It's that sea grass, Turline says, that makes this some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world.",
        "(unintelligible) the grass.",
        "The only solution I see are in the grass and the oil burned off with it, you know?",
        "That's the only thing I could see that maybe we can save it, you know?",
        "And hope that the oil burns off with the grass.",
        "Then let the new grass grow after that.",
        "In St. Bernard Parish there are two oil refineries, but otherwise, most of the jobs here rely in some way on the fishing industry.",

        "Well, there's an abbot in the year 900 who, it has to be said, is not one of life's natural optimists.",
        "And he says quite, quite clearly in sort of the tones of an Al Gore that the world is doomed, that everything is coming to an end.",
        "And his reason for doing that is twofold.",
        "Partly it's because I think that it is undoubtedly the worst time to be a European in history, because Europe is being attacked from all sides: by Vikings, by Hungarians, by Saracens, and it is imploding from within.",
        "But also, of course, this backdrop is focusing attention on the fact that the year 1000 and the millennial period is approaching, and that has significance because, according to the Book of Revelation, that is the date of the end of the world - the coming of not only Christ but before him, Antichrist.",
        "And so there are people in the 10th century, I think, who really are bracing themselves for the worst.",

        "And Fulk Nerra is absolutely a pioneer because he has picked up on an exciting new innovation, which is to find a sort of an area of high ground and to build wooden or possibly stone foundations on it, and using this then to terrorize the locals.",
        "And this invention, of course, is the castle.",

        "Hmm.",
        "And these knights are then set to rounding up the peasantry, as though they were sort of errant cattle or sheep, and installing them in radical new settlements called villages.",
