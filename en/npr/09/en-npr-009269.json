        "Yeah.",
        "Because this guy has embarrassed the Democratic Party.",
        "He staged the coup with the Republicans to basically take power for the Republicans.",
        "And I'll tell you a little bit more about him: he's a Democrat who represents the Bronx in the State Senate.",
        "And he's had a little bit of ethical challenges.",
        "He's been investigated for campaign finance problems.",
        "So, this is the guy who basically created a month worth of gridlock, embarrassed the Democratic Party, and every day, there was this sort of spectacular failure to get anything done in Albany.",
        "He is now the majority leader of the Democrats.",
        "Well, you know, this is designed to apply to the largest financial institutions in the country that benefited most directly from the rescue.",
        "And that to us seemed the sensible way to do it.",
        "You know, we're doing it in a way that effectively puts a tax on leverage, so that it'll help disincent some of the risky practices that caused the crisis.",
        "And we've designed it carefully to reduce the risk that it has any impact on lending.",
        "And we think that's the best way to do it.",
        "There's one reading of this which is that it's an effort - this tax is an effort to blunt the impression that the administration has been too close to Wall Street, too soft on Wall Street.",
        "Is that part of what's happening?",
        "No, it's not.",
        "I mean, again, the law that was passed to authorize the financial rescue put an obligation on the president to propose a way to recoup the cost of the crisis, and that's what we're doing."

        "What about bonuses, though?",
        "If this fee is imposed and come next January we see bank bonuses just as big as this year, would that suggest to you that this has not done the job, or could that happen and could the fee still be working?",
        "This fee is not designed to address that problem.",
        "And, as you know, our financial system has got a lot of problems in the basic design of the rules.",
        "And we are going to have to fix that.",
        "And that's why it's so important that we pass financial reform that puts in place much stronger constraints on banks taking risks, that protects the consumers and investors from the kind of behavior that cause so much damage and, you know, reduces the risk we ever again face a crisis like this...",
        "But aren't you at all concerned about, at least the appearances of bonuses that seem to show that the banks that received help from the federal government don't get it?",
        "Look, I think what's happening on the bonus front is deeply troubling.",
        "And I think it is causing enormous damage to basic trust and confidence in the people running our financial institutions.",

        "And we're going to work very hard to do that.",

        "And I think we made the basic test of doing it in a way that was going to provide the best basic return for the American people.",
        "In fact, on the specific transaction the Fed was involved in, it's almost certain the Fed will actually make money in that transaction.",
        "Then why wasn't the word to AIG: Go ahead and be as public about it as you would in any other filing?",
        "No, I understand that.",

        "I was recused from dealing with AIG and had no involvement in the decision about what to disclose when.",
        "But the Fed has disclosed all the information about what counterparties get, I think appropriately.",
        "And, of course, I will work very closely with the Congress to make sure they have the information necessary, that people can look and evaluate the judgments we made, with the benefit of hindsight, but these are consequences (unintelligible)."
