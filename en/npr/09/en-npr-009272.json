        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And my son and I went flying through the trees very successfully, and we're waiting on this little, tiny platform about 100 feet up.",

        "She was next.",
        "And you're holding on - you have a harness, and you're holding on.",
        "And she went zooming on this cable at about 35 miles an hour and couldn't brake herself.",
        "She couldn't use the brake, the hand brake.",
        "And she hit - she came in, and I saw her coming, and she couldn't stop into a tree.",
        "She hit her head.",
        "Ow.",
        "And then, we were up 100 feet up, and she had to be lowered down with ropes and taken out on horseback, with us following her.",
        "And the - at a certain point, the horse she was on - the people who were taking her, took a right turn and disappeared into the forest with her…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…and they had taken a short cut to the clinic.",
        "But we didn't know that.",
        "So there she was being - anyway, it all turned out okay.",
        "She got stitches and she used her Spanish and was able to negotiate the clinic experience by herself.",
        "What is Spanish for concussion?",
        "That, I don't know."

        "Our family's car from Ohio broken into and two young ladies were driving in from New Jersey and they were kidnapped in their car, and that ended two blocks away in a hail of bullets.",
