        "One person who does not buy the apology is Tim Wu.",
        "He's a former senior adviser at the Federal Trade Commission.",
        "And he was there in 2011, the last time that Facebook got in trouble for failing to keep its promises about privacy.",
        "Tim Wu is skeptical that the company will change its ways anytime soon.",
        "The problem the FTC was confronting was the problem, similar to now, that there were a number of abusive apps that you installed, and then they did a lot more with your data than you thought they were.",
        "And one of the big problems is that Facebook gave you the impression that you could control your own privacy by, you know, setting the settings in certain ways, but those settings didn't do anything.",
        "They were, like, fake buttons.",
        "Why even put them up if they were fake, just to give people a sense of security?",
        "Yes, or - you know, they prevented some things, but the apps were very easily capable of getting around the settings.",
        "So they promised to fix it all up.",
        "They entered in a big consent decree.",
        "They agreed to audits every two years for the next 20 years and a massive privacy probe.",
        "It was all going to be different.",
        "But the problem didn't go away.",
        "In fact, those little settings remained fake.",
        "The survey app that we - really, created by Cambridge Analytica - was able to take the data of people's friends and family and take it all for itself even though Facebook was supposedly not allowing that.",
        "So that is the problem.",
        "They've basically broken the promise they made to the country in 2011 and the promises they kept making to everybody through these privacy settings.",
        "And I think that's the core of the problem.",
        "Why does Facebook continue breaking its promises?",
        "Aren't they afraid that they'll get hammered by the FTC if they don't shape up?",
        "I think they clearly did not make it a priority.",
        "Let's put it that way.",
        "And I think that period, 2012 to 2015, was one where they were obsessed with revenue generation.",
        "And the fact is that privacy - it's like kryptonite to their business model.",
        "You know, they have to be able to promise their advertisers that they have the goods on everyone and they have the power to manipulate people.",
        "And so if they are also extremely tight on privacy, that tends to throw a wrench into the machine.",
        "When I brought Roscoe home our resident beagle, Sasha, was thrilled and gnawed on him, prompting both to chase each other around the house.",
        "Later that night, my husband was on his usual evening guard duty--manning the television remote while prone on the couch--when Roscoe came bounding up, depositing himself with a thump on my husband's chest.",
        "He stuck his head into my husband's neck and licked it furiously."
