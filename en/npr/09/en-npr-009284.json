        "But in terms of pathological changes in memory, of course, the most common being Alzheimer's disease, this is typically--has onset of symptoms in the late 60s and early 70s.",

        "Too much stress can.",
        "Actually, at very high and sustained levels, stress has--we know can cause actual physical and physiologic damage to structures in the brain that are important for memory.",
        "But at mild or moderate levels, stress actually can help memory function, believe it or not, because it kind of alerts you.",
        "It gets you to pay attention to something.",

        "You never really get a good night's sleep.",
        "Can that really affect your memory?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Sleep is critical for what we call consolidation, which is a process by which memory is etched into storage.",

        "That brings to mind obstructive sleep apnea, which is a very common and underdiagnosed condition that can fragment sleep and cause increased--decreased daytime alertness.",
        "And again, you get that kind of a front-end problem with memory, where people are just not as attentive, don't absorb things and, therefore, don't remember them as well.",
        "Another thing we hear a lot about, more people now are aware of their parents or grandparents having Alzheimer's disease.",
        "Does that mean you're going to automatically get it yourself?",
        "Not at all.",
        "In fact, the majority of Alzheimer's disease is sporadic.",
        "It doesn't have at least an obvious genetic connection, a familial connection.",
        "Certainly having a relative with Alzheimer's disease does increase your risk, but it's not anything like the type of genetic determination that we see with other illnesses.",
        "The genetics of Alzheimer's disease are extremely complex.",
        "We don't really have it worked out yet, but at this point, having a relative with Alzheimer's disease does not absolutely seal your destiny as having it yourself.",

        "Could you comment on that, please?",
        "Well, I mean, anxiety--this sort of goes along with what we're talking about with stress, John.",
        "Anxiety is an internal event which is going to distract you.",
        "It's going to take your focus off whatever it is you're trying to focus on at the time.",
        "If you're anxious and your mind keeps sort of fleeing to some anxiety-laden thought that you're kind of compulsively replaying, you're not focusing on what's in front of you.",

        "Are there any things you can do to improve your memory?",
        "Well, there's lots of things you can do, Ira.",
        "In fact, roughly speaking, about 50 percent of how your memory changes with age is not genetically determined, which means that it's rarely within your control; has to do with behaviors, habits, things you do in your life that can make a substantial impact on how things go for you.",
        "What we've learned about memory really is--echoes a lot of what we learned about cardiovascular health, in terms of brain health.",
        "And it turns out that everything that we know that's good for the brain--good for the heart is also good for the brain.",
        "So promoting optimal diet, exercise, managing stress--these things will all help ensure brain health as we age.",
        "There are other things I think I talk about in my book in terms of habits that you can devise or strategies that you can, you know, come up with that can effectively deal with certain repetitive memory problems in your everyday life.",
        "There's been some interesting research out of Columbia over the last 20 years on what's called cognitive reserve.",
        "Here, the notion is that being involved in lifelong learning and keeping intellectually engaged makes a difference.",
        "It certainly can push you off the onset of Alzheimer's disease.",
        "We know that people with high levels of cognitive reserve can resist symptoms of Alzheimer's disease despite an equal or greater amount of brain pathology in the people who have the low levels of cognitive reserve.",
        "And this all has to do with both genetic and acquired intellectual interests.",
        "We've heard stories about studies with people who do crossword puzzles or mental exercises having better memory functions as they get older.",
        "Well, sure.",
        "Is that true?",
        "Well, again, there's some evidence--again, there's a lot of evidence about ongoing intellectual engagement, which speaks to that.",
        "Whatever it is for you, something that engages your interests, something that engages your creativity, whether it's learning something new, getting involved in a project that puts you in contact with new learning, new people.",
        "These are all things that are going to promote that kind of lifelong intellectual engagement, which is important.",
        "Crossword puzzles--sure, why not?",
        "I think that there's a little bit of overselling of, you know, that kind of a--I think there's some--you know, you see a lot of techniques that are kind of one-shot sorts of things.",
        "If you, you know, try and remember a particular article of clothing that somebody's wearing every morning that you wake up, something new, that that's going to improve your memory.",
        "Well, I'm not quite going along with that.",
        "I think it's really more of a longitudinal kind of a habitual engagement in learning that makes a difference.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What about food and food supplements, like vitamins, things like that?",
        "You know, vitamins are important, and certainly, there's some good evidence that certain kinds of vitamins, particularly the B vitamins, for example, have an important link with how memory goes as we age.",
        "B vitamins are--you can't obtain--these are not produced from within.",
        "You have to actually get them through food, through supplements.",
        "Those are important and certainly there are vitamin deficiencies, certain kind of B vitamin deficiencies, which can produce severe memory problems, so that's critical.",
        "And often, one of the things we look for in patients presenting with memory complaints, we want to have a good idea of what their nutritional status is, what they're eating, maybe what they're missing, supplementing things.",

        "Yes.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What you're referring to just now, Ira, has to do with what we call flashbulb memories, but the caller was talking about more personal memories that are emotionally tinged.",
        "These are things that--events that are important in our lives that really capture our attention at the time that they're occurring.",
        "And information which is important, which is emotionally significant is always going to be remembered more soundly across time.",
        "It's going to be etched into our memories more deeply.",
        "And there's actually an anatomic reason for this, to some degree.",
        "We have structures in the brain that are important for memory and the experience of motion that are really overlapped, so that there's a lot of cross-talk between these structures.",
        "In terms of flashbulb memories, one of the interesting things--you mentioned the Kennedy assassination that's been studied recently.",
        "There's been some interesting research on the 9/11 disaster.",
        "Looking at people's memory for those events, and even though, in some ways, there's an enduring memory for the event, they're also subject to the same kinds of biases and changes over time that normal memories are.",
        "That's what's kind of fascinating.",
        "So what remains is this absolute conviction of remembering a particular detail, but when you actually look at the data, it turns out that, you know, it might not be quite as accurate as you think."
