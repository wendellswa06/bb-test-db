        "Also, he says that despite the tough economic times that we're in, really fixing the health-care system would be an economic boon.",
        "And so it ought to be done, not in spite of the tough economic times, the tough fiscal situation, but in part because of the tough economic times, and this would actually help the economy, help the government's long term fiscal situation.",

        "For example, now, if someone making - a family making more than a quarter million dollars gives a dollar to charity, they're able to deduct 33 or 35 percent on their taxes.",
        "The president wants to cap that deduction at 28 percent, effectively making it more expensive for wealthy families to make contributions to charity or to make mortgage interest payments on their home.",
        "The administration argues, hey, that just puts those families on the same plane as middle class families or working class families who get a smaller deduction because they pay a smaller marginal tax rate.",
        "The counter argument though from the housing industry and from some charities is that, hey, if you limit that deduction, it's just going to put more downward pressure on home prices when they don't need it and it might make people less inclined to give to charities at a time when charities are already seeing pressure on their contributions from the down economy.",
        "So, if not from tax deductions, where else might funding come from?"
