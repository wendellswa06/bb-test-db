        "The United States and Israel can declare with one voice that Iran must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.",
        "A reminder that these comments are coming at the same time that Iran just re-elected its moderate leader, President Hassan Rouhani.",
        "And for his part, President Rouhani called Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia a theatrical gathering and told the Associated Press today that relations with the U.S.",
        "are, quote, \"\"a curvy road.",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So we heard that phrase, a curvy road.",
        "We also saw President Rouhani telling the AP that he hopes the Trump administration will settle down.",
        "At the same time, President Trump has threatened to renegotiate the deal, the nuclear deal with Iran.",
        "But he hasn't done that.",
        "The U.S.",
        "has re-upped parts of the sanctions relief program for Iran.",
        "How does Trump's rhetoric match the reality of the administration's policy?",
        "Well, so far, the administration has not actually ripped up the deal, but it is threatening to put additional sanctions on Iran for other sets of issues which in effect will negates whatever economic benefits Iran was going to get out of the deal.",
        "And then Rouhani in particular was hopeful that the nuclear deal would only be the first step in that curvy road that he described towards other deals and gradual opening of Iran.",
        "So even Trump's notion that the deal is not going to go anywhere from where it is - that's also not really welcome news to Rouhani and those who voted for him.",
        "You know, President Trump has been saying on this trip that Israel and Arab nations have common cause in the threat posed by Iran.",
        "What's your take in how the president is trying to present these alliances here?",
        "Well, he has gone back essentially to the Bush era where there was a really close United States-Arab alliance against Iran.",
        "But the picture has become quite complicated.",
        "For instance, in Iraq, the United States and Iran since 2003 have been backing the same Shia government.",
        "In the past year, the two have been fighting the same ISIS enemy.",
        "And without Iranian support for the campaign against ISIS, the current U.S.",
        "strategy in Iraq would not work.",
        "So the president - I think President Trump jumped feet-first into a policy that is very popular in Riyadh and in other Arab capitals but actually does not address the complexity of interest that the United States has in different theaters of conflict in the region.",
        "In the end, do you see the same irony that some analysts are talking about in the idea of Rouhani, comparative moderate, retaining power in Iran at the same time that you have an American president who is at least in speech looking for a harder line?"

        "Yes, it is actually ironic, but also, it's even more ironic in that Rouhani - when he was elected first in Iran, he was a moderate.",
        "He moved significantly more to the left in order to get re-elected.",
        "And this is really a vindication of President Obama's initiative to carry out the nuclear deal, that the nuclear deal is now playing a transformative role in Iran's politics.",

        "Yeah.",

        "You know, ever since she won Wimbledon two years ago, she became sort of a marketing icon, but not exactly that on the tennis court.",
        "This is the first time she's even made the finals in a grand slam tournament.",
        "Since then she's been 0 and five in semifinals.",
        "But if she can beat number one, you know, the way she did Mauresmo yesterday, and beat number two today, she'd be making a big statement.",

        "Wouldn't it be fun to see a final between Federer - who's the best player in the world, no doubt about it - and Andy Roddick, who so many people think could be the next great American player.",
        "You know, Federer's favored every time he steps out onto the court.",
        "I think my favorite moment in the tournament so far came when he was beating James Blake in a tense match Thursday.",
        "In the middle of the match, Blake just stood out there on the court and yelled out what everybody was thinking: you're too good.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's got to be tough to admit when you're playing a guy, but it turned out to be the truth.",
        "So can anyone beat him?",
        "Oh, he did - you know, Federer went on to win, no question.",
        "So let's not conclude, though, without talking about Andre Agassi, now retired after a valiant but very painful third round departure.",
        "This has been an incredible career."
