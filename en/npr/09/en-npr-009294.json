        "Definitely.",

        "So I became aware of this community going through all of these, you know, speech therapies and things like that as well as the hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is something that I highlight in the book as well.",

        "And one thing that I experienced myself even though I'm not in the autism community per say, but having been in that world of parents with children with chronic illnesses, when the illness takes over your life - and I think that one thing that it does that's very unexpected for me anyway is that it's very isolating because you find that you don't have as much that you want to talk to your old friends about...",

        "And the only focus is lead.",
        "And it's a huge step forward for that because the only way to get the lead out of the water is to remove the lead and the galvanized lines.",

        "And I mean again, the only real solution for that is to get the poisonous pipes out of the ground.",
        "So this is one step for that, but it's not going to settle anything with money when it comes to water bills or personal damages.",
        "The judge has now given you a solution to the problem of lead pipes three years in the future.",
        "What happens for those next three years, though?",
        "For the next three years, we still have to be very careful.",
        "We have to test our water.",
        "If people do trust the filters to remove lead, they need to make sure they're maintaining their cartridges and making sure that they're being very careful.",
