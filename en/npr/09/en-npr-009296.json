        "Well, the question had to do with the gay lobby in the Vatican, which would refer specifically to people who work in the Vatican, primarily priests.",

        "At the level of substance - that is, concrete acts of governance - he hasn't done a great deal.",

        "And at that level, certainly judging by the crowds and the popular reaction in Brazil during the week that Francis was on the ground, you would have to say that he's done relatively well.",
