        "I mean, potentially, the main ways in which this sort of move forward to the winter holiday break really makes an impact on the primaries.",
        "It has more to do with kind of bodies and hands that have done the work of mobilizing.",
        "It has much left to do with the vote.",
        "Really, for a decade now, at every single election, the big story is - it's going to be the youth vote and the reality is, it's never the youth vote.",
        "I mean, the one thing that Obama's campaign can sort of rest easy about is that, really, it's never the youth vote that turns the tide.",
        "It is appropriate for him to continue to try to sort of mobilize his group especially towards thinking towards the generals.",
        "But young people, as enthusiastic as they appear, tend to not make the difference in primary campaigns.",
        "Robert, what about that whole door-to-door, no leagues of young, sweet-footed people going out and, you know, buttering folks up, is that going to make a difference?",
        "Yes and no. I agree with Melissa that, at the end of the day, the youth vote does not turn the tide.",
        "However - in terms of actual votes, but the youth vote does provide a lot of free labor.",
        "They're very energetic, they're very idealistic, and they're extremely enthusiastic about whomever their candidate may be, and this incidence, it, perhaps, could be Barack Obama.",
        "So, what Senator Obama is looking for is actual foot soldiers, people that are going to knock on doors, that are going to drive people to the polls, that - actually, he's basically looking for foot soldiers that are going to bring people to the polls that, ordinarily, may not come out or that may be running the fence; that's what may get Senator Obama to the finish line.",
        "There's folks out there that are undecided, that are saying, you know what, I'm not sure, but you know what, if you pick me up, if you give me a cup of coffee, if you give me a free ride, I might vote for your candidate.",
        "Now, Robert, let's talk a little bit about Mitt Romney - different demographic - talking about the Christian vote here.",
        "He is going to give a talk tomorrow about his Mormon faith.",
        "Will this be an outreach to evangelical Christians or a defense of his Mormon values?",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "I talked to the Romney campaign early this morning about this, and they are very adamant that this is not going to be a quote, \"\"the speech,\"\" if you will, which is very similar to what John F.",
        "Kennedy did in 1960 when he talked about how the Vatican was not - if elected, the Vatican was not going to control his ideological beliefs.",
        "The Romney campaign is telling me is that this is going to be about religion in general and about religion in the public square, and about how their needs to be religious tolerance or more religious tolerance in this country as it relates to different people's beliefs.",
        "The - I'm told he's going to make a subtle jab, if you will, at folks out there that may say Mormonism is all about polygamy or whatever the case may be.",
        "He's also going to talk mainly about how we are founded on a country where religious beliefs and religious tolerance is the element of who we are as a people, and then he's going to move to the future.",
        "So, this is going to be very interesting to see if, in fact, how that resonates with the American people, particularly with those voters out there in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina where, frankly, they may not know a lot about Mormonism.",
        "Once you build this hard infrastructure, there has to be a commitment - and hopefully, now, a commitment upfront - of putting dollars aside to maintaining it forever.",
        "Melissa, this is a country that has become increasingly pluralistic.",
        "You've got a lot more Muslims, people of various faiths, and yet, within Christianity, there still are these distinctions which can cause deep divisions.",
        "Do you think that evangelical Christians, by and large, are going to feel mobilized in a field where no one of the leading candidates really fits their demographic?",
        "I mean, this is part of what makes this particular election cycle so fascinating.",
        "You have a white woman and a black man leading with the Democrats, and a Mormon and a bad Catholic leading with the Republicans.",
        "This is, I mean, darn bizarre, but that's also what makes it - it means that everything is kind of up for grabs.",
        "It's not clear exactly how these, or traditional lines of identity are going to fall out when there's no sort of easy place to run.",
        "So, given that you have a Mormon and a Catholic, where will evangelicals fall?",
        "I suspect that if Romney can do the work of suggesting that Mormonism is, in fact, Christianity, which I think is, really, the central anxiety for many evangelicals who see the book of later Revelation the - of the Latter-day Saints - the book of Revelations that is the book of Mormon, related to sort of the North American conduit as they see that as being outside of Christianity, outside of what is generally accepted as the holy books of the Christian tradition.",
        "I think that it cannot just be about religion tolerance; Romney is going to have to make a very clear and strong statement that Mormonism is Christianity and that, in fact, the kind of world views and morals and ethics of Mormons are closer to that of evangelicals than the behavior of Rudy Giuliani."
