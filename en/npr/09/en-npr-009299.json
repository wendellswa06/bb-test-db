        "She's been in the news recently for saying kind things about Senator Barack Obama, who's running for the Democratic nomination.",
        "But she's also making news in her own right with new deals in North Korea and of course the possibility that she'll be attending what looks like a breakthrough conference in the Middle East involving Iraq, Syria and Iran.",
        "Donna Brazile, what is going on with Condi Rice?",
        "Well, first of all, she is testifying on Capitol Hill this week in defense of the president's new policy to add more troops in Iraq.",
        "In addition, she's defending the resources that the White House is requesting to complete - hopefully complete his mission, but I'm sure to continue his mission.",
        "The secretary is also announcing this week that there's a regional meeting that will be held in Baghdad the first half of March, which will involve both Syria and Iran.",
        "She knows that in order to succeed in Iraq, we must have a diplomatic surge.",
        "And she has some good people around her who I believe will help her secure her legacy as someone that was able to bring America forward in this war on terror.",
        "Donna, the reason that we're focusing on secretary of state this week is that you have a situation where many are saying that she is suddenly rising as a power in the administration, challenging the likes of Vice President Cheney in order to get the administration to agree to a deal with North Korea despite the opposition of far right-wing conservatives who are still condemning that deal, including John Bolton, the former U.N.",
        "delegate from the administration from the United States.",
        "You have now a situation where John Negroponte, who was director of National Intelligence, is coming over as her number two.",
        "But it looks as if she really is becoming much more of a player.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Look, I think she had a rough patch as part of the president's war cabinet, especially when Don Rumsfeld was at the table, who didn't really take kindly to anyone disagreeing with him, whether it was Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, or Secretary Rice.",
        "But I believe that she has found her stride.",
        "You know, look, I have to say in all honesty that I don't agree with everything the administration is doing on the war on terror or the one in Iraq, but I have an opportunity every now and then to sit down with Condi Rice to share my views and opinions, especially as it relates to Africa and Darfur and some other places on the globe."

        "Fauntroy, let me read to you some numbers from the Harris poll.",

        "In early February, a Harris poll found that her approval rating had slipped to 46 percent.",
        "But she still is the superstar of the Bush cabinet.",
        "Vice President Cheney is at 29 percent, President Bush at 32 percent approval ratings.",
        "Even the new secretary of Defense Robert Gates is at only 32 percent.",
        "So when you look at this, does it suggest that Condoleezza Rice really might have a political future if she is as successful as Donna Brazile says?",
        "Well, I think 46 percent is not necessarily something you want to hang your hat on.",
        "I think she's going to be hard pressed going forward.",
        "I think that her legacy in many respects is always one to be about being one of the chief architects and apologists and explainers for this failed Iraq policy.",
        "And all the while this is going on, North Korea has sort of spun somewhat out of control, although they're trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube with regard to North Korea.",
        "Still nothing going on of substance in Darfur to end the genocide there, and the other concerns around the world.",
        "And if I were the secretary of state, I would be focus on some of those other issues as well to take some attention away from what's going on in Iraq.",
        "Well, if you were Condoleezza Rice right now and you point out that there has not been a white secretary of state, well, since Madeleine Albright was secretary of state in the Clinton years - so that has been more than 12 straight years of people of color, of women, as secretary of state and you have Condoleezza Rice in the job now - why aren't we talking about presidential candidate Condoleezza Rice?",
        "Well, you know, that's interesting.",
        "There's been this Draft Dr. Rice movement that's been operating on the Internet for some time now.",
        "I think some of the reason why we're not talking about it is because she's - she hasn't given much hope to those folks, because she's continually said she's not particularly interested in the job.",
        "Why would it be hard for her to win a Republican nomination, Donna Brazile?",
        "I was at a convention just a few months ago, conservative - CPAC - the conservatives were in town.",

        "Pistole had not seen the sketch, but he gets the joke.",
        "He says TSA has taken steps that allow half of those who travel to go through expedited screening - the old and very young and those in the Precheck program.",
        "That's where if you pay $85 and undergo a background check, you can avoid some of the annoyances of post-9/11 air travel.",
        "With nearly half the people that we screen every day being able to go through TSA Precheck, they can keep their shoes on.",
        "So that's nearly 2 million shoes a day that people can keep on and their liquids, aerosol gels and laptop computer being kept in their bags.",
        "So those are clearly improvements in terms of our efficiencies.",
        "But the question of how best to identify those who are serious threats to attack an airliner remains a work in progress.",
        "Foreign fighters who have been in Syria or Iraq coming back to Europe or the U.S.",
        "are a concern.",
        "Pistole says his biggest worry over the years has been a terrorist not known to law enforcement here or abroad, and therefore not on any watch lists, carrying something the equipment cannot detect.",
        "The primary threat is still the nonmetallic improvised explosive device, the IED, that a person can have on their person, go through or walk through a metal detector, which is common worldwide, and never set off an alarm.",
        "So travelers to the U.S.",
        "from some countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East undergo increased security screening.",
        "But he notes there are so many airports to watch.",
        "Under Pistole, the TSA has also put more importance on behavioral detection methods, which he says are working.",
        "I believe that our behavioral detection officers do a good job of identifying people who are acting suspiciously without profiling.",
        "That's one of the key aspects - is make sure that they're not profiling.",
        "But the Government Accountability Office issued a report earlier this month that did question whether the agency has sufficiently tested those methods.",
        "Pistole says the TSA will be making some modifications in response to the GAO's findings.",
        "He says the TSA has moved from a one-size-fits-all approach to aviation security to a more professional, risk-based approach.",
        "Pistole is most proud of the increased efficiencies that have allowed him to eliminate some 5,000 screeners off the TSA's payroll and return $100 million to the Treasury.",
        "One final note - Pistole says there is no current elevated threat to holiday travel.",
