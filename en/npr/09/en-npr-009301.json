        "Most of cervical cancer is caused by what's called human papillomavirus, or HPV.",
        "And we now have tests for HPV, and that's been an important step forward.",
        "These tests are either done alone or in combination with the Pap test.",
        "They are another good choice for women between the ages of 30 and 65, the task force now concludes.",
        "And Dr. Owens says while Pap tests should be repeated every three years, women can wait five years between HPV tests.",
        "Five years is a good balance between the benefits and harms.",
        "It's still highly effective in detecting cancer, and that screening more frequently in that may increase some of the potential harms.",
        "And so we think that's a good interval.",
        "The harms, including unnecessary follow-ups, such as biopsies.",
        "The task force had considered suggesting two options, either the Pap smear or the HPV test, but its final recommendation, published in the medical journal JAMA included the combination test too, Owens says.",
        "The HPV test alone is not available everywhere, and so we want to be sure that women, no matter where they're receiving care, have options for cervical cancer screening, and the combination Pap test plus HPV test is widely available.",
        "And so all of those are good options.",
        "And a woman can, you know, discuss with her clinician what's available at the place she's receiving care.",
        "Women may not notice the difference between test, says Debbie Saslow at the American Cancer Society.",
        "An HPV test, a Pap test - the sample is taken the exact same way.",
        "Women usually won't know which one they're getting unless they ask.",
        "And she says that's potentially a problem since the follow-up time is different for the two - three years for the Pap test and five years for the HPV test.",
        "The biggest problem for cervical cancer screening and for most cancer screening is remembering to come back.",
        "And so one of the most proven evidence-based interventions is to provide reminders.",
        "And unfortunately most health plans don't do that.",
        "Saslow also says if women have a choice, she'd recommend the HPV test for women over 30."

        "I truly believe that including the HPV test either along with the Pap or instead of the Pap is superior than the Pap alone.",
        "It detects a type of cancer that the Pap test does not.",
        "And so wouldn't you rather find the two most common cancers than just the one most common type?",
        "There's evidence the HPV test is better at detecting adenocarncinomas, a less common form of cervical cancer.",
        "The main point is simply to get tested, Saslow says.",

        "But Owens says a vaccine alone doesn't replace cervical cancer screening.",
        "Our recommendation applies to everyone, whether you've been vaccinated or not.",
        "And it's very important that women don't forego screening because they've been vaccinated.",
        "Maybe eventually women who have been vaccinated will no longer need to get cervical cancer screening, but scientists want to have more evidence in hand before making that call.",

        "And I think one of the big controversies between the industry and the administration has been over permits offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, as their permitting was interrupted by the tremendously large BP oil spill in 2010.",
        "So that's a little bit hard to blame the administration for.",
        "And drilling there is pretty much back where it was before the oil spill took place.",

        "oil production is up, that natural gas is up.",
        "How much is it up?",
        "Well, it's up substantially.",
        "Maybe - I don't want to blame Obama for certain things like permitting.",
        "I'm sure he should take credit for the increase either since a lot of those drilling permits were issued under President Bush.",
        "The credit for the drilling boom really belongs to some innovations in private industry and the extremely high price of oil, which is a tremendous incentive for people to go out there and drill.",
        "Production is back to the highest level it's been since 1994.",
        "It's a little bit over 6 million barrels a day.",

        "We've heard President Obama talk about an all of the above energy policy with a large focus on renewable energy - wind and solar.",
        "What has he been able to accomplish in that area and where has he come up short?",
        "Well, he put an enormous amount of money from the stimulus bill into renewable energy projects and it's been a mixed track record, most famously the Solyndra half-billion dollar loan guarantee for the solar panel maker, which went bankrupt.",

        "It's a little early to tell for a lot of these things.",

        "Well, it's hard to remember, but four years ago, we were all talking about Cap and Trade and climate legislation that would've limited the emissions of greenhouse gases.",
        "That failed, so what's left is a patchwork of policies that will still end up lowering U.S.",
        "emissions of greenhouse gases and that's succeeding in part because of policies from the Environmental Protection Agency, but also, again, because of low natural gas prices.",

        "More than half the oil we use goes into American cars and trucks and more than one in ten barrels of oil produced in the entire globe goes into American cars and trucks.",
