        "It collected millions upon millions of dollars on the side, never publicly disclosed, and technically they did not have to be disclosed 'cause they're public relations activities.",

        "I just wanted to make the comment that a lot of times when people are talking about lobbying they're thinking about it in terms of elected officials, and that's I think probably the case with Jack Abramoff.",
        "But people often forget that lobbying goes on a lot in the executive branch agencies, anything from like, say, the chemical manufacturers lobbying the EPA or the Farm Bureau in the Department of Agriculture.",
        "And it affects the regulatory process and rule making and things along those lines.",

        "Those regulatory decisions--you see them on the energy front in mining and all kinds of areas, and all that gets much less coverage in the newspapers than what happens up on Capitol Hill although what is done in the regulatory process can have much more consequence.",
        "But again, I want to be clear.",
        "The idea that people have an idea, they have a pet project, and they want to make sure that it passes so they contact whoever can help them get this done--that's what our democracy's founded on.",
        "And then there's this thing called lobbying that once we hear the word we're a little bit shocked by sort of, you know, the excesses.",

        "Is it access?",

        "People who have money and companies that have money are going to be able to hire talented, skilled people who have access to members of Congress, often as former staffers or as fund-raisers in all kinds of roles, whereas the average citizen clearly cannot afford to do that.",
        "So there's always going to be an unfair distribution of power, and I think that is one of the nagging problems that underlies lobbying.",
        "But it's one that unless you're going to alter our system of government is not going to change very likely.",
        "Well, we'll talk a little bit more about those changes, about some of the proposed changes in lobbying legislation, some of those that we've seen in recent years, track how well they've done, take a look at the proposals to project how well they might do, as we continue to talk about lobbying today on TALK OF THE NATION and take your calls at (800) 989-8255.",

        "OK.",
        "Scott Klug, everybody's going to have some representation, but the argument at this moment is that those who have a lot more money have a lot more representation.",
        "I think that's true, but only in the sense that it's a caricature.",
        "I think the fallout from the Abramoff scandal is that folks think that everybody who goes and lobbies a member of Congress only represents large corporate America.",
        "My congressional district, when I was in, was essentially a 60-mile radius around Madison, Wisconsin, which meant a fair amount of the folks who came to see me with lobbyists actually represented, for example, agricultural trade associations.",

        "There'd be a lobbyist who'd come with the pork producers or the cattlemen.",
        "And so oftentimes the lobbyists are there to help those groups sort of talk in shorthanded code, which people do in the lobbying world or the radio business or as a nurse or whatever business you're involved in, and they're really there to help communicate the needs of your constituents.",
        "And I would guess in Larry's case and in my case, the vast majority of lobbyists I saw were most of the time accompanied by people from my district.",
        "Now I was on the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction, for example, over telecommunications issues, so I'd see people from AT&T and SBC, but I would guess at the end of the day that's probably only 10 or 15 percent of the folks I would see who professionally were lobbyists who usually were accompanied by somebody back home.",
        "Tom Edsall at The Washington Post, you've been watching this process for a long time.",
        "How does it actually work?",

        "What is it that actually turns the deal and gets a congressman's attention?",
        "Is it simply persuasion?",
        "Well, the ex-congressman is right in saying (coughs)--excuse me--if you have local pressure, you're going to be much more effective, and if there is a local interest that's in favor or against something that the congressman faces as a choice coming up, that's going to have a lot more to do with his decision than some abstract company from New York or whatever without any district interest.",
        "One of the skills of lobbyists has been to mobilize--it's called grassroots lobbying--to mobilize local people for causes of all kinds and to develop the stockholders as lobbyists, develop local branch managers and so forth and lobbyists know very well that it's very important to have local ties to be able to get good access to a member.",

        "In the software industry, we trace every line that's written or changed to its author, and since sunshine is the best disinfectant, why don't we do this with our laws so that congressmen or staffers can't do this under the table and at least have to own up to where things came from.",
        "The `this' you're referring to actually writing--when lobbyists write the legislation.",
        "Why don't we disclose that someone else other than the congressman or staff wrote...",
        "Why don't we just disclose where everything came from so if, say, a senator's getting a lot of money from Disney and they're writing a number of things very friendly to Disney, we know exactly whose staffer that came from in the committee.",

        "And so I disagree with the supposition of the caller that somehow this is all very mysterious.",

        "I mean, given the choice between some corporation that drops into my office unannounced who I have no relationship with who, you know, theoretically and sort of the way this has been colored, is going to raise a lot of campaign money for me, or my constituents back home, at the end of the day most members of Congress want to get re-elected, and the way to get re-elected is to make your constituents back home happy.",
        "And so again, I think I want to disabuse folks of this notion that somehow there's this sort of vast array of disembodied lobbyists who show up in members' office that don't have any connections to them.",
        "Most of it, even the campaign money, the grassroots organization--at the end of the day it's the focus to get people re-elected, and the way you usually get re-elected is by keeping people back home very happy.",

        "We're taking your calls at (800) 989-8255.",
        "Well, not all lobbying work involves big bucks and flashy perks.",
        "Non-profit organizations, like churches, also employ lobbyists, and they have to use different strategies than the bigger firms.",
        "So we'll take a look at the non-profit world right now with Sister Simone Campbell, national coordinator of Network, a Catholic social justice lobby.",
        "This is Larry too.",
        "I would add that a lot of this starts with concepts, and if the member of Congress agrees with the concept and where something is going from a constituent back home, then they take that to the legislative counsel and they put it in legislative language, and so you take it from the grassroots all the way up through the process and it's not necessarily drafted.",
        "There is a symbiotic relationship, however, that can't be denied between the lobbying community, but many of the people who are lobbyists are working away on very intricate, detailed issues that are putting a comma here or doing something that is all making the wheels of government work, because in a complicated society with many changes, a $12 trillion economy, there are going to be needed amendments and they come from various sources.",
        "And the vehicle for getting those into the legislative process is obviously the member of Congress.",
        "And there's actually more sunshine on this than people would believe.",
        "Well, let's talk about some of the changes that have already taken place in terms of lobbying.",
        "In 1995 Congress passed a Lobbying Disclosure Act.",
        "Tom Edsall, what did that do?",
        "It made it so that they had to disclose much more of the det--the actual dollar amount you were spending.",
        "Before then, lobbyists were reporting tiny, tiny sums for what amounted to really major efforts.",
        "And now there is much better reporting in terms of the costs spent by groups ranging from the Chamber of Commerce to lobbying firms like the one that just closed from the scandal, Alexander Strategy Group.",
        "So there's a lot of information available and a voter..."
