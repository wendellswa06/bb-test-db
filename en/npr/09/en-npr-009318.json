        "I would simply add that Tom made a really good point earlier in the program that a lot of the pressure on members of Congress goes back to their constituencies.",
        "In other words, if there's--if something is asymmetrical in terms of where the contributions and support is coming from, then the constituents back home are going to notice that.",
        "One of the problems that we have right now are all these safe seats where you almost have to be a serial killer to lose your seat, and if you don't have a safe seat and it's marginal then you're paying attention all the time to what you need to do back home and what attention you're paying to your constituency and how they would feel through this transparency system of knowing that you were getting so much money from Wall Street or the telecommunications companies or Disney, as your listener mentioned.",
        "The final arbiter on this has been the constituents, but we seem to have gotten away from that because of the safe seat notion.",
        "Well, Tom Edsall, how much time would constituents have to put in sort of sorting out where the money's come from and how that may or may not have paid off for them in terms of what their congresspeople are doing?",
        "It sounds like it would take an awful lot of time on the part of the voter to figure out where the money's coming from and whether it worked.",
        "All I can tell you is that the press in Idaho were pretty attuned to following that because it was so disclosed and transparent.",
        "Well, Tom Edsall, I know that you--I'll give you time to answer that if you wanted to chime in.",
        "I think that the press in Idaho may--there are some good papers in Idaho, but most districts, there is virtually no attention paid to this by the press, and it really is the obligation of newspapers to ask citizens to do this kind of work.",
        "It's just a huge burden.",
        "But it is sort of basic news coverage.",
        "Most local papers do not have anyone in Washington, and they don't--and figuring out how to track all this stuff--it's a lot of hard work and the lobbying is particularly hard 'cause it's not--with the campaign money you can track that and who gave it, but with the lobbying it's very hard to see how--'cause they do not disclose who they've talked to or who they've taken out to dinner or any of that kind of thing.",
        "Well, that said, would you say, then, that more disclosure is likely to make this a cleaner process?",
        "I think it's--I am a big proponent of disclosure in part 'cause that's my business is writing about this, and the more than I can know the better.",
        "I have mixed feelings about the--sort of the cleansing nature of disclosure.",
        "We've had more and more disclosure and I think basically what you've done to some extent is institutionalize and legalize a process that is pretty sleazy sometimes.",
        "Well, Larry LaRocco, do you think the system--let me ask you about that."

        "The industry.",
        "But does the system need reforming?",
        "I think it does.",
        "I mean, there is a danger in going overboard and going too far on it, but I think we can really clean this up a little bit and--for example, I know a lot of companies in DC or entities with PACs, for example, that are sick and tired of the insatiable appetite by leadership PACs.",
        "And that's just another way to have a bite at the contribution apple, and you give $10,000 one year and then it's--people demand 20,000 the next year.",
        "And I think maybe we need a timeout on that.",
        "And then--I don't know if Tom wrote the story, but The Post wrote a great story, I thought, on Tom DeLay and how he used one of his campaign committees to really live a pretty lavish lifestyle.",
        "And the folks back in Houston and Sugar Land really didn't intend for him to do that and to raise the money and then to go off to Caribbean islands and put everything under the rubric of campaign activities.",

        "Let...",

        "I don't believe it's really affected us too directly.",
        "At first we got a little nervous about what sort of further reforms and further distancing between our work and the actual members of Congress would be created.",
        "But, in fact, I--since we don't have money to give away and we don't have PACs, all we have are people around the country.",
        "And our effort at being a voice with and for those who live at the economic margins of our society--since that's all we have, I doubt that they'll outlaw that in the near future.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You're not too worried about any of the reforms.",
        "Is the work that you do fundamentally different from the work of the sort of K Street lobbying firms in terms of how you try to pressure lawmakers to get change?",
        "There are many similarities, but the fact is we don't have money, so what we need is people.",
        "And what we've established at Network, for instance, is a broad-based membership across the country of folks who share our perspective and commitment and are engaged at the local level with their legislators.",

        "And that's what we work with, both through e-advocacy--the Internet's a great invention for us--and also through our one-on-one relationships on the Hill with legislators.",
        "Does it work?",
        "Does it work?",
        "It has worked in some settings.",
        "I believe--for instance, the current budget situation in the House where they've not yet passed the 2006 budget, a lot of our work has been in explaining some of the details that will adversely impact low-income folks in our country, and some of the things that were slipped in, either intentionally or inadvertently, so that we've been working a lot with members' offices and with staffs to just say what's in there, and we feel like we've made a significant impact in both delaying it and in clarifying and changing some of the revisions.",
        "Well, I want to get this straight.",
        "Is there a question of you sort of persuading a lawmaker that this legislation is right or not right or in persuading the lawmaker that if they vote a certain way they can count on a certain effect in the polls?",
        "We can't draw the direct correlation between you vote for this, we'll vote for you.",
        "We can't do that one on one.",
        "I think the mess--if constituents are reporting--are engaging them, then that message is very clear.",
        "Our message usually is trying to touch their hearts but--because of the things we come at, we come at from a faith and values perspective.",
        "And to touch the legislator's heart, to see what do they care about, how do they meet that?",
        "And the second point is to just explain what's in these laws, because the point was made that this is a--often are very complex areas, and they--moving a comma, inserting a phrase, can make dramatically different results.",

        "And it wasn't the flowers; it was the thousands upon thousands of dollars of cut-glass vases and sterling silver pieces and everything that came with it, to the point that after her funeral, they had, down in Kentucky, they had a sale of all of those things and it brought in thousands of dollars for a food cupboard.",
        "He died as chairman of the Appropriations Committee in 1994.",
