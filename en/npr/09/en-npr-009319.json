        "I think it's interesting to me that you're bringing up this whole point, but it comes down to congressmen having to also police themselves.",
        "And for 40-something years, he just didn't take money.",
        "Now that's a very hard thing to do if you're not from a rural community as he was, but in the long run, if you don't take the money, they can't have you in their pocket.",
        "And...",
        "All right.",
        "Well, Chuck, let's get--I want to have time to get a response, but I do appreciate the story.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Scott Klug, on the one hand, if you don't take the money, then they don't have you in your pocket.",
        "There is kind of an equation there.",
        "But also, given the expense of campaigns these days, can you afford to turn the money away?",
        "And let me talk about that in just a second.",

        "Fifteen years later when they're retired, is it going to be filled up with gifts from--and memorials from vendors and business relationships?",
        "No. So I don't necessarily think that that story, as told, illustrates what the caller meant to say.",
        "But let me talk about relationships with fund-raising.",
        "Again, I think that every member of Congress wants to get re-elected.",
        "It's easier to get re-elected if you have money than if you don't have money, but that's just sort of simple arithmetic.",
        "But I think Sister, who's on the--sitting in the studio with you, can tell you the story that at the end of the day, what still matters more than anything else are relationships with constituents and how your voters feel about you.",
        "And back to Larry LaRocco's point earlier on.",
        "If you do something that's out of perspective, voters understand that.",
        "I mean, if you're flying around on corporate jets--which is one of the allegations in the Abramoff case--where you only pay the cost of a one-way business ticket, you don't pay the cost of the two--the turbo corporate jet.",
        "And if I'm flying from here to San Francisco, it's not a thousand dollars; it's 20 or $30,000.",
        "I think that's an abuse that should be stopped.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And one of the things I've thought been long ripe for abuse is the role of spouses, where spouses get hired by foundations or get hired by assignment, which is a direct payment to the member of Congress, not necessarily the same kind of thing as a campaign contribution.",
        "So there's more disclosure than ever before.",
        "If you're a crook, you're going to be a crook no matter how much disclosure there is.",
        "And unfortunately, that's the lesson I think we've learned over the last six months.",
        "After the reforms that came from ABSCAM in the '80s, after the reforms that came from the House bank fallout in the 1990s, whatever changes Congress will make this time out, if you're intention is to be a crook, you're going to be a crook.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, Sister Simone, I saw you nod when Scott talked about relationship being an important thing.",
        "I wonder if grassroots organizing is really the strength of a non-profit lobbying organization, if you've seen any growth in that as a result of these scandals, a sense that `If we don't have the money, we do have the people power, and we can affect things that way,' or are people becoming discouraged and dropping out of the process?",

        "But the other piece is, is that I think that there's a growing disenchantment with the idea that government is also part of the free market system and that government can be bought.",
        "And that's some of the equation that gets set up in these cases.",
        "You've got money; it only can go to the highest bidder if it's for--if it's a commodity to be bought like in the rest of the market.",

        "It could ostensibly be used to prosecute the president, the vice president, the defense secretary, and so on.",

        "This bill would go back so that anybody who had committed an act since 1997 that fell under the old definition of a violation of the War Crimes Act but not the new definition would more or less be off the hook.",
