        "This video presentation has actually become rather controversial there, I gather.",
        "Well it was upon its conception last year and in fact the Dutch authorities have decided to bring out another version that doesn't include some of the more controversial images that you mentioned, including the men kissing and the topless beach.",

        "I mean, that is the purpose of this whole exam.",
        "Again, it's an exam for people who have never been to the Netherlands, who may not know a lot about the Netherlands and is basically telling them, this is what you should realistically expect and, if that is something you can live with and if you can sort of take onboard some of the norms and values that you're offered through this course, then, yes, you can go to the next step, which is this preliminary residence permit, which will then be followed by further courses upon arrival in the Netherlands, and, at the very, very end of line, possibly citizenship.",
        "This seems to be the paradox facing your country, one that was personified by the late populist politician (unintelligible) that Holland is an extremely liberal society, that welcoming immigrants is a very liberal value, but that many of the immigrants who are coming come from societies that deplore those very liberal values.",
        "Yes.",
        "Although I think that where really all of this comes from is the sense that a lot of people have had and not just the followers (unintelligible), that it's been the Dutch authorities who have in many ways gone overboard trying to accommodate the cultures and the needs and the expectations of the immigrants.",
        "I mean, you could argue that can't really blame the immigrants for being intolerant, if you like.",
        "If from arriving in the Netherlands, all they get told is that you know it's fine to maintain their own culture, to keep themselves to themselves, if you like, and if by any chance anything in Dutch society will give offense to them, that's in order to show how enlightened and liberal and accommodating we are, then we will do whatever we can to change it.",
        "And it's that attitude that basically led to a lot of pressure on the authorities and that pursuit is still in the process of trying to come to terms with."

        "Now, one of my countrymen here in America who might want to move to the Netherlands would not have to take this test I gather?",
        "True.",
        "It's specifically for non-Western immigrants, which has been another big debate, because at first the idea was that every single immigrant would have to take it.",
        "Well, that was basically laughed off by the authorities who were then faced with the problem of implementing this whole system.",
        "So the argument there, the philosophy, if you like, is that people from Western countries and let's say, THAT for instance Australia, New Zealand, etc. are ranked here as Western, would from their own exposure and access to the media already know most of the things that are in this test.",
        "Therefore, it wouldn't be primarily aimed at them, and it's been narrowed down for formerly non-Western countries.",
        "In practice, really what you can argue is that there are two countries, Morocco and Turkey that it's really aimed at, and particularly, women and families of immigrants already living in the Netherlands who want to rejoin them.",

        "So even with a massive security presence, it's not foolproof.",
        "Looking at this from the perspective of the terrorists, do you think the fact that high-profile targets have been so heavily secured in the last decade or so means we're likely to see more targets of opportunity sort of like what we saw in Paris or Mumbai?",

        "They're looking at gaining attention.",
        "So I do think that in some respect, the lashing out at soft targets represents a bit of a last resort, even on the part of terrorists.",

        "They're losing against the Kurds in Iraq.",
