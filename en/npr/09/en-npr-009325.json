        "This is the first presidential race where anyone's opted out of public financing for the general elections since 1976.",
        "Why is that important?",
        "Well, it's important because it really does underscore Obama's ability to fundraise.",
        "That's in part what he is saying.",
        "We've been able to see these record money-making fundraising abilities since, I guess, the start of the primary season, from $30 million in one quarter at a time.",
        "You know, but when he's saying in an email to his supporters that public financing allows special interest to drown out the voices of the American people, and he's asking supporters to declare our independence from a broken system.",
        "It's going to be hard for a lot of voters to be outraged that he says, I'm not accepting federal funding, public money.",
        "(through translator) The people who had papers would make us work a lot more for less money.",

        "This is a product that comes with health warnings, but the health warnings are about the long-term possibilities of cancer from prolonged exposure.",
        "There's no health warning about the kind of reaction you're describing - suddenly dropping dead.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so the warning labels - all of them say do not use in an area without enough ventilation.",
        "And some of them give examples like, don't use in bathrooms; don't use in basements.",
        "But what they don't say is the consequences of this inadequate airflow.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So the European Union banned it from general use, which actually means the general public - consumers - but also generally professionals.",
        "They figured it was really only safe in engineered industrial environments.",
        "It's really sort of unclear why the U.S.",

        "The EPA is now considering a role which could involve stricter warnings.",
        "It could involve restrictions.",
        "It could be a ban.",
        "We'll have to wait till next year to see what they want to do.",
        "But the lack of warnings is not for lack of knowledge that this is problematic.",
        "People have been raising red flags for a really long time, as you report in this piece.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "In the 1970s, actually, there was a paper written by two medical researchers that pointed out the risk of a heart attack from using this chemical.",
        "That's one of the ways it can trigger death.",

        "Why did the Center for Public Integrity decide to look into this issue?",
        "We heard from a public health official that this is a problem.",
        "There was a paper written about it by researchers several years ago when they realized that people working on bathtubs - stripping old bathtubs - were dying frequently from this.",
        "And then we realized this was still happening.",
        "The most recent death was in July, and we thought that this is a situation where lack of information is literally killing people.",
        "And finally, what are the companies that manufacture these products say about the safety of them?",
        "They say if people follow the instructions, then they're safe.",
        "That's Jamie Smith Hopkins who investigated deaths among people working with a solvent commonly found in paint strippers and other products.",
        "Thank you very much."
