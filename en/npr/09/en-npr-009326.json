        "So, it will be interesting to see if the voters seem to agree with McCain that he is being dishonest, that he's going back on his word initially that he would be accepting public funding and now he says, well, instead I can raise the money on my own, and I don't want to accept public money if it means also being grasped by the tentacles of special-interest groups or lobbyists or PACs.",

        "And you know, until now, Barack Obama has presented himself as the kind of candidate who will take a principled stand and will forgoes things that may be advantages to him as a politician in favor of being honest with voters and being a different kind of leader.",
        "And what he's shown right now is that he's doing the kind of thing that the Clintons used to do, which is, you know, say one thing and then do another if it becomes politically more advantageous.",
        "So, I think he's going to have to be careful about making moves like this, even when they make sense.",
        "And the other thing we have to watch is who will be donating to his campaigns, I mean we're assuming that he's going to get a lot of his money from the Internet because that's where he's gotten it before, but if he forgoes public financing and some of the controls that come with it, who knows where this money is going to come from.",

        "But does this incident show that his team has gone too far in trying to protect his image?",
        "Yeah, I think it does underscore that it is very precarious for the Obama, as an individual and for he as a politician, as the nominee for the Democratic Party.",
        "While his, you know, senior adviser, Anita Dunn, said this does not in any way reflect the orientation of the campaign, it is difficult for people to remove supporters, people who - volunteers, those whether they be on volunteer or on staff working for Obama, to separate the two.",
        "While Obama and his campaign now have to work hard at his image and not really as what we're seeing as of late, particularly after being in the near presumptive nominee that he's working hard on his image.",

        "I think this is a terrible gaffe to take place.",
        "While it may not have been the presumptive nominee who actually asked these young ladies to move their seat, it's nearly tantamount to that because these are his supporters, these are people working on his campaign.",
        "Eric, how do you think this is going to play out over the campaign, because there is this whole question of, you know, Swift Boating and truth squading and, you know, Senator Obama has this whole, you know, Web site set up specifically to rebut rumors.",
        "So there's definitely a role in every single campaign for trying to protect your image, but particularly in a campaign that is kind of throwing out the we are the world, you know everyone grasp hands, this is the new America image.",
        "Isn't this problematic?",
        "Well, I'd say there's two things that jump out, I mean about this.",
        "The first is that Obama, there's these growing murmurs that he has problems with press relations, that his people are too heavy-handed, they don't give enough access to the candidate, and that John McCain is much better at charming the press than Obama is.",
        "So again, I think this is more of a reflection of that, that, you know, they are having a hard time, a difficult time figuring out how to present Obama in a way that doesn't shut down the press and seem too heavy handed.",
        "And I think they're going to have to develop a more nuanced way of dealing with these issues.",
        "Otherwise, it's going to backfire.",
        "The other thing that's going on here is that Muslims, frankly, are concerned because Barack Obama doesn't attack the central issue at the heart of a lot of these issues, which is that - what's wrong with being Muslim?"
