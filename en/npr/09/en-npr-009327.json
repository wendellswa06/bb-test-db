        "More than 100,000 people were killed in the war in Bosnia, almost 10 times the number in Syria - so far.",
        "Daniel Serwer, with Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, says there's certainly a difference in scale.",
        "But he says in both cases, diplomacy, and threats by the international community, had little initial impact on the violence.",
        "I think what you've got is a situation which atrocities are being committed.",
        "And the international community, while it clearly has a consensus against these atrocities, does not have a clear and compelling consensus to intervene, to prevent them.",
        "Serwer says it took more than three years to develop the consensus to intervene in Bosnia.",
        "He says there was a cumulative effect where news, day after day, of atrocities and executions increased moral outrage.",
        "But one event may have been the catalyst for change.",
        "There have been reports of at least four massacres in Syria, but on a much smaller scale.",
        "The worst was in the region of Houla, where more than 100 people - mostly women and children - were killed.",
        "Serwer says that massacres and other atrocities in Syria may spark disgust.",
        "But he says so far, there is little public support for intervention.",
        "I haven't seen that kind of revulsion developing in the United States.",
        "Americans are not very focused on Syria, and I think they're acutely aware of the risks - and costs - of getting involved in another Middle Eastern war.",
