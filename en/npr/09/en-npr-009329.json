        "It is subsidy dependent, though it's getting very close to not being.",
        "Advances in technology have brought the price of wind down 25 percent since 2008.",
        "And firms say that if that continues the industry will be able to free itself from the boom and bust cycle of tax credit dependence.",
        "In the short-term, though, the credit still expires again at the end of 2013.",
        "So new wind farms started in 2013 are safe.",

        "You say that the euro is irreversible, so unfounded fears of reversibility are just what they are: unfounded fears.",

        "Let's say a country is struggling with too much debt, and the interest rate it pays on government debt is soaring.",
        "Draghi says the ECB will step in and buy up the country's short-term bonds as a way of tamping interest rates back down again.",

        "We will do whatever it takes within our mandate - within our mandate - to have a single monetary policy in the euro area and to maintain price stability in the euro area and to preserve the euro.",
        "In other words, the ECB's main job is to keep inflation under control.",
        "But saving the euro will take much more than that.",
        "Draghi made clear the bond-buying program is, at best, a temporary measure and European officials must begin to think in broader and bolder terms.",
        "That means building the kinds of institutions and regulatory bodies the eurozone needs to keep crises from growing out of hand.",

        "But I think Yvonne brings up an interesting point.",
        "It's a point that I've been trying to, as I've moderated different programs throughout the years, get people to deal with, and that is the idea that as the world becomes more interconnected and, to a great degree, countries become less reliant on the United States for certain things, there is this sense of standing up against big brother and saying, `You're not going to tell me that I can't have something that you have,' and that if we feel the need to protect ourselves with nuclear weapons or anything else, we're going to do it.",
