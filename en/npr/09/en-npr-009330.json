        "Well, I think the answer to that--I was just going to say, I--quickly--that in my view, the answer to that question is yes.",
        "We are going to have to accept some limitations on our prerogatives in deference to the international opinion and work in a multilateral fashion if we're going to go forward.",
        "We're not going to able to do it on our own.",
        "I think that's certainly the case that as we move forward we're going to have to acknowledge also that there are going to be some nations that are not going to respond to any multinational effort regardless of what kind of shoring up we do with the UN.",
        "There will still be nations that will not respond to other sanctions or proposals that are put forward.",
        "And we have to move beyond that.",
        "They will not respond to diplomatic overtures, as well.",
        "And I think that the United States is going to have to realize that--I don't even like the term `bully.",
        "I just think that they have to re--understand that they cannot police other nations in the same way that they may have been able to do in the past.",
        "Moreover, having international--rather, foreign policies that are not transparent, that seem hypocritical, that does not foster any trust in us to have other countries want to get on board to by our allies or would even be willing to concede that perhaps their position needs rethinking.",
        "Marcelo, how realistic is it for us to assume that those in Washington who, quite frankly, turn the corner very slowly will look at it that way?",
        "When you listen to military brass and, quite frankly, when you listen to politicians who've been entrenched in this kind of a global picture for years, the idea of being the biggest kid on the block, quite frankly, is something that is seen almost as patriotic and is not going to be cast aside easily.",
        "Sure, but there is a disconnect here between the political position and the rhetoric and the increasing realities of these new global frameworks that we've been discussing.",
        "States have always been in the business of amassing power and the military is, of course, a piece of that state function.",
        "What's increasingly important is that in the context of global formations around weapons of mass destruction, around nuclear weapons, increasing legitimacy, transparency, better science, better policy, better monitoring mechanisms is what will be required regardless of the rhetoric.",
        "The US moving forward will need to increasingly coordinate its interest with the interests of the international bodies in order to be successful in deciding and in identifying what are the battles that are worth fighting and what are the battles that will get us nowhere.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's turn our attention to something that is interesting not only by virtue of the issue we'll be dealing with but where it comes from.",
        "We're going to have Governor Bill Richardson on and talking about the state of emergency he's declared in his state and neighboring states when talking about the porous borders and the concern of illegal immigration here in the United States.",
        "But this comes out of Virginia--not out of Florida, not out of Texas, not out of Arizona, but Virginia--where there's a fight when--in a neighboring county--and in Herndon, Virginia, specifically--who wants to build a site for day laborers to gather.",
        "Because right now, they gather on the side of the highways waiting for construction work from day to day.",
        "Now there is a question of whether or not tax dollars should be used to build this facility where these day laborers would gather.",
        "And two of Loudoun County's towns are--counties are, in fact, fighting.",
        "One wants it; one doesn't.",
        "And the idea that we thought was interesting here is the mixed message that's being sent, quite frankly, across the country where we're fighting illegal immigration, yet we're providing valid driver's licenses; we're building, for instance, this facility with tax dollars and the like.",
        "Marcelo, when we look at this, is there a need?",
        "Because, quite frankly, these laborers are so much a part of the economy to make it easy, and in many people's minds, it's a good way of tracking these people.",
        "What's interesting, Ed, is that this is taking place in the South.",
        "The South is undergoing a profound demographic transformation as a function of this huge wave of immigration.",
        "For the first time in the history of our country, we now have more illegal immigrants coming into the US every year than legal immigrants.",
        "This is touching every state of the union, rural, urban, suburban areas.",
        "What we see here in Virginia is another indication of the great dystopia that has come to characterize this wave of illegal, undocumented immigration.",
        "We are making a mess of the border.",
        "We're making a mess in terms of managing what should be orchestrated nationally at the level of the federal government to bring order into what is clearly an out-of-control and chaotic situation.",
        "When they started the coalition, Dr. Betz says they knew they wanted to include both people in health care and gun dealers.",
        "Glenn and Yvonne, I'm going to have to hold it there.",
        "I apologize for not letting you chime in on that, but we were going so far with the first couple of topics that we've run out of time for today.",
        "But as I said, we'll have Governor Bill Richardson on with us tomorrow.",
        "We'll certainly talk about this as it affects his state.",
        "But I thank you all, Marcelo, Glenn and Yvonne, for joining us today.",
        "Appreciate it."
