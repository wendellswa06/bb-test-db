        "I think that in Social Security, we need to restore long-term solvency, which would also contribute modestly, not hugely, to deficit reduction by having a balanced plan that comes half from trimming future benefits and half from raising more revenue for Social Security.",
        "And for the budget as a whole, I believe that we ought to achieve a balanced plan to deal with long-term deficits that, again, is about half on the budget cut side and about half on the revenue side with the revenues including significant changes in tax breaks, tax expenditures, tax entitlements, as Alan Greenspan once called them.",
        "And it's interesting that Ronald Reagan's former chief economic adviser, the noted conservative economist Martin Feldstein, wrote last summer that if you want to cut wasteful spending, the biggest source of wasteful spending in the federal budget and the first place to go to cut wasteful spending are all these subsidies that are delivered through the tax code.",
        "So I think if we could have a balanced, a 50-50 mix for the budget as a whole and for Social Security, both sides would have to compromise, but that would lead us to a balanced, long-term plan.",
        "Would the changes in Social Security include an increase in the retirement age?",
        "I personally would rather get the contribution on the benefit side and Social Security in another way.",
        "And the reason I say that - raising the retirement age is widely misunderstood.",
        "Most Americans who hear it think that what it means is that if you continue to work till 67 or 68 or 70, your benefits would be the same.",
        "That's not accurate.",
        "An increase in the retirement age is simply an across-the-broad cut in Social Security benefits.",
        "Whether you begin to draw benefits at 62, 65, 67 or 70, the effect is the same for each year that the so-called full retirement age and the Social Security benefit formula is raised.",

        "It isn't the privatization, per se, that produces the big cuts in the Ryan Medicare proposals.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "There's no question, but that the single most important thing we have to do for the long term is to reduce the rate of growth of health care costs.",

        "There are some things we can do now, but they are modest compared to what we have to do long term.",
