        "And again, this is one of a series of conversations on the federal debt we're having this week.",

        "We've asked you to save your questions for then.",

        "And Robert Greenstein, some said that yesterday, whether they approved it or not, that at least the proposal by Congressman Ryan spelled out the ideological basis for the Republican plan.",
        "It's political risky, in some respects.",
        "Obviously, challenges to Medicaid and Medicare, well, if you're going to endorse those, you're taking political risks.",
        "You just mentioned some political risks that you would endorse, too: raising taxes, as some would put it, by letting the Bush tax cuts lapse.",
        "Maybe the Democrats need to put out their own plan and be just as bold ideologically and say, all right.",
        "Let's go to a single-payer health care system.",
        "Let's whack the defense budget, and that's how we do it.",
        "No, I don't agree with that, and it's the same reason that I don't agree with the praise that Ryan is getting.",
        "When people put out plans that make it harder to reach bipartisan compromise, it sets us back, not forward.",
        "The last time we had a really big bipartisan deficit reduction plan, a very successful one, was in 1990, under the first President Bush, and the leaders of Congress in both parties were heavily involved.",
        "That did not start by the Republicans or the Democrats putting out highly ideological plans that had no chance of going anywhere.",
        "The Ryan plan is the most extreme, most ideological plan I've seen in nearly 40 years of working on these issues in Washington.",
        "You know, it turned out the Congressional Budget Office issued an analysis yesterday of the Ryan plan, and they said that under the Ryan plan, federal expenditures for everything in the federal budget other than health care, Social Security and interest payments, would be cut from 12 percent of the gross domestic product today to three-and-a-half percent several decades from now.",
        "Well, that's about what the defense budget costs.",
        "And what it revealed is that Ryan's long-term vision is to actually virtually eliminate most of the federal budget, most of the government, education, environmental protection.",
        "That doesn't advance the ball, nor would it - I happen to personally think a single-payer system would be a good idea.",
        "I spend zero time thinking about it.",
        "It doesn't fit with American political culture.",
        "It isn't going to happen.",
        "And insisting on it doesn't help us to make progress.",
        "So I actually worry that the Ryan plan will encourage Republicans to be more inflexible and dig their heels, to argue there can be no revenue contribution at all, despite the fact that we have over $1 trillion a year in tax breaks in the tax code.",
        "That's more than Medicare and Medicaid cost combined.",
        "And it will end up, you know, being stuck.",
        "We need mechanisms to move forward towards a middle ground, not to stand off to the side and propose solutions that would greatly increase poverty, widen inequality and clearly can't pass.",
        "Robert Greenstein, thanks very much for your time today.",

        "Are you surprised?",
        "I am surprised a bit, because they were initially giving quite a bit of pushback on this, but then I think they realized they were more details to it than the higher-ups had realized.",
        "Now, an internal review doesn't guarantee necessarily that it will be thorough or exhaustive, but it's a positive sign that they are paying some attention to it.",
        "And your point in your piece was that this was, in some ways, the ghost of Donald Rumsfeld haunting Arlington National Cemetery.",
        "Yes.",
        "And of course, obviously, we can't particularly blame Rumsfeld, or even his successor, Gates, because it happened at a fairly low level, but it is the sort of thing that went on earlier with the refusal to allow the photographs of the flag-draped coffins returning at Dover Air Force Base, or Secretary Rumsfeld having an automatic machine sign the condolence letters to the families of the fallen.",
        "It sorts of fits in with that pattern, and it's one that Secretary Gates has tried to exorcise from the Pentagon.",
        "This is - has been a notable exception to that, however.",
        "And in those cases, the justification was privacy."

        "I think it's important to point out at the outset, though, that if a family, the next of kin, say they don't want media coverage, well, there's no media coverage, and certainly there'd be no protest from any of us in this business.",
        "We're talking strictly about cases in which the family has said, yes, we would like to have media coverage at this funeral.",

        "So, essentially what appears to be happening is the family saying yes.",
        "The folks at Arlington are saying no.",

        "You cannot hear the proceedings, the photographers cannot get a line of sight, and in fact, you leave the ceremony before it's over, with the very important moment when the folded flag is handed to the grieving widow or mother, what have you.",
        "All of these things, I should add, were - it was very common to be allowed to hear, see, and be very close to the proceedings as recently as 2005, when I went to report on - when I was very surprised that all of that had been taken away.",
