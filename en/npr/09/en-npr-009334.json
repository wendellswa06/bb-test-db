        "Okay, The Extra Lens is led by a guy named John Darnielle, who is better known as the lead singer of The Mountain Goats.",
        "And basically, The Mountain Goats started out at John Darnielle in front of a junky boombox, you know, with fans whirling in the background as he's strumming on an acoustic guitar and singing these kind of bare-knuckle anthems.",

        "What makes it better than music I would hear when I go to get my nails done at the spa or something, you know, that kind of relax.",
        "I think this for one thing, the sound is much richer and much deeper.",
        "And music like this really, really benefits from very, very good headphones and kind of allowing yourself to become immersed in it, where it's not just a synthesizer going, wah.",
        "The sound has kind of almost three dimensions to it."
