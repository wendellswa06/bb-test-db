        "And right now it looks like he certainly might not win it.",
        "The final bell has not rung.",
        "But when you have somebody like John McCain, the senator from Arizona and, crucially in this particular instance, a former prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, opposing the president's legislation and advancing his own and getting other moderate Republicans to join him, then you're up against a very tough fight, as the vote in the Senate Armed Service Committee yesterday demonstrated.",
        "That vote went against the president's plan.",
        "And among those moderates, by the way, is somebody who is not a senator or former secretary of state, Colin Powell, who wrote a letter to Senator McCain endorsing the McCain legislation.",
        "And the crucial sentence there is - the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.",
        "That's pretty strong language for a former Bush appointee.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the language that he didn't use when he was in office, isn't it?",
        "Isn't that right, Glenn?",

        "Yeah.",
        "I guess this is not a segment on Colin Powell, but I agree with that.",
        "Much could be said about that.",
        "But, you know, there's an election coming.",
        "The war in Iraq and the failure in Iraq is a deep burden for Republican candidates and finally we're getting some congressional oversight and pushback from even Republican senators and congressmen and women who have some doubts about what the president is doing.",
        "And Colin Powell's point that the world is losing confidence in our moral leadership is a deep and profound point.",
        "Secrets prisons, extraordinary rendition...",
        "And an obvious one too, Glenn,.",
        "Guantanamo, you know.",
        "But, you know - but, Mary, the president has been in this position before when it seemed that he could be counted out, and at the end of the day he manages to prevail.",
        "What prevents him from doing that again?",
        "Here's what I think.",
        "McCain and Graham, who both have military experience, are acting on conscience and for the best interests of our troops in the long run, not just in the short run; so that if they're captured by somebody they'll be protected.",
        "So they're right on the substance.",
        "Whether they can hold out on the politics of it will depend on a lot of things.",
        "It'll depend on whether Bush's approval ratings go up so that he's seen as an asset rather than a liability going into the next election.",
        "It'll depend on how much the conservative base leans on McCain, who's running for president, to get onboard and whether he then resolves his doubts in terms of his conscience."

        "A president can always promise you nominees for judges in your states and all kinds of stuff.",
        "But I would say, looking at it now, since Warner is stepping down as chair - this is the end of his Services chair - and McCain is running for president, and the polls now go the other way, I think that the president has a good shot losing this one.",

        "And despite Blair's pronouncements, the latest national poll in his own country shows 53 percent believe the government was losing the war.",
        "And get this, 56 percent thought the war was being lost by \"other governments,\" namely us.",
        "So how shaky, Joe, is the coalition that went to Iraq initially?",
        "Well, the allies haven't gone anywhere.",
        "They're where they always have been, and that's in opposition to the policies of Washington as it relates to the war in Iraq certainly; not to the large on war on terror, which includes the invasion of Afghanistan in which you really had a lot of allied support."
