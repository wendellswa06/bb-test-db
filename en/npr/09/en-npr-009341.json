        "Good to see you.",

        "What happens?",
        "What does the body do when it gets hot?",
        "How do we respond to that?",
        "Well, the body has two avenues, two ways to lose body heat to the environment.",
        "The first is putting blood to the skin, and if the environmental temperature is low enough, basically you can radiate heat from the skin to the environment to dissipate heat.",
        "But as the temperature of the environment gets higher than the body temperature, you can't use that way of losing heat anymore, so you secrete sweat to the skin and the sweat then evaporates and that causes evaporative cooling to the blood in the skin and therefore allows you to lower body temperature.",
        "So how hot can people tolerate?",
        "How much heat can they tolerate?",
        "Well, it depends on the person.",
        "A highly conditioned athletic who's acclimatized to the heat can get body temperatures well over 40 degrees - over 41 degrees often reported - and they'll have adverse consequences.",
        "Whereas perhaps a frail older individual may have body temperatures not much over 40 degrees, and may have problems.",
        "But it's not just a function of high body temperature, it's also the cardiovascular strain placed on the person.",
        "As I had said, putting blood to the skin requires additional blood flow and stress on the heart, and also as you secrete sweat and that evaporates, that can also cause dehydration, causing more cardiovascular strain."

        "And Larry Sonna, maybe I can turn to you, you're interested in not so much these, you know, whole body physiological responses to heat, but more on the molecular level.",
        "What happens to cells when we get exposed to the heat?",
        "Well, as it turns out, cells throughout the evolutionary tree have mechanisms to compensate for exposure to high temperatures.",
        "A variety of biochemical processes take place, one of which includes the expression of certain types of proteins known as heat shock proteins.",
        "These heat shock proteins have many functions, one of the important ones of which is to serve as sort of the 911 response of yourself.",
        "Mmm-hmm.",
        "One of the things that they do that seems to be important is they help proteins that have been unfolded by the heat refold back into a state that's normal.",
        "That's of course one of the best understood processes, but there are many others as well that are still under active investigation.",
        "And - well, first I should say we're talking with Larry Sonna from the University of Maryland, and Michael Sawka from the U.S.",
        "Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine about how the body responds to the heat.",

        "Why is someone like Michael Sawka who studies the whole body response to heat, what does your research have that would help him?",
        "Well, it turns out that we respond to environmental stress in general, and heat stress in particular at all levels.",
        "At the behavioral level people will move to cool themselves down.",
        "you divert blood flow to the skin, you help lose heat.",
        "And as you move down to tissues and even cells, these responses at the lower level help protect cells from subsequent stresses, and respond to the stress that they're under."
