        "Mmm-Hmm.",
        "...that as we understand how the body responds psychologically, the key is really tying in to the molecular adaptations, in that, as we look at heat injury, we had always looked at it very simplistically just due to an overexposure, but now we're starting to learn that, one, in terms of protection of the mechanism of the body, it's not only your ability to dissipate heat, but the ability for cells to adapt - and we don't really fully understand - so that they can stand higher levels of body temperature and greater reductions in blood flow to them.",
        "On the other hand, we're starting to understand that some people under certain conditions are becoming more susceptible to injury, and that it may not be in heat loss responses, but on particular days or particular events, whether it's due to sickness or in a young and healthy - such as athletes - from events preceding, that maybe, may or may not affect the heat loss responses which we've traditionally looked at in science, but may actually deactivate a lot of those molecule systems, or may do both together.",
        "So on some instances, people may not only store more heat, or may not, but they also, at the same time, may be unlocking these protective mechanisms, making a given person on a given day more susceptible to very serious heat injury.",
        "All right.",

        "My question is, what mechanisms does the brain have that keeps it cooler than the rest of your body?",
        "Because your body can tolerate a higher change in temperature than your brain can.",
        "What's the deal?",
        "Interesting.",
        "I guess Michael Sawka?",
        "Well, I'll answer that.",
        "First of all, the brain doesn't have - recently we just found out what brain temperature is relative to body temperature.",
        "As physiologists, most mainstream physiologists always thought that brain temperature was approximately equal to arterial blood temperature.",
        "And there were just a few minority individuals that actually thought humans could have brain temperature lower.",
        "But as it turns out, brain temperature's actually slightly higher than arterial temperature, which are some very recent experiments, and the brain does have a lot of very good protective mechanisms, because as I said, the temperature's higher.",
        "But the same molecular responses that protect the brain actually can be decoupled and cause injury.",
        "So the brain basically is about the same as our ulterior blood temperature, or slightly higher.",
        "It's reasonably well protected, but it's not a lower temperature.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Even when it gets extremely warm?",
        "Well, the experiments that have actually been able to directly - get a close to direct measurement of brain temperature have been with physical exercise.",
        "But it seems that the brain has higher temperatures for two reasons.",
        "One is, is that at least when you have the high blood flows associated with exercise, blood flow to the brain may decrease slightly.",
        "Michael Sawka, I am sorry, I shouldn't have asked that question when I did, because we're right at a break.",

        "Here today we're talking about heat and how our bodies deal with the heat, and we're talking with Larry Sonna.",

        "Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Massachusetts.",
        "And just before the break, I asked Michael Sawka about how the brain keeps cool in extremely hot environments.",
        "And maybe you can just go back over the two points that you were making.",
        "Yeah, what I was saying was that the brain is not any cooler than the rest of the body, according to our latest scientific evidence, and that in fact with heat stress associated with physical exercise, the brain is probably slightly warmer.",
        "And the reasons for that is a reduction in brain blood flow, which would also probably carry over to arresting heat exposure, because you have to support the high skin blood flow.",
        "And second is, there's an increase in metabolism in the brain, so increase heat production in the brain, at least during physical exercise, which contributes perhaps the slightly higher temperatures, and we don't know whether that occurs with arresting heat exposure.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, here's an interesting phenomenon that you may not have thought about.",
        "But when the temperature climbs into the high 90s in Philadelphia or New York, why are there likely to be more deaths than in, say, Phoenix or Miami, where the temperatures are routinely in the 90s plus range?",
        "Joining me now to talk about that curious question is Larry Kalkstein -sorry, Kalkstein.",

        "Hi, Joe, good to be here.",
        "So what's the answer then?",
        "Why - why would people in Phoenix be less susceptible than people in Philly?",
        "Well, first of all, let me tell you that when you have a heat wave in Philadelphia or New York, it is considerably hotter than what you get down here in Marco Island or in Miami.",
        "Every day here is basically the same.",
        "When you live in South Florida or even New Orleans or even somewhat in Phoenix, although less so, our weather is the same day after day.",
        "We get up to 89 or 90, get down into the mid-70s and so on.",
        "That is not going to kill you.",
        "What you need to kill you is high variability in the weather, and that is what happens in cities like New York and Philadelphia.",
        "For example, you have a large number of days maybe in the low to mid-80s, and then all of a sudden you get one of those weeks where the temperature shoots to near 100 or above, and those are the killing situations.",
        "So rather than the extremity of the heat, it is the high variability that's most important, and that's why more people die in Philadelphia from the heat than they do in Phoenix, Arizona."
