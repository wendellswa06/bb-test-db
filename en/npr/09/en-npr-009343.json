        "Hmm.",
        "And so you've been trying to work with the National Weather Service on tweaking at least a little bit the nature of heat warnings for different cities.",
        "What's that all about?",
        "Well, the National Weather Service is the agency that's designated the call the excessive heat warnings.",
        "Whenever you hear one on the radio or television, it's the National Weather Service that calls this.",
        "For years they've been using a very strict set of criteria, usually being a heat index of over 105 degrees for a couple of days, and sometimes the minimum temperature of 80, and that's when they call the heat index - what they call an excessive heat warning, whether you live in Boston or Atlanta or wherever.",
        "Our research shows that our response to heat is very relative, and you react very differently to heat in Boston than you do, let's say in Atlanta or New Orleans, and so our systems are locally tailored for each individual city, and we look for thresholds beyond which we see increases in human mortality.",
        "So ours is based on a health outcome rather than just some arbitrary number like 105 degree heat index.",
        "So you went to hospital records and found out how many deaths were related to the heat and what the temperature and humidity and all that was, and that how you used to come up with these heat indexes for different cities?",
        "Something like that.",
        "We have compiled everyone who has died in the United States for the last 20 to 30 years, and the data are compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics.",
        "So we can tell every day's total deaths for any given area.",
        "We can't talk about individual people and what Mary Jones died from, because that's private, but we do have total numbers of deaths.",
        "So we know what weather conditions lead to increases in mortality, and basically we don't just look at temperature and humidity, we look at a wide variety of weather parameters.",
        "For example, if it's 95 degrees and clear out, that's more dangerous than it being 100 degrees and cloudy because the heat load on a building when it's 95 and clear would be much more extreme, and you get many more deaths under that circumstance.",
        "So these heat warnings are for information purposes, but I mean they don't change the fact that you're still stuck in a hot environment."

        "Yeah, but they are much more important than just for information.",
        "For example, all the health departments are clued in to this in every major city - emergency managers, utilities, and so on.",
        "And also, there are - along with the warnings are given information to the public as to what they should do to lessen their vulnerability to the heat.",
        "One of the bits of advice we tell them not to do is to sit in front of a fan in a hot apartment, because it has a convection effect.",
        "But let's say you are a poor person without air conditioning, you live in an upper story of a tenement in Philadelphia.",
        "Your best bet is to go into a bathtub and sit there and remain cool during much of the hottest part of the day, or to get out of the house and go to an air-conditioned mall.",
        "That advice is dispensed, and all of these people like the health departments and utilities, they do something whenever excessive a heat warning is called.",
        "In Philadelphia they activate an 800 line that people can call and get information if they're starting to feel dizzy or whatever.",
        "They actually take the homeless off the streets, open air-conditioned shelters.",
        "And in some cities, utilities, when people don't pay their bill, they cut off their service.",
        "But if an excessive heat warning is called, they do not - they suspend these disconnects.",
        "In other words, those people can maintain their utilities even if they haven't paid during this excessive heat event.",

        "Well, there may be.",
        "In fact, I'm looking at an article right now by a group in Israel that has looked at individuals who are highly heat intolerant versus people who are normally tolerant, and there do appear to be biochemical changes that are not proceeding normally in people who are heat intolerant.",
        "I don't think this group has had the final word on it, but the observation that the expression of certain proteins that may be protective against this kind of stress differs from people who are normal from heat intolerant.",
        "It's certainly a very - it's a very interesting observation and I think one that will give us a lot of work in the next five to 10 years to follow up on and follow forward.",
        "How would you use this information.",
        "I mean, if you found some molecular marker that said you were heat intolerant, what could you do with that?",
        "Well, there is sort of several levels at which you can look at it, beyond just simply the interest in science itself.",
        "One is, if you could in fact find a practical marker - right now to diagnose someone as heat intolerant, one of the things you have to do is either stress them in the heat and observe their core temperature relative to normal, which is sort of what the - one of the research ways of doing about it.",
        "Or the other way is, sadly, to be someone who is prone to having incidents of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, much more so than the people around you.",
        "Wouldn't it be great if we could find a cellular marker or a biochemical marker or a gene expression marker that could tell you before you got to that point that, you know, you're someone who's at risk for this kind of injury, and perhaps you should take extra precautions during the heat.",
        "I like it.",
        "I can't come to work today.",

        "Yes.",
        "I was - we're moving from Gloucester, Massachusetts to South Carolina, and I was wondering - it sounds like we can actually cope with the heat on a molecular basis.",
        "I'm wondering how long do those kind of changes take, or is there any research - when can I expect to be able to tolerate the heat in South Carolina?",
        "Well, Michael Sawka, maybe it's more of a practical question, since the molecular answer to that is probably not going to help Bob very much.",
        "But what do you think, Michael Sawka?",
        "Well, it's nice that you ask that question.",
        "We just finished up a study working with a group at the University of Maryland, looking at heat acclimatization and some of the molecular adaptations.",
        "What's kind of interesting is we don't understand the molecular adaptations to heat quite as well, but if you look at the time span of heat acclimatization, that's the physiological adjustments that reduce the strain, minimize the strain of the body for a given exposure, generally, for the average person, most of the - a large majority of your adaptations can occur over five days, or about a week, and most of your - you're almost fully adapted after about two weeks, roughly.",
        "Okay?",
        "And if you look at some of the molecular adaptations, most of those adaptations occur over several days and probably follow a very similar time span.",
        "So as you look at adaptation, you're looking at it, one, of an adaptation of improving heat loss so the strain on the body, the cardiovascular system, the rise in body temperature is not as high, and at that same time you have these molecular adaptations so that within the cells, as they get hot, it's less likely to produce injury.",
        "Did you - I'm just thinking, since you're at the U.S.",
        "Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, were there any special instructions given to U.S.",
        "troops who might have come from Gloucester, Massachusetts and suddenly found themselves in Iraq?",
        "Well, what we do is we had very extensive instructions and very extensive preventive medicine guides that we've developed over many decades, and these fall around principles that are used for risk management of heat exposure, so that you can maximize adaptation, so that - and also do other risk management procedures so that you can, one, maximize performance, which is particularly important to the U.S.",
        "armed forces so that they can have peak operational effectiveness, but also at the same time minimize the effects of injury.",
        "So yeah, there's very extensive guidance.",
        "Any main thing that you warn them about?",
        "Well, I think for the general population, as we look at risk reduction, I think that, you know, you basically would fall under a broad category of minimizing exposure, and these are all common sense types of things that I'm going to tell you right now: minimizing exposure, acclimatizing, that, you know, gradually increasing the amount of heat or physical work or exposure that you have over a number of days so that you can allow the adaptive responses, you know, to occur.",
        "And also it's important - and you certainly hear a lot about this in the press - is maintaining hydration because the cardiovascular system's important, so you want to have adequate blood volume.",
        "So it's important that people drink, and they also have high sweat rates, so you want to replace that water lost.",
        "But you know, as we talk about heat injury, and we've had this outbreak on people's minds in terms of deaths, it's really important to realize that there's really two different types of heat strokes that we see, and two different populations at risk."
