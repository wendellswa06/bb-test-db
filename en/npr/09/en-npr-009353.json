        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "I mean, obviously China has been through something of a rough patch over the last century and a half, you know, when the technologically superior West arrived with its gunboats and sort of nibbled away at China's edges and Japan occupied it, and China was pretty much defenseless to defend itself.",
        "So, that was humiliation enough.",

        "And what made the whole Tibetan demonstrations so painful and so incredibly disruptive and evoke such enormous amounts of anger and indignation in China was that it threatened to intrude on this very carefully written script to which China had spent huge amounts of money and time, and here it was on the very precipice of that long-awaited moment, and then it seemed to be snatched away from them.",
        "Of course, every nation wants to win as many golds as possible at this Olympics, but would you argue that in China it is especially important not only because China is the host country, but because of this idea of vanquishing this national humiliation identity?",
        "I don't think there is a country of consequence - another country in the world that cares as much, even as it pretends it doesn't care about how the outside, and particularly the developed world, sees it.",
