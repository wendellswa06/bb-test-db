        "I went to pick up the press, Dana Milbank included, and I got back out there and it had been moved pretty far away.",

        "There was no regulation.",
        "There was no standard.",
        "And that was my problem, ultimately, is that there was nothing in black and white to refer to.",
        "There was nothing that you could point definitively to and say, this is the policy.",
        "This is the regulation.",
        "And so, as a result, things would constantly change, and that was my issue.",
        "That it was arbitrary, in a sense."

        "Yeah.",
        "And bottom line, the cemetery bureaucrats took control away from the families.",
        "I think, ultimately, it is up the families, whether or not media coverage should be allowed, and the family should be the one to determine what media coverage means to them.",
        "Dana Milbank, as Gina Gray just said, you were there that day.",
        "Why were you there?",
        "And tell us about the experience from your point of view?",
        "Well, I had gone, as I do occasionally, to write a column about a funeral.",
        "I had last done it a few years earlier, and it was quite a moving ceremony.",
        "I returned to do what I thought would be the same thing, then realized suddenly that we could neither hear nor see what was going on.",
        "So, I actually wrote about that experience of not quite seeing or hearing the funeral.",
        "And I had not realized that this set off this internal debate that ultimately led onto Gina's firing.",
        "And Gina, are you convinced that your dismissal was retaliatory?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah, I am.",
        "What is it, more than anything, that points that out to you?",
        "I think just from that moment - from the day that the Lieutenant Colonel Hall funeral occurred, and I had put my foot down and started questioning, you know, where are these regulations?",
        "And then when I couldn't find them, I began questioning that further, and I think from that point on, it was very hostile and just kind of contentious.",

        "A secondary question that's not directly relate to this, but is it possible that the, quote, unquote, \"\"rule\"\" of no media coverage also kind of stems back from the (unintelligible) Baptist Church that puts up these incredibly hateful, anti-gay signs, I mean, protesting, you know, a completely unrelated subject.",
        "They're not protesting the war.",
        "They're protesting a gay lifestyle.",
        "And then just try and prevent any of them from getting anywhere near the funeral procession or anywhere else between?",
        "Dana Milbank, there have been these, well, protests that are very upsetting to military families of people - well, I think Gretchen's got it right in a capsule.",
        "Sure.",
        "I think it's unrelated, because those have not been, to the best of my knowledge, at Arlington, which could obviously crack down on that sort of thing anyway.",
        "Arlington has a very special place in country's memory.",
        "It is the most hallowed ground for somebody who has served in the military to be buried in.",
        "So, that's why there is, perhaps, an additional public-access question, in terms of what should be viewed of the services there.",
        "And as the earlier caller, the general, certainly when somebody had that sort of a point of view, there would never even be a question.",
        "But in other cases when the family was open to it, there is this matter of balancing the family's privacy with the American public's need to know that there's still a war going on.",
        "And Gina Gray, if memory serves, that group lost a First Amendment case and were found that - prohibited from further demonstrations like that.",
        "Were there any concerns about demonstrations like that at Arlington?",
        "Well, they can't protest on cemetery grounds.",
        "Nobody can protest on the cemetery grounds.",
        "And the burials are far enough away that if they were to protest, you know, outside of the gates, you still couldn't hear them while the ceremony was going on.",

        "I appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",

        "And again, we're so sorry for your loss, but what happened when - what went into the thinking?",
        "Did people talk about it?",
        "We actually had an internal family discussion about what we wanted to do with media coverage.",
        "I actually work in media relations, and have for over a decade, and so, I spoke with my parents about what they wanted.",
        "And our decision, as a family, was that we wanted to find a place of middle ground, which was we did not want coverage that was exploitative.",
        "We wanted to seek coverage that would honor my brother and the sacrifice that he had made, and that would honor his life.",
        "And so, for us that meant that the first week after my brother was killed, before we even went to Arlington for the funeral, we did not do any on-camera interviews.",
        "We did do an interview with our local newspaper.",
        "And we did feel that, in the case of Arlington National Cemetery, that the media - we knew they would be back a ways, but that the pictures and video that they would get would also help our whole community grieve, because my brother grew up in this community.",
        "And in the event, did it?",
        "I think that it did help our community, because 40,000 people could not go from a small town to watch their local hero be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, and yet, there were hundreds of people who were deeply moved by my brother's death.",
        "And I think it was a way for people to be able to experience that and to also, you know, be part of that experience.",

        "The way we solved the problem, as the previous caller mentioned, a lot of people wanted to grieve over my father's passing, but weren't able to attend mostly because of their age, we actually hired a videographer, and the videographer made CDs for us, and...",

        "It was all private, and since that time, my mother's shown CDs to probably four or 500 different people that wanted to participate in it but couldn't make the trip.",
        "So, I think rather than having the press, I think that's another option people have.",
        "But I would be against the press.",
