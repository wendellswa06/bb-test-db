        "And so when these artists showed up, I think they themselves were so amazed at the knowledge, the passion, the enthusiasm that, you know, audiences in Congo, or in Egypt, or in Poland had for their music.",
        "They had no idea, and that was really eye-opening for them.",
        "But we also see moments in your film when a number of these artists were conflicted about being ambassadors for the U.S.",
        "at the time when they were still facing, you know, very obvious blatant discrimination and racism in the U.S.",
        "I mean, you know, you're thinking - you're watching this and you're thinking, you know, they would have been turned away from some hotels in the United States, you know, at that time.",
        "How did they deal with that dilemma?",
        "I think that's the real heart of the film, and what we've set out to answer is that question.",
        "You know, this was obviously a great opportunity for them to tour the world and to go to new places.",
        "But it was - there was a paradox at its heart, which is you're being asked to stump for a country that doesn't treat your own people as equal citizens.",
        "And that is the great dilemma of America's stance in the Cold War at that time.",
        "So my effort in making this film was really to understand how each individual artist responded to that question in their own words.",
        "And we really looked around the world for pieces of archive, interviews, memoir writings, whatever we could find where Louis Armstrong, or Duke Ellington, or Dizzy Gillespie could answer that for themselves.",
        "And what's so great about these musicians, they insist on almost unanimously telling it like it is - not sugar coating anything, being honest.",
        "And that comes through both in what they say and in how they play.",
        "And that's what really was the most successful, and probably from a State Department point of view, the least expected outcome of this.",
        "But it's what really worked.",
        "There's a very moving image in your film of Louis Armstrong performing this jazz standard, \"\"Black and Blue,\"\" in Ghana.",
        "It's a wonderful song.",
        "I'm not sure everybody always listens really carefully to the lyrics, so I'm going to play a little bit of it.",
        "And then we can talk about what he's saying.",

        "(Singing) How would it end?",
        "Ain't got a friend.",
        "My only sin is in my skin.",
        "What did I do to be so black and blue?",
        "It's remarkable piece of footage to see Louis Armstrong singing that to Dr. Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana in 1956 as that country's experiencing its own independence struggle.",
        "And Robin D.G.",
        "Kelley, who we interviewed in the film, speaks so eloquently about the universality of those lyrics about the desire to want to be other than you are.",
        "And Armstrong is really able to bridge this divide with that Ghanaian audience and specifically to such an important leader like Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, such an important liberating figure in African politics and say, we sympathize.",
        "This is a universal issue, and we're somehow connected.",
        "Fortunately this is a lip-dub, and Don Mclean will be singing it instead of us.",

        "In the end, what do you make of their journeys?",
        "Do you think these musicians were ambassadors for the U.S., or were they in some ways ambassadors for music or for jazz as a kind of a universal language?",
        "I think that all of those things, actually.",
        "They are certainly ambassadors for the United States.",
        "And maybe it's a bit more difficult to imagine it from today's point of view, but the world they were inhabiting was so conditioned by this binary Cold War opposition of Soviet Communism and an American democratic values.",
        "So I really did get the sense as I researched this film and got closer to the thoughts of these musicians that they were very patriotic and they did want to help the United States.",
        "And yet, as many people who were involved in the film and we were able to interview attest, there was - it was all about a kind of internationalism and a lack of a specific ideology and forming connections around the world.",
        "So",
        "that really goes beyond the, you know, the United States and its particular grievance with the Soviet Union.",

        "It's about child abuse and what the media's responsibility is in reporting it.",
        "Last Friday the ABC news magazine Primetime broadcast videotape of a man in Northern New York abusing his 15-year-old stepdaughter.",
        "It caused outrage in the community.",
        "Here is Brian Mann from North Country Public Radio.",
        "In 2002 Primetime's producers set up cameras in two volunteer households, hoping to catch the intimate lives of stepfamilies in crisis.",
        "They recorded more than 1200 hours of tape with the family of Joe and Lynn Nelson, who live in tiny Vermontville, New York.",
        "Kyle Nelson, Joe's daughter from an earlier marriage, was then 15 years old.",
