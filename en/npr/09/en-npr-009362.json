        "We - it seemed like a sensible prediction at the time, but of course, Barack Obama ran an absolutely brilliant campaign, and he has come through and dominates, I think, many of the predictions for this year.",
        "Some people might call this spin, but I'm going to give you a little bit of credit here.",
