        "For Kevin Peterson, though, a memorial doesn't go far enough.",
        "Peterson is the founder of The New Democracy Coalition, which promotes civic engagement in Boston.",
        "Since last summer, one of its main causes has been a call for the city to remove the name Faneuil from Faneuil Hall.",
        "We saw it as an opportunity to engage the nation and the city around the issue of race.",
        "Peterson wants to rename the building for Crispus Attucks, who was killed during the Boston Massacre just a few blocks from where Faneuil Hall sits.",
        "He's the first person to die in the Revolutionary War, happens to be an African-American who was part Native American.",
        "I asked visitors at Faneuil Hall what they thought about the debate.",
        "Most of them were tourists visiting the city on vacation, and none of them knew about Peter Faneuil's role in the slave trade.",
        "But they didn't seem to have strong feelings about the name either way.",
        "Andy Dreyer was visiting from Minnesota.",
        "I don't know if you can change everything based on its history.",
        "But you know, if it's really hurtful to some people, it's definitely worth consideration.",
        "As for the artist, Steve Locke, he wants to keep the name.",
        "So it matters that it's Faneuil Hall.",
        "It matters that he built it.",
        "And he built it with the lives of trafficked people.",
        "So we really can't let him off the hook for that.",
        "And if we change the name, then we end up letting him off the hook for what he did.",
        "Locke's proposed slave memorial at Faneuil Hall has support from the mayor of Boston and is currently being reviewed for funding.",
        "The advocates for changing the name haven't gotten a hearing.",
        "But whatever happens, these debates have resurfaced a chapter of history that many people might have forgotten - or never learned in the first place.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Maggie Penman in Boston."

        "This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News, I'm Lynn Neary, sitting in for Rachel Martin.",
        "Sunni insurgents continue to push their way into Iraq, capturing strategic border posts and cities west of Baghdad.",
        "These territorial gains bring ISIS closer to their goal of creating a Sunni caliphate stretching from the Mediterranean to Iran.",
        "Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in the MIddle East today, and he expressed his concern about the insurgents movements.",
        "He called their ideology \"\"a threat to the entire region.",
        "Even Thomas Jefferson in Query 14 of \"\"Notes on the State of Virginia\"\" said that - and this is almost a direct quote - that the orangutan prefers African females over his own female of the species, suggesting that Africans and orangutans slept together.",
        "That's Thomas Jefferson, the father of the Declaration of Independence and probably the father of Sally Hemings' children.",
        "Well, let me ask you both, though, about a reading or I suspect re-reading - and I know, Henry Louis Gates, you wrote in the introduction of course you read it before, and I suspect that's true of Hollis Robbins as well.",
        "But what was it - the first thing you had to do in entering this project was presumably go back and re-read the book?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "For me, now I - as I mentioned in the introduction, I first read it in the eighth grade.",
        "But I first became aware of \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\" watching \"\"The Little Rascals.\"\" And Eliza escaping across the ice flows was both hilariously funny and very, very moving for me.",
        "And in fact doing this research, Hollis and I looked at a lot of the film versions, including \"\"The Little Rascals.\"\" But it was full of surprises for me.",
        "The biggest surprise for me was that the transformation of Uncle Tom from an almost mythical hero to black people, a transformation from that hero status to become the ultimate term of race betrayal is one of the great mysteries and ironies in African-American history, Neal, and it happened in 1919.",
        "We can even pinpoint.",
        "Do you know that Frederick Douglass, writing in 1892, DuBois writing in 1903, James Weldon Johnson writing in his autobiography, \"\"Along This Way,\"\" all hailed \"\"Uncle Tom\"\" as one of the great works of American literature and one of the best things that happened for the cause of African-American people.",
        "Frederick Douglass wrote that in the midst of these slave troubles came the book known as \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\"\" a work of marvelous depth and power.",
        "Nothing, Douglass continues, could have better suited the moral and humane requirements of the hour.",
        "Its effect was amazing, instantaneous and universal.",
        "Now that was Frederick Douglass.",
        "And as we point out in the book, Douglass reviewed this book, talked about this book over and over in Frederick Douglass' paper, his own newspaper, between 1852 and 1854, and even defended it when a black man, Martin Delany, one of the fathers of black nationalism who claimed he had read it but was basing his opinion on his wife's opinion.",
        "He wrote in and said, remember in - key to \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\"\" Mrs. Stowe says that it's - Uncle Tom was based on the figured of Josiah Henson, who wrote his own slave narrative.",
        "And Martin Delany writes in and says, if it was based on Josiah Henson, maybe Mrs. Stowe should give Josiah Hanson the royalties.",
        "And Douglass fought Martin Delany and fought everybody who with - and believe me, no other black person traduced this book.",
        "The only people who were criticizing Mrs. Stowe in the page of Frederick Douglass and most of the other press in the North were apologists for slavery.",
        "And what happened in 1919?",
        "Well, 1919, the strangest thing happened.",
        "In an address - yeah, you remember Marcus Garvey."

        "Booker T.",
        "Washington was his hero.",
        "But Booker T.",
        "Washington died in 1915, and Garvey went on to found the United Negro Improvement Association, and Garvey became the most populist black nationalist in the history of black nationalism without a doubt.",
        "And at his rally - or first of all, Garvey enunciated this concept in 1919 saying, the old-time Negro is gone, buried with Uncle Tom.",
        "And then at a rally in August 7, 1920, one of his lieutenants, the Reverend George Alexander McGuire, declared and I quote, \"\"The Uncle Tom nigger has got to go and his place must be taken by the new leader of the Negro race - not a black man with a white heart, but a black man with a black heart.",
        "And that was the beginning.",
        "And it culminated of course with Malcolm X.",
        "And Malcolm X in 1963 famously called Martin Luther King an Uncle Tom.",
        "And it wounded King.",
        "Martin Luther - Malcolm X said, just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to keep the Negroes from assisting the bloodhound or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by teaching them to love their enemy, or pray for those who used them spitefully, today Martin Luther King is just a 20th century or modern Uncle Tom or religious Uncle Tom who is doing the same thing today to keep Negroes defenseless in the face of an attack that Uncle Tom did on the plantation, to keep those Negroes defenseless in the face of the attacks of the Klan in that day.",
