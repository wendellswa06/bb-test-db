        "Well, Hollis and I did a book event, a marvelous book event, at the New York Public Library about a month ago, I guess.",
        "And the last question asked from the audience was this.",
        "Who would I characterize as being an Uncle Tom today, meaning not in a derogatory sense - and Neal, we have to come back to explain why the shift from Uncle Tom being a hero within the black community to be a term of derogation, why that came about.",
        "But I was really - and they looked at me and they wanted me to come up with somebody.",
        "And the person who, ironically enough, comes closest in my mind to conforming to the characteristics and beliefs of Uncle Tom was none other than Martin Luther King himself.",
        "Martin Luther King - think about it - sacrificed himself for his people, just like Uncle Tom did.",
        "He was a deeply religious, devout Christian.",
        "He wasn't self-serving.",
        "He was large of heart and generous of spirit.",
        "I mean if there was a 20th century Uncle Tom, it was Martin Luther King, but not in the sense of Malcolm X - Malcolm X intended it; in the sense that Harriet Beecher Stowe drew the character.",
        "Wouldn't you agree, Hollis?",
        "I think that's absolutely right, though I'm glad you're actually embracing your answer this time.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Because I think people were a little shocked that anybody would - even now, after our book, when people have started reading it, that it's hard their heads around the idea that Uncle Tom is actually a lovely character, just like the - our caller just said, that he's good, he's kind, he's gentle.",
        "And Stowe was very deliberate in her characterization of him, though he's obviously an uneducated person and he speaks in dialect, except when he's quoting the Bible.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "His English is beautiful, his English is perfect, and she really wanted him to be seen as a speaker of the Gospel.",
        "Now, one of the problems I think that contemporary readers, particularly African-American readers - and, Neal, you have to remember, we did this book to recuperate \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\" for the African-American community, for a new African-American reader, in the same way that my dear friend and colleague Jane Tompkins and many other feminists in the '70s and '80s writing about Harriet Beecher Stowe recuperated her for feminists.",
        "No one had done that, though black people have written about this book extensively.",
        "There wasn't an edition that had done that sufficiently, and that was at least my motivation for doing it.",
        "But one of the problems with trying to get young black readers to read the whole book is the..."

        "For example, in chapter six, which is called \"\"Discovery,\"\" she says, Very soon about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows, on the veranda railings, each one determined to be the first one to apprise the strange master of his ill luck.",
        "And then: Won't he swear, said little black Jake.",
        "Yes, he does swear, said wooly head Mandy.",
        "You know, it's all the wooly-haired and all that black this and that, which is certainly partaking of racial attitudes of that time, but contemporary black readers have a hard time getting over that.",
        "I figured that if we could annotate that out and get them through that, they could realize how profound, an effect, as James Weldon Johnson said in 1933, this book has had...",
        "Can I say one more thing?",
        "I just wanted to say, yes, that Tom was good and kind and compassionate, but he was also enormously strong, both physically and mentally.",
        "He was.",
        "I mean he was a powerful figure, and after 24 hours of reading this, I thought, oh, good God, if only we had him in the White House...",

        "But you have to say, it was written in that time."

        "...there's a proliferation, literally, of tens of thousands of what we call Sambo art, derogatory images of black people, black people stealing chickens and watermelons, with big, thick lips and mispronouncing the King's English, almost to put the genie back in the box, because black people had never enjoyed as much power in this country as they did between 1866 and 1876, Radical Reconstruction.",
