        "Oh, I loved \"\"Nigger by Dick Gregory.",
        "I wrote about it in my memoir \"\"Colored People.",
        "Oh, well, when I read that - I think I was 17 years old, maybe - it just turned my head around.",
        "Yeah, me too.",
        "I did a report on it in my class at school and the teacher wouldn't say the name out loud.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think in a similar way that has happened with \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\"\" Because I think that over the years - and I'm a middle aged black man - I have heard Uncle Tom, Uncle Tom, Uncle Tom, but the Uncle Tom that people were talking about was not the Uncle Tom that I read in the book.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's right.",
        "And much of what I think has happened - and I'm not a literary scholar by any means - but what I think has happened is that there have been so many generations of folk who have heard that phrase Uncle Tom in such a disparaging way that people just make the assumption that that's what Uncle Tom was.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I'm sure Malcolm X never read this book.",
        "If he had read the book...",

        "And even for James Baldwin, when he wrote his famous essay - the 1951 essay - he didn't realize how sexually powerful Uncle Tom is in the novel.",
        "Though Stowe works very, very hard to make sure we don't see it, I think it keeps - it keeps emerging, the sexuality keeps emerging.",
