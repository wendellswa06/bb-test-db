        "Yes.",
        "I'd like to - I'm sort of glad that Professor Gates left, because I want to take this is a little less intellectual direction, and that was how I was affected by the portrayal of \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\" in the show \"\"The King and I,\"\" which really spoke to the dignity of man as a whole.",

        "Yes.",

        "I thought it was a wonderful parallel.",
        "It was a way of bringing home exactly what, you know, Rogers and Hammerstein had in all of their plays, if you look at a subtext, of the dignity of mankind.",
        "And it's interesting that in the introduction to the book, Hollis Robins, it's written that though the facts as presented in the little house of Uncle Thomas in the movie are all wrong, that somehow they manage to get the metaphor right.",
        "They get it exactly right, that it's about whatever you need to do to leave.",
        "Whatever you need to do to be free, whatever you need to do to escape from the shackles that are both emotional and physical shackles there.",
        "Which is, I think, the better parallel for \"\"Anna and the King of Siam\"\" as well, especially given - well, given the strange domestic makeup of the palace there, with all of those various children and not a sort of monogamous family structure.",
        "Which was sort of Stowe's critique of slavery, was that there was no nuclear family or nuclear family kept getting...",

        "I had never read it before being asked to - being assigned to do this interview, yes.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "I think because it fell so far out of favor in the 1950s, when I grew up and was going to grammar school.",
        "By the end of the 1950s, the book was completely out of favor and I never saw a reason to read it - I'm embarrassed to say.",
        "And now that I've read it, I've had to, of course, revise all of my thinking about what the fundamental nature of the book was; indeed, what the fundamental character of Uncle Tom was.",

        "And that is, does anybody read \"\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\" today?",
        "Well, absolutely not.",
        "I mean, that's - I came to it in graduate school at Princeton, was assigned it in a 19th century literature class.",

        "But I was reminded as you were talking - or I saw a parallel to the character of Jim in \"\"Huckleberry Finn.",
        "Yes.",
        "Who's often been characterized and caricatured as sort of the ignorant, superstitious black man, and sadly I think Toni Morrison has even written, you know, a tract about how that book should be struck off the canon.",
        "But in fact if you actually, you know, read the book, Jim is the one and perhaps the most moral character in the book.",
        "He is a father figure to Huck.",
        "He teaches Huck ethics and morality.",
        "And yet he has been - he's really known, I think, in the same way that you're discussing Uncle Tom, in a much different light.",

        "I think a lot more people read \"\"Huckleberry Finn.\"\" But go ahead, Hollis Robins.",
        "Well, I think that's an excellent parallel.",
        "And I think one of the things that Stowe was trying to do - and I'm not sure about Twain.",
        "But Twain's dislike of religious doctrine, of this doctrinaire idea that you had to believe to a certain sect, you had to be baptized, you had to have agreed to this or that doctrine in order to go to heaven - that Stowe embraced the idea of natural goodness and a natural Christianity.",
        "And in this way she was - she was sort of thumbing her nose at her father, her doctrinaire father, that Uncle Tom is unschooled, like Jim, and yet utterly humane and utterly good.",
        "But at the same time I would agree with you that that sort of utter goodness Christianity, Christ-like figure, sits very uneasily with the superstition.",
