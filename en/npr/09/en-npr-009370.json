        "Well, starting in 2004, four foreign companies - Siemens of Germany, Alstom of France, Bombardier of Canada and Kawasaki of Japan - they agreed with China to transfer technology so that China can come up with the high speed trains.",
        "China spent money for that.",
        "In Kawasaki's case, China spent close to $760 million to come up with a train that goes as fast as 155 miles per hour.",
        "And over the last five to six years, China's train companies learn quickly, enough so that they started adding technology, innovation to the original technology.",
        "And they believe they've done enough re-innovating that trains that they came up with are their own technology.",
        "You talk in one of your reports for the journal with folks at one of China's high speed rail companies, CSR, and a spokesman says, look, this is nothing like Kawasaki's bullet train.",

        "Yes.",

        "There's no way you can call this your own technology.",
        "But, China says, no, no, no. You know, we made enough additional innovation that we're calling these trains the result of our effort.",
        "So they feel that they can export these trains to places like U.S., Brazil, Russia maybe, and foreign companies feel that that is in violation of their contract.",
        "And do the foreign companies have legal recourse at that point?",
        "I think they do.",

        "Do you find that foreign carmakers are still eager to develop new car technologies in China, given what a huge, huge market that is?",
        "Basically, yes.",
        "I mean, they have no choice in many industries including auto, China is now the biggest.",
        "So if you don't succeed in China, there's no future for you, basically.",
        "So, the dilemma is how to control how much you give to China.",
        "Publicly I think you have to strike this posture that you're really willing to help China.",
        "But at the same time, you have to find a way to control the technology transfer process.",
        "And that's going to be a big challenge for anybody."
