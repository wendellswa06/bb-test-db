        "Government corruption is a major problem, and benchmark laws on de-Baathification, oil, and provincial powers have stalled over lack of consensus on what kind of country Iraq should be.",
        "There's no agreement on what Americans might call states rights.",
        "The absence of these laws means it's not clear what levels of government are responsible for what.",
        "And as long as these laws are not passed, there are unlikely to be local elections, which Ambassador Crocker believes are critical to providing local credibility and stability.",
        "It's probably going to be fairly important to have elections, say, within the coming year as a means of, you know, regulating this competition.",
        "In the meantime, Colonel Gibbs says people he meets tell him the Americans are the government for now.",
        "We're that link until the government stands up.",

        "After five years, no one is meeting the expectations of Iraqis.",
        "And just as no one has anything good to say about the government, many Iraqis still blame the U.S.",
        "for their problems.",
        "At the social services office, Iraqis are just as critical of the Americans as they are of the Iraqi government.",
        "Given its huge power, Iraqis say the Americans must be deliberately undermining Iraq.",
        "But for all its effort to push the process, the Bush administration seems powerless to get timely results from the Iraqi government."

        "You know, in the case of the ad offering, you know, to get someone off the island, it was apparently from someone in the States, a Cuban American saying that she'd be down here this summer and that she was willing to enter into a fraudulent marriage, and she wanted half the money upfront and half the money at the end of the deal.",
