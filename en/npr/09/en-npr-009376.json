        "One politician said, this separates Europe from the Anglo-Saxons - that is from the USA - and this means that we will have a united Eurasia with Russia in it in about 10 years."

        "It was a number that didn't exist.",
        "And they also said Turkey about to join and send in 76 million Turks - just not true - so that was kind of post-truth politics.",

        "But most of them will pay as much or more in Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes that come directly out of their paychecks.",
        "In fact, most Americans pay more to Washington in these payroll taxes than they do in federal income taxes.",
        "One that I find often surprises people though is, if you look at the data, the share of income that the typical American pays in all federal taxes - income taxes, payroll taxes, all that - it actually has been coming down over the past couple of decades, although very few people I think accept that.",
        "And there are some people who pay no taxes at all.",
