        "So they could decide not to enforce the rules for Deutsche Bank and say that it was up to their own assessment of the evidence.",

        "For those who have a concern about this particular relationship, does it make a difference if Donald Trump hands over his business to his children or, you know, otherwise tries to back away from the company?",
        "No, that's not a solution at all because Deutsche Bank could seek to curry favor with his children, which would benefit them and also benefit Trump as well.",
