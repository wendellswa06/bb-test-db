        "Below us is a mosaic of young trees arranged by species - cocobolo, teak, mahogany.",
        "They rise out of a sea of canal grass, an invasive species that can grow 10 feet high.",
        "Hall and his colleagues are trying to figure out whether trees are helping to keep the canal filled in the dry season or just competing with it for water.",
        "We duck inside a small shelter where Hall explains the dual nature of forests.",
        "Trees actually are like big straws in the ground.",
        "In order to photosynthesize and fix carbon, they have, in their leaves, stomata and they open and let carbon dioxide in the leaves and water goes out.",
        "Lots of it.",
        "Even in the humid climate of Panama, evaporation from a single tree may transport 15 gallons of water a day into the atmosphere.",
        "That's 15 gallons that isn't reaching the canal.",
        "But Hall says trees can also help save water.",
        "For example, they repair soil damage that would otherwise allow water to escape to the sea.",
        "Take the land we're on here.",
        "What we believe it was used for before we ever came here was for cow pasture.",
        "And if you have cattle on the land, that's going to lead to soil compaction.",
        "So it's just going to pound it down.",
        "You might as well put a steamroller across it.",

        "You take a sponge, fill it with water, and put it outside in the hot sun, you'll see some evaporation, but you'll also see water seep out of that sponge.",
        "The question is whether the benefits of dry season water storage outweigh the year-round losses to evaporation.",
        "To find out, Hall and his team will spend the next couple of decades measuring how much rain falls on a grove of trees and how much water runs off.",
        "We want to see if it will serve as a reservoir, take in water during the wet season, and then slowly release it like that sponge on your concrete over the course of the dry season.",
