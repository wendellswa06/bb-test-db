        "This morning, in his weekly address, the president spoke out about the tragedy.",
        "As a nation, we have endured far too many of these tragedies in the last few years: an elementary school in Newtown, a shopping mall in Oregon, a house of worship in Wisconsin, a movie theater in Colorado, countless street corners in places like Chicago and Philadelphia.",
        "Any of these neighborhoods could be our own.",
        "So we have to come together and we're going to have to take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this from happening, regardless of politics.",
        "And just a short time ago, the governor of Connecticut, Dannel Malloy, also spoke.",
        "When tragedies like this take place, people often look for answers, an explanation of how this could have happened.",

        "No good ones, anyway.",
        "Joining me now, as he does most Saturdays, is James Fallows from The Atlantic.",

        "And yet we know they will happen again and again.",
        "We do.",
        "This conversation we had after the Aurora shooting this year and after the horrific Gabrielle Giffords shooting last year.",
        "And so far, the dynamic of American politics has been: we put the flags at half-staff, we grieve, whoever is our political leader tears up, and then essentially nothing happens.",
        "And the question is this time whether there's anything about the horror of this case that'll make it different.",
        "Is it different?",
        "It's not different.",
        "It's different in its scale.",
        "As we've gotten used to hearing, it's one of the worst school shootings ever.",
        "It is undeniably different in the horror of all these little children.",
        "So the question is whether finally this crosses the threshold of doing what the president said of meaningful action, something that he and politicians of all parties have avoided for recent memory.",
        "What is meaningful action?",
        "That is the question.",
        "I think we - on my own part, I've decided that it's worth trying to talk about gun safety as opposed to gun control, because gun control has become so embattled, so poisonous, so divisive an issue in American politics that polls show even that most average people think they have less faith that gun control will make any difference."

        "If we can talk about incremental gun safety steps, and enlist responsible gun owners and the NRA to that account, that might do something, but it will depend what happens the next few days, starting with the president.",
        "After the Dunblane massacre in Scotland in, I believe, in 1996, the British Parliament passed very strict handgun laws.",
        "It is illegal to own, I believe, to own a handgun, for a private person to own a handgun in Britain.",
        "Nothing like that has happened since.",
        "And there's almost an echo case in Australia where there was the so-called Port Arthur massacre back in the 1990s in Tasmania, which was like this case in its scale - even more people were killed then.",
        "The conservative Prime Minister John Howard had this sweeping measure of gun control legislation.",
