        "But there's a big debate all of this, about whether this flood of genetic information could end up doing more harm than good.",

        "But while Christine and her husband were waiting for the results, lots of questions started popping into their heads.",
        "If we have all this information, when do we tell Zoe?",
        "You know, do we wait until she's a specific age and say, oh, by the way we have all of your DNA, you know, do you want to see what doctors have found?",
        "Or do we kind of keep that to ourselves?",
        "Or would it be better to just only get the information we really need and then genuinely not know, so that we don't have to walk down that road?",

        "So if people start making life-or-death decisions based on information that is so tenuous at this point, I think this could indeed be a nightmare scenario.",
        "A nightmare, because parents could easily get overwhelmed with confusing information about the health of their babies during one of the most sensitive times in their lives.",
        "That already happens with what parents get from those little blood spots collected at birth.",
        "Mark Rothstein of the University of Louisville says the tests can lead to something called the vulnerable child syndrome.",
        "They're viewed as medically vulnerable, medically frail.",

        "Something like Alzheimer's or Huntington's, adults in large numbers choose not to know their status for those disorders.",
