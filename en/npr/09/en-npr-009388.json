        "So you found other turtles down there.",
        "When did you start to realize you had something different on your hands?",
        "Yeah, so this is - Carbonemys, which is the turtle we are talking today, is the second species that we describe at the mine.",
        "We described another one in 2010.",
        "And - but this one is the largest one that we have found in the mine, and it was a really exciting day for me.",
        "It was in January 2006, actually, a couple days after my birthday, and I went to - very early in the morning to one of the localities of the mine, this huge pit they built.",
        "And so I saw a small piece of bone on the ground, in the rock, and I started using, well, the screwdriver, and it took me almost two days actually to realize how big was and to see, oh my God, this is something new, this is something that we haven't seen in Cerrejon, but also it's something new in terms of evolution of turtles, and the size was gigantic.",

        "How big was its head?",
        "So yeah, the shell is around 173 centimeters long, but that's without adding - when we add the head and the neck and the tail, we easily can have a turtle around two meters, 20 centimeters long.",
        "So it's very, very similar to the size of a small car today.",
        "So it was a really large - really large animal.",
        "So what do you know about how this turtle lived, what it ate, all that stuff?",
        "So another important thing about Cerrejon or this locality in Colombia is that for the first time in the fossil record, we can have some sort of idea of the entire ecosystem of the tropics or the neo-tropics after the extinction of dinosaurs.",
        "So - because the fossil leaves, we had the plants, we had the fruits and also we had the animals.",
        "So we can reconstruct the entire ecosystem of the tropics, and we know, for example, that turtles and in particular Carbonemys is, the design, the configuration of the bones of the head are very - I mean, it's possible that this configuration, the massive maxillary bone, which is actually a bone that turtles use for masticatory process, they were huge, and that implicates that probably this turtle was eating not only plants but also on the menu could be small crocodiles or small turtles, too.",

        "Yeah, absolutely, if - and actually when we're considering the size of this turtle, well, menus like crocodiles or meat could be beneficial for growing so - because it has a lot of protein on it.",
