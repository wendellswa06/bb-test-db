        "How are you doing?",
        "What's on your mind?",
        "I just wanted to know what was the largest that had been found prior to this discovery, comparatively speaking.",
        "Great question.",
        "Yeah, that's a very good question, and I want to point out here because this is not the largest freshwater turtle so far known.",
        "The largest turtle, freshwater turtle so far known is from Venezuela and Brazil.",
        "But it's only seven million years old.",
        "And we're talking about a turtle almost similar size to Stumpendemys, the biggest freshwater turtle so far known, but 50 million years older.",
        "So it's a fascinating story about how the body size in turtles evolved in the last 50 million years.",
        "Now it's not just the body size in turtles, though.",
        "As you mentioned earlier, you found a giant snake in almost exactly the same place a few years back.",
        "What's in the water there?",
        "Why all these big animals?",
        "So yeah, that's really interesting about Cerrejon is also for the first time in the fossil record, we are able to test many hypotheses and many ideas that actually biologists and ecologists today have, as for example how the (unintelligible) evolved in reptiles.",
        "And (unintelligible), I think there are only one reason to explain why these animals get so big after the extinction of dinosaurs, and probably there are at least three factors involved in this.",
        "The first is big ecological change between the Cretaceous, when you had on land dinosaurs, and probably the ancestors of turtles, snakes, all these animals were sharing the environment with dinosaurs, probably competing for food, or even some of them could be actually the prey for dinosaurs.",
        "That happened on land, but also you were in water.",
        "You were a turtle that was living very close to the sea, very close to the coastal areas.",
        "You probably meet some of these marine reptiles like (unintelligible).",
        "They were killers.",
        "So a big change in ecology comparing to the Cretaceous versus the Paleocene in Colombia, when you don't have the dinosaurs on land anymore, but marine reptiles anymore on the seas."

        "So that's a good opportunity for these reptiles to have more space, more sources of food.",
        "So that's one of the first factors to consider (unintelligible).",
        "The second one is also a race between predator and prey.",
        "So if a turtle increased its size so potentially the crocodiles also had to increase their size to be able to (unintelligible).",
        "And we have evidence in the shells, in the carapace of these turtles, that there were bite marks from crocodiles.",
        "So we know that crocodiles from Cerrejon were eating these turtles, too.",
        "So it's another factor here.",
        "And the last one is related to the climate.",
        "And we know based in the fossil record of plants, and also we use the body size of reptiles to estimate how was the temperature for that time, and we know that it was much, much warmer than any tropical environment today, around four or six degrees Celsius warmer.",
        "Well, it's really difficult to make an estimation on how fast they move because we don't have any forelimbs.",
        "So we don't have the arms or the legs to actually have an idea of the locomotion of this animal.",
        "But my idea is that this probably could be a turtle that instead of walking or swimming far distance preferred to see on the bottom of the lakes or the river waiting for the prey.",
        "So it probably wasn't too fast.",
        "And just so the people can picture what this looked like, is it like the box turtle that you have at home, and it's just a really big size, or what did it look like?",
        "Yeah, I mean, a good example of - or to have an idea is - they are like an alligator turtle, for example, but much, much bigger than that one.",
        "So that's a good example of how Carbonemys looked like.",
        "So one last thing for you here: Do you think that reptiles could ever get bigger like this once again?",
        "Is this ever going to happen again in history?",
        "Yeah, that's the cool story behind this discovery, too, that actually the predictions currently show - many biologists predict that based on the conditions that we have today, the climate change, most of the tropical reptiles, they're going to be extinct.",
        "So they are going to disappear.",
        "But maybe, the fossil record can tell us that actually these animals can be - adapt to these different conditions and temperature very easily.",
        "So I'm pretty sure - I mean, I say the conditions now are relatively different to 60 million years old because had less areas, and we humans are here, so I'm pretty sure some of this is (unintelligible).",
        "I'm pretty sure someone is going to get it.",
        "So but yeah, I mean, it is potentially - the temperature start - I mean, continue increasing, we will be expecting to see again these gigantic reptiles on the tropics."

        "Melissa Price, Australia's environment minister, said the species had not been seen since 2009.",
        "Beshara says the extinction shows that Australia's government didn't take climate change seriously enough.",

        "Now we'd like to turn to the bombshell that President Trump delivered the day after the election.",
        "Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out, and his former chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, was in as acting attorney general.",
        "Whitaker's office quickly confirmed that he would be, quote, \"\"in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\"\" unquote, which means that Whitaker, who had been a vocal critic of Robert Mueller's investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, is now overseeing it.",
        "This appointment has raised a bevy of questions about the legality of the appointment, as well as about Whitaker himself.",

        "Critics are saying that anybody serving in this role has to get Senate confirmation for this position, and they question why the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, was not placed in this role.",
        "What's your take on that?",
        "I've got some issues with this, quite frankly, because the notion that the chief of staff, who is not Senate-confirmed, would have more experience, more wisdom and better judgment than someone like the deputy attorney general or even the solicitor general - people in the line of presidential succession within the Department of Justice - to me, it confounds me.",
        "I have to question why that decision was made.",
        "Putting aside the question of whether or not it can be done legally, it creates additional problems or questions about the leadership at the Department of Justice at a time when we don't need any more questions about the leadership.",
        "You know, for two years, the department has been under attack.",
        "For two years, Jeff Sessions has been under attack.",
        "For two years, the Mueller investigation has been under attack.",
        "I think the last thing the department needs today is more questions about the leadership there.",
        "And so, for that reason, I - you know, I don't want to say I disagree with the president's choice.",
        "I just find it a very odd choice given the circumstances.",
        "And is the discomfort one of optics, or is there, in fact, a legitimate question about his authority to hold this position?",
        "I think it's both.",
        "I think there is a question.",
        "I'm assuming someone spoke to the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice before the appointment was made and inquired as to whether or not, would this be lawful?",
        "But it's the optics that I'm also concerned about.",
        "Whether or not it's lawful or not - and, obviously, the lawfulness is an important issue - but, even if it is lawful, I question whether or not putting Mr. Whitaker in this position at this particular time was a wise move, particularly when you add on top of everything else his public comments about the Mueller investigation.",
        "And I think it calls into question his impartiality.",
        "I think it raises a whole specter of whether or not he should recuse himself.",
        "The last American combat brigade pulled out of Iraq today.",
        "It's a milestone, even though more than 50,000 troops remain in the country.",

        "There's not a lot of sign of serious negotiation, they're no coalitions emerging, and at the same time, there's a very deep vein of disenchantment among the public - toward this paralysis, toward this deadlock and anger over what a lot of people see as clashing services - no electricity, no water, it's often, you know, a lot of the same complaints you've heard for so many years here.",
        "So, well, given that we've heard the same complaints for so many years, what are the dangers of the situation now?",
        "Well, it's, you know, in a lot of ways it's the summer of discontent here, and it's somewhat reminiscent of 2003.",
        "You know, back in 2003, you had popular frustration with a lack of electricity in the searing Baghdad summer, you had an unsettled political landscape and you had uncertain American intentions.",
        "And I think in a lot of respects, we're seeing that in 2010; although, it comes at a much different time, you know, as the Americans are pulling back their troops, withdrawing all but 50,000 soldiers in this country."
