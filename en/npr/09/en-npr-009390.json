        "Is there a connection Anthony Shadid, between the American partial withdrawal, disengagement from Iraq, and the inability of Iraqis to figure out a governing structure for themselves?",
        "Well, I think Steve, what might be most remarkable about this American withdrawal, is that it marks a moment for American diplomatic influence here.",
        "The military situation on the ground probably won't change all that much.",
        "But I think it is indicative that the - that American political influence is waning.",
        "The American embassy has been unable to break this deadlock, though they put a lot of effort into it.",
        "The stalemate continues and I think a lot of Iraqis and even some diplomats, when they speak more privately, will say that we may be waiting weeks and even months before there is any government here.",
        "You know, I think Anthony Shadid, a year or two ago - or three years ago - somebody might have said that sure, there are horrible, horrible problems in Iraq but Iraqis have begun to figure out the way that eventually they will live with each other together for better or for worse.",
        "Is there no longer that feeling?",
        "Well I think, Steve there's a real question here about power and the question of power.",
        "How powerful is the prime minister?",
        "How powerful is the cabinet?",
        "Basically what system is going to arise here that's going to govern this country?",
        "Those questions are unanswered.",
        "They're at the core of the negotiations.",
        "There's a lot of disputes on where to go and how to get there.",
        "But I think there's even a deeper question here, and I think this is what's alarming to a lot people who have spent a lot of time here, and that's the almost utter disenchantment among the public for the political elite.",
        "There's a real divorce here, between governed and governors, between ruler and ruled.",
        "And that, I think, is one of the more unpredictable factors we see going on right now.",
        "In a few seconds - are people thinking again, as they were a few years ago, about the country falling apart?",
        "You know, there's a lot of worry that the longer this stalemate goes on, the worse it's going to get.",
        "Anthony Shadid, thanks very much.",

        "Former Speaker Gingrich's first stop was a former railroad station turned senior center in Plymouth.",
        "As an audience of a few dozen townspeople listened politely, and for the most part silently, Gingrich blasted President Obama.",

        "They were recess appointments, though Congress technically isn't in recess.",

        "And he's done it for a clear reason.",
        "He's paying off his union allies.",
        "I mean, it has nothing to do with good government and everything to do with trying to buy his re-election.",
        "Sure.",
        "There is a race going on here to have savings in the health care accounts.",
        "We're saying in this budget that these things have to be paid for.",
        "The thing that I have said repeatedly to the administration and the chairman of the Finance Committee is if we don't get a hold of long term costs in health care, it fundamentally threatens not just the budget of the United States but the economic position of our country as well as the budgets of individual American families all across the country.",
        "Some Republicans have used the word bankruptcy.",

        "To me, it's crystal clear.",
        "The United States is reacting to a plea by the opposition, a request by the Arab League, a request by the Gulf states - all of whom required - asked the United Nations to join together to protect civilians from massacre.",
        "Now, this event is not calculated to get rid of Colonel Gadhafi.",
        "And the president was clear about that, and Admiral Mullen was clear; I've been clear.",
        "It's not calculated to get rid of Colonel Gadhafi, even though we believe he ought to go.",
        "How, then, do you square what you've just said with the comments from the British defense minister, Liam Fox?",
        "He says Gadhafi is a legitimate target.",
        "Well, he's - you know, the British and the French can speak for themselves.",
        "That's not the targeting that the United States understood at the time, and that is certainly not the understanding that I had about that operation."

        "Let me ask you about another ambiguity.",
        "General Carter Ham, yesterday - the U.S.",
        "general who's overseeing the mission in Libya - was asked about who exactly qualifies as a civilian, whom we're protecting.",
        "And he said this: It's not a clear distinction because we're not talking about a regular military force.",
        "It's a very problematic situation.",
        "Well, that part of it can be difficult if you have forces that are engaged at a particular moment, and you're trying to figure out who you're helping, and you have some civilian rebels who are involved at that point.",
        "And people forget, Colonel Gadhafi issued a warning to the Libyans who were fighting for their freedom, and their ability to be able to be out from under his cruel thumb - we will show no mercy.",
        "That's the warning with which he sent the troops up to Benghazi.",
        "And I think the fact that the United States and the global community stood up to that is laudable.",
        "Senator Kerry, when you talk about people who are fighting for their freedom, you're talking about a rebel army.",
        "Are you equating that with protecting a civilian population?",
        "In other words, intervening on their behalf is the same as protecting the civilian population, do you think?",
        "I think we were trying to protect life and in this case, we had a sort of collateral connection.",
        "But in fact, that's the consequence - is, we have protected civilian populations.",
        "You know, we've tried to do our best.",

        "And I think that will help a lot of people to understand our connection to this.",
        "I'd like to ask you about that because we had on the program yesterday Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of State, who said: It's one of the first times - I think - in our entire history where we've introduced American military power on behalf of a group of people that we don't know.",
        "He's saying, we simply don't know who we're backing here.",
