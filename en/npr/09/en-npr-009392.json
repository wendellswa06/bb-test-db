        "We just don't know, or do we have a better fix on how many are there?",
        "Well, again, the simple answer is we don't know, but the metro area is probably not going to be that much different than it was before Katrina.",

        "Was the exodus of blacks who did not come back far greater than that of whites?",
        "Yes it is.",
        "Blacks were slower to return, and it looks like the population, when things stabilize, is going to have fewer blacks than it did before.",
        "Now, one interesting part of that is we also found that when we were trying to explain why whites came back earlier and at higher numbers, the biggest determination was: how much flooding did the household have?",
        "And once you take that into account, there aren't any racial differences.",
        "Everyone reported back in 2006, 2007 on the arrival of a great many Latino workers after the flooding.",
