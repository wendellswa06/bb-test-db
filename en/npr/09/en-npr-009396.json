        "He is a notorious smear artist and practitioner of what's sometimes called smash-mouth politics.",
        "And they should've realized that any kind of allegation that he made needed to be checked out very carefully before anybody acted upon it.",
        "Press Secretary Robert Gibbs was on the defensive today in that briefing.",
        "He was asked if the administration is skittish when it comes to race.",
        "He was also asked if the administration was afraid of conservative commentators, suggesting that the administration wanted to fire Shirley Sherrod and put out a fire before conservative commentators made too much of it on cable and talk radio.",
        "Gibbs said the administration is not cowed by conservatives, but does history suggest otherwise?",
        "I don't think they're cowed by them.",
        "And I don't think, interestingly, that their reaction in this was mostly about race.",

        "This story is overshadowing it.",
        "I think what they hoped was that if they could get it off the table, that they could get the kind of coverage they wanted for what they consider to be a major accomplishment and also move on to energy legislation and the rest of their agenda.",
        "The big thing that I learned about their political operation in reporting for \"\"The Promise\"\" was that they believe in what's called no distractions.",
        "And so, something like this rather than being, you know, a racial issue that they want to illuminate or somehow have a national conversation about, they see as a rather trivial distraction involving somebody who's not a high level public official and something that they want to sweep away as quickly as possible.",
        "So they are not afraid of the political damage that Fox obsessions can do.",
        "As the president has said, I don't get all wee wee-ed up about cable news.",
        "But they are afraid of their agenda being overshadowed and that's what's really at issue here.",
        "You know, the president, when he talks about race, often describes it as something that is a distraction.",
        "And I'm wondering why the administration, in issuing this apology to Shirley Sherrod, would not be just more upfront and say, listen, you know, there were lots of mistakes made here, but let's look for a teachable moment, much as the president did successfully with a speech on race after the Jeremiah Wright flap.",
        "Well, you know, they talked about the flap over Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates' arrest as being a teachable moment.",
        "But I don't think they really meant it so much in that case.",
        "That was damage control and this is damage control.",
        "And I think in both cases they recognize that it is not the right subject on which to launch a teachable moment or a conversation about race."
