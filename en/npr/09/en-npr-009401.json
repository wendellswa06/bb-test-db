        "We went to the town of Stalachard(ph), a sort of provincial capital near where she was found, and brought her out of the freezer and had a first really good look over her exterior.",
        "What was that like?",
        "Well, the main reaction, I suppose, was she's just so wonderfully preserved, an all-but-living animal.",
        "What did she look like?",
        "She looks a little dried, but she looks really very much like a baby elephant but with a distinctive hump on the back of her neck, which we now know is made of something called brown fat, a special tissue that's capable of generating warmth.",
        "It helps an animal to maintain its body temperature under cold stress.",
        "Did she have a little wooly coat?",
        "She had the remains of a little wooly coat.",
        "Much of it had fallen out some time after her death, but she otherwise looks really very similar to the way she would have in her life."

        "And we asked him whether he regretted taking the government aid and regretted the deal with Merrill Lynch, and he said he'd wished he'd taken only about half of that amount.",
        "Does that mean he's about to pay back $10 billion very soon to the Treasury?",
        "Well, no. I think the government wants him to wait a little while before he pays back that money to be sure that there aren't any further losses down the pike.",
        "But the reason he did give us for wishing he hadn't taken so much is he said that he had asked the $20 billion in what he described as an abundance of caution because the scale of the losses at Merrill Lynch were getting to a state where they were very worried that the capital hit to Bank of America was going to be huge when the deal closed.",
        "But by taking $20 billion, they made the bank look more like Citigroup, and therefore more of a risk of nationalization.",
        "He doesn't believe that that was fair."

        "Now according to the committee, Palmeiro's in the clear for that steroid, which showed up in the test administered in early May, but couldn't there have been other steroids in his system when he testified, steroids that might have cycled out before that test was performed?",
        "Certainly, and Davis did address that as well.",

        "The committee, though, said that it didn't obtain any evidence supporting that.",
        "There was no evidence that the B12, which is a dietary supplement, has ever been inadvertently contaminated with an anabolic steroid, and this backs up what some anti-doping experts say.",
