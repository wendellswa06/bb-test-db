        "That's correct.",
        "Why then are they using the H-1B visa program?",
        "Well, when you traditionally look at competition in the Bay Area, it has attracted a lot of technology-based companies.",
        "And they're looking for candidates who come from either a master's degree or even a doctoral degree, but with specific skill sets in computer science, in robotics, in a lot of the high-skilled areas.",
        "But is it that your clients cannot find any American-trained engineers to do those jobs or scientists to do those jobs, or that the Americans would cost them more money to employ?",
        "About a day ago.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's how he describes it, that it had perverse impact.",
        "And then, in fact, the government money in many ways has had a perverse impact.",
        "It's been that - you know, the intention was to boost confidence to make people feel more comfortable that the capital levels at these banks were safe, and that instead people have worried, well, these banks need so much government money.",
        "Something must be really, really wrong.",
        "Now another problem with Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch was that it turned out Merrill was paying out a few billion in bonuses - not to mention millions in bathroom redecorating costs - just as it was losing even more billions.",
        "Does Ken Lewis express any regret over the very idea of buying Merrill Lynch?",
        "Well, he tried hard not to look at it too much from a short-term perspective.",
        "He does admit that in the short term, he was very worried that perhaps Bank of America had overpaid.",
        "But he said he tries not to think too much about price and that in the long term, he's very convinced that this is a long-term strategic home run for Bank of America, particularly in the context of acquiring what's known as Merrill Lynch's thundering herd: This army of brokers that they have that allow them to sell Bank of America products now to a huge number of new customers.",
        "It's - at the time of the acquisition, Kenneth Lewis was being praised as the, well, as the biggest man on Wall Street, otherwise based in North Carolina, but also someone who is creating the new paradigm of the bank - the huge investment financial institution that would have retail investment branches as part of a large bank…"

        "Well, of course the irony is that he has been accepting government money to support a deal that creates a banking powerhouse exactly at a time where we are dismantling the banking powerhouse of another era, and that's Citigroup.",
        "So I think it's certainly two very difficult situations to contrast.",
        "You know, the thundering herd is a big deal for Bank of America.",

        "You see, October 22 was the day when it would finally be possible for her to walk away, to retire with a full pension.",
        "The date had such power that even when she left Social Security four years ago to take what she thought would be a lucrative consulting position, she held on to the day mentally.",
        "On October 22, 2008, she would turn 55 years old, time, she thought, to finally see the world.",
        "I wanted to be in Alaska for the whole summer and drive up through Canada, travel to China, to Israel, everywhere.",
        "Now, these were not her only plans.",
        "To prepare for her liberation, she had trained as a wish-granter for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.",
        "She also had a vague notion that she might go back to school, take a ceramics class, but the specific plans were less important than the idea itself, the promise of complete and total freedom.",
        "You know, just being able to do what I wanted for the first time in forever, my whole life, so…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But two months from now, When La Fond does turn 55, there will be no extended road trip, no ceramics class.",
        "Why?",
        "Her reasons will probably sound familiar."

        "Every year for the last 18 years, the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, D.C., has put out its annual retirement confidence survey, and Jack VanDerhei, a professor at Temple University who's affiliated with the institute, says that this year's survey found a dramatic drop in the number of older people who said that they are able to retire.",
        "Last year in 2007, 27 percent of active workers were very confident.",

        "We found that about 25 percent said they were going to have to defer retirement, in fact are changing their retirement plans.",
        "The other very powerful statistic is 25 percent said they are taking money out of their retirement savings.",
