        "Right, that is the main difference.",
        "You know, McCain co-authored that failed immigration reform package last year that would have given, you know, many of the 12 million illegal immigrants in the country a pathway to citizenship.",
        "And his Republican rivals just say, you know, his position puts him on par with the Democrats.",
        "And they always use the A word, amnesty, when they're talking about his stance, and he's really had to fight this.",
        "So now he says he's heard from the American people - border security is the most important thing, and that comes first.",
        "And here he is in the Republican debate earlier this week defending that stance.",

        "We are all committed to carrying out the mandate of the American people, which is a national security issue, which is securing the borders.",
        "That was part of the original proposal, but the American people didn't trust or have confidence in us that we would do it.",
        "So we now know we have to secure the borders first, and that is what needs to be done.",
        "That's what I'll do as president of the United States.",

        "Oh, I'm always concerned about huge crowds and what that can mean in a city, but I'm totally confident that the people in Cleveland will be peaceful.",

        "What would you want to hear out of this convention this week?",
        "I watched most of the debates on both sides over the last several months, as many in the country did.",
        "The Republican debates were so often name-calling and talking about each other's families, let alone appeals to race and appeals to religion and bashing of immigrants.",

        "Now the problem happened.",
        "Basically it was absolutely a phenomenal amount of crowds that were congregated around that area and the problem is people will travel from Medina to Mecca this evening as they have been doing throughout the day.",
        "So they take their baggage with them that they brought to Medina to stay here for the past three or four days.",

        "Well, I can certainly say that they've tried, but I definitely believe that they could do more.",
        "From two years ago, we should say, there was a number of lives lost then, I think almost 250 people lost in a similar stampede.",
        "So what the Saudi authorities did then was rather than have a pillar for people to throw the stones at, they converted that pillar into a wall.",
        "So we now have three walls, a much larger space for people to throw their stones.",
        "So I think it's a combination certainly of Saudi authorities trying to do more to control the flow of people that go into the Gand Mosque but also etiquette of pilgrims not counting outside, not taking their luggage with them, certainly not taking elderly or sick or children to those similar sites.",
        "Just one last point.",
        "Is it unthinkable to suggest that perhaps the number of pilgrims should be less than 2.5 million, that perhaps the holy sites just can't stand this volume of people?",

        "This year, as you say, almost two and a half to three million people performed it.",
        "One thing they have not been able to control, however, is the number of people within the kingdom that come perform the hajj.",

        "Thank you.",
        "That's Rabiya Parekh who's a reporter for the BBC World Service, who has been at the hajj and is talking to us from Medina, Saudi Arabia, where earlier today more than 300 people, Muslim pilgrims, died in a stampede."
