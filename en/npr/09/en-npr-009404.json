        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Debbie Elliott.",
        "In 2003, reporter Michael Goldfarb traveled to Iraq to make a radio documentary about the war from the point of view of an Iraqi.",
        "First, he needed a translator.",
        "So just before the start of combat, Goldfarb headed to a hotel in Irbil in Kurdistan.",
        "There, he met a men named Ahmad Shawkat, who would become his translator and ultimately the central character in his documentary.",
        "After the program aired, Ahmad Shawkat was killed.",
        "Goldfarb has now written a book called \"\"Ahmad's War, Ahmad's Peace.\"\" NPR's Jacki Lyden spoke with him about the book.",
        "They began their conversation with Goldfarb reading a passage about his first meeting with his interpreter.",
        "(Reading) `My initial impression was this just would not work.",
        "Ahmad seemed a bit shy; more important, he was too old.",
        "At first glance, he looked to be in late 50s, maybe even 60.",
        "Age mattered to me.",
        "If we came under fire, I needed to run or were among a crowd of people that turned into a mob, I didn't want to worry that my translator was physically incapable of running away with me or, worse yet, was going to have a heart attack when the pressure was on.'",
        "When did you feel that Ahmad Shawkat was not just an ordinary translator, and the two of you had crossed some sort of threshold together in which you understood each other really well?",
        "Almost immediately.",
        "He immediately started talking to me about American literature, which I found quite extraordinary.",
        "I was interviewing for a job to be my translator during a war, and he was talking about American literature.",
        "But, two, we were very close in age.",
        "And I think once I decided that I would make my documentary about him, because he was precisely the person I was looking for--I mean, he had been in and out of Saddam's dungeons four or five times in his life; he was living in internal exile, this--a Kurd married to an Arab--there were all kinds of extraordinary things about him.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Somebody once told me that Ahmad was my brother from another mother and--which is a wonderful phrase.",
        "And we had become close friends, and it was like I knew him for a very long time.",
        "You mentioned that he had been incarcerated in Saddam's prisons at least several times.",
        "At one point he really expected never to see the light of day again because he had written a short story which offended the regime.",
        "But it was when he was forced to stop teaching at the University of Mosul that he was most heartbroken.",
        "Correct?",
        "People are really relieved, you can see it in their eyes and their faces, you know?",
        "They all got their white flags.",
        "All giving us thumbs up everywhere we go.",
        "I'm really, really happy.",
        "It feels like the war is wrapping up.",
        "It really does.",
        "I am so glad because I am in my homeland again.",
        "I'm still believe we have our hope again without that devilish dictator called Saddam Hussein."

        "No, I did not send them home.",
        "They will go home within a 120-day window, and then they have the process of starting to return.",
        "But that's 15 million people.",
        "You're saying to do that would collapse the American economy, and now that's exactly what you're proposing.",
        "No, I don't think it would collapse the American economy if people went back and did their process of becoming legal.",
        "You know, Robert, not to be outdone, Mitt Romney talks about giving illegal immigrants 90 days to leave the country voluntarily before penalties.",

        "I do not think that it is either appropriate to give a driver's license to someone who is here undocumented, putting them, frankly, at risk because that is clear evidence that they are not here legally.",

        "And especially in these states that are coming up in Super Tuesday, like California that has such a large immigrant and Latino voter populations, you know, almost every candidate has some outreach in Spanish.",
