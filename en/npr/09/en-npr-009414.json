        "School shootings have taken a terrible human, toll but they've been a boon to business - the business of security technology.",
        "Last year, American schools spent $2.7 billion on everything from bulletproof backpacks to tourniquets.",
        "Washington Post reporter John Woodrow Cox saw an array of items on display this summer at an expo in Orlando, Fla.",
        "He and fellow reporter Steven Rich went on to investigate whether any of this technology really helps save lives.",
        "When I spoke to Cox, he described the expo as a surreal scene.",
        "There were things like a pepper-ball guns that have typically been used in combat zones.",
        "There was a guy who had just come back from Afghanistan.",
        "And it's basically a gun that shoots a - sort of a paintball that is filled with a pepper mixture meant to take down a gunman.",
        "There were people there basically pitching an idea to embed special forces agents inside schools, and they would be posing as gym teachers so that they could sort of secretly figure out who the threats were.",
        "You know, there was facial recognition software.",
        "There was, you know, doors that were meant to repel bullets.",
        "And everything you could think of was being pitched there.",
        "You report that The Washington Post sent surveys to schools in its database that had suffered shootings since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn., six years ago.",
        "Roughly half of the schools responded to that survey.",
        "What did they tell you about safety technology and how it worked?",
        "Well, you know, one of the questions we had was, what, if anything, would've prevented the shooting from happening?",
        "And there was only one school that suggested any sort of school safety technology would have actually helped.",
        "And it was - the guy mentioned it sort of in a long list of things.",
        "He said, well, maybe metal detectors would have prevented the shooting.",
        "There were a lot of schools that had all sorts of school technology that didn't work.",
        "One prime example was a school in Alabama that had a significant amount of security.",
        "They had three armed resource officers.",
        "They had metal detectors.",
        "They had cameras.",
        "And that did not stop a student from getting a gun into the school, from drawing it, playing with it, firing it and accidentally striking a girl in the chest.",
        "And she was killed.",
        "And, you know, despite all of that effort, they couldn't stop that gun from getting in the school.",
        "And we've seen that over and over.",
        "Theoretically people could even make babies from cells stolen unwittingly from celebrities.",
        "At least 40 percent of the schools that have had some sort of incident of gun violence on campus since 1999 have had resource officers at the time.",
        "And a resource officer is a sworn police officer who is always armed.",
        "So there is no sure thing, whether it's resource officer or a piece of technology, that ensures safety from gun violence for kids at school.",
        "You write about a school, Rancho Tama Elementary, in rural Northern California, where the students and staff regularly practice lockdown drills.",
        "And then they had to use what they learned in drills - they had to use that for real.",
        "So take us back to that and whether the drills actually worked as they were intended.",
        "They absolutely did, in that case.",
        "There was a man in that part of California who had gone on a shooting rampage, and some staff members heard gunshots approaching the school.",
        "They called for a lockdown immediately.",
        "All the teachers got all the kids inside.",
        "They locked all the doors.",
        "And the gunman, who had a - sort of a modified AR-15, fired more than 100 rounds into the buildings there.",
        "And he injured one student, but because they locked the doors and he couldn't get inside, there were dozens of lives saved.",
        "And it was because of preparation, which is really the thing that we heard over and over from schools say that the one thing that was most important was preparation.",
        "The kind of training that you just talked about in Northern California has been commoditized by an Ohio company that teaches people how to respond to active shooters.",
        "They call their training method ALICE.",
        "You found that to be controversial.",
        "Why was that controversial?"

        "Well, an aspect of their training teaches students in certain scenarios to essentially attack the gunman.",
        "And specifically what they're saying is, arm yourself with any sort of objects you have, and then, just in case, throw it at the gunman and then swarm the gunman.",
        "Students as young as elementary age are taught that by their schools.",
        "And that's really controversial because, you know, you see these videos online where people are practicing the ALICE techniques, and all the students attack the gunman, and the gunman just falls to the ground.",
        "Well, you know, that's unlikely to go that way in a real-life situation where somebody is there to kill you.",
        "One more thing.",
        "I wanted to take a step back for a moment.",
        "Statistically, school shootings are still considered rare, but there also seems to be this general feeling that mass shootings, school shootings are tragically becoming the norm.",
        "Based on your reporting, tell me about how school systems are weighing the statistics with public pressure when they decide where to spend their money and how.",
        "I think that's really tough.",
        "Schools very consistently make these decisions on what to invest in based on politics or based on reaction.",
        "So we see things like Parkland happen, and then we see big spending all over the country.",
        "And often, schools and school districts are not methodical in deciding, OK, this is what is the smart thing for us.",
        "Because the reality is that school shootings are quite rare, maybe not compared to other developed nations, but certainly given how many schools we have in this country, it's very unlikely that a student is going to ever experience a school shooting.",
        "But I think that what is critically important is that schools take their time.",
        "They shouldn't be investing millions of dollars into products because somebody said they were an expert and this is the thing that will work.",
        "They should be stepping back and really studying, what does our district need compared to that other district?",
        "That's Washington Post enterprise reporter John Woodrow Cox joining us.",
        "Thank you very much, John.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Scientists in Japan say they have taken a crucial step towards creating human eggs in the lab that could eventually revolutionize the way people have babies.",
        "NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details.",
        "So the first question you may have is, why in the world would scientists want to manufacture human eggs in their lab?",
        "Amanda (ph) Clark at UCLA says there's a very good reason.",
        "For many years, we've been looking for a way to understand human fertility and infertility given that such a large fraction of the human population does experience difficulties getting pregnant and having a child.",
        "Scientists around the world have been racing to try to turn stem cells into human sperm and eggs.",
        "They were able to do it for mice and have even bred baby mouse pups with mouse eggs and sperm they made from stem cells, but they could never even get close to that for humans."

        "This is incredibly exciting because for the first time, scientists have been able to convincingly demonstrate that we are able to make eggs.",
        "They're very immature eggs, but we're able to make eggs in the laboratory.",
        "They did it by taking human blood cells, turning them into stem cells and then coaxing the stem cells into becoming very immature eggs using little mini ovaries they created in a lab from mouse cells.",
        "They created a tiny, little, artificial ovary.",
        "And inside that little reconstituted ovary were these very immature human egg cells.",
        "So the entire experiment happened entirely within an incubator within a laboratory.",
        "Now, these egg cells are way too immature to make a baby, but that's the ultimate goal.",
        "And if it works and is safe, it could help millions of people suffering from infertility.",
        "The same thing could be done starting with human hair or skin cells.",
        "So Hank Greely, a bioethicist at Stanford, says that's just the beginning.",
        "If we can make human eggs and sperm from skin cells, it opens up an enormous number of possibilities for changing how humans reproduce.",
        "For example, gay couples could make babies with sperm and eggs made from their own skin cells.",
        "And easy access to eggs means it could become routine to scan the DNA of embryos before anyone tries to have a baby.",
        "Doing genetic testing basically on a large chunk of every generation of babies before they even become fetuses, while they're still embryos, and having parents or perhaps governments pick and choose which embryos can go on to become babies - that has lots of implications.",
        "And that's not all.",
        "Babies could be made from the cells of children, grandmothers, even dead people, according to Dartmouth bioethicist Ronald Green."
