        "Well, there are different ways in which it was useful to people who were experiencing it there.",
        "So, for instance, during the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and the subsequent nuclear disaster, there were people who were, for instance, by themselves in an apartment who used it just to get support, emotional support.",
        "They would tweet that they were, you know, what they were experiencing and people across the world were writing back to them saying: You'll be all right.",

        "And it's the example of something that could not have happened without Twitter.",
        "Now, your book runs from October 2010 to October 2011.",
        "And, of course, there's been plenty of news and gossip since then.",
        "What's happened in the past few months that you would say really rocked the Twittersphere?",
        "Well, the Occupy movement was very interesting on Twitter.",
        "It was a subject that was a slow burn one.",
        "But a lot of people used it in very interesting ways.",
        "They used it to get supplies sent to the squares where they were camping, and they used it to organize upcoming protests.",
        "So there are still a lot of people out there, Kate, maybe even some of our listeners who don't tweet.",
