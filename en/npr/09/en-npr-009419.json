        "Some say it's tough enough just being a jazz musician, but the famed saxophonist Branford Marsalis has the nerve to wear a couple of other hats.",
        "Marsalis Music is a record label he started a few years ago.",
        "The label hopes to provide an outlet to elder musicians who never got their due.",
        "After Hurricane Katrina, Branford added activist to his resume.",
        "He co-founded the New Orleans Musician's Village with singer Harry Connick Jr.",
        "In conjunction with Habitat for Humanity, Marsalis is in the process of building new homes for displaced musicians in the Ninth Ward.",
        "Through it all, Branford has never stopped making music.",
        "But he told me his business venture, and more recently, his activism have hit a few bumps.",
        "Right now, we are in the process of going through a local battle with a lot of the people that are in New Orleans because, you know, this is the traditional form of aid, which is kind of self perpetuating.",
        "And you know, sometimes it's guilt-based aid I guess, I'm not sure.",
        "But it's the kind of aid when somebody says I really need some money.",
        "They'll say well, here, have some money.",
        "And what we're seeing is you really need some money, here have a job.",
        "You know, what I mean.",
        "Here, have a house.",
        "So when we started the plan working with Habitat, because musicians get paid so incredibly poorly commensurate to their value to the city, a lot of the musicians had credit - they have debt problems.",
        "At which point, Habitat says, well, we can't give you the house right now because you have debt problems, but we have several organizations that we would direct you to depending on the severity of your problem.",
        "Right.",
        "And once you worked that out, then you can re-apply, and we got it.",
        "You're cool.",
        "And a lot of the guys were just like, well, you know, man, I just - they basically are used to the old way - they didn't want the key.",
        "Right.",
        "They don't want to clean up the debt.",
        "They didn't - you're raising money in our name, so just give us a check.",

        "And they travel from tragedy to tragedy, kind of like the ambulance chaser.",
        "But my parents were always very active in the New Orleans community, trying to change the environment, and it kind of rubbed off on all of us.",
        "I would have preferred to have just started this, raised money, and then done with it.",
        "Right.",
        "Because, you know, I don't really get anything out of doing this - which is very a New Orleans thing too, you know.",
        "So some of the other organizations were actually spreading bad rumors about us because they're in the business of charity, and we're not in the business of charity - it's just a charity.",
        "I mean, Habitat is a nonprofit organization, you know, in the real sense of the word, 501c3 Nonprofit.",

        "My manager and I were talking about the fact that the older musicians were just pushed aside, and they weren't being recorded.",
        "So we came up with an idea where you take one of the older musicians, at least 60 years old, and it's us honoring them.",
        "And then them passing information onto the younger guys.",
        "So one of the first two guys we landed - we tried other people who weren't really interested - but Jimmy Cobb was interested and Michael Carvin was interested.",

        "Like some of my experiences have been, for guys to say, well, all right, man, I'll do it, but you know, I'm not giving up my publishing.",
        "Like I would steal people's publishing.",
        "You know, what I mean?",
        "It's just, I mean, you know me my whole life, what makes you think that I would do that?",
        "But there are instances in New Orleans - a very famous New Orleans producers is doing just that to their friends.",
        "So there's this expectation of jiveness on our end.",
        "And it's not really a matter of talking bad about those people, but I understand why a lot of them refuse not to do it - because why shouldn't I be like every jive-ass record producer and record company owner that they've encountered in there 40, 45 years in the business."
