        "A trip to the grocery store offers what appears to be an abundance of chicken choices - from patties to pot pie, tenders to Cornish hens.",
        "The selection can almost be overwhelming.",
        "But you can count on just one hand the number of food companies producing those choices.",
        "In his new book, \"\"The Meat Racket,\"\" author Christopher Leonard investigates the handful of companies that have taken control of the meat supply, focusing especially on Tyson Foods.",
        "Behind that household name was a man Leonard calls a genius, Don Tyson.",
        "Don Tyson had the ability to see the world as it did not yet exist.",
        "And the most important thing he saw, back in the 1960s, was that chicken would soon replace beef or pork as the most popular meat in the United States.",
        "The idea was not common wisdom at the time.",
        "Up until the 1940s, chicken was reserved for special occasions.",
        "It was a specialty meat.",
        "It's what you would cook for a nice Sunday dinner.",
        "Back then, you would typically cook a whole bird.",
        "It was a luxury item.",
        "I mean, when people talked about having a chicken in every pot, that was sort of a marker for affluence.",
        "But that really changed in the '40s and '50s, when these farmers in the South figured out how to raise chicken more efficiently.",
        "Well, you refer to raising chickens, especially in the early days, as a casino.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "The market was very volatile.",
        "When supply outstripped demand even by a little bit, the price of chicken would just drop through the floor.",
        "And it was hard to gauge production exactly right.",
        "Well, this has to do with the fact that with a cow, you're talking anywhere from many months to a couple of years.",
        "I mean, you can raise a chicken and get it ready to be slaughtered in six weeks.",
        "That's right.",
        "You can almost respond to the market in real time with a chicken.",
        "And in the early days, that's exactly what the industry looked like - this boom-and-bust-type cycle of people seeing good prices, ramping up production, creating an oversupply; and then prices would fall again."

        "There's going to be all kinds of theories and post-mortems about this, and I think it was a difficult calculation.",
        "You can say, well, the White House completely messed this up, but I think there was a difficult calibration about how much to leave to Congress, how long to wait, how long to try and get bipartisan support.",
        "I think the critical issue was last summer, the summer of 2009, when the Senate Finance Committee, which was really in I think we talked about it the epicenter of this effort got derailed in its negotiations with trying to get Republicans and kept asking for more time and more time, and in the vacuum of a Senate bill, a lot of opposition, a lot of demonization went out, a lot of information, like the death panels and all that, was spread around.",
        "And the tea parties erupted.",
        "The tea parties erupted.",
        "There was no way for the president to go out and counteract that or sell a plan because he had nothing to sell.",
        "He wasn't willing to put a plan on the table.",
        "He was still waiting for the finance committee to do its work.",
        "I think you could certainly argue that there was a critical moment there where they waited too long on that committee, instead of realizing they were going to have to switch tracks and go a different way.",
        "Now that he's come out with a proposal, the president is campaigning -out there campaigning.",
        "He'll be in St. Louis today, another campaign-style event to push health care through.",
        "Well, and this is just, in my view, and I think in a lot of people's views at this point, long overdue.",
        "Because whether this is the right bill or the wrong bill, you have to go out and sell it to the American people."

        "They spent an awful lot of time selling it in Congress, but the truth is, if you've got a plan that doesn't have a plurality of support in the polls a plan with 35, 38 percent, whatever it is lately - you're not going to get a lot of members of Congress in difficult races to come out and support that bill.",
        "In the modern era of presidential power, you have to build public support for your agenda and take that to the Hill.",
        "They failed to do that, and it's never too late, and I think that's the right thing for him to be doing.",
        "Interesting poll out today from the Associated Press, showing the president with 53 percent, the support of 53 percent of the people, more support on foreign issues, Iraq and Afghanistan, than on domestic issues; Congress with dismal ratings of 22 percent support, and slightly more support for Democrats than Republicans, but both terrible.",
        "Well, and I think there's a fascinating thing going on here.",
        "Now, I would hypothesize, but I have no data to support it, but not only is this president, who's certainly a different kind of party leader, not only are his approval ratings not hitched inexorably to his Democratic majorities in Congress, I would argue that there's actually the opposite going on - which is that people like this president, they're rooting for this president, at least the people who voted for him, but they need somebody to blame.",
        "And they're actually his support, his likeability with a lot of the public is translating into more resentment for Congress.",
        "Because, I think a lot of independent who lean independents who lean left or Democratic voters are basically saying, somebody's making a mess of this, somebody's not getting things done, and I don't think its the president because I still kind of believe in him.",
        "So I actually think that he and his party's paths here and public approval, are actually diverging for a reason.",
        "And yet that same poll shows a plurality of independents saying they would vote Republican now.",
        "Yeah, and that's just a huge problem in a congressional election.",
        "I mean, we're far out, a lot can happen, and you know, generic ballots, which is, you know, who would you vote for, a generic Democrat or a generic Republican -that will become much more important as we get closer to the election.",

        "The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling.",
        "And it does cause you to think whether or not it makes sense for us to be there.",

        "You know, I would you know, I'm not going to presume to tell the chief justice, you know, what the political situation is in the country, but this is, we had the invention of television sometime in the late 1950s in the political arena, and since then, just about every televised event has become highly politicized.",

        "And I don't know how they make the decisions of what they're going to make public and what they aren't, but I think it is one of the interesting things about his comments about the State of the Union is it exposes sort of the bubble that the Supreme Court lives in and how, increasingly, I think, that erodes, in some sense, the trust of the American people in that institution because it is so much less transparent and sort of less adapted to the moment than so many other institutions - maybe any institution - of government that we have.",
