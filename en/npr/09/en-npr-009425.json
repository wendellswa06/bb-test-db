        "Well, we've invited Ruy Teixeira, along with Matt Continetti, associate editor of the Weekly Standard, to do some more forecasting as 2010 November approaches.",
        "Both of them join us in a moment.",
        "As you look ahead to 2010, which trends do you think favor which party?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email talk@npr.org.",
        "And Ruy Teixeira and Matt Continetti are here with us in Studio 3A.",
        "Of course, Matt Bai is here, too.",
        "Ruy, have things shifted substantially in the last two years?",
        "Well, clearly, things have shifted in terms of opinions about you know, you look at things like the generic ballot.",
        "You look at things like Obama's approval rating.",
        "Obviously, things have changed a lot since Obama got elected.",
        "Another thing that's changed is that when Obama got elected, unemployment was 6.8 percent.",
        "Now it's 9.7 percent.",
        "It peaked at 10.2 percent.",
        "It's an iron law of politics that when unemployment goes up, as a kind of sharp upper trend line that we've seen, the incumbent party and the president suffer, and that's about 85 percent or 90 percent of what happened.",
        "You can pretty much explain the political trajectory since Obama got elected almost exclusively on the base of that variable.",
        "Were mistakes made?",
        "Yes, mistakes were made.",
        "Is there enthusiasm on the other side of the aisle, among Republicans?",
        "Absolutely there is, but it's very difficult to sustain the enthusiasm and the support and the glow that you had when you got elected in the teeth of this kind of unemployment.",
        "So I think that - I just really want to emphasis that factor.",
        "It's been critical.",
        "But do you see these things as malleable?",
        "Could there be a shift up, as well as down, if the economy gets better, things will look better for the president and the Democrats, or...?",
        "Three minutes.",
        "So the question of the moment, then, is given the state of the economy, given the state of political play, what sort of losses are the Democrats likely to sustain in 2010?",
        "And it is, Matt Continetti, traditional for the president's party to lose seats in the first midterm election.",
        "This one may lose more than just a few.",
        "Right, and it's also traditional for the president's approval rating to be lower in November of the midterm year than it was in January.",
        "I differ slightly with Ruy."

        "I think, obviously, the economy is a factor in any political situation, but when I look back at midterm results over the past decades, I see that presidential job approval is actually more important than the unemployment rate.",
        "And right now, then, President Obama would, you know, superficially say that he's doing pretty well.",
        "There's about a 10-point spread between the Rasmussen, which trends Republican, poll has his approval at 43 percent, to the latest AP poll, I think today, has his approval at 53 percent.",
        "Anything about 50 percent, and there's going to be a lot of you know, the losses won't be as great.",
        "The problem is not so much President Obama's overall job approval, but his job approval among the voters who turn out to vote in November.",
        "And I think this coalition of voters is going to be what you saw in 2009 in Virginia and New Jersey and again in Massachusetts in January of this year.",
        "They are going to be whiter, they are going to be older, and they are going to be conservative-leaning independents.",
        "And among this group, Obama's approval rating is in the trash bin, and so I don't think that helps Democrats at all.",
        "Matt Bai, your book, \"\"The Argument,\"\" was about documented a lot of the energy that was around last time on the Democrat side, as Ruy said, if there's energy out there now, it seems to be on the Republican side or at least on the Tea Party side.",
        "Yeah, it does, although and that certainly benefits Republicans.",
        "I think both versions we've just heard are, in my mind, a little wishful.",
        "I agree, Ruy, that you know, I certainly would agree that unemployment is a huge factor in what's going on.",
        "I don't know, and you know, to the extent there's an iron law, I suppose that would be one.",
        "I don't know that it's 85 or 90 percent.",
        "I would make an argument that you have seen, over the last 20 years in American politics and more pronounced in the last several years, just a simple frustration with the culture of government, with incumbency, a general tendency of voters to revolt against whichever party is holding power as their frustrations peak, and at ever-shortening intervals.",
        "So, you know, they threw out Republicans in they threw out Democrats in '94, threw out Republicans in '06, seem poised perhaps to throw out Democrats now.",
        "So I don't think this is all about just, gee, we inherited this bad economic climate.",
        "I think there is a not-ideological-but-just-a-general-reform-minded fury out there with the inability of government to cope with issues.",
        "Having said that, I think Matt's a little you know, Matt strikes me as wishful, too, because in order to win, you know, I mean, I have no idea what's going to happen in November, but you've got to have something to say.",
        "You've got to have some new class of candidates.",
        "You've got to have some alternative.",
        "You've got to have some agenda.",
        "I just see none of that.",
        "Republicans are running a whole bunch of candidates who have run before.",
        "They're running completely on opposition.",
        "They're running with no alternative to speak of.",
        "They've got some time to work on that, but I think their own history, both in triumph and defeat, would tell you that they're putting themselves, at this point, at the worst possible position to take advantage of a very ripe situation."

        "I think there's some of that, and I think the agenda is part of it, too.",

        "If you go to pollster.com, you'll see that there's about a 10-point gap among independents, disapproving of Obama rather than approving of his job performance.",
        "And a lot of that, I believe, is tied not only to the economy but also to the agenda.",
        "What we've seen lately, just in the past couple weeks, is Obama solidifying the support, even gaining in some polls, and we see an upward trend in support for the health care legislation, as well.",
        "And the reason I think that is is because Obama has taken a much more aggressive stance, against the insurers in particular, and also trying to show that the Republicans really are just opposing him for political reasons.",
