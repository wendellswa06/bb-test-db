        "I was - I've been listening since the beginning of this particular show and talking about the trends, but one thing that came up was that, you know, whether or not the job approval rating is going to be down enough by November, which leads me to - why does - why is everything in such a rush?",
        "Why does there have to be such a change, this - so quickly?",
        "Is this an American personality trend that we want what we want when we want it and we don't want to wait?",
        "I mean, we're not buying a TV here.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "These are big things to take consideration.",

        "And as you hear, noisy.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "We have a short attention span in America today.",
        "But I think there's also a political explanation for what you point out, and that is, before the administration even came to office, they made a calculation that the financial crisis and recession made the opportunity right for grand social reform of the sort not seen since the Great Society.",
        "As Rahm Emanuel famously said, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.",
        "And so they went for this big bang theory of governance that included the stimulus, that included health care, that included cap and trade, that included the education reforms and the banking regulatory reforms.",
        "And today, that we see that the only thing of that agenda that has been enacted into law - other than the education reforms, which will go into place, it's a bipartisan issue -is the stimulus.",
        "And so I think that strategy backfired in a lot of ways.",
        "Well, really, you anticipate that a lot of those things are going to get through.",
        "But, nevertheless, this short attention span, as we were talking earlier with Matt, the Democratic dawdle last summer has really cost them.",
        "Right.",
        "I think it has cost them.",
        "I'm not sure the public's attention span is that much different than it used to be.",
        "Certainly, the level of scrutiny is maybe a little more than it used to be.",
        "I mean, I completely agree with Matt.",
        "I think the dragging out, the sausage-making process in the full view of the American people for the length of time it was, particularly in the summer doldrums with the - with Grassley and Baucus playing footsy for months was probably a bad idea.",
        "But I think it probably would have been a bad idea back in 1962 and 1940.",
        "I mean, people don't like this stuff.",
        "They've never like this stuff.",

        "Yes.",
        "I was going to say, I used to volunteer for the Democratic Party.",
        "But now I'm going to be doing everything in my power to undermine them because they're going to tell me that if I do not buy health insurance, they will come after me.",
        "But they do not have enough boots on the ground to make sure those premiums are going to be affordable.",
        "It is not 1962.",
        "We're not talking about a 4 percent tax.",
        "We talking about being considered a criminal, and there's no comparison.",
        "In other words, you're talking about if the Democratic proposal passes and you don't buy health insurance, the IRS will note that and penalize you.",
        "Oh, they will, too.",
        "The IRS's efficiency, everybody more or less accepts that.",
        "Matt Bai, Robin's point, a lot of Democrats are upset - not just on her point, but also a lot of Democrats on the left upset that this is not the health care proposal they thought they signed on for."
