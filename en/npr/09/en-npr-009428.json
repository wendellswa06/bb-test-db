        "I want to ask you about a recent article in The New Yorker magazine by Atul Gawande, which described how McAllen, Texas, has the most expensive health care in the country, essentially because the doctors there are collecting as much money as they possibly can, largely from public health plans, by ordering more tests and more procedures than doctors are anywhere else - even in the next county in Texas, where there's a very similar patient population.",
        "Why hasn't the AMA stood up for best practices, best outcomes, most efficient outcomes, and given doctors standards that they have to adhere to?",
        "Well, actually, the AMA has tried - over the last six years, that we have actually brought the profession together through specialty societies, through our physician consortium on performance improvement - to come up with those best practices for patients.",
        "What McAllen, Texas, is, is not only a unique area but it's also one of the poorest counties in the United States.",
        "And so there's cost-shifting that's going on there because of the uninsured burden.",
        "So we're committed as the AMA to try and create a solution so that we can reduce unnecessary variation in care, but also have that liability protection so that if we don't order that extra test, or do that extra procedure, we don't have to worry about being sued because we didn't do that test that wasn't necessary.",
        "But as doctors in McAllen told Atul Gawande, in Texas, liabilities capped at $250,000 and in other counties in Texas people aren't ordering the same test.",
        "They say it's not malpractice.",
        "It's a commercial culture, in that particular place, in doctors trying to make as much as the system permits them.",
        "The reality is, is that there is variation in care.",
        "And part of the reason we have variation in care is we don't have, many times, the science to help guide patients and physicians - is a device or a drug better for that patient?",
