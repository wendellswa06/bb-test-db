        "I mean, it does an incredible job at giving us meat that is more or less safe, at a predictable price, that's relatively cheap to our incomes.",
        "But I can say, chicken would be cheaper today if this industry was not so consolidated.",
        "You've got these giant companies whose reach spans out across 22 percent of the entire market.",
        "So a single company can cut its production and keep prices higher than they would be.",
        "A highly consolidated and monopolistic industry is not good for consumers.",
        "I wonder how difficult it is for any person to opt out of the system; to steer clear of buying and eating meat produced by these enormous meat companies.",
        "I have concluded that the only way to truly opt out of the system is to become vegetarian.",
        "If you're eating meat today, unless you know the farmer and that's the only meat you eat, you're participating in this industrial system.",
        "All of the unlabeled meat that is served in our restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals, at the grocery store - it all comes from industrial companies.",
        "And so I think we need to take a hard look at this system that delivers most of our meat to giant cities seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.",

        "The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities tells me that the number of people living in poverty has reached 37.3 million, and is growing.",
        "But poverty has become the great no-no in political discourse - associated with that other frowned-upon word, welfare.",
        "It was not that way during the Depression of the 1930s, when President Roosevelt spoke of rescuing one-third of the nation who suffered in poverty.",
        "And in the 1960s, President Johnson launched a war on poverty, which left us with permanent institutions like Head Start and community health centers.",
        "But President Reagan scored political points by mocking the war on poverty as a war that poverty won.",
        "And since then, the Clinton administration made some big changes in welfare, and the Bush administration, some small ones.",

        "He says the pay was determined by the board outside his presence and that board members were briefed about the details by the compensation committee.",

        "Year after year, the judge said, the board made decisions to pay him without knowing his true compensation.",
        "He noted that one pension benefit given Grasso had mushroomed from 36 million to a $110 million in the space a few years, and Ramos said Grasso, as chairman of the exchange, had a fiduciary obligation to explain all of this to the board.",
        "He said any claims to the contrary were shocking.",
        "Henry Hu is a professor of law at the University of Texas.",
        "Here he's saying, well, gee, you got an amount of money involved that in one year represented, what, something like half of the income of the entire corporation?",

        "Justice Ramos also made clear that Grasso was not entitled to some of the money he received, and that he took some pension benefits before he should have.",
        "Ramos stopped short of ruling whether Grasso had done anything illegal, saying that would be determined at his upcoming trial.",
        "But he did order Grasso to return the money with interest, and he ordered an accounting of how much he owes.",
        "That could end up costing Grasso tens of millions of dollars.",
        "And New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who brought the charges against Grasso, said yesterday that the former stock exchange chairman would probably have to return about $100 million.",
        "Spitzer, who is running for New York governor, has said that any money returned will go into a stock exchange fund to educate investors.",
        "For Grasso, yesterday's ruling is a huge defeat.",
        "Again, Henry Hu of the University of Texas.",
        "This kind of decision can be appealed, but from the point of view of Grasso, this litigation was really not necessarily about the money but more his reputation, and the judge has said things here that Richard Grasso may be unhappy with.",
        "And Grasso lost out in other ways as well.",
        "The judge also struck down a series of motions Grasso had filed, including one claiming he'd been defamed by Exchange officials.",
        "In the past, Grasso has locked horns with Justice Ramos.",
        "His lawyers tried to get the judge to recluse himself from the case, noting that he had twice unsuccessfully sought a seat on the stock exchange's board.",
