        "We don't speak the same language; our patients don't necessarily want to talk to us when they have a life-threatening diagnosis - they want to talk to their rabbi, their pastor, you know, a social worker, somebody else on the health-care team.",
        "And I think that's a real issue, that communication.",
        "Yeah, maybe - let's break that down.",
        "Maybe you can give us an example of what - how that might affect a patient's decision, in other words the lack of time they have with a doctor.",
        "I know from personal experience, you don't spend a whole lot of time with your doctor, even just on routine visits - and certainly, I haven't had a serious illness.",
        "But how might it affect a patient's decisions about medication, about the route they should take in dealing with something when they don't have that doctor's time and attention and the conversation that you were talking about?",
        "Well, in an ideal world, you would have all the time that you would need.",
        "You would have, from a doctor's point of view, you'd be able to spend an hour per patient and really sort of get to know that patient and that patient's family and their issues on where they're coming from.",
        "You know, one of the, I think, great things about health care now is we're talking more and more about patient empowerment and patients being part of the team, and I think that's a really important concept.",
        "However, it is based on - it's premised on the idea that patients have all the information that they need.",
        "And I think one of the important roles for doctors is to help to supply that information.",
        "In fact, one of the important roles of the medical establishment is to supply that information.",
        "But we haven't done a very good job of it.",
        "On the other hand, I think that one of the important things for patients to do is to grasp this opportunity to be empowered but to also realize, as well, that there are certain constraints that we have on the patient-doctor relationship - the time constraint, for instance.",
        "Many doctors are working under incredible time pressures to - you know, as you said earlier, we only see patients - we can only see patients for 15 minutes.",
        "And I think that if there were more, sort of understanding between both parties, I think that the relationship would be improved, but that…",
        "I just want to focus a little bit more, though, on the patient's responsibility because, you know, on this program, we're talking about different aspects of the whole system, and we've talked a lot about doctors, and so let's return to that whole subject of patients for a moment.",
        "Even given the problems of communication between doctors and patients that exist now and the lack of time that you've been talking about, do patients sometimes demand that doctors, you know, order tests that perhaps aren't needed or, you know, maybe aren't as responsible about their own health care, or their own preventive health care, as they could be?",
        "They may be, but I think it's really difficult, as a patient, to fully take on that responsibility.",
        "I think everybody is capable of it, and I think everybody is fully capable of understanding medical issues.",
        "I think the problem is that we don't have the time to talk to each other, to educate each other about the issues.",
        "So for instance, doctors don't have, necessarily, the time to explain all the medications and what they are doing, or the pathophysiology of a certain diagnosis.",
        "At the same time, patients don't have the time, or don't feel they have the time, to answer the questions, or they may be - for some reason feel like they can't ask their doctors certain things or that their doctor's in a rush."

        "Let's forget about it.",
        "Let's - there are too many issues.",

        "And she joins us from Capital Public Radio in Sacramento, California.",
        "Welcome to the program, Marge.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Now, do people understand - to what degree do people understand, or think of themselves, as part of the problem in health care?",
        "Right.",
        "I think that that is one thing that - one area that we could work on, the whole sense of expectations that patients may have.",
        "For instance, the previous caller also brought up the idea of liver transplantation, that doctors could compete and sort of offer transplantation at a certain price.",
        "They really don't.",
        "Unlike - or actually the same as other stakeholders in the whole paradigm of health care, patients tend to think that the problem of rising costs really belongs to everyone else, particularly the health insurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies, who they believe are really gouging the system, where there's unnecessary waste and greed, but don't see themselves as part of that role, and consequently don't see themselves necessarily as part of the solution, either.",
        "And that really can be a problem.",
        "I think Dr. Chen's points are well-taken, but the fact is we start with spending 50 percent more on health care in this country than we do everywhere else.",
        "And we use more drugs, we use more scans, we do more surgery, we see more specialists, and our health care isn't any better.",
        "And I think that's what the Obama administration and what Congress is trying to do right now, is get a handle on why are we spending so much and not getting better health, and what can we do to reduce the costs?",
        "How are the patient and the doctor - who together, really control the bulk of how health-care dollars are spent - how does it turn out that all these expensive interventions are being prescribed when they may not be necessary?",
        "So getting to the patient in terms of helping to control some of the demand for health care is really going to be critical, and we have been looking at that for a number of years, on how people respond to rising costs when they put on their citizen hat rather than their patient hat."

        "Well, how can people be made more aware of these issues that you're talking about?",
        "Well, I think part of it is we really do think of health care as something personal, and it is personal.",
        "It's like all politics is local, all health care is personal.",
        "But that makes it a little difficult, then, to start looking at the big picture when in fact, it is all of society that is helping to pay for health care.",
        "So anyone who's part of a health-insurance plan, whether it's private or public, in fact is part of a pool of resources that's being contributed by everyone - by a lot of people, anyway.",
        "And yet we see it as our own personal stash, our own personal benefit package that's there for us and there to meet all our needs.",
        "I think for us, and for the rest of society, what we need to do is begin looking at health care from a somewhat different lens, that it's not just about the person at the bedside.",
        "It's about everyone else in this country that somehow is contributing to the cost of health care and is also trying to benefit from it.",
        "So it's - I think it requires a new way of looking at health care beyond that of the individual, to the greater good.",
        "You know, it seems like a tough task to me because I think that when it comes to health care, it may be when people might be, in a way, at their most selfish because they just want the best for themselves, and they want the best for their loved ones in particular.",
        "You know, often, you know, if you have a child involved or your husband or a parent, you know, you just want them to get the best.",
        "And so it makes it hard for anyone to think communally at that moment, I would think.",
        "Well, part of the problem is that what we often conceive of as best, in fact, isn't best at all.",
        "And that's why the president is really moving towards the whole idea of comparative-effectiveness research in trying to really identify what really does bring value to people and what doesn't.",
        "Clearly, physicians have a major role in this because they're the ones that, in fact, prescribe probably - 80 percent of health care is delivered when physicians prescribe it.",
        "So if they're not part of this whole re-looking at what works well and what doesn't, then we'll - I'm not sure we'll ever get there.",
        "One thing that's particularly interesting that we've learned is that when people - we do a lot of discussion groups with people, and we ask them to look at the problem from the perspective of a member of society and to make decisions on how resources should be best spent.",
        "And to a person, they come to conclusions that in fact, we really do need to be paying close attention to how well certain treatments work, and not cover things that are not effective.",
        "So they're very much in line with where Congress is trying to go, but they're never really asked these questions at the bedside.",
        "It takes sort of a broader societal view for people to kind of create the rules under which we can all live, and all live comfortably and successfully.",

        "Dr. Chen?",

        "Is there a way to do that?",
        "I mean, is there a way to make people more health-care literate?",

        "They're incredibly difficult to understand, and most patients don't understand.",
        "It's usually the doctor that is explaining what is on the consent form, and then the patient signs.",
