        "We have no free clinics in the city that I live in.",
        "We have the health department, which is almost impossible to get into without a lot of paperwork for people who are illiterate or semi-literate.",
        "When children are ill, when your children are ill with things like - and I'm talking about basic access -worms, children with worms, children with lice or bed bug bites, or a lack of immunizations or dental care.",
        "And I've taken so many families to the emergency room because we had no other place.",
        "I've called doctors, doctor after doctor, asking if they take Medicare or Medicaid, and doctors don't.",
        "So I think it's really irresponsible to blame patients.",
        "Someone like me, who's informed - and I try, and I try to find access for these families, and our whole school does, really.",
        "That's one of our big problems, our children not being in school because of illnesses, simple illnesses that they don't have access to regular health care.",
        "Marge Ginsburg, this is really an issue that has to be addressed.",
        "I mean, here you have somebody who is knowledgeable, is bright, knows what's going on, and has to take people to the emergency room because otherwise, they wouldn't have any place to go to get care.",
        "The access issue is a very big problem, and in some way it's different, in some way it's related to the issue of do we overuse health-care resources.",
        "Because I think part of the problem with access is we funnel so much of our money into high-tech specialty care and then give short shrift to primary care, particularly in rural and more isolated areas, that where the need really is doesn't get met.",
        "Instead, the need - health care goes to the biggest cities, the places where there's the most amount of potential income.",
        "So they're definitely related.",
        "If we did a better job of how we decide how we're going to distribute our resources, then we'd have a system that's much fairer for everybody.",
        "There was one other point I wanted to make, and the previous caller saying he really didn't believe it's the patient's fault that so much is being spent.",
        "One thing that's important to keep in mind for at least some patients, patients' belief about health insurance and what it should cover and how they want, you know, the best of everything and no compromise and complete choice and fast service, in part, large part, is because this is what we've been telling them for years.",
        "I mean, if you look at all the advertising that goes on for pharmaceutical companies, even hospitals, medical plans, medical groups, it's all about how you can get everything - the best, the fastest, the quickest, most choice.",
        "And now, we're turning around and saying to them hold a second, we were kidding.",
        "We really can't deliver this high expectation that you have.",
        "So consumers came to this for very good reason.",
        "It's what we've been telling them.",
        "The expectation, the sort of subtext under that is that every transplant will come out 100 percent perfect, and that there will be no complications and no sort of natural - it's a human endeavor that there will be no problems at all.",
        "But health care isn't that way.",
        "It's a really human endeavor.",
        "There will be errors.",
        "There will be ups.",
        "There will be downs, and you are also talking about sort of bringing people together in a very relationship-based endeavor.",
        "So I think all of those have to be sort of put into the mix.",
        "In regards to this current caller, the woman who is bringing all these children to the emergency room, I think that brings up another issue.",
        "Again, it goes back to health-care literacy, which is the parents of these children.",
        "It's most often the patients, the people who have the least, that are least confident about going and accessing health care, about educating themselves.",
        "And that's something that we have to work on.",
        "Yes, you could say that that's the patient's fault, but really it's our responsibility - the medical establishment's - is to go out there and educate those people and to help give them the confidence to ask questions, to seek care, to bring their children to get whatever care they need."

        "If consumers were exposed to the actual price of health care, do you think that that would make a difference in how we actually think about our health?",
        "Well, I think that a $1,000 deductible, as my little intro there said earlier, won't make us any healthier, but I think the important point is that it most likely won't make us any less healthy.",
        "And that, I think, is the key distinction.",
        "Well, how so?",
        "Make that distinction for me.",
        "Explain…",
        "Well, so I think that - I just want - I think a general point is that, you know, we've kind of collectively, at least in regards to health insurance, I think we've kind of collectively forgotten or overlooked the fact that insurance, insurance as a concept, is for indemnification against catastrophic financial risk, okay?",
        "So it really - it's the financial risk associated with a catastrophic health event that causes, you know, severe straits for people.",
        "So I think the caller, Kevin, from North Carolina, had it partly correct in the sense that a high deductible policy is - insurance is still necessary.",
        "And a high deductible policy would still provide the indemnification against the risk associated with having a catastrophe - you know, cancer diagnosis, getting hit by a bus, something really bad happening that costs a lot of money to fix.",
        "That's why we still need insurance there."

        "You know, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to insure that event when it's entirely predictable.",
        "So that's a distinction.",
        "I think in terms of the broader point about, you know, will getting less care make us less healthy?",

        "And increasingly, the use of patient decision tools, ways of helping people understand what their options are and what the benefits and costs are for those options, can go a long way in making sure that the role that patients have is a meaningful one in determining what makes the most amount of sense for them.",
        "And the fact that his doctors did not listen to him, did not seem to care, is really a sad commentary on where medicine is right now in being sensitive to the issues of both cost and benefit.",

        "And I don't know if we're getting to another whole subject there.",

        "And so, you know, I think - and I'm sympathetic to what the caller is saying there.",
