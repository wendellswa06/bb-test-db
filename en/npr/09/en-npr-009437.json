        "Political Junkie Ken Rudin is with us, and obviously, the big story this week is what the FBI and U.S.",

        "According to a publication called the Corporate Crime Reporter, its number six among the 35 most populous states.",
        "So, what is your state's great stain of honor?",
        "Hey, I'm from New Jersey, home to Boss Hague years ago and at the center of the Abscam scandal.",

        "First of all, we were talking earlier about Senate candidate number five, the one who was allegedly offered half a million or a million dollars for the Senate job.",
        "According to ABC News, they name that Senate candidate number five as Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr.",
        "That's correct.",
        "We have not confirmed that, although when asked about it this morning, Jesse Jackson Jr., Congressman Jackson, said that he doesn't know if he's number five, but he said he absolutely had nothing to do - nobody associated with him, nobody on his staff, nobody on his behalf, have ever been in a position to offer any kind of quid pro quo, and that includes the half a million, million dollars that Blagojevich has talked about on tape.",
        "So, Jesse Jackson's name has been perhaps linked to this Senate candidate number five, but as far as whether he offered a bribe or money or payments, he said, absolutely not, and Jackson said that he's been told that he is not a subject of the investigation...",
        "A target...",
        "A target to the investigation.",
        "And of course, all we know is these wiretaps, which, of course, are Blagojevich's version of the story, a story which may change under oath.",

        "Nevertheless, there is another connection that everybody is concerned about.",
        "This was Senator Obama's seat.",

        "And yesterday, David Axelrod had a different story.",
        "Yeah, I know.",
        "The tape we just heard, I believe, is Axelrod on Fox News about - right after the election, saying that, I know that Governor - that President-elect Obama has spoken to Governor Blagojevich, and now, he says, no, it's my understanding that there has been no conversation, and Barack Obama himself has said, no conversation.",
        "When - you know, it's kind of hard to imagine that conversation in some kind of level did not go on, because obviously, Barack Obama would have strong interest in who succeeds him in the Senate, and of course, he has many allies in Illinois who want that seat.",
        "But it's just very interesting how David Axelrod - we're talking about how this is a different open administration, and there was something kind of queasy about listening to Axelrod a month ago and to read his statement yesterday, he said no, I was mistaken.",
        "And the other part of it is that, of course, on the tapes, at one point, Blagojevich said, all - that they, meaning - referring to the president-elect using a barnyard term, then said, all they are prepared to offer me is gratitude, thanks.",
        "Bleep them, he said.",
        "They apparently are not close.",
        "Exactly, well, because we're talking about Senate candidate number one, who apparently was Valerie Jarrett, a close adviser of Barack Obama, who extensively was Obama's choice to succeed him in the Senate.",
        "But Blagojevich said, obviously, if they're not going to pay to play, then, you know, blank them.",
        "But all these other candidates - Congressman Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky, Luis Gutierrez - they've all met - most of them have all met with Blagojevich.",

        "Toxic right now.",
        "Tammy Duckworth, who was the state director of Veterans Affair, she's also on the list, too, very close with Blagojevich; Emil Jones, the president of the state senate, very close to Blagojevich; you wonder if their political careers are in serious jeopardy.",
        "Anyway, getting back to the rankings of the most corrupt states in the country, this is from an article at Politico.com, and I guess it's not really a trivia question as to which one is number one.",

        "But no, Spitzer should not be on this list.",
        "That was personal peccadillo, not personal corruption.",
        "But I think, local officials, as you say, have shown to be quite corrupt in New York.",
        "New Jersey, too - big city mayors, the mayor of Newark; a bunch of mayors from Jersey City had gone to prison.",
        "But as far as governors, you know, it's been pretty clean as well.",
        "I think if you look at the place like New York City and you just have to go statistics, you get eight million people, 10 million people together, it's going to happen.",
        "Yeah, according to the statistics from the Corporate Crime Reporter, New York and New Jersey, New Jersey in at nine and New York in at 10.",
