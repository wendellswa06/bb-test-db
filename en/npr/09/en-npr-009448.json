        "And you used, in fact, the memory tricks of the ancients?",
        "Right.",
        "So, well, these techniques that they used and that I used are actually 2,500 years old.",
        "They were discovered in ancient Greece, and they're the same tricks that, you know, Cicero used to memorize speeches, that generals used to memorize the names of all the soldiers in their command, that medieval scholars used to memorize vast libraries of information.",

        "Well, they test you on, they give you a bunch of faces with names and ask you to memorize those.",
        "They give you lists of random words, numbers, and you have to memorize the order of a shuffled deck of playing cards.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "It's been talked about for years, and this problem is certainly not new.",

        "And they could even be on the path to citizenship.",
        "That's something that the Democrats favor more than Republicans, the citizenship element.",
        "But I think that business has sort of joined with labor in saying we have to find some way to find legal status for all these workers who are in the country.",
        "It's not enough to simply say they should leave because there's no way we can get them out.",
        "Now, you mentioned earlier, my words not yours, but that the Democrats are happy to let the Republicans beat each other up over this issue.",
        "But I'd like to ask you, first of all, where is the center of gravity in the Republican Party on this issue.",
        "Is it, are they, is the caucus pretty evenly divided between those on the border states, those not, or people closely allied with big business versus agra businesses?",
        "I mean, how, what are the divisions in the Republican caucus?",
        "And then, briefly after that, tell me about where the Democrats are on this, other than enjoying the fight on the other side."

        "Well, it is accurate that I support a guest worker provision, but it is not accurate that I've changed my mind.",
        "I urged our leadership to do a comprehensive bill rather than an enforcement only bill, and I've urged them to do that from the get-go.",
        "I believe that this problem requires a comprehensive solution, that you cannot do it by enforcement only.",
        "My reason for going ahead and voting for the enforcement only bill is that we needed a vehicle.",
        "We needed a bill that addressed the problem of illegal immigration to meet up with the Senate bill, which is taking shape as we speak, so that we can move forward and address this problem because it's a major concern of many Americans.",
        "So, I was disappointed that the Sensenbrenner bill did not have a guest worker provision in it, but I think it was kind of the only train leaving the station.",

        "Well, I think the president's perspective on the issue is a valuable one, but I think the Congress needs to chart its own course here.",
        "Unfortunately, I think the president had an opportunity to help educate Americans on the need for guest workers as a part of our workforce, on the problem we have with a declining birth rate in this country and the fact that we need workers to do some of the jobs that Americans, apparently will not do, and I'm not certain that by the way he's handled the issue he's done a good job of doing that education rather than by just saying, By gosh it must happen.",
        "I think we need to do build the case so that people would understand that there is a huge economic factor here and having no guest workers, having no foreign workers in our workforce is not a viable option.",

        "Sure.",
        "And this is, we're going to go to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and let's talk to Steve.",
        "Steve, what's on your mind?",
        "Yes.",
        "My comment on the guest worker permit was that it simply appears to give the employers of illegal workers a free pass so they are no longer illegal, they're no longer breaking the law.",
        "And it makes people that were employing legal aliens or Americans, it makes them more inclined to cut their wages and benefits enough to declare that they need guest workers, since if you cut the pay and benefits enough of any job, no American would be willing to work it.",

        "That's what we're doing right now.",
        "Employers in the United States today can effectively say, and I think honestly and legitimately say, there is no mechanism for them to discern whether someone that applies for a job with them is in fact a U.S.",
        "citizen or a legal immigrant or perhaps an illegal immigrant because the government does not have an effective program to answer that question.",
        "So, we're allowing employers today to hire illegals.",
        "Some of them do so knowingly and some of them pay sub-par wages, and indeed pay none of the benefits, don't withhold the taxes that they're supposed to, and that gives employers a free pass to essentially exploit that illegal worker workforce.",
        "But the caller's point is exactly right.",
        "If we allow guest workers to come, first of all, we should not allow them to come illegally, and we should not convert those who are here illegally into guest workers other than through a mechanism where we know who they are and we can make sure the employer cannot exploit them.",
        "And then we have to be certain, once we have control of how many are here, that we don't allow, quite frankly, too many in.",
        "The caller's concern, and it's a legitimate one, is that if we have too many illegals here willing to work for low wages, that will pull down the wage rate and benefit packages for all American workers, and that's a part of the balance here.",
        "I certainly don't want to do that.",
        "At the same time, there are industries, certainly the agricultural industry, where we, at least here in the Southwest, have to harvest certain crops where it is in fact impossible to find sufficient U.S.",
        "borne workers to do the work.",
        "So, the caller has a legitimate concern and it's a part of difficult balance that has to be struck in this area.",
        "Steve, thank you for your call.",
        "Congressman, what about the undocumented immigrants who are already here?",
        "What is supposed to happen to the 12 million people already here?",
        "Well, I think that's the most difficult part of the question.",
        "I think it's fairly simple to say we need to get control of our border.",
        "That's step one.",
        "I think it's fairly simple to say that at some point in the future, we'll need additional workers and you could deal with them as a guest worker program.",
        "But the fundamental issue is, what do we do with the 12 million or so, 11 million, that are already here, number one.",
        "And how do we make sure that in handling them, we don't encourage more to come across illegally?",
        "I think a part of that answer is that we should not grant, as it is referred to, amnesty.",
        "Amnesty would be forgiveness of any penalty for them having come illegally.",
        "I personally prefer a mechanism that would say if you got here illegally, you must surface, you must identify yourself, and you must make a choice.",
        "If you got here illegally and you would want to stay just to be a worker for a period of time, that is, you want to renounce any possibility of becoming a U.S.",
        "citizen, then you can register and follow one path.",
        "And you could continue to work in the United States as a legal guest worker or as a legal foreign laborer but you would have no path to citizenship.",
        "If, on the other hand, you came and you want to preserve your right to become a citizen at some point, then I think you ought to have to return to your country of origin and come in pursuant to a mechanism established so that we knew it was your goal to work in the United States for a period of time and then to begin a path towards citizenship.",
        "That would at least let us sort out those who have come here just for wages and are sending them back to their home country with no intention of becoming ultimately an American, versus those who are choosing to become a part of this country.",
        "Close - Kamala.",
        "Congressman John Shadegg spoke to us on the phone from Phoenix, Arizona.",
        "And we're joined now, in Studio 3A, by Mark Krikorian, he is the Director of the Center for Immigration Studies.",
