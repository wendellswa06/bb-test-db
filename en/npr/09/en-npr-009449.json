        "John Shadegg said he supported it mainly as a vehicle to get the debate going in the House.",
        "But you really believe in the core substance of it.",
        "It doesn't include a guest worker program.",
        "It would make the people who enter the country illegally felons, it calls for the construction of a 700 mile fence along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
        "Taking each one of these separately, how do these measures solve the problem?",
        "There all really part of a broader strategy.",
        "See, that's what you need to, the way you need to think about it.",
        "The way this issue is presented, is that usually, there's only two options.",
        "One is we deport everybody on Tuesday.",
        "We couldn't do that even if we wanted to, we don't have the capacity to, and it would be very disruptive.",
        "The alternative therefore is legalization, is the way it's presented.",
        "Deport everybody, can't do it, therefore legalize everybody.",
        "Whatever euphemism we come up with, they don't like amnesty, so it doesn't even matter.",
        "What the word is its legalization.",
        "The point is those aren't the only two choices.",
        "The third choice is we start enforcing the law, and bring about attrition of the illegal population over time.",
        "So that instead of growing every year, it starts to declining every year allowing us to back out of this problem that took us many years go get into.",
        "There is no magical solution.",
        "When people talk about comprehensive immigration reform, what they really mean is magic immigration reform.",
        "That somehow, we really have the capacity to screen and vet, and track 12 million illegal aliens and make sure they are who they say they are.",
        "We can't even, the immigration service is chocking on its responsibility now, it can't do that.",
        "Enforcement on the other hand, and this is the point to the Sensenbrenner bill.",
        "Enforcement is something we can do with whatever resources we have, whatever opportunities we have, and to squeeze the illegal population down.",
        "Both through normal deportation, we need to increase that, but we don't do very much of it, but also by encouraging those, especially more recent arrivals, to give up and leave.",
        "And we in fact, something like 40 percent of illegal aliens have been here less than five years.",
        "They aren't rooted here, the can in fact be compelled to self deport, if it becomes impossible for them to get a job, to get a drivers license, all the other things that are necessary for normal life.",
        "We've never enforced the immigration law inside the country at the work force.",
        "We've done a little better at the border, but even there it's not much better.",
        "So the point is that the House bill is part of, is sort of fits into a strategy of reducing the problem through enforcement.",
        "And then maybe taking a second look, not next week or next month, but after a period of years, at what we want to do the loose ends that do remain.",
        "Well, what's wrong with a guest worker program?",
        "What's wrong with a, finding a way for a very large number of people, who have in many cases raised families here, are paying taxes here, have established lives here, finding a dignified way for them to live out there days here?",
        "What's wrong with it?",
        "Well, there's two issues, a guest worker program, pure guest worker program, is people who aren't here at all, bringing them in and then sending them back.",
        "What you're talking about is using the guest worker program as the vehicle for legalizing, for amnestying people.",

        "Well both parts are in the bills, but you're right that the, the using a guest worker program as the vehicle for an amnesty is what people are talking about, it's the most contentious issue.",
        "The question is, do we want to encourage more illegal immigration?",
        "Amnesties do that.",
        "The past, amnesty we had 20 years ago was a deal, amnesty for three million illegal immigrants in exchange for promises for enforcement.",
        "The amnesty, the illegals got their amnesty, the promises of enforcement were abandoned as soon as everybody was processed through the system.",
        "At the very least, we need to reverse the relationship.",
        "There needs to be enforcement first, if only for credibility reasons, because frankly, I just don't believe the promises of enforcement by supporters of the guest worker program.",

        "And they are, quite frankly, are not scared of enforcement, at this point.",
        "And they think the talk of enforcement and incarceration of these people is pretty far out, simply because we don't have the resources to do it.",
        "The county I live in can't even afford to incarcerate the ones they got.",
        "We need to get federal money to help us.",
        "I think that's, you know, I think that approach is pretty ineffective.",
        "Also I don't think you can shut down the border.",
        "I just, even if you build a wall, they're gonna find a way to get through.",
        "I think what people are not addressing is the real root of the problem, in that these people do not have jobs at home.",
        "They come here, yes, to get better wages and to get more money, because the jobs are not available at home.",
        "I think, if we would spend money and time and effort and expertise in helping Mexico and some of our Central American and South American countries to build up their economies, to build up their country, to where people had jobs, you'd see a definite slowdown in immigration.",
        "These people don't, don't want to come here.",
        "They don't want to leave their families back in Mexico.",
        "They don't like to do that.",
        "But they have no other alternative.",

        "What about his point about though, Mark Krikorian, that you, that, it's really, this is people who are voting with their feet.",
        "I mean, they're looking for the opportunities.",
        "They're doing what immigrants and what Americans have always done, which is look for opportunity?",
        "There's a couple of factual points.",
        "In fact, research shows that most Mexican illegal immigrants had jobs in Mexico.",
        "They just found better jobs in the United States.",
        "Likewise, they have developed the expectation that they can find work here, precisely because there is no fear of enforcement.",
        "I mean, we talk about illegal immigrants living in the shadows, well, what shadows?",
        "I mean, they're on the front page of newspapers, they testify before state legislatures.",
        "Illegal immigrants, once they're 50 miles or so past the border, no longer have much to fear from law enforcement.",
        "So the idea that this is, this is sort of an inevitable flow, like the tides or the weather, you know, this poverty there and it's moving people here, is false.",
        "It's an artifact of government policy.",
        "We don't get a lot of low-skilled immigrants from say, Indonesia, because we don't have any long-standing relationship with Indonesia.",
        "Even within Mexico, we get disproportionate numbers of people from particular parts of Mexico that we had a relation, that sent Pesaros(ph), for instance, to the United States.",
        "So there's nothing inevitable about this, and although, in the long run, economic development is the solution to this, but we're all dead in the long run.",
        "Question is what do we do in the next 40, 50, 60 years, and that's something we need to decide now.",
        "And not just sort of hope it takes care of itself.",
        "We're gonna take a short break just to say, you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And I'm talking with Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies.",
        "Mark, and I apologize again to Steve for hanging up on him.",
        "I did not mean to do that.",
        "But what do you think is missing from this debate?",
        "You've started our conversation by saying, that, it's, if we've been reduced to two sides, which is either you can deport everybody, which everybody understands is not logical, or you can legalize everybody, and you don't find that to be appropriate either.",
        "But why do you think we've gotten stuck on those, sort of, two positions?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "I'm not sure why.",
        "They're easier to understand, because they both, there's a very small number of people, actually, think we can actually deport everybody.",
        "But I mean, there's always some, sort of, constituency for that.",
        "Why don't we just round them all up tomorrow and get rid of them.",
        "But that's actually a pretty unimportant voice in the debate.",
        "The much more, sort of, the dominate voice is this idea that we need to throw up our hands and give up, we need to lie back and pretend to enjoy it, because there's nothing we can do about it.",
        "So, we need to come how, sort of, re-label the flow and therefore make it legal.",
        "The attraction of those is that, and I don't mean to be too derogatory here, but there's sort of magical solutions, they solve everything in a kind of clean and easy way, neither of those neat solutions is realistic.",
        "It took us a long time to get into this problem.",
        "We're gonna have to back out of it.",
        "And during the time that we back out of it, there's gonna remain a significant, though shrinking illegal population.",
        "This is not something we can snap our fingers and allow it to disappear, and make it disappear successfully.",
        "So I think the, those two poles are attractive to people because they seem neat and easy.",
        "And unfortunately, reality isn't quite that simple."
