        "His view in many instances is in counterpoint to that of Justice Scalia, who contends that the Constitution means what the words put down by the framers meant at the time.",

        "You cannot adopt a theory that the Constitution is evolving and the Supreme Court will tell you what it means from age to age.",
        "You cannot do that without causing the Supreme Court to become a very political institution.",
        "But Breyer argues that the founders used broad terms precisely so that the Constitution would be adaptable over time.",
        "And Breyer believes that courts should interpret the Constitution with particular emphasis on what the underlying purpose was, fostering democratic participation to achieve democratic rule.",
        "So how is it that he was among the dissenters in the Supreme Court's 2002 decision upholding taxpayer-financed school vouchers to pay for private tuition at religious schools?",
        "After all, the Ohio law that was upheld was enacted by a democratically elected state Legislature.",
        "`In a society as religiously diverse as ours,' Breyer writes, `I saw, in the creation of a huge grant program for religious education, a potential for religious strife, and that, it seemed to me, was the kind of problem the First Amendment religion clauses banning state involvement with religion sought to avoid.'",
        "Breyer says the same constitutional concern was the basis of the deciding votes he cast in the two cases last term involving Ten Commandments displays.",
        "In one he voted to uphold the large granite Ten Commandments monument outside the Texas Statehouse but, in a second case, he voted that a framed copy of the Ten Commandments in a Kentucky courthouse violated the Constitution.",
        "One of the basic purposes underlying the establishment clause, which I thought put in very general terms, was to try to minimize the social conflict related to religion.",
        "And looking at that basic purpose in the particular cases led me to different outcomes in the different cases.",
        "To purge all religious references from the public square, said Breyer, could end up provoking exactly the kind of religious conflict the framers sought to avoid, so, he writes, `One has to examine the particular display in context to see whether it conveys the kind of government-endorsed religious message that the Constitution forbids.",
        "In the Texas case, he concluded, the public had long considered the religious message of the monument secondary to the display's broader moral meaning.",
        "The monument had been paid for by a private civic organization seeking to combat juvenile delinquency.",
        "It was surrounded by other non-religious monuments and, most important of all, it had stood for 40 years without objection.",
        "It thus had proved socially undivisive, whereas its removal would likely provoke social conflict.",
        "In contrast, the Kentucky display had a short and stormy history, with ample evidence that its motivation was to convey a religious message."
