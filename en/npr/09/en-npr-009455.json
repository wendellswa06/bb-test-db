        "Breyer's method of statutory and constitutional interpretation leads him more than any other member of the court to defer to Congress.",
        "That contrasts with the current court's conservative majority.",
        "A study conducted by Yale law Professor Paul Gewirtz shows that until 1991, the court on average struck down one congressional provision every two years, but that in the last decade, the court has invalidated a total of 64 laws, with the court's conservatives voting most often to strike them down.",
        "The justice voting most often to strike down federal laws was Justice Thomas, 67 percent of the time, while Justice Breyer voted to strike down laws least often, 28 percent of the time.",
        "Breyer maintains that his method of constitutional statutory and regulatory interpretation, looking at those underlying purposes, is a method that holds the elected branches most accountable.",
        "It all fits together and other more complex theories, it seemed to me, are only mystifying and make it harder for an average person to figure out, `Who do I hold responsible for this mess' or `Who do I say, \"\"You did a good job in that getting that excellent objective\"\"'?",
        "There's loads of room for judgment.",
        "The judges do judge.",
        "And were these things to decide themselves in some automatic way, what reason would there be for a court?",
        "Some guards require a receipt for admission to the bathrooms, Eddie says, but you can grab one from the trash.",
        "Eddie, who's 39 and homeless, works in a restaurant himself.",
        "We're only using his first name because he's admitting to illegal drug use.",
        "Our next stop - a national restaurant chain.",
        "You have to get the code to use their bathroom, but if you go in there and sit on that side by the bathroom, if you wait long enough, someone's going to use that bathroom.",
        "And then you'll say hey, hold the door for me.",
        "And then you're in.",
        "So you know which bathrooms you can...",
        "I do.",
        "I do.",
        "I know all the bathrooms that I can and can't get high in.",
        "Even in the train station downstairs, you can use that bathroom most days and not be bothered.",
        "So...",
        "But that's not good in some ways, right?",
        "It's not good at all.",
        "Who's keeping an eye on them?",
        "That's why you have to have somebody with you to make sure that you don't overdose.",
        "It's unfortunate that it's come to that, but that's the way it is.",
        "You can understand why the restaurants might be freaked out about this, right?"

        "At one of those family businesses, the 1369 Coffee House, Joshua Gerber and his staff have found several people on the bathroom floor not breathing.",
        "And it's very scary, you know?",
        "Gerber has installed key codes on bathroom doors and metal boxes for needles, so users don't flush them and clog pipes.",
        "In an ideal world, users would have safe places to go that it didn't become the job of a business to make sure that they were OK.",
        "Gerber is taking the unusual step of training his baristas to use naloxone, the drug that reverses most opioid overdoses.",
        "He sent a training invitation to all employees.",
        "And within 10 minutes, he had about 25 replies.",
        "Mostly capital yes, I'll be there for sure, just thrilled to figure out how they might be able to save a life.",
        "Naloxone has become standard equipment for security guards at many Boston hospitals.",
        "At Massachusetts General Hospital, emergency room physician Dr. Ali Raja realized bathrooms had become a magnet for drug users.",
        "There is an understanding that if you overdose in and around a hospital that you're much more likely to be able to be treated.",
        "And so we're finding patients in our restrooms.",
        "We're finding patients in our lobbies.",
        "Speed is critical, especially now when heroin is routinely mixed with fentanyl which is even more potent.",
        "Some clinics and restaurants knock on bathroom doors after five or 10 minutes.",
        "One clinic has installed an intercom and requires people to respond.",
        "Another designed a reverse motion detector that sets off an alarm when there's no movement in the bathroom.",
        "But Boston Medical Center's Dr. Alex Walley says no one wants to talk about their strategies in public."

        "It's against federal and state law to provide a space where people can use knowingly, so that is a big deterrent from people talking about this problem.",

        "Earlier this week, the Senate passed a resolution that calls for 2006 to mark the beginning of the end of the war, and though the Republican-controlled Senate rejected Democratic demands for a specific timetable, the bipartisan message to the president was unmistakable.",

        "Is it responsible to leave before Iraq's government and military are ready to take over?",

        "However, I think it's fair to say that in the rest of the country that they are--particularly in Shia- and Sunni-dominated areas, there is certainly a very strong wish to see the coalition presence end arguably as soon as possible.",
