        "And the cart was basically the only way we could do this.",

        "And right when we started, Columbus was really into food carts, and the timing for us was just perfect.",

        "Today, we have bulgogi cheesesteak, which is a Korean marinated beef cheesesteak.",

        "Well, good luck to you.",

        "A couple of options are to link up with another business that doesn't utilize their kitchen, or there's some indoor markets going on in the wintertime.",
        "Those are some of the main options.",
        "For us, I don't know how hardcore we are about standing out in the cold.",
        "I know some carts and trucks do that.",
        "I don't know if we're as strong as them about standing out in the cold like that, but maybe we'll do it for a little bit."
