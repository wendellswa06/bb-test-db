        "Jones is outreach director for Southside Community Health Services, one of the organizations that's sharing in a $4 million federal grant to provide the boots on the ground to explain what MNsure is about and how to sign up for coverage.",
        "Barbershops and beauty shops are really one of the places where people come and they talk to trusted messengers.",
        "So, we know that people are concerned about their health.",
        "And so we wanted to establish some kind of relationships with barber shops and beauty shops so that we can give them information about how to access medical care, which is an issue in many communities.",
        "It's particularly an issue for Minnesota's Latinos, who are three times as likely as white residents to lack health insurance, making them an important target for outreach efforts.",
        "On a recent Saturday, Jones and about a half-dozen of his colleagues visit Karina's Beauty Salon in the heart of St. Paul's Latino community.",

        "But even people who do qualify for coverage may not sign up to protect an undocumented family member.",
        "Benson said the clipper clinic at Karina's is only the first step in a continuing conversation about MNsure.",
        "I think it opens up the ability for the conversation to broaden, so people who've been afraid or don't know what questions to ask, when they hear more information, start to understand that it's OK to ask any questions that they might have and hopefully get the answers that they need, to go forward and take care of themselves.",

        "It said a tracking device located one truck driver who claimed to be en route sound asleep in a parking lot.",
