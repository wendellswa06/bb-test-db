        "Overall, the report found that much of the criticism the federal government received for its response to Hurricane Katrina was warranted.",
        "The Homeland Security Department, which oversees FEMA, says it recognizes many of the problems and is already moving to address them.",
        "Russ Knocke is the agency spokesman.",
        "We're taking steps as we prepare for the storm season to make significant and substantial improvements to logistics, to claims processing for disaster victims, to debris removal, procurement steps, emergency communications and several other areas.",
        "He said, for example, that Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is naming federal disaster coordinators for 13 hurricane-prone states in advance of the next hurricane season.",
        "It begins on June 1.",
        "That allows these pre-designated officials to start working now, start training now, start coordinating now, with state and local emergency managers.",
        "In Hurricane Katrina, federal coordinators were assigned after the fact, and there was confusion over what they were supposed to do and who was in charge.",
        "Chertoff has also announced that in the coming weeks, his agency will conduct exercises with state and local officials in the Gulf region to make sure officials are prepared to work together in another disaster.",
        "Among its findings, the inspector general's report agreed with the conclusion of many emergency managers, that FEMA was weakened when it became part of the Homeland Security Department in 2003.",
        "It said the agency must do a much better job integrating FEMA.",
        "Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine said in a written response that the new report highlights what she called the unacceptable failures of FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Her committee is expected to issue its own report later this month.",
        "Pam Fessler, NPR News, Washington.",
        "Today in Los Angeles, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld paid tribute to 21 Marines killed in Iraq over the past few days.",
        "Our nation needed them, our nation called on them in battle and we mourn them now in death.",
        "Our country will honor them by completing the mission which--for which they fought so hard and so nobly.",
        "Fourteen of those Marines were killed yesterday by a massive roadside bomb near the city of Hadithah in western Iraq.",
        "The Marines were traveling in an amphibious assault vehicle.",
        "Michael Moss writes about military transportation for The New York Times, and he says those vehicles were designed in the late 1960s and never intended for use in anything like the war in Iraq."

        "It's a slightly armored vehicle.",
        "It holds 25 people, it's 25 tons.",
        "And it's a landing craft, so it's designed to bring Marines from the ship onto the beach and go inland maybe a mile or two.",
        "How is this vehicle now being used by the Marines in Iraq?",
        "They have 99 of these vehicles in Iraq now and they're basically using them to transport troops from post to post, which is not what its original design was for.",
        "I mean, one of the problems for the Marines in Iraq is that they're doing a job for which they--you know, they didn't train or properly equip themselves.",
        "They're basically helping the Army in sort of a sustained conflict there.",
        "So they've been scrambling ever since they've gone to Iraq to find, you know, and jury rig in any kind of equipment they can.",
        "In this case, yes, they're using this amphibious assault vehicle merely to transport a large number of troops from one post to another.",
        "At the military briefing in Baghdad today, they said that they thought this vehicle had what's called a level-two armor.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "That's a reference to sort of the size and the amount of the armor that's put on, but also when.",
        "Level one, in Pentagon parlance, is when the vehicle was armored in the factory.",
        "Level two is when it's had armor added on after the fact.",
        "So level one would be the best armoring, made in the factory; level two is added on after the fact.",
        "I'm wondering, though, with a bomb apparently this big, big enough to flip over a 25-ton vehicle, is armor even relevant to this discussion for a bomb that strong?",
        "Well, it is and it isn't.",
        "I mean, military experts will say that the size of this bomb probably would have knocked over a Bradley tank, anything short of an Abrams, for example.",
        "So in some sense, this is an example of the incredible frustration that the Pentagon's been facing in Iraq, which is that they're facing an ever-stronger, clever enemy with which they're unable to sort of meet defenses that will safeguard the American troops.",
        "It is good.",
        "The people are so polite, and they respect us.",
        "We are happy here.",
        "Yet, you also hear from people who say it's too early for American forces to leave because they're the only things at this point holding back the possibility of a civil war."

        "Well, yes, there are varying ways of looking at this situation.",
        "Some people would argue that it's the coalition forces themselves that are causing the constant insurgency against the newly formed institutions of the Iraqi government and the coalition itself.",
        "There are others who are saying that the--that the new Iraqi government is simply not in a position to defeat the insurgency and survive without having coalition backing behind it.",
        "It's a very difficult one to call.",
        "I would personally say that I would agree with the latter analysis; that at this moment, the new security structures of the Iraqi army, the Iraqi police forces are simply not strong enough, they're not large enough in terms of numbers.",
        "Their quality is not yet high enough to defeat the insurgency if Americans and British forces left.",
        "And in terms of that timetable, any time that you can see when Iraqi forces might be said to be ready?",
        "Well, I think it's very difficult to--first, to judge the numbers involved.",
        "We hear figures from the Pentagon and from the Ministry of Defense in the UK as to how many forces have been trained.",
        "But it's very difficult to really ascertain the quality of these forces and just how capable they are in the field.",
        "I think there is a further problem with the Iraqi military insofar as the more effective units tend to come from either Kurdish peshmerga or Shia Badr Brigade units and I would argue are fighting more for those particular groups rather than for the idea of a umbrella Iraqi identity.",
        "And so it's very difficult, I think--almost impossible--to say when the Iraqi military will be able to take on its responsibilities as an Iraqi military, capable of defeating the insurgency without having a greater allegiance to communal identity.",
        "And what about the government?",
        "Obviously, we're still in the midst of a process with elections coming up again next month, in December.",
        "In terms of administrative structure--and again, northern Iraq is different, the Kurds have enjoyed local autonomy since the end of the first Gulf War in 1991--but throughout the rest of the country.",
        "Well, yes, I think that's a very important question to ask.",
        "I would say that Iraq, in some ways, isn't even a failed state.",
        "It's very difficult to even find the state in Iraq, outside the north.",
        "I think there is a fragmented power--fragmented pattern of political power and administrative structures in the rest of the country.",
        "That certainly doesn't bode well for holding the state together in the future.",
        "So, again, I think the institutions that have set up have certainly not been institutionalized within Iraqi society and I think have little longevity beyond--if the coalition forces did actually leave.",
        "Does the government have legitimacy?",
        "Again, it depends who you ask.",
        "I think there is a sizeable proportion of Iraq's population that would say that it is legitimate in one way or another, but more importantly, there are very sizeable groups of the population that do not recognize this government and its legitimacy, and I cannot imagine how those groups, and particularly those groups associated with the Sunni insurgency, could be brought into thinking--any thinking that this government is legitimate.",
        "Now you've been to Iraq several times and you lived there for some years before the invasion.",
        "How do you feel about what has transpired there?",
        "I mean, the--Iraqis, for the most part, were quite pleased with the eviction of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "I think whether or not you supported the invasion of Iraq and the removal of Saddam--and I personally--I was academically confused, I think.",
        "I believe that there was a need to remove such a grotesque dictator, but I also considered that the reasons given for going to war were flawed.",
        "But still, whether you supported the war or not, following the removal of Saddam, I think there was a great opportunity to do a lot of good within Iraq.",
        "There was a window where I think there was a lot of support from--pretty much from all groups of--all sectors of Iraq's population in the two months following Saddam's downfall; yet I think that that period was wasted--criminally wasted, I would say, with inactivity, with poor planning, if any planning at all, which resulted in power devolving in a chaotic sense and fragmenting authority within the state down to groups such as--well, communal groups, tribal groups, groups that identify themselves by a particular localized coloring.",
        "And once that happens, it's very difficult, I think, to then draw power back to a centralized structure, as I think the Iraqis are trying to do now.",
        "So I think the great tragedy of Iraq in recent years has been that wasted opportunity, which was hard-earned by coalition forces and then subsequently by Iraqis on the ground and was just wasted."

        "Well, initially, what we did was stand up the police force, the Iraqi police, and we wanted to get them back in uniform, on the streets, and we wanted everyone to understand that the Iraqis were in control.",
        "Within hours, we appointed an interim Iraqi mayor, because we wanted, again, to get an Iraqi civilian leader in charge of the city, but what we also did was focused on public administration.",

        "Right, there is an interdependence between all three of those.",
        "And an open, free market was a real tangible, you know, example of what this good governance was going to produce, and you have to understand that a lot of the people--they wanted more efficacy in the politics, but they also wanted economic prosperity, because of the depravation under Saddam, and so that free market, that open market, we were able to open up the borders and get fresh fish, fresh meat into the market within days after arriving there.",
