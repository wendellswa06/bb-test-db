        "Did you put them on checkpoints because you needed their manpower or because you needed them for their presence and for their local knowledge?",
        "Well, both.",
        "Working together built mutual understanding, but it also enabled each other to do better at our tasks.",
        "For instance, because of our presence, we were able to back up any Iraqi policemen that encountered some kind of threat that he couldn't handle.",
        "But by integrating them with us, they were able to identify who was really from the city, who was even a foreigner and not even Iraqi, so we complemented each other's efforts.",

        "Yeah.",
        "My comment was just on the--what was said by the expert earlier that, you know, we can't get out until the Iraqi military is of a sufficient size and quality, and that just perpetuates the myth that this is going to be gotten out of militarily.",
        "I mean, we're not going to stop the insurgency that way, and so waiting for it is just going to be forever.",
        "Gareth Stansfield.",
        "Well, yes, I think as the major said from the Pentagon that there are interrelated dynamics, including the economy, security and promoting institutions on the ground.",
        "But I think when the Iraqi government is faced with such a wide-ranging insurgency that has legs--and this insurgency is very capable and active, then the security element does come to the fore at that point, so I think increasingly, the focus on the structures of the Iraqi security forces have to be taken into account and given pre-eminence in any analysis.",
        "But I do recognize that the issues particularly about the economy and providing employment are also very important.",
        "I think it is a chicken and egg sort of idea.",
        "Can you do both together or does one have to come before the other?",
        "Well, my feeling is--just the big question, is it for us to stay there and do it or just get out and let the Iraqis sort out their own economy and security?",
        "Well, Major Gavrilis, let me bring you in on this.",
        "Given your experience, is this something that the outsiders have to do for them?",
        "Is this something they can do themselves?",
        "It certainly is a combination.",
        "But you have to remember that, you know, we're not rebuilding what was destroyed during the invasion.",
        "What we're rebuilding is what Saddam had destroyed during his dictatorship.",
        "And security services inside Iraq were tools of state coercion, and if you want to transform these security institutions into public servants, institutions that respect human rights and individual rights, it's just going to take time, and they need assistance, and it's that institutional development that takes a little bit more time, but that's what creates lasting change, and it's going to allow any withdrawal from the country to be permanent.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, John.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Major, when--in your article, you described how your forces in the space of two weeks--and again, this was right at the beginning of the war or right at the end of the major military operations phase of the war--were able to win over this town, Ar Rutbah, in the space of two weeks.",
        "Obviously, a lot has happened since then.",
        "But it seems that that formula--empower the Iraqis politically and militarily, let them handle the situation, get the economy up and going again, and move American forces out of the town itself--is that a formula that can work today?",
        "Yes, I think it is.",
        "I think it's a useful model.",
        "There's going to be differences for different locations, but generally, I think it is still a useful model."

        "But what happened after your forces did leave?",
        "Well, you have to understand that the police that we stood up were--we were just beginning, and it was very clear to us early that the police needed a lot more time, guidance, supervision, and it's one thing to stand up a police force but it's another to actually develop an organization that can maintain that police force, sustain it, and then also, you know, ingrain a particular culture that is different from what the police forces were before.",
        "And so what had happened was in that short period of time, we weren't able to develop the police fully so they could stand on their own, and so when we left, they became vulnerable to regime elements that could come back in or foreign fighters that could come back in and intimidate them.",
        "So it's probably a good example of why withdrawal should be conditions-based and not based on a time line.",
        "Conditions-based meaning the conditions of--the state of the Iraqi military, the Iraqi government and the Iraqi economy.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "We were successful in a lot of ways because we helped the Iraqi mayor and the Iraqi government that we established--we helped them pass binding laws that the police--and with our support--enforced, but without those kind of enforcement mechanisms, the government becomes ineffective.",
        "Gareth Stansfield, in miniature, what Major Gavrilis is talking about that happened in Ar Rutbah is, in a way, what the United States is trying to do elsewhere.",
        "Of course, it gets more and more complicated as you get into more and more--larger towns and more complicated ethnic situations.",
        "Can that model still work, do you think?",
        "Well, I think it has worked in various places, but my impression is that there simply are not enough security forces with coalition backing to put down the insurgencies that have taken hold of the country, so you can operate in one town very well, but then the insurgency simply starts up somewhere else.",
        "And it is this--almost like a fairground game, like whack-a-mole game.",
        "You hit them in one area and they come up in another.",
        "And this isn't really at all helping the development of a stable, secure, new state of Iraq, and particularly as I think the insurgency is gaining momentum.",
        "We see peaks, we see troughs with insurgent activity, but there seems to be little evidence that its effectiveness and its ability to really damage the new institutions of government and security forces, and still coalition forces, has been at all diminished.",
        "If anything, it is continuing to grow.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "I'm not sure we're still in Serbia, but Bosnia, I'll grant you.",
        "But let me put that question to you, Gareth Stansfield.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "I mean, the idea of setting a time frame--the problem, it is argued with us, is that insurgent forces play towards that time frame and perhaps everything isn't then in place by that date necessary in order to leave comfortably, and I think there is an issue that it is up to the Iraqi government not to demand that coalition forces stay.",
        "They cannot do that.",
        "But to at least request them--feed into the equation as to when it would be best from their perspective for coalition forces to leave.",
        "The problem is--I think, is that Mr. Talabani may have quite a different idea on that compared to other political players in Iraq, including Ibrahim Al-Jafari, the prime minister, and any Sunni politician that may appear in the forthcoming elections.",
        "So each of these political characters has quite a different game plan.",
        "Al-Sadr might think differently.",
        "Pardon me?",
        "I'm sorry.",

        "Yes.",
        "Moqtada al-Sadr, one of the Shiite clerics there.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "And I think it depends on how the new governments of Iraq will be stretched after the December elections as well.",
        "But I would tend to agree that setting a time for the withdrawal of coalition forces could create more problems rather than resolve them.",

        "Thanks very much, Scott.",
        "At the same time, though, Gareth Stansfield, isn't there a developing problem with public opinion in the United States, public opinion and opinion in Congress as well?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "I mean, following from the other side of the Atlantic, it certainly seems as though American public opinion is falling away from supporting the policies of George Bush in Iraq, and certainly with the rising death toll of American soldiers on the ground.",
        "It's not surprising that the president seems to be losing support, and especially when, again, the insurgency seems to be going from strength to strength, and the political process--it doesn't really take a political scientist to realize that the political process in Iraq is flawed at best, if not downright unworkable at worst.",
        "Major Gavrilis, I know we have to let you go...",
        "Sure.",
        "...but I did want to ask you, is it your view now from the Pentagon--you've served two tours in Iraq now.",

        "No, I don't think it is.",
        "It's very potent and it's very lethal but we had not seen it expand beyond the Sunni areas, and I don't think we've even seen it expand within the Sunni areas.",
        "It is formidable and it has roots and has good external mechanisms, and there is some popular appeal amongst a lot of the disenfranchised Sunnis, but I don't think it is completely undefeatable, and I think that our strategy has been working.",
        "A lot of people want to focus on these tactical engagements in the streets, but they're overlooking the larger political developments.",
        "They're overlooking a lot of the community building, and it's just important that we continue this democratic process over there, because--and it's important that we develop Iraqi good governance.",
        "We help them develop Iraqi good governance because that's what has been missing under Saddam.",
        "That's what we found in the city, what most Iraqis responded to, a government that could take care of them.",
        "And if we can establish a government that could take care of people, take care of its citizens, then that's what really can remove the discontent that drives a lot of these individuals to extremism or towards the insurgency.",
        "That's really the answer.",
        "And I'm very optimistic and I've been optimistic because the majority of the Iraqis--in any section of the country, the majority of them have been in support of a democratic transition.",
