        "We want to bring Leslie Gelb onto the program now.",
        "He's president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations and has written on the viability of a three-state solution for Iraq.",
        "He joins us now by phone from his home in New York.",
        "And it's nice to speak with you again.",
        "Afternoon.",
        "How would federalism work?",
        "There's a constitution now that calls for modified federalism.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, the key to all this is having a power-sharing agreement among the three major groups in Iraq: the Shia Arabs, the Sunni Arabs and the Kurds.",
        "That's viable.",
        "It works.",
        "If you can't have that, nothing else is going to work.",
        "And the idea of a federal system is to allow these different groups, which essentially want to rule themselves, to be in a position to do that.",
        "So you have strong regional governments, three strong regional governments in the federal system, and a central government in Baghdad with limited powers, more or less as was the case with the United States at our founding.",
        "We--rather, you know, limited central government in Washington, and states rights (technical difficulties).",
        "Under the articles of confederation?",
        "No, no, no, under our Constitution.",
        "The states were the basis of lawmaking until very late in our history, until people had the confidence that they could turn the lawmaking powers over to a central government.",
        "You know, the history of Iraq is not the history of one country.",
        "People who talk about that don't know anything about the history of Iraq.",
        "It's really been one country only under centralized, despotic, ruthless rule from Baghdad under Saddam or under British-imposed rule.",
        "But otherwise it's really been different constituencies, different ethnic groups essentially living their own way.",
        "Iraq is only a modern, unified country late in--you know, beginning 1920s in this century.",
        "We're talking about the future of Iraq and a possible exit strategy for the United States.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Leslie Gelb, the Kurds would presumably leap at the opportunity for autonomous control of their region.",
        "The Shiites might as well.",
        "But wouldn't such an arrangement deprive the Sunnis in the middle of the country of, well, a lot of the oil?",
        "Well, the Kurds would leap at independence and that, I think, would be bad for them, bad for us, because it might cause a war between them and Turkey.",
        "So I don't want three separate, independent states.",
        "I want a federal state with three of them still under the yoke of an Iraq.",
        "Now as far as the Sunnis are concerned, you're quite right to raise that.",
        "There's no peace, there's no unity without the Sunnis, and under the plan that I'm proposing, the Sunnis would have the same authority to legislate for themselves in the central region as the Kurds would in the north and the Shiites in the south.",
        "You know, otherwise the Sunnis really are going to be in a position down the line where a Shiite majority legislates for them, and they aren't going to like that one bit."

        "Forever.",
        "I would continue to support a civil union that provides all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage.",
        "Right now they've only been focusing on a strong central government because they're still under the illusion that they're going to be in charge of it again, that they're gonna run Iraq the way they did in the previous 80 years.",
        "But that isn't going to happen.",
        "And once they adjust to the new reality of things, they'll see they're better off, far better off with a more autonomous region of their own in the center.",
        "Now the problem--I'll just take a moment more.",
        "The problem is money, because they haven't got any revenues, any reliable revenue stream, and what I would do is I'd put in the constitution itself a revenue-sharing agreement for oil that would give the Sunnis even more than they deserve based on their population levels, and guarantee it for them, for both new oil revenues as well as the old oil revenues.",
        "And that would make their central region viable and give them a reason, a powerful reason to stay in a united Iraq.",
        "Gareth Stansfield, we just a minute or so left, but I wanted to ask you if that's an outline that you think might be viable.",
        "Well, I would tend to agree with Les Gelb that the only future that Iraq has as a state as we've seen within its historical parameters is if it's a federal entity with maybe three states, but perhaps even more, five states that ...(unintelligible) talked about with two Shia provinces, a metropolitan Baghdad, a Sunni area and a Kurdish region.",
        "Now there are all sorts of permutations on this, but I think if it's--if we describe it as the only future or the only possible future for Iraq, it's often not a terribly good one because federal structures are notoriously complex models to impose.",
        "They're highly--they're the most sophisticated form of government and democracy that have yet been developed, and to imagine putting such a model in place in Iraq, and the basic requirements of federalism would require trust to exist between these groups, would require agreement to be reached on these complex issues such as revenue sharing, upon the status of the very troublesome mixed cities, particularly of Kirkuk and ...(unintelligible).",
        "And I'm afraid we're running out of time but, Gareth Stansfield, we wanted to thank you very much for joining us today.",
        "Leslie Gelb, appreciate your time as well.",

        "Scientists, endocrinologists, gynecologists, gender experts have for years carved out a set manifest standard for what defines a male and a female athlete, ensuring that every person who steps up to the start line is not up against a chemically-engineered specimen quite unlike his or her birth profile.",
        "Simply put, the goal of most of the doping cheats in sports is to become somehow more male - the more male the body's chemistry, the higher potential for brute strength, explosive speed and efficient oxygen utilization.",

        "The most famous male-to-female transgender athlete who actually competed as a female was Renee Richards.",

        "Open women's draw as Renee.",
        "But there was protest.",
        "Some of the women at the time, although respectful of Renee's personal life decisions, deemed it unfair to face a 6-foot-1-inch athlete who was not long before male, with bigger-than-normal hands, a smaller-than-normal hip girdle.",
        "Let's look at this as would a statistician.",
        "A born male has a range of height, wider shoulders and so on than a born female.",
        "So if you were born with those male skeletal characteristics, traits that don't change with hormonal shifts, and stand within any group of females, you have a likely chance of being bigger than average - an asset in most sports.",
