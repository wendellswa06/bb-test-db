        "Are women really inherently more suited to making peace or is this, as Pedro suggests, really a question of equity?",
        "Well, I think it's both.",
        "And, you know, in terms of your specific question about whether they are inherently geared toward making peace, I think if you were look at major crises around the world, this could be whether it's war, whether it's the aftermath of an earthquake or tsunami, you will see that women are the ones who generally take the lead in rebuilding communities, have an enormous capacity for being able to remake, to look at tragedy and begin to remake the village.",
