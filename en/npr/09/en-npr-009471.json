        "It's important for the American public to know that there are elected representatives who are willing to take a tough stand and call for an end to the war.",
        "I don't think that they can stop it now.",
        "I think that the fact that Bush still is the commander-in-chief and the fact that he has both Republicans and Democrats in sufficient numbers to support him will make it possible for them to continue to pursue this war.",
        "What's going to change things, ultimately, is the continued disaster in Iraq.",
        "The American people at some point will get so fed up with seeing so many lives lost - and not just Americans, but Iraqis - and see that country continue to spiral into chaos, because I have seen no evidence at all that this surge is going to lead to stability in that country.",
        "Nat, Pedro brings up the very good point that it's not just Americans who are dying.",
        "And recently the sectarian violence in Iraq has just increased to an astounding level where before, explosive devises might take 10 or 20 lives, now regularly 100 at a clip.",

        "Because we have a poverty draft in this country.",
        "It's poor people who serve in the war, and I think it's been easy for Americans not to understand and appreciate that tremendous costs have been borne because middle-class Americans to a large degree are not sending their children off to this war.",
        "All right.",
        "Got to end it there.",
        "Pedro Noguera, professor of education at New York University; Nat Irvin with the Winston Salem Journal, WFDD radio was where he was; Mary Frances Berry with me right here in D.C.; thank you all so much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Right now we're just like - I think Pedro summed it up very well - in fact I will compare it to a chess game where, you know, you have opening, you have middle and you have end game.",
        "We're sort of at the end of the middle toward the end game and right now the fact that, you know, the accumulation of the total deaths of the Iraqi people themselves, the enormous amount of the injuries that have been suffered by our veterans, something like 25,000 serious injuries, 3,100 deaths, the accumulative effect of that has moved us to a point as a country where now we are just waiting for this thing to end.",
        "I think the thing that helps this resolution is the fact that we now have a new secretary of defense who does have a credible voice.",
        "David Petraeus is a credible general, and I think that the tone that they have set is not one, even though the language may still be winning, it is one of negotiate, get our troops out, get America out, get the troops, the veterans - get the veterans the medical treatment that they need, and good riddance, get the hell out of Iraq.",
        "It is a disaster of major proportions, and I was thinking how sad I am about this situation that the United States is in because of the administration's policy - all the deaths and the dying that everyone talks about.",
        "But just yesterday, General Petraeus kept talking about how you needed to do more than use the military, and he sounded very depressed about it."

        "And we'll get out, but as you say, there's an enormous cost and they will be faced with something like Nixon was at the end and Ford when he came in, trying to get the United States out of something that we are in that just keeps getting worse.",
        "And Bush will just hand it over and go back to Texas, I guess.",
        "Nat, what about that?",
        "I mean, at some point aren't we going to have to pay the piper not just in terms of the war but in terms of the expenditures for the war?",
        "Well, we're already doing that, Farai.",
        "And it is a long-term financial - and basically we have adopted Iraq as a state, financially, for some long period of time, you know, never having known that.",
        "But you know what I think, I'm with Mary on this.",
        "It's the human toll that this is taking on Americans who virtually still are unseen largely by this country.",
