        "Where is the pressure on, you know, coming in terms of the media, in terms of the newspapers down in South Carolina to force Jim DeMint to look elsewhere?",
        "Where's the pressure coming from the White House?",
        "Obviously the president is low on the polls, he's weak, and that's why he'd get Republican senators able, like DeMint, able to do what they want to do on this key issue for President Bush.",

        "Well, right now his biggest advocate would be Vice President Cheney, as he was Vice President Cheney's former chief of staff, as you said.",
        "The problem is, of course, that Republicans, even as they feel for Lewis Libby because, you know, they feel like, you know, this is a political player and he's falling on his sword for Vice President Cheney and we should take care of him, see that it would be a huge political liability going forward because it will contribute to the idea that Republicans are part of what the Democrats dubbed in '06 a culture of corruption.",
        "And so if he pardons him now, it's bad because it will last.",
        "And if he pardons him just before he - before the '08 election or if it's hanging over the head going forward in the '08 election, again, just bad news for the Republicans.",
        "So there's pressure.",
        "There's a countervailing pressure coming from Republicans to say, well, he was convicted, he's going to have to do the time, even as much as we don't like it.",
        "Do you think that Vice President Cheney might be able to persuade the president nonetheless to pardon Libby?",
        "He'll put pressure on him.",
        "But Vice President Cheney is at low ebb in many ways.",
        "You know, just this week, there were more details came to the forefront about how the hospital visit that was paid by Attorney General Gonzales and Andy Card, who was then the White House chief of staff, to the hospital room of Attorney General John Ashcroft, trying to get permission for some national security things that Ashcroft had denied as illegal, and it was, again, Vice President Cheney who had been the hidden hand.",
        "And similarly, Vice President Cheney - it came to light this week - has been trying to block access to logs of people visiting his home, the vice president's mansion here in Washington.",
        "I think that a lot of people just see him now as kind of, you know, of someone who is a problem for the party, especially in terms of swing voters who see him as far too, you know, far too much of a commanding presence rather than a political leader."
