        "Well, I think, Neal, it's important to keep in mind that threat assessment methodologies, while they've gotten a lot of attention in higher education in the last couple of years since the April 16, 2007 incident here at Virginia Tech, threat assessment methodologies have been around quite some time.",
        "I was part of a team that formed back in 1994 at Iowa State University, although it's certainly garnered much more attention over the last couple of years.",
        "Well, as I understand it, in the past the focus was very much on trying to identify people who were students, primarily mentally disturbed, who might be threats to themselves.",
        "Has that focus shifted?",
        "Well, again, going back some time, it's not just trying to identify people who may be violent, either homicidal or suicidal, but people whose behavior indicates that they're experiencing difficulties.",
        "It may be mental health, it may be lack of access to other resources, problem solving.",
        "The focus on who is going to be the next shooter I think is a highly misguided focus, and it gets us down a road that is just not going to be very fruitful for us.",
        "We, and many other people, did follow-ups after Virginia Tech, and a lot of people told us it's really difficult to predict violent behavior.",
        "I think we might even build a new one.",
        "Well, I think we see a couple of different extremes, Neal.",
        "We get one group of people saying after the fact, and we're hearing some of this in the last couple of weeks, that given what we think that we know now about what was going on with a particular case, we should have been able to predict a mass shooting, and we should have been able to prevent everything, or at the other end of the extreme, people who take a focus that we can't predict violence at all, so we shouldn't do anything.",
        "And I don't think either of those two extremes is particularly fruitful for us, and this is akin to what Talib(ph) called a black swan event, where after a highly improbable event that has a major impact, we like to think that we can, through hindsight, predict what's going on.",
        "And Talib's, I think, perspective, is very instructive, that that's not really the goal.",
        "The goal is to identify all the swans that may cause concern and identify areas of vulnerability.",
        "So as Talib says, you turn the black swans white."

        "Gregory Eells there at Cornell, I know you just started up a protocol.",
        "What's the goal there?",
        "Well, it's very much like what Gene has outlined.",
        "I think much of the armchair quarterbacking that you see after an incident like this really is misguided.",
        "I think the goal is to build systems where people are communicating with each other, where you don't fall in those two extremes, where you can really find people who may be at risk.",
        "A lot of time these efforts are about connecting people to support services and resources that may be helpful to them, where you can, as Gene said, turn the black swans to white swans.",
        "That's really what we're trying to do with our threat assessment protocol here, as well as our other teams that focus on student behavior.",
        "Well, give me a for instance.",
        "What kind of issues have you had to deal with?",
        "Well, you know, I think there you know, without getting into real specific cases, you know, dealing with issues around threats through electronic media, I think that's one that we look at, and to what extent those are viable threats.",
        "You know, Gene and I have presented together, and I think those kind of stated threats oftentimes are really not good predictors of actual threat.",
        "That's oftentimes more vague or troubling composites of behavior you may look at.",
        "So, you know, looking at some of those things that are more explicit, weighing out all the options and coming together as a collective team to really kind of weigh different pieces of information through what information the police may have, through my perspective as a licensed psychologist, through our university counsel's office, looking at the legal perspective, trying to come up with a collective decision that puts all those pieces of information together.",
        "When you say electronic media - email, Facebook, that sort of thing.",
        "Facebook, Twitter, yeah.",
        "A lot of times there will be threats that occur through those media, and I think, you know, many times you have some generational differences that students or people new to these media see them like diaries.",
        "So they're talking about things that they may think are much more private than they really are, when, you know, you or I may see them as, like, the New York Times."

        "Well, perceptions about privacy issues and misinterpretations of law in numerous instances have interfered, have been one piece that's interfered with people's willingness to report.",
        "I think if there's any telling lesson that is learned over the last few years is that these incidents are highly complex, and they're inter-relational and that no one person or department is likely to have the whole picture and certainly isn't likely capable of making sense of it by themselves.",
        "So as Greg was saying, as his team works, as the team does here at Tech, as it did at Iowa State, the focus is pulling together these what may appear to be disparate pieces and seeing if they form a coherent picture and then raising the more interesting and challenging questions of what can we do to mitigate the risk.",
        "Well, you're obviously one member of the threat assessment team there at Virginia Tech.",
        "You're the deputy chief of police at Virginia Tech.",

        "Many campuses have their mental health professionals, sometimes as their counseling service or health service professionals.",
        "For years, all the teams that I have served on has had HR representation, understanding that not all threats to colleges and universities are represented just by students, that faculty and staff and the hundreds of thousands, in many cases, of visitors that we get to campus can pose a threat to us.",
        "So our HR professionals, our academic colleagues that understand the nuances and fluctuations of the academic year, our broader student affairs professionals who, in residence and in conduct, who deal with students in other facets of their lives - our goal on a team is to identify people who are what I think Gladwell(ph) referred to as connectors, that are integrated into the community and that are good early gatekeepers of recognizing developing concerns.",
        "And do you think you have done that successfully?",
        "Well, that's one thing that you never really judge until after the fact, right?",
        "This is a process.",

        "Let me put that question again.",
        "Have you intervened in the case of a student or a visitor or a staff member, anybody, and said, well, maybe that was a really good idea?"
