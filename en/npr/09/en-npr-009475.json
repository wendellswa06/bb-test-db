        "I mean, I think, you know, oftentimes, you know, for example, if a student came in, and they were dealing with a departmental policy or even an employee that was dealing with a departmental policy, and that policy was very frustrating for them, maybe around something, a benefit they are entitled to.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And when you review that policy and you start to look at it, and you say, well, of course, this actually is very frustrating.",

        "The question is: Are they in a situation that may increase the likelihood of violence?",
        "That a lot of about what threat assessment is about is specifically looking at the situation.",
        "So if you put someone in a situation that's highly frustrating, and there maybe are some Kafka-esque procedures that would frustrate anybody, but someone with a very low frustration tolerance that's going to contribute to their likelihood of escalation and potential likelihood of violence that you would really look at those procedures, and someone coming from a threat assessment team would not just look at the individual but would look at - what are we doing institutionally that are going to increase the likelihood of people's frustration, may increase the likelihood of a bad outcome?",
        "So I think specific policies that are very Byzantine or really are putting a considerable, onerous burden on students or staff are things that the teams would look at, look at from a larger policy issue.",

        "And I think this is this topic is, it's pretty timely in a more general sense than beyond just the universities and colleges but in the society in general, where we're afraid to question and confront each other in a reasonable way, instead of saying well, I'm threatened by this person, or this person's making me uncomfortable, therefore, I'm going to have someone else deal with it rather than saying...",

        "Okay, and what kind of behavior did you find out later people took the wrong way?",
        "I guess I they found me intimidating and threatening.",

        "That may not have anything really to do with them, specifically, it just may be the stress I'm under.",

        "The vast majority of people are not violent people.",

        "And that's really the most caring response.",
