        "Well, I think Walter is right on the money.",
        "In fact, many of the models that we turned to at Iowa State back in the mid-1990s were based on what was happening in the larger industry, in the workplace violence models that were there, and ironically enough, some really outstanding work that was being done at the United States Postal Service through the 1980s, into the early 1990s.",
        "Many of the workplace violence prevention models, threat assessment teams, are based on those initial concepts, and they've been refined and enhanced with research and practice over time.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yes, hi.",
        "I'm here in Virginia.",
        "I'd prefer not to give the city because what I was calling about is we have threat assessment -actually I'm leaving school right now.",
        "We have a threat assessment program, I think that's what they call it at our school here in Virginia.",
        "But students that I have talked to have found it wholly I guess they would say wholly inadequate in terms of not that it's not that the program itself is completely flawed but that it's not enough for the students to feel safe, considering Virginia Tech, and so they conceal-carry.",
        "Conceal-carry weapons?",
        "Against, obviously, school policy, which is why I'd prefer not to discuss the school.",
        "No, I understand, but...",
        "But yeah, and I've seen guns.",
        "I've seen students who carry, and to be totally honest with you, having had in-depth discussions with students, it does scare you to the extent that I'm not scared of them.",
        "I'm scared of a repeat of Virginia Tech to the extent that I probably would be breaking school policy and carrying a gun if I didn't know that my friends already were.",
        "I don't have to break school policies or laws because I know other people already are, the point being that students on campuses, or campi I guess you would say..."

        "You are a student.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, that they don't feel safe, that they don't feel comfortable, and as your guests have pointed out, you know, these threat assessments, obviously they do work, but the problem is it's much like terrorism.",
        "It only takes one time for an incident to result in, you know, mass casualties, for example.",
        "And the question is whether you want to put your life in the hands of - you know, hoping that we get it right every time.",
        "My grandfather was a Keystone cop in Hollywood, one of the actors in the silent films era.",
        "And I remember watching on TV at Virginia Tech as a police officer ran back and forth looking at the building there in Virginia Tech, trying to decide how he was going to get in, and it just repeats in my mind over and over again.",
        "And I would not want to be in that position at the - just at the mercy and hope that everybody got it right.",
        "Well, let me ask first some response from our guest.",
        "Greg Eells?",
        "Well, I think one of the things the caller's talking about is our own feelings of safety, which is completely understandable.",
        "And again, I think some of that goes to how we think as human beings about risk.",
        "I mean, these kind of targeted violence events are very, very rare.",
        "You know, I think about it much like how we, you know, how we get afraid to fly when we ride in cars all the time and we're 10 - you know, thousands times greater risk.",
        "And the likelihood of something like that happening on a campus is pretty low.",
        "And carrying a firearm, you know, Gene knows as a police officer, doesn't make you safer.",
        "You're much more likely to shoot yourself or one of your friends.",
        "So, you know, I think I would, you know, challenge you to think about your own safety, think about some of the ways in which you can, you know, advocate within your school, within your system to make those -the kind of changes.",
        "I mean, Virginia mandates these teams on all of their state campuses.",
        "And I think in some ways having those teams is a very effective response.",
        "But is it going to make everyone safe all the time?",
        "No. Are you still going to feel unsafe at some point?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think using those specific instances to kind of generate a general strategy isn't necessarily effective.",
        "Gene Deisinger, do you think that there are kids who carry concealed weapons at Virginia Tech?",
        "Well, of course, they are.",
        "And Jeremy's comment illustrates that.",
        "Guns are now, and have been before the Virginia Tech incident, have been on campus.",
        "I don't think that that makes us any safer, frankly, but it certainly represents the fears are out there and some of the fear-driven responses.",
        "I mean, taking Greg's analogy in a little bit different way about flying, we know that occasionally, planes crash with catastrophic incident.",
        "And yet, I don't have any desire the next time I get on the plane to become the pilot to assure my own safety.",
        "And I think that the carrying of gun when you're not used to all the responsibility that comes with that and all the challenges that come with that is akin to trying to be a pilot when you're not used to flying a plane."

        "I'm not giving details, so as not to be identified.",
        "The student was military-obsessed, and believed he was part of an elite Special Forces intelligence unit.",
        "The police came.",
        "They determined he was not an immediate threat.",
        "He continued as a student with no psychological intervention.",
        "When I called to get my copy of the police report, I was told it would be ready in a few days.",
        "When I called back in a few days, I was told there was no police report because there was no serious incident.",
        "The union didn't do anything.",
        "I quit immediately, figuring it's best to disappear and get away from the student.",
        "I no longer teach on a college campus.",
        "It was an eye-opening experience.",
        "And no reason to believe, Gene Deisinger, he's talking about any of the places you have worked.",
        "But do you think that this former teacher acted the right way?",
        "Well, if what he's described is an accurate representation of what he faced, it's unfortunate.",
        "But it, again, illustrates that no one - and whether it's the police, whether it's the counseling department - by itself is likely able to fully assess whether a threat is present.",
        "My guess is - without knowing the situation that our writer is referencing there - is that police really probably looked at that as: Was a crime committed that they could do anything about?",
        "But that's a separate question in terms of whether or not there are interventions that can be done to mitigate the risk, regardless of whether there's a crime.",
        "Many police departments, such as the one I served on in Iowa State and the one at Tech, are focused on preventing crime to the extent that we can.",
        "And I think that's a more responsible position for law enforcement.",
        "But we do that in partnership with others across the - across our community.",
        "It wouldn't make that determination based solely on the law enforcement response.",
        "Okay.",

        "And one thing - I'd like to just add to that real quick.",
        "I think one of the reasons why these teams are effective is that it may not just - with these teams, it wouldn't just stop with this, that this threat may then be taken to some other to have some discussion about it.",
        "So something different may happen at a college or university - hopefully would happen at a college or university that has one of these threat-assessment teams.",

        "Hi.",
        "You know, I was a - an employee of the University of California for many years, mostly as a - an academic counselor.",
        "And in my experience, frustration is best dealt with with definite procedures that students know they can follow easily if they have a complaint or if they want to defend themselves from a complaint.",
        "And that usually involves two different points of view.",
        "And each point of view has to be - has to have an advocate, one on each side in order to calm the situation and present the facts impartially so that each person is treated impartially and the issues can be aired clearly.",
        "I think that's - I think it's vital.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And I think if students know that they have those options, things go a lot more smoothly.",
        "There's a lot less trouble.",
        "But the problem is this...",
        "Very quickly, if you would.",
        "...that this is expensive, that it takes time and money and energy, and there are very few bureaucracies who are willing, you know, who have the political will to diminish their own forceful manipulation of students."

        "Well, I think - I mean, he's right in the sense that having clear, transparent procedures where people know what's expected of them, they know how to ask for what they want, they know how to get what they want, they know how to find advocates in the system, I think, are essential.",
        "And being in an academic adviser role, that's definitely a role that our academic advisers play in advocating for students and helping them sort through what sometimes can be a bureaucracy at any institution for higher education, which can greatly increase people's frustration, which, you know, in some instances, is going to make someone potentially more likely to act out violently, even though - even that may be rare.",
