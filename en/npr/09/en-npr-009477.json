        "By some estimates, Sacramento has more trees per capita than any other city except Paris, and it's getting even greener.",

        "He's spearheading a new project called The Greenprint Initiative.",
        "The goal is to double the tree canopy in Sacramento and five neighboring counties over the next 40 years.",
        "According to a recent study by NASA, these trees can lower urban ground temperatures here by 36 degrees on a hot day, making the Sacramento summers actually quite pleasant.",
        "We always meet people in Sacramento that still do not have air conditioning on 110-degree days because they live beneath the canopy of the trees.",
        "And the more trees you plant, the more benefits.",
        "NASA scientists say if Sacramento doubled its tree canopy, it would improve air quality and cut the number of smoggy days in half.",
        "But Trethaway says getting these perks means planting big trees.",
        "We're underneath two pear trees right now that don't give a lick of shade compared to the large-canopy trees that we have been strolling under.",
        "And so this would not be the choose of trees in the future.",
        "According to the US Forest Service, a large-canopy tree will add $48 in benefits, saved in lower electricity use and improved air quality.",
        "A small tree, by comparison, saves only a dollar.",
        "But there are challenges to building a forest amidst a city.",
        "Trethaway points to a young sapling about five feet tall.",
        "Anything smaller in an urban setting--boy, they can get run over by skateboards, eaten up by dogs, run over by cars or lawn mowers and such.",
        "So you have to start with a pretty good size tree.",
        "Most trees are normally two to three years old when you put them in the ground.",
        "In that little clip of tape we just heard, you seemed pretty upbeat.",
        "It must have been much harder for you that year than you were letting on."
