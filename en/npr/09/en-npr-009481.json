        "In a very small minority of cases where officers overstep or misstep, we would agree that something needs to be done.",
        "But to just wholesale investigate police departments - trolling, in effect, for problems - is something that has a chilling effect on rank-and-file officers.",

        "We are doing no favors to law-abiding officers.",
        "We're doing no favors to communities by sweeping these challenges under the rug.",
        "And nowhere is that rug bigger than in the Big Easy, where Justice spent 11 months investigating the New Orleans Police Department.",
        "Here's what they found: widespread racial profiling, unconstitutional searches, and the failure to investigate rape and domestic violence.",
        "At a news conference in March, Perez blamed the paid detail system, a sort of sanctioned moonlighting by police officers, for much of the department's trouble.",
        "That detail system, in the opinion of one observer of the department, is the aorta of corruption in that department.",
        "Over the past few weeks, several officers in New Orleans have been put on leave in a widening scandal over those arrangements.",
        "Justice Department officials say they expect to reach a settlement agreement with the city by the end of the year.",
