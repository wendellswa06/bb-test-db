        "That's up from $6.55 an hour.",
        "Congress approved this wage hike two years ago, when the economy was in much better shape.",

        "How many people will this wage hike affect?",
        "The Labor Department says that roughly 5 million workers report that they currently get less than $7.25 an hour, so those people are going to be looking for a raise on Friday.",
        "But really, more people than that will be affected.",
        "You have to remember that the federal minimum wage really serves as a benchmark for the labor market.",
        "So, people who are earning up to, say, $9 an hour, they most likely will get raises this week, too, when their employers slide the whole pay scale up 70 cents.",
        "That's going to affect about 10.5 million more workers.",
        "You know, it doesn't sound like much on the one hand - 70 cents an hour - but that works out for a full-time worker to $112 a month.",
        "If you're living paycheck to paycheck, $112 a month - that could be the difference between the kids have milk and bread or they don't for that month.",
        "We mentioned the controversy over the wage hike.",

        "Some economists think it really does help the economy.",

        "Low-wage workers do not get a raise and put it under the mattress.",
        "Those new dollars circulate through the economy, and they can help a small restaurant owner, the corner gas station store, the dollar store, that kind of thing.",
        "But on the other side, economists are worried about the effect that this hike is going to have on small businesses.",
        "I mean, can they really afford to give raises to their workers, even if people begin to spend more money?",
        "Ah, the famous economist other hand.",
        "Lots of economists point out that businesses are hanging on a by a thread this year, and any increase in wages is not going to be a small matter for them.",

        "They looked at it, looked at it, looked at it and concluded it did no harm.",
        "It didn't help, it didn't hurt.",

        "And there were areas where we were just prohibited because the roads were so bad, the infrastructure just wasn't safe.",
        "So, we had to drive away from the area, and certainly we weren't going to go towards the nuclear plants.",
        "I gather that they have tried to keep people out and they've evacuated people who live anywhere near those plants now.",
        "Correct.",
        "Earlier in the day, the evacuations were only within about a three-mile radius of the nuclear plants near the coasts.",
        "And then later it was expanded to some 10 kilometers, 20 kilometers.",
        "The government continues to say that it is still not harmful; the amount of radiation leakage isn't to a point where people should be alarmed.",

        "And that raised some people's votes because Reid said he was delaying the vote because negotiations were making some headway.",
        "The key players in this latest attempt to rescue the country from default are Senate minority leader, Republican Mitch McConnell, and Vice President Joe Biden, the same two players who negotiated the deal that allowed the extension of the Bush tax cuts back in January.",
        "So, what do you know about the shape of this possible compromise?",
        "Well, it would raise the debt ceiling in two steps, an additional $1 trillion in spending cuts, allow the debt ceiling to go up by one trillion.",
        "Then there would be a second batch of spending cuts - $1.6 trillion - decided on by the end of the year but yet another bipartisan commission.",
        "And the biggest sticking point is what the enforcement mechanism would be to ensure that there's a second batch of $1.6 trillion in cuts.",
        "What if the bipartisan commission doesn't come up with the cuts, which presumably would be a combination of domestic cuts, entitlement changes and tax reforms?",
        "What would happen?",
        "What would be triggered?",
        "We're back to the same divide that's been there all along.",
        "Does this enforcement mechanism trigger just spending cuts and changes in entitlements or does it also force tax increases, which the Democrats are still demanding as a condition of their support in which the president has said represents the kind of balanced plan he was insisting on."
