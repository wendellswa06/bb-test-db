        "Now, this whole weekend has been an extraordinary spectacle in Washington.",
        "Who pays the political price for this?",
        "Well, everyone pays the price.",
        "Certainly the president has been hurt.",
        "His approval ratings has been steadily slipping - part of that's the economy, which hasn't shown any signs of improvement, but the debt ceiling standoff is also taking a toll.",
        "And, of course, many Democrats believe that's exactly the reason Republicans are being so recalcitrant, because Democrats say Republicans' first and foremost goal is to hurt the president or weaken his hand in the negotiations.",
        "In the latest Gallup poll, the president's approval rating is down to 40 percent.",
        "The only consolation for the president, of course, is that the approval ratings of Congress are much, much worse - 18 percent.",
        "What kind of toll do you think the drama in the House is taking on John Boehner?",
        "Watching him trying to get control of his caucus has been one of the most compelling parts of this.",
        "We need all the right people in the room to make sure that we can make a decision in time to move people out of harm's way, shelter them and everything else, getting everybody's attention focused, and strategies and driving programs and processes.",
        "This is no different.",
        "Yvette Howard(ph) says she has two fears.",
        "One is that the Democrats could lose the election if people vote against Obama because he's black.",
        "It was very difficult.",
        "The whole idea was that something would change.",
        "I think even at 14 and 15, we thought that we were there to make a great change, so we took that responsibility and kept it with us.",
        "Do you agree with the judge's decision yesterday to end federal supervision?",
        "No, I don't.",
        "I think if we consider public schools a social experiment, I guess this one failed.",
        "We don't see the screaming mobs today, but we are continuing to see school segregation based on color, class, ethnicity.",
        "And it's upheld by our institutions, including and especially the courts.",
        "And it's demoralizing.",
        "So why do you think integration efforts have failed?",
        "Well, we're still dealing with segregated neighborhoods and segregated head space.",
        "I think we haven't thought it out.",
        "We haven't changed what we believe."

        "When you look at Central High today, what is different and what is the same?",
        "Well, the word on the street is that Central High is segregated, that it's got a few black kids in AP classes and most of the black kids not.",
        "And again, we have separate and unequal.",
        "And you know, it's not really about Central.",
        "It's about the whole nation.",
        "I think we've spent more effort maintaining segregation than we ever did to create integration.",
        "So I've decided that based on my observation that segregation is probably one of the highest values in the United States.",
        "We've done a really good job at it.",
        "Minnie Jean Brown-Trickey was one of the Little Rock Nine.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us.",

        "Roy Brooks joins us now.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Why do you think its taken 50 years for your school district to be released from federal supervision?",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "A lot of hard work remains before us.",
        "Certainly we can be happy and we can celebrate this day, but we know that work still remains.",
        "There's as much as a 40 point difference between white students' scores and black students' scores on some standardized tests.",

        "When we look at the achievement gap that exists between advantaged and disadvantaged youngsters, yes, it's something that we need to work on nationally and we're certainly going to do our hardest here in Little Rock to close it.",
        "And how is the school district different now than it was 50 years ago?",
        "Well, it's different in the demographics.",
        "Fifty years ago, only 28 percent of the youngsters in our public schools were black.",
        "Today, 68 percent of the youngsters in the Little Rock school district are black.",
        "So it's changed over the years, yes.",
        "And so what will the lifting of federal oversight mean for how you can supervise the school district?",
        "Well, I think that the federal court has given this school district back to the people of this community.",
        "We gratefully accept this challenge and we'll do everything we can to help the children of this community.",

        "Thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ever since the founding fathers carved the boundaries of the District of Columbia out of a swamp on the Potomac, Washingtonians have been without a vote in Congress.",
        "People who lived here at the time, a very small number, were disenfranchised almost immediately.",
        "And the residents were very surprised, as were other Americans.",
        "I think there was an assumption that the Congress would provide for DC residents.",
        "Ilir Zherka heads a group called DC Vote.",
        "He says that Washington DC's situation has been one of historic humiliation - no vote in Congress, no vote for president until 1961, limited power of the purse.",
        "But now those pushing for a DC vote on the House floor say that this should be the year that it happens."

        "Now that Congress is ruled by Democrats, the party that supported DC voting rights for years, one would think a DC vote in the house would be a done deal.",
        "Virginia Republican Congressman Tom Davis and DC Democratic Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton drafted a bill they thought no one could oppose.",
        "It would give the district a voting member of Congress and also give Utah another House seat, which the state just missed getting after the last census.",
        "Utah feels aggrieved for 10 years.",
        "We feel aggrieved for 200, and that's a perfect match.",
        "Norton says neither Republicans nor Democrats should object to the Bill - since Utah is a red state and DC is blue, it wouldn't change the balance of power.",
        "But giving Utah another House seat means it also gets another vote in the electoral college.",
        "DC already has three, so that wouldn't change, but Utah's vote troubles some high-ranking Democrats, especially Henry Waxman of California, whose committee has jurisdiction over the bill.",
        "He says it could give Republicans the edge in the next presidential election.",
        "There have been a number of scenarios where the elections have been - for president in the electoral college have been so close that one could imagine that to have been the case.",

        "Yes.",
        "Compelling like a train wreck at some times, but just like the president's Speaker Boehner comes out of this a weakened leader.",
        "He went from trying to negotiate a grand bargain with the president to moving drastically to the right to get the debt ceiling bill through the House.",
        "And the deal he passed is so much farther from the center than the deal he was talking about with the president.",
        "Now, there's an open question if there's any kind of compromise bill he could actually pass through the House.",
        "There is a real risk to the speaker in becoming captive to the Tea Party base of his party.",
        "And don't forget, in order to get the support of enough Tea Party Republicans, he had to put a provision in that bill that Congress has to pass a balanced budget amendment before the debt ceiling could be raised - not just vote on it but pass it, and that takes two-thirds of both chambers of Congress.",
        "That means the debt ceiling will never be raised.",
        "Now that Boehner's in negotiations with the Senate and the White House on something that presumably could pass both houses and be signed by the president, his new bottom line seems to be that he needs to get a majority of his majority.",
        "He wants a majority of Republicans to vote for it.",
        "The first bill he passed on Friday only had Republican votes.",
        "That means he has to get the rest of the votes from Democrats.",
        "And we're back to the same old problem we talked about before, which is what will have to be in this compromise for Nancy Pelosi to help John Boehner get it passed.",
        "Even the very conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page weighed in about the behavior of House Republicans yesterday in an editorial, when it said, quote, \"\"Republicans are not looking like adults to whom voters can entrust the government."
