        "When pyrethroids were originally approved for use, it was assumed that they wouldn't hurt aquatic life.",
        "That's because they don't persist in the water column.",
        "Pyrethroids are, however, drawn to sediments like a magnet, and there they do persist.",
        "That's a problem for the tiny mud-dwelling critters that live there, and potentially for the fish that eat those critters.",
        "Weston has taken hundreds of samples of sediments in both rural agricultural creeks and urban creeks.",
        "He says fewer than 20 percent of the rural streams were toxic because of pyrethroids.",
        "His urban samples are a different story.",
        "Sixty-five, 70 percent of them are toxic in the urban environment, and there's enough pyrethroids to explain the toxicity in every single one of them.",
        "In urban streams like this one, he says the toxicity isn't caused by big industry or farms.",
        "It's mom and dad and two kids and a dog."
