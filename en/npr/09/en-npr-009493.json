        "In Massapequa Park, Verizon found a friendly mayor, and secret deliberations led to a special deal that hurts consumers.",
        "Cablevision critics say the suit and the fliers are simply an effort to fend off competition.",
        "Verizon spokesman Thomas Dunn(ph) says Cablevision is trying to send a message to other local communities that they'd better not let Verizon in.",
        "The lawsuit is an intimidation tactic.",
        "It's nothing more, nothing less.",
        "And, you know, we're dedicated.",
        "We will break up the cable monopolies and provide choice and competition to the people.",
        "And Verizon officials say Cablevision's tactics are a little ironic since Cablevision has been doing some expanding of its own.",
        "The company is now selling voice telephone services over its cable lines, directly encroaching on Verizon's market.",
        "But Cablevision says it's Verizon that wants to thwart competition by throwing its considerable weight around.",
        "Verizon angered some local officials on Long Island by installing its network without getting permission first.",
        "Anthony Panzarella, the mayor of the town of Malverne, has been a sharp critic of the company.",
        "(Soundbite of traffic)",
        "I think that was the wrong way for them to go.",
        "They should have approached the village first.",
        "Instead, they came in like a bunch of storm troopers and were trying to take over the village with all this wire and boxes.",
        "Panzarella acknowledges that Verizon has tried to make amends since then, and has been much better about consulting with local towns.",
        "But Verizon has since done something that angers local officials even more.",
        "It's lobbying for the right to sign cable contracts on a state or federal level.",
        "That means it would no longer have to negotiate individual agreements with every local community.",
        "And Panzarella says the change would strip town officials of any control over cable systems.",
        "Right now, if I have a problem with Cablevision, for instance, I could pick up the phone and call the local government liaison and say, `Hey, Jack, you know, we're having a problem.",
        "We're getting complaints from our residents.",
        "Take care of it.",
        "And usually within 24 hours the problem is taken care of.",
        "I'd like to see that happen if I had to call Washington.",
        "Cablevision's defenders also note that the cable company had to spend years painstakingly working out contracts with every local town it serves, and they say letting Verizon come in now and negotiate national contracts would give it an unfair advantage.",
        "One thing that most people agree on is that the fliers and the lawsuit are unlikely to stop Verizon's entry into the cable market.",
        "Another suburb north of New York recently approved a contract with Verizon and the company is set to begin offering cable service next year.",
        "Even Verizon's critics say more competition is badly needed in the cable market, and if Verizon can make a go of it, few people really want to prevent it from doing so.",

        "There'd been enormous amount of contracts, and you think of telephones and underground electricity and streetcar lines, and the opportunities for, shall we say, incentive payments, unofficial incentive payments, sometimes called graft, those opportunities were very dramatic, and San Franciscans were deeply divided about this.",

        "Mr. Fradkin is with us here today.",
        "Thanks very much for joining us.",
        "Nice to be here.",
        "Now, what was the political scene like in San Francisco back in 1906 before the earthquake, and how did that event fold into this development, well, we see the progressive movement existed before 1906?",
        "As Kevin just said, Phelan was in office.",
        "He went out of office.",
        "Mayor Eugene Schmitz came in on a pro-labor government, and just before the earthquake struck, there had been, there was some move by the progressives to, in fact, dethrone Schmitz through graft prosecution charges.",
        "That hadn't gotten underway.",
        "And then, again, as Kevin says, the fabric was torn apart.",
        "It wasn't only the tear in the earth, it was in the social, political, and economic fabric of the city, and I would maintain it remains torn apart to this very day.",
        "When the ceremonies that took part at Lotta's Fountain were more an orgy of self-congratulations than a dealing with reality.",
        "(Soundbite of audience laughter)",
        "So what happens after the earthquake is that the progressives use this as a chance to gain power, and they do gain political power.",
        "Now the Chinese have a long history of earthquakes—13 million people killed over some 3,000 years—and they know, in fact, that when there's a large natural disaster, there's a regime change, and they're very careful during those times.",
        "And this was a regime change on a local, civic level.",
        "And it was a fascinating thread to watch, the affect of landscape, meaning nature, on human history, destiny, character and culture.",

        "The speaker was speaking about the maritime origins of the city of San Francisco, and I was wondering if he'd like to consider the evolution of the relationship of trade with the Pacific Northwest, the Maritime regions, Puget Sound and as far north as Sitka, Alaska, insofar as it's my understanding that the trade name for Sitka spruce, a tree that grows in that region, evolved as a result of the spike in demand for building materials after the earthquake.",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Okay, thanks for the call.",
        "Kevin Starr, I mean --",
        "Well, I think he's mentioned something very important, and that's the establishment in the early 1800s of Astoria, on the cost of Oregon, that would be a trade for the Asia-Pacific basin.",
        "There was always the belief too, that there was some river, it was called Son Bella Ventura(ph), it didn't exist.",

        "So the maritime origins were there from the beginning.",
        "The first Americans to come to California, came on the Lady Washington, the Otter, that was the sea trade that came around the Horn to California and then went across the Asia-Pacific Basin.",
        "And if you go back even further, to the Spanish Era, California is brought into being in part because of the Pacific ambitions of the Spanish Empire.",
        "The crossing of New Spain into the Philippines, in the 1560s and 70s.",
        "So at the core of this sort of DNA code of San Francisco, to this, well, not to this day, because our maritime excellence is shared with Oakland and other places, now.",
        "But up until certainly well into the 20th century, San Francisco was a port, and as a port city, was a maritime colony, and as such had a very high level of civic development civic institutions, and an almost narcissistic self-esteem.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Can't imagine where that's gone away to.",
        "Mr.",
        "Fradkin, let me ask you, though, this development of progressivism.",
        "How did San Francisco, the events here, propel progressivism around the country?",
        "Well you talked earlier about a local effect and an international effect.",
        "In terms of a local effect, there was a graft prosecution, which I think of more as a graft persecution afterwards.",
        "It was aimed at economic rivals, it was undertaken by Rudolph Spreckels, by James Phelan, by Fremont Older and a number of other progressives.",
        "It's somewhat in league with President Theodore Roosevelt.",
        "And it was aimed at getting economic and social and ethnic rivals out of the way.",
        "So what happens is that they take advantage of this dramatic event.",
        "And, in fact, the civic government is turned over to progressives and Phelan boasts, in fact, that he determines policy in his office.",
        "And James Phelan and Hiram Johnson, who was in fact one of the prosecutor/persecutors, go on to become United States Senators.",
        "So that's the local and national legacy.",
        "The international legacy is the racism that takes part afterwards.",
        "Not so much aimed at the Chinese, but at the Japanese, which is really virulent and physical, endangers this country's security.",
        "And Theodore Roosevelt says, what are those damn fools doing out there?",
        "My friends are progressives.",
        "They're running us into a war with Japan.",
