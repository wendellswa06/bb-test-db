        "What were their numbers?",

        "Thanks for having me.",
        "What was life like for San Francisco's Chinese population in the early 1900s?",
        "Well by 1906, the Chinese had been in San Francisco for over 50 years.",
        "And initially they had been welcomed in the city and could go and live anywhere.",
        "And as racism and discrimination increased, the Chinese converged on the area around Portsmouth Square, and what we know today as Chinatown grew up around Portsmouth Square.",
        "And in '06, it was a vibrant, vital community made up of residences, businesses, and it was a mixed neighborhood.",
        "There were African Americans in the neighborhood, there were Japanese in the neighborhood, as well as Chinese.",
        "And so while the Chinese endured the discrimination, they were able to find a safe haven inside Chinatown.",

        "Well the people dispersed.",
        "You've got to remember in '06 that there were Chinese families in Chinatown and many of the women of the merchants had bound feet.",
        "So as they were fleeing Chinatown, it was very difficult to get these women out of Chinatown into safety.",
        "They could barely walk on flat land, let alone up and down the hills of San Francisco.",
        "And as the fires approached Chinatown, they came from the east, uphill, and so you had to flee uphill to get around the fires.",
        "So what to us would take, you know, a few minutes to walk up a hill, it took them almost the entire day to get up to safety.",
        "One other question, and then we'll get to questions from the people in the audience.",
        "But, that is that the fire destroyed so many records of Chinese immigrants, and this was a time when it was extremely difficult to get into the country.",
        "You needed some sort of paper documentation saying one of your relatives was already here.",
        "And all of a sudden, anybody who could say, well of course, the records that burned up showed that I'm perfectly legitimate.",
        "As workers hit the picket line, GM issued this statement read by company's spokeswoman Katie McBride.",
        "That's right.",
        "Well it didn't happen right away.",
        "The records of City Hall burned to a crisp, and what happened was, over time, people realized that they could claim citizenship without having to prove anything.",
        "They could say, well, the burden is on you to prove that my records weren't burned in City Hall.",
        "So I think that's a more lasting repercussion of the earthquake.",
        "It wasn't an immediate, you know, you didn't have automatic citizens the day after the quake.",
        "Right.",
        "This dawned on people a little bit later.",
        "Anyway, let's, I got another question from here in the audience in the audience in San Francisco.",
        "Hi, I'm Nancy, and my question is, how much did graft and corruption contribute to the inability to stop the fire?",
        "Hmm.",
        "Philip Fradkin?",
        "Not at all.",
        "It was just a matter of inefficiency and bad judgment.",
        "The third factor, there's fire, there's earthquake, first of all, then there's fire, and then there's dynamiting.",
        "Indiscriminate.",
        "Using the wrong explosives.",
        "Unfortunately there wasn't water and the natural response to that is to do something.",
        "So there was a great deal of explosives stored in the Bay area, because we had just come off the Spanish American War and the Philippine Campaign, and there was a lot of mining going on in the Sierra Nevada, and they grabbed--everyone grabbed, firemen, army soldiers, civilians, whomever, just grabbed as much explosives as they could lay their hands on and use it indiscriminately and in the wrong way and just spread the fire.",
        "So that was not a matter of graft.",
        "It was just bad judgment."

        "As Simon is also with us here today on the panel.",
        "Good to see you Simon.",
        "And you, too.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me ask you, in addition to some of the physical and demographic questions, there were spiritual, intellectual changes as a result of the 1906 quake.",
        "Yes I'd rather like to ratchet the conversation down a level or two and talk about the high degree of testosterone in San Francisco.",
        "This was although as Kevin says, a maritime city.",
        "It was also a city populated by miners, I mean, miners with an e--and who had come here without their families and were, I mean, basically--I think I can use the phrase on NPR the FCC is, I'm sure, listening--But they were a fairly horny crowd of chaps.",
        "And so, ladies of easy virtue flocked into San Francisco and the town that resulted had all, you know, Sitka spruce and stuff like that, but it also had brothels a-plenty and very dubious bars and this wonderful hotel which I'm so sorry was a victim of the 1906 quake, the 1,000-room hotel Nymphomania, which also, I'm afraid, was burned to a crisp.",
        "But this did have a salutary effect when it came to the reaction to the earthquake.",
        "And it came about in a rather peculiar way.",
        "Because, at the same time, well in the early part of the 20th century, there was a very energetic evangelical Christian movement working it's way westwards from where it was founded in Topeka, Kansas.",
        "And it fetched up in a little church in Los Angeles, which in 1906 was a town of only 40,000 people, on a street called Azusa Street.",
        "A to Z USA.",
        "A to Z U.S.A., precisely.",
        "And the preacher there, a Reverend Parham, was on the 15th, Sunday the 15th, preaching to a group of assembled people who believed that the lord manifested himself by extraordinary behavior among the congregation.",
        "They would either fall to the floor and foaming at the mouth or speaking in gibberish, or speaking foreign languages that they had hitherto known not-at-all before.",
        "So all this went on, on the 15th of April, but the Reverend Parham got up and said, this is all very spectacular, and it does display that the lord is here and manifesting himself, but there's going to be something more dramatic in the next few days.",
        "And there was a reporter there from the Los Angeles Times.",
        "And on Monday, the 16th of April, 1906, there's a report in the L.A.",
        "Times, wonderfully prescient, which says, Local pastor predicts major sign from God imminent.",
        "And 3 days later, the most sinful, testosterone-rich city in all of America was destroyed in 42 seconds of ground shaking and an avenging angels fire, which came down in put an end to it all.",
        "And the following week, the following Sunday, whereas 200 had turned up on the 15th, on the 22nd, something like 10,000 people crowded into this little church to see the pastor with a rather smug expression on his face, saying essentially, from the pulpit, I told you so.",
        "And with that was born the Azusa Street revival, and with that revival, a Seminole moment in the history of Fundamentalist Christianity in this country, was born the Pentecostalist church, which has such, you know, intellectually splendid creatures as Jimmy Swaggart and Tammy Faye Baker and Pat Robinson.",
        "All the legatees, in a peculiar way, of the San Francisco earthquake.",
        "And one might look further to the political consequences of fundamentalist Christianity in this country and wonder the extent to which in fact San Francisco is to blame."
