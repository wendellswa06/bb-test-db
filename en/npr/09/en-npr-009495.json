        "And actually, the opium dens were also a tourist attraction to Chinatown.",

        "They did all take off.",
        "Kevin is a greater expert on this than I am, but they took off and went, essentially, to Carmel by the Sea.",
        "And so all the painters and many of the writers who had made a considerable name for themselves in Fantasy Ecla(ph) San Francisco, took to their heels and didn't really come back until Howl was published in the 1950s.",
        "It was a half century long dearth of artistic and intellectual energy in San Francisco.",
        "There was an attempt.. There was a publishing company set up with a wonderful name, something-opolis.",

        "Well, I think that, when we say what a city is, we say it's a physical thing.",
        "It's an economic thing.",
        "But a city also has to be imagined.",
        "A city is a moral community.",
        "It's an imaginative construct.",
        "And that's why, for instance, writers play an important role and Simon's very correct saying that the writers left.",
        "Writers play an important role.",
        "You can't see Paris without seeing it partly through Balzac or London without seeing it through Dickens or Chicago without seeing it through Dreiser, because cities have to be imagined.",
        "And the thing that did not go wrong with San Francisco, and I'm a great admirer of Philip Fradkin's book in showing a number of things that did go wrong, but something that didn't go wrong was that San Francisco didn't lose an imaginative sense of itself.",
        "It was impoverished.",
        "It was embattled.",
        "It was confused.",
        "But it was still there.",
        "And that, that's the crisis, I think, with New Orleans.",
        "New Orleans had reached a point of development a long time ago, if you think of New Orleans before the Civil War as a great entrepole(ph) for the cotton, cotton industry in the South, ect.",
        "And then it went into this mode of just reflecting upon itself in terms of tourism, ect.",
        "Incidentally, tourism became the lead element in the San Francisco economy from 1962, so there's that parallel there.",
        "So, I think the combination of New Orleans and San Francisco is that somehow San Francisco recovered itself.",
        "It recovered its image of itself, rematerialized itself, and we're still waiting now for that process to occur in New Orleans or even to begin.",
        "A friend of mine, Joe Cockin(ph), his new book on cities, says it can take, from this level of catastrophe, it can take up to, from 10 to 20 years for a city to resuscitate itself.",
        "From that perspective, the oligarchy that had not handled the fighting of the fires so well, certainly by 1909 had rebuilt the city within the Portola Exped—-Portola Exposition celebrated that.",
        "So that was remarkable.",
        "San Francisco having, as I said…",
        "I mean, here's a city after all that was only found in its American format by, in 1847.",

        "My great grandfather came from Ireland in 1852.",
        "My other great grandfather came from Rhode Island a few years later.",
        "That sense of community, imaginative apprehension of San Francisco, was there when it was needed."

        "As far as Lloyds of London was concerned, a great hero was a man called Cuthbert Heath, who--because a great deal of insurance was underwritten in London, he sent a telegram, which is contrast to Phil Fradkin's infamous document, this is one of the documents of which the insurance industry, which is in my view not an industry that ever does anything particularly nice, can be proud of.",
