        "It made technical errors in testing and analyzing results.",
        "And the majority on the panel today, those voting guilty, said the initial test on Landis' sample - that's a measure of the ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone - that was not done according to established rules.",
        "But the second test, a more precise one, which can detect synthetic testosterone, that test was accurate and it was enough to establish an anti-doping rule violation.",
        "Now, the dissenter on the panel, Arbitrator Chris Campbell, said the errors were enough to overwhelm everything else, and he said Landis should be found innocent.",
        "So the arbitrators did acknowledge that there were some flaws in the system of testing.",
        "Yeah, they did and, although, as I mentioned, the majority says it was still clear that Landis had used a banned substance.",
        "The majority did issue a warning to the French lab and I, quote, the panel finds that the practices of the lab in training its employees appears to lack the vigor the panel would expect in the circumstances given the enormous consequences of athlete - consequences to athletes of an adverse analytical finding.",
        "If such practices continue, it may well be that in the future, an error like this could result in the dismissal of a positive finding by the lab.",
