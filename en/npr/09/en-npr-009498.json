        "Yeah, so I'm hoping we were insulated.",
        "If we dismissed all the tickets written that day, then we would have to automatically give refunds to anyone who got a ticket for any reason all day and that's, you know, $60,000 coming out of the city budget.",

        "It has to be within what, six blocks of a voting center and during voting hours, right?",

        "So I'm going to give a refund personally.",

        "Sounds like if people had taken your advice, maybe you wouldn't be out so much money for parking tickets right now.",
        "That's true but the way to look at it is to say thank goodness I did that ad or else I may be writing a larger check for more parking tickets."
