        "Which is bad, right?",
        "Well, given what we know today, a breakfast of just this kind of sugary cereal is not the way to start the day, and here's why.",

        "OK.",
        "This is how you make flour or wheat cereal.",
        "When bread makers or cereal makers refine these little kernels, they've basically got two options.",
        "They can use the whole thing including the little tiny germ that's inside that's packed with all of the good stuff - so folate, magnesium, protein, fiber.",
        "Or they can refine it out and just leave the starchy part, which doesn't have as much nutrition.",
        "And what's left moves through our bodies really quickly and can spike blood sugar.",
        "I spoke to David Ludwig of Harvard Medical School, and here's how he explains the potential problem.",
        "It's not a coincidence that the obesity epidemic got its start as we began replacing the typical higher-fat, higher-protein meals and breakfasts in our diet with all of these processed carbohydrates.",
        "Oh, God.",

        "Well, hang on here.",
        "Now, we're told that breakfast is the most important meal, right?",
        "Yeah."
