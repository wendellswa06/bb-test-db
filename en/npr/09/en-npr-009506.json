        "I'm pretty sure I heard a blue-gray gnatcatcher there in the background just hissing away a little bit.",
        "That would have been my second guess.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "But you won't be hearing either of those birds singing right now.",
        "It'll be a few more weeks, as the days get longer, before the birds start singing again.",
        "Are we seeing anything unusual, any - more birds like the snowy owl from last year?",
        "Have we seen a flock of birds coming in?",
        "Yes, Ira, you remember last year was the snowy owl invasion.",
        "Well, we have new birds invading from the north this year.",
        "But this year they are the coniferous cone specialists.",
        "So we have an invasion of crossbills, redpolls, grosbeaks and the like.",
        "When you say it's an invasion, could we actually see that in our home birdfeeders?",
        "Absolutely, and it's an interesting story.",
        "So in some ways it's the same as the owls that the food crop that they're relying on, in the owls' case it was lemmings, in this case it's the seed crops of the coniferous forests, they don't do well, and birds, say red crossbills from the Pacific Northwest, they're such good flyers that it makes sense for them in a bad year to fly all the way to Alleghany, Pennsylvania, the coast of Massachusetts, to Sacramento, California, and the like.",
        "It's just amazing that they can travel that easily.",
        "David, other than the finches, are there any other bird species that you'll be keeping an eye on?"

        "Well, just one more finch I'd like to mention, the Pine Siskin, has moved in really big numbers out of the northern forests this winter, and we're seeing them in all of the lower 48 states, which is a pretty eruption year.",
        "Another species, though, not one of the finches, that we're keeping an eye on is called the Eurasian collared dove, and the name might be a pretty good clue that it doesn't belong here in North America.",
        "It was introduced down in South Florida back in the 1980s, and it's made a really remarkable conquest of North America in the last decade, moving from Florida to Alaska, and is now becoming one of the more common feeder birds that many people see across the country.",
        "Is this a consequence of global warming, where the seasons are changing a little bit or the climate for these birds?",
        "The dove example is basically an introduction of a novel species to a new place where it finds a welcoming niche.",
        "It does really well in highly modified human landscapes, and it's taking advance of that all across the country.",
        "And it'll be really interesting to see how this Eurasian collared dove interacts with our native dove species, like the mourning dove, it's about 10 percent bigger than the mourning dove, as it continues to move across the country and grow in population size.",
        "Let's go to Midland, Texas.",

        "Yes hi, Ira, appreciate you taking my call.",
        "Yeah, I wish I could have gotten to redbird first.",
        "But no my question is how come Redbirds down here, cardinals as they say up north, have moved so far, like up into Canada?",
        "I mean, they used to just be down South.",
        "Now they seem like they're all over the place.",
        "Is it climate change?",
        "Good question.",
        "Gentlemen?",
        "I'd say the typical answer - I'd be curious to hear David's response, too, is that it's a mixture of things.",
        "We're certainly getting much more mild winters, but climate change is showing in the wintertime that lots of - the center of ranges of birds are moving north.",
        "Upwards of 40 percent of the birds are moving north.",
        "But there are also a lot of people feeding birds.",
        "So they're able to persist in inclement weather further north than they could if that supplemental feeding wasn't there.",
        "And the bird count, is it all over the world or just in the Western Hemisphere, or where are the concentrations of folks?"

        "By and large it's in the United States and Canada, but we are expanding ever southwards.",
        "Last year was the first time we had a Cuba count.",
        "There's three going on right about now.",
        "So we can expand a lot more into Central and South America, and that will be very important for us to get a full picture for the full bird ranges in the winter.",
        "We have a tweet coming in from Joe Walker(ph).",
        "He says: Here in Minnesota I've noticed what appears to be an increasing number of mallards, which are not migrating.",
        "Is this widespread, or is it increasing?",
        "Do you know of what he speaks?",
        "Yeah, a number of the water fowl, Canada geese are another really great example of that, a species that tends to not be migrating as far as it used to, and you end up with relatively large flocks of resident birds staying in northern states and in southern Canada throughout the wintertime, as long as there's some open water available.",
        "So yeah, that's definitely another trend that we're seeing, along with species like the cardinals and the tufted titmice and the Carolina wrens moving their ranges to the north.",

        "We feed our bluebirds mealworms, live mealworms every morning.",
        "And it's just been a great thrill.",
        "Did you try to attract them?",
        "Were you shooting for - wrong choice of words, but were you trying to attract the bluebirds?",
        "No, actually I've just kind of been a bird enthusiast, and I saw them in my neighborhood.",
        "So I went to my local Wildbirds Unlimited store, no plug on them intended.",
        "But I did get a bluebird house, and sure enough, I've had like three or four, I think four nests built.",
        "And now I've got like six or seven bluebirds that frequent my backyard.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "We also had an early eruption of Red-breasted Nuthatches in the state."

        "Absolutely.",
        "You can pick birdhouses that have the right width of hole and size that can encourage groups of birds.",
        "So if you got a really big one, and you had the right area, you might get a wood duck or whatnot.",

        "Yeah, we are actually seeing a bit of a range expansion of blue jays into the Pacific Northwest.",
        "We have a number of sights now as far west as Washington state where blue jays are showing up.",
        "So bird ranges are not static.",
