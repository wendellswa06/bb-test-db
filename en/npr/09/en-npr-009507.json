        "Why are we seeing so many birds coming south, you know, from those areas in the Arctic?",
        "That was a tweet that just came in.",
        "So the answer to that is, as I was alluding to a little bit earlier, that these seed-eating birds tend to be specialized on one or a few kinds of pine cones.",
        "And so when that tree is having a bad year, they'll come south.",
        "And what's interesting is it happens every, you know, three to six years for each species that sometimes, they'll just naturally co-occur.",
        "So I think it was in '97, '98, we had lots of species doing it."
