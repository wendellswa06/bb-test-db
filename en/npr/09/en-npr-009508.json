        "Hey.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Similar to the, I think, your first caller, I've been raising bluebirds, actually, for about - not raising.",
        "I've been hosting bluebirds for about 17 years on my back deck.",
        "Every single year, they will have a brood in one box.",
        "And then when they're done, they'll move over to the next box and have another brood.",
        "If anything happens to that second brood, if it's early enough, they'll actually have a third brood, and I believe it's all the same couple.",
        "But my question is, this time of year, I see seven, eight, sometimes more - typically, five or six, though - but sometimes seven, eight bluebirds coming and checking up the (technical difficulties) for the springtime.",
        "And I'm wondering, is it - do you think that they would be the same birds?",
        "Or would they be the children or the offspring of those birds (unintelligible)?",
        "And how long do they live?",
        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR.",
        "Well, what about the answer to that?",
        "Do they check out on new real estate, the same birds or the...",
        "Bluebirds do tend to form small, winter-foraging flocks.",
        "So they'll move around in groups of five to 10 birds.",
        "And they do tend to be fairly resident, as long as there are enough resources there in the form of fruit.",
        "On fruiting shrubs, they can stay even in cold places all winter long, and they'll continue to check out the boxes and sometimes even roost in the boxes at night.",
        "I swore last year, when we lost the leaves - well, not this year, but last year -that I saw this - the tree must have been 200 feet high, but at the top, looked like - I would only describe it as a turkey vulture.",
        "Would they - because there was this giant vulture-looking-like bird, you know, in Connecticut where I live.",
        "I couldn't believe it could be it.",
        "Could that have been it?",
        "Because I couldn't think of anything else it could have been.",
        "Gentlemen?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Turkey vultures are certainly found in Connecticut, probably year-round.",
        "A few hearty, turkey vultures could over-winter in the state of the Connecticut.",
        "And there's another vulture called the black vulture, which you're just about at the northern extent of the range for that species.",
        "But that's another possibility.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let me go to - speaking of turkeys, let me go to this call quickly - Ed in Putnam Valley, New York.",
        "Hi, Ed.",
        "Hi.",

        "Yeah.",

        "In the 1930s, they were endangered, going extinct.",
        "And groups like Audubon, Christmas Bird Count and agencies banded together, and, you know, that's a modern day success story.",

        "And we're in our 26th season of FeederWatch.",
        "And it engages people to watch what's going on at their own backyard birdfeeders, follow a pretty simple protocol for counting the birds that are coming to their feeders, and sending that information to us.",
        "And it runs from November to April each winter.",

        "Yeah, that's a challenge these days.",
        "A lot of the birding clubs out there tend to be, you know, more older folks, not a whole lot of kids hanging out in the bird clubs.",
        "But we do have a program called the Young Birders Event at Cornell University, at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology each year, where we bring in some of these really keen, young birders from across the country to visit the lab and learn about all the work that we do, all the research we do there at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.",
        "And many of those students end up applying to and coming to Cornell and getting involved in research right out of high school.",
        "That's fantastic.",
        "When does that take place, and how can I find out about it?",
        "Because my father-in-law went to Cornell.",
        "So it would be easy to persuade the family to make a big trip."
