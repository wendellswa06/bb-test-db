        "What are you going to ask?",
        "We'll be looking at subjects such as the president's debt and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election, the president's compliance with financial disclosure laws, the president's potential and actual conflicts of interests, the president's business practices and the Trump International Hotel in Washington.",

        "But our jurisdiction - and the main thing that my committee is for is making sure that government functions properly.",
        "But is there a risk of it looking like Democrats are determined to just keep digging through the tawdry chapters of the president's life - testimony about a porn star and a Playboy model - instead of exercising serious oversight over his administration?"

        "Yeah.",
        "But my point is, what are we supposed to do, sit back on our hands when we see that there may be problems in the executive branch, when the Constitution clearly states that it is our job?",

        "And I must say that I doubt it.",
        "Basically...",
        "So you're saying you think in the Senate they will vote to block him from using emergency powers.",

        "We're talking about accountability.",
        "That's why we have courts.",
        "And you have a number of senators who'll be running in 2020, and they're going to have to be answerable to the people when the people ask, why did you allow the president to take away your power?",
        "When we give the president the opportunity to go around the Congress, that is basically taking away the power of the Congress, and it also is taking away the power of the people.",
        "That is Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings.",
        "He chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and he'll be leading the questions for Michael Cohen come Wednesday morning.",
