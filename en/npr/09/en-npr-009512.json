        "I'm glad you asked that question, because I think, if there's - you know, that's probably the biggest theme of the book.",
        "I think if there's one thing that people underestimate about black kids and black boys going to school in cities, they really underestimate how violence completely changes how you look at everything.",
        "It's very hard to sit in class, and I'm you know, even if I had have been a white kid, you know, wherever I would have been, I don't know that I would have been much different.",
        "You know, I didn't do well in school, and I you know had really, really good parents.",
        "But having said that, having said that, I think people really underestimate how violence just completely re-orients how little black boys and you know, as they grow to you know, bigger black boys and into black men, look at life, look at school.",
        "I mean, if one of your big concerns about getting to school is how to get their safely, I wonder how much time you're going to have to think about algebra to think about Shakespeare.",
        "What about your friend Fruity (ph), who was someone who took a different approach to trying to deal with the violence than you?",
        "How did you each approach that issue?",
        "Fruity was a lot like me, but I think something happened earlier in his life where it became very clear to him that there's a time to negotiate and there's some things that just can't be negotiated, you know.",
        "And he was one of these guys who, when he was threatened, his, you know, response was always, you know, self-defense.",
        "And he didn't care how many people it was, because, you know, he understood.",
        "I was - and as I portray myself in the book, you know - I was much more of a talker, you know, I wanted to talk my way - I would have, you know, done anything to avoid conflict.",
        "And what he taught me - and this has really been a life lesson - some conflicts, you know, can't, they just be, they can't be avoided.",
        "It's like that great Churchill quote, you know, you sought to avoid war and disgrace and now you'll have both.",
        "I'm getting that wrong, but it's paraphrased, it's something like that.",
        "And he understood that as a 12-year-old boy.",
        "Your father was in the struggle, but a different kind of a struggle.",
        "As a Black Panther, as a book publisher.",
        "What do you make of his struggle?",
        "How did you relate to it as a kid, first of all?",
        "Initially, not particularly well, because I felt like his struggle was basically one in which he made me do as much as work as possible.",
        "As a child you just, you know, adults try to explain things to you but you have so many questions.",
        "And you know, to cut on the TV and to see \"\"One World\"\" and how things are going.",
        "I mean, this is the age of Reagan, and whenever, you know, people talk about Reagan, whenever the rest of America talks about Reagan, it's very clear that they have a different memory of those years than what black folks who lived in the cities had of those years.",
        "And so you cut on the TV and you see one reality and you walk outside and you see a completely different reality.",
        "My dad's struggle, this sort of consciousness that he was trying to bring forth, the books that were in my house, the histories of the Black Panther, the Black Power movement, Malcolm X, all that stuff, it was a - and I don't say this in any sort of a berating way - it was a mythology for me.",
        "It was a way to explain, it was religion.",
        "I was in a house in which we didn't really have a religion.",
        "We weren't Christian, Muslim, or anything.",
        "We didn't even celebrate Kwanzaa.",
        "So it's sort of left to you to create a way of understanding the world and that's what mythology, that's what religion gives us.",
        "And that was what that was for me.",
        "Not a single one.",
        "But police are saying that at least 22 migrants seeking asylum are being sought as suspects.",
        "Some of these were identified by video.",
        "Others were actually stopped by police on that night in the square in Cologne and then they were questioned and let go.",
        "Police say that the foreign suspects were mainly from Algeria and Morocco and that they have yet to identify 44 other assailants.",
        "Now, could you also say the fact that America now has a black president marks the end of an era for the NAACP?",
        "This is NPR News."
