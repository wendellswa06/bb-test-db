        "I wasn't even going to say that.",
        "I'm going to see if I can do it a little quicker than you, with that being said, what has to be done at this point?",
        "Well, I think what we need to understand, in this case with Venezuela, is the relationship between Hugo Chavez and Iran is very concerning.",
        "A lot of people don't know, and I have Iranian sources that have told me that under Khatami, there was an arrangement between Venezuela and Iran to smuggle in Syrian and Iranian spies under the auspices of Venezuelan passports, because of how difficult that has become through other channels after 9/11.",
        "Also, when Khatami visited Iran last year, Hugo Chavez chummed around with him, discussing how they were going to build a strong alliance against the United States, and that he expressed an interest in introducing nuclear elements through the help of Iran into Venezuela.",
        "Now, these types of issues have been flying under the radar with the average American citizen, but the state department and the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, they understand the danger of having a Hugo Chavez/Iranian relationship in the Southern hemisphere.",
        "And not only that, it's correct that there is a dramatic shift to the left, and there is a certain anti-American sentiment going on in Latin America, unlike we've seen in a long time.",
        "And what the Americans are trying to do with issues like CAFTA, we're trying to maintain a certain amount of economic influence in the region, so that we have them on our side, because there's a shrinking cadre of American allies in Latin America.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me move us quickly, because we have an abbreviated roundtable today.",
        "We're going to do a salute, in just a few moments, to Miles Davis and his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but what a lot of people are talking about, Pedro, is this fascination that America seems to have with the Sopranos, and in particular, minorities.",
        "African-Americans, Latinos and the like, love this show.",
        "And we've seen, historically, the love of gangsters.",
        "While Tony has become the loveable gangster, is there any danger in blurring the lines here?",
        "Tomorrow's Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina is a crucial one for Senator John Edwards.",
        "It's the state where he was born.",
        "Edwards' message here has been especially geared towards poor and working-class South Carolinians.",
        "And he might be resonating more with African-Americans in the state if he were not competing against an African-American candidate, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, a woman with strong ties to black America.",
        "I spoke with Edwards and asked what he plans to do after tomorrow if he doesn't win at least second place.",
        "Oh, I'm in this for the long haul, and the causes that I'm engaged in, speaking for the people who don't have a voice, speaking for the uninsured, for people who live in poverty, for our veterans, for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, those are the causes of my life.",
        "And they're not going away, and I'm in this for the long haul.",
        "Now you've talked many times, including in this week's debate, about your father working in the mills.",
        "You yourself have succeeded in making millions of dollars living a much wealthier lifestyle.",
        "So when people think about their place in America, what obligation do voters in your income bracket have to pay their taxes and take action on behalf of poor and working-class people?"

        "Of course.",

        "It's not a small number.",

        "So do you worry that some of the people who might otherwise support your message are taking race and gender into account in a way that doesn't favor you?",
        "No, what I worry about is whether I am being heard.",
        "I think when - Martin Luther King III just put out a statement a couple of days ago saying that the things that I've been driving in this entire campaign and in my life, in which you and I have spoken about already, but the problem we have is being heard through the glitz and glamour of Senator Obama and Senator Clinton's campaign and the money.",
