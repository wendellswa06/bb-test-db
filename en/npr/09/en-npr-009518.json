        "You know, the NBA has been heading that way in recent years, and this collection of teams is a great indication of the change the game's undergone.",
        "You know, in the past, offensive success, especially in the postseason, was kind of a slowdown kind of offense, often isolate with one or two players involved in the play - not very exciting to watch.",
        "But in recent years, it's been more about spreading the offensive players around the half court, utilizing three-point shooters, making the extra pass, and these teams do that.",
        "Golden State, of course, most celebrated for its high-octane, quick shooting and long-range shooting offense; when it comes to three-pointers, Houston and Atlanta, actually, shoot more than the Warriors this postseason.",
        "What about defense, though?",

        "Coach Mike D'Antoni giving players the green light to shoot, but that Suns team was limited because its defense wasn't great, and that's where the Warriors separate.",
        "Golden State has a great defense.",
        "It's been the best in the NBA this season, and the combination of that and the offense makes the Warriors the favorites.",
        "OK, so Warriors versus the Houston Rockets in the West; in the East, Cleveland versus Atlanta.",
        "How do you predict that one?",
        "Tougher to predict.",
        "The Hawks have not looked in this postseason like the wonderful, free-flowing, move-the-ball-around team they were in the regular the season, you know, a kind of poor man's San Antonio Spurs.",

        "I remember a few seasons ago when Tony's daughter was seeing a black guy, he called him a charcoal.",
        "So, when you see this, it is an interesting juxtaposition between black's love affair with this, and how we are depicted on the program.",

        "I mean, the Mafia has been a fascination in America, black and white across the board for many, many years, because of the loyalty to family and then the criminal element of that.",
        "There's so many different aspects of these relationships that are fascinating, and I think that it is an interesting point to see that because Italian-American mafia-types are so racist against blacks, that there's still such a draw to the Tony Montana's of the world, even though he was Cuban, but that whole gangster lifestyle has been a fascination with blacks.",
