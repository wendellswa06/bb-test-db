        "But I think what Pedro says, I think, is a good point, in terms of what happens once you've actually gotten there.",
        "But speaking to your point, Ed, and also combining what Tara said, I do think--any kind of signal that says to our young people that there is a badge of honor or you can, as in Lil' Kim's show, you can figure out how much product that you might be able to say on your new release because you're going to jail, that's the bad aspect of it, certainly.",
        "Tara, real quick, the follow-up: you mention the idea of the entrepreneurial spirit.",
        "One has to believe though that obviously there's a huge market for this.",
        "I said that.",
        "There's supply and demand and, unfortunately, the supply here is the human lives, or the destruction thereof, of many of our black brothers and sisters out there...",

        "Thank you.",

        "Gadson is just one of many physicians working hard to help African Americans stop smoking.",
        "You can add to that list, Dr. Phillip Gardiner, a researcher with the University of California's Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program.",
        "He's long studied the effects of smoking and often presents his research to churches and support groups.",
        "He believes the epidemic of smoking related deaths among African Americans isn't just a health crisis, it's a civil rights crisis.",
        "I guess a little sign in our office, in the Tobacco-Related Disease office, has, They brought us over here to pick it.",
        "Now they've gotten us to smoke it.",
        "Part of what I try and get across to people is that the use of tobacco products by African Americans is furthering their oppression here in the United States, and that if we can get off of this, it puts us in a much healthier position to take up struggles, whether it is for greater affirmative action, or equal rights, or even getting a job.",
        "Dr.",
        "Gardiner was a smoker for 18 years.",
        "Like most former smokers, quitting wasn't easy, but just how many times did he have to try before that last cigarette?",
        "Often.",
        "Here's Dr. Gardiner in his own words.",
        "The story that I like to tell people, and I do talk to a lot of groups about smoking, but I used to work at San Francisco General Hospital, and at break, you know, I would go outside and smoke a cigarette, and I noticed that there were a number of us sitting outside, mainly the poorer and the darker of the employees there, smoking.",
        "But I guess what really got to me is after a year or so sitting out there, ambulance would be coming by, and drive up into the hospital, and after awhile, you know, it kind of, it kind of came clear that that's going to be your outcome if you don't do something about this.",
        "The day I quit was May 7th, 1987.",
        "My wife had quit on her birthday the month before in April, and I was determined this time, one of my many times quitting, that I would quit and that I knew for me I needed to get out of my existing surroundings or routines or going to work or going to meetings, and we decided to go to Tahoe.",
        "The next morning, I think was truly the most difficult test for me because I was, I had thrown the cigarettes away, I was clear, we're going to go drive around Lake Tahoe and just enjoy ourselves, so I go put on my, I had on my heavy jacket because we were out at night, and I put on the lighter jacket to go for the drive, and there in that jacket was another pack of cigarettes that I wasn't aware of.",
        "And I went, I must admit, I was in quite a bit of turmoil, but I convinced myself.",
        "I threw it away, and we got in the car and went for the drive.",
        "The other defining moment in the immediate period after quitting was the day we got back a week later, and I went into our bathroom at the house, and it seemed like the bathroom was alive, no other way to put it.",
        "When you have been smoking, a lot of your senses are dulled for years, and here I was, I hadn't smoked a cigarette in seven days, something I hadn't accomplished in ten or 15 years, and I could hear, smell, feel, see, and I remember that day very well.",
        "I wanted it to stay like that.",
        "I haven't wanted a cigarette since."

        "In his own words, that was Dr. Philip Gardiner, a researcher with the University of California's Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program and a former smoker.",
        "Uri, what's going on?",
        "Why the drop?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The Trump administration has had very close ties with Mohammed bin Salman, and they've really promoted his vision of transformation for the kingdom.",
        "And so this whole episode has highlighted the other part of Mohammed bin Salman's rule, which has been escalating repression of dissidents and silencing dissent.",
        "Yeah, I would say that.",
        "I mean, I think that if you are making this argument that it is purely a matter of celebrating history, then you have to I believe also recognize the full breadth of that history.",
        "And so you can't wear something like a Confederate flag or wave a Confederate flag and say that it only represents this tiny sliver of history when, in fact, there is this really broad history, the bulk of which is pretty negative, at least for a pretty large group of people of color, that, you know - you have to recognize that that is part of the story that you're telling.",
        "So tell me a little bit more about what reaction you're getting to the column.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I would say that the reaction is as polarizing as the hat is.",
        "The people who agreed with the column are very vocal in expressing that.",
        "And then there are people who simply say that, oh, you're reading way too much into the hat, or you, in fact, are a racist because this is what you see in that hat.",
        "But I would say that the ones who are perhaps most eloquent in their - the defense of the hat really are the ones who are saying the dark terrible things that you described, do not reflect what's in my heart, do not reflect how I feel about immigrants or how I feel about women, you know?",
        "They still feel that the hat is representative of something that goes directly to how they think their government should be run.",
        "And, you know, and I say to them that, yes, I understand what your intent is.",
        "My argument is that that benign intent has been drowned out, overwhelmed, eradicated by quite a malignant intent.",
        "Well, it proves your point, once again, that fashion isn't just fashion.",
        "Fashion is communication and culture, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's not simply what you are trying to communicate.",
        "It's also - you know, fashion is connected to the broader culture, and all of those outside forces change the meaning of what you wear.",
        "That's Washington Post fashion and culture critic Robin Givhan, the Pulitzer Prize-winner joining us in our studios in Washington, D.C.",

        "His father and his mother, Louis and Mary Leakey, contributed volumes to our understanding of human evolution with the fossils they uncovered at the Olduvai Gorge, along with Mary Leakey's later discovery of a long trail of footprints left by bipedal hominids three and a half million years ago in Tanzania.",
        "My next guest added to the human family tree with many finds of his own, including the nearly complete skeleton of Turkana Boy, a Homo erectus.",

        "Well, it's a difficult question to answer.",
        "I think there's an awful lot of privilege associated with it.",
        "But like anyone who is known, it carries a certain weight with it.",
        "And one has to be careful what one says and where one goes and what one does once you get that sort of notoriety.",
        "But it does carry a lot of privilege, and it's great fun, particularly earlier on in life, to be recognized.",
        "I'll bet.",
        "I have to tell you, share a story with you.",
        "Your father was the first brand name, I'll say, big-name scientist I ever interviewed, 40 years ago.",
