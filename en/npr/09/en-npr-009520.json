        "Many of the fossils that I have been associated with finding have been found in very remote parts of Kenya, very desolate, hot, dry desert areas.",
        "I've built up a personal love for the desert, and fascination.",
        "But looking for human fossils is only part of the story.",
        "They're usually part of an extinct fauna (unintelligible) fossils of other creatures that lived in the same environments.",
        "It's really like visiting a new zoo every day you go out.",
        "You find things that you haven't seen before.",
        "You're intellectually piqued practically throughout the day.",
        "And so there's nothing in a day that doesn't give you some form of satisfaction, even though it may be tough.",
        "But it's an enormously privileged activity to go out and look for things that, if you find them, may change the course of understanding of humanity.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number if you'd like to talk to Richard Leakey.",
        "But it must be - you say it gives you satisfaction, but it must be incredibly frustrating knowing it could take you years.",
        "It took your father decades to find what he was looking for.",
        "And then your mom found it.",
        "Well, I think frustration is the wrong word.",
        "Okay.",
        "I think I have been very fortunate in my career in that when I went up to Lake Turkana in northern Kenya, it turned out to be there were so many fossils that one really had very little of the difficulties that my parents experienced.",
        "Forty years later, there are far fewer fossils to be found because they've largely been collected, but there are very specific questions.",
        "And over the last five years, my wife, Meave, and daughter have been focusing on very specific things they're looking for, and they've zeroed on - zeroed into particular time bands represented in the geology."

        "And they have spent days and days looking specifically for fossils in that particular time zone.",
        "They have been rewarded.",
        "They have found them.",
        "But that is a much more diligent task than simply the exploration that I was privileged to have fun doing.",
        "And what are they looking for at this moment?",
        "Well, they were - last few years they've been looking for the origin of Homo and trying to find out what more complete specimens would have looked like that relate to the Homo habilis story that my parents worked on at Olduvai, and maybe looking into the whole question of the ancestry of Homo and whether Homo habilis, which comes before Homo erectus, really is distinctive from some of the things that have been called Homo habilis but are not.",
        "It all gets very technical, but one of the problems with paleo-anthropology is that although there's a remarkable story, much of the story is still represented by frustratingly fragmentary evidence.",
        "And so more has to be found to tie up a few loose ends.",
        "But it's so much further along than it used to be even 20 years ago.",
        "So when you find a fossil, what do you see in these old bones that can tell you whether or not something was our ancestor?",
        "Well, I guess it's like - it's harder today in America, where you use paper cups and paper plates.",
        "But if you think of your grandparents' cutlery and crockery, if you break up a series of plates of different kinds and different sources and you mix it up with the dirt, and you've studied the plates and crockery, when you pick something up, you can say: Ah, this is the edge of a plate that was probably used for soup.",
        "And: Ah, this is a plate that was probably used for dessert.",
        "And this is a piece of a plate that was probably a serving plate.",
        "Just from its shape, thickness and design.",
        "If you're familiar with anatomy, and you're familiar with the anatomy of fossils that have been found previously, it's relatively easy to categorize what you're finding quite quickly into a broad set of characters.",
        "Then clearly you have the problems if you haven't found enough of the specimen, what it actually compares to, but you can look on the specimen and see if it's got any evidence of being recently broken.",
        "You then determine whether to excavate, whether to screen the area, and you can gradually build up a picture.",
        "It's like when we found the Turkana Boy.",
        "I didn't find it, but Kimoya(ph), one of my assistants, discovered a little piece of skull.",
        "And it was clearly a little piece of a hominid skull, but whether it was going to lead to anything, I didn't know.",
        "But in these cases, you always look further, and within a few days we had found enough of the skull to know that the front of the skull was represented with a fragment, the back of the skull was represented with a fragment, and so presumably the middle of the skull was too."

        "So we had to then start a much more extensive excavation, and we started to find bits of ribs.",
        "Well, skull and ribs mean there's probably something connecting them.",
        "And then we found that we had an almost complete skeleton.",

        "It was enormously exciting because every day, practically, for the first six weeks, we were finding things that had never been seen before by modern humans.",
        "And we were the first to see them and realize that we had things in our hands that were going to answer questions that people have been worrying about for years.",

        "Does it happen often, that kind of thing?",
        "We never lost a human fossil, but we've lost some wonderful other creatures' fossils that have been left overnight to dry from the hardener, and in the morning there's just been a crumpled wreck when a hyena has chewed on it to get what it thought might be good-tasting.",
        "Up to three million years, it chews up a skeleton.",

        "We had a few fossils but they were not particularly convincing.",
        "And we disagreed and chose to disagree over what this represented.",
        "But I think, over the last 25, 30 years, so much more material has come in that the picture is much clearer.",
        "It's perhaps fortunately that over last 30 years I have been focusing more on conversation and more on politics.",
        "And I haven't kept abreast of some of the discoveries.",
        "But certainly at 3 million years, there is more than one candidate for Homo ancestry.",
        "And I think that's probably the best way to leave it at the moment.",
        "You know, a lot of people who are creationists and do not believe in human evolution, they like to say that no human has descended from a monkey or an ape or a chimpanzee.",
        "And that's exactly correct, isn't it?",
        "It's not that we were descendants from them, but there's a common ancestry somewhere.",
        "Well, indeed.",
        "And I think if we were very fair, which humans aren't, and one did - had the classification of primates done by a non-primate, there would be six great apes, not five, because we are just an ape.",
        "We just happened to have been a more intelligent one who did the classification ourselves.",
        "And I think this added to the whole idea that God created us in his image.",

        "And I'm quite sure had Charles Darwin not suggested that we, too, had evolved, evolution would have been perfectly acceptable to everybody.",
        "But it wasn't thus and all the evidence today, and there's abundant evidence and very clear evidence, is that we have evolved.",
        "And if you go back far enough, our ancestors don't look anything like we do today.",
        "But people didn't like the idea that the world wasn't the center of the universe.",
        "People didn't like the idea that the world wasn't flat.",
        "Given time and evidence, people learn to accept these things if they're true.",
