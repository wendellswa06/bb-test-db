        "And I'd like to bring on another guest now to talk about evolution.",
        "And this was the evolution of language, because, just like species, languages evolve, pick up new words and new rules.",
        "And, eventually, languages diverge from each other and, well, to the point where they can no longer communicate, people speaking different languages.",
        "Recent count of the world's languages, that number has hit nearly 7,000 - 7,000 different languages.",
        "But did language originate only once?",
        "Was there an original language before branching off into all of those modern varieties?",
        "If so, where did it originate, and when?",

        "Yeah.",
        "So the background - my background is in evolutionary biology.",
        "And so the approach I took was really a similar approach to what population geneticists have done to look at our genetic origins and trace that back to Africa.",
        "So one of the key lines of evidence there is that genetic diversity is highest in Africa and decreases as you go out further from Africa.",
        "And that fits with a model called the serial founder effect, where an ancestral population will have a lot of diversity.",
        "And then as you go out from that during an expansion, populations will break off and take a subset of the diversity with them.",
        "If that happens over and over again, then the further you get from the origin, the less genetic diversity you expect.",
        "Well, in genes we track the, you know, genes backwards.",
        "How -what do we track backwards?",
        "What are the building blocks in languages that we're looking to track?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, one of the fundamental - or perhaps the fundamental unit of language is the phoneme, the smallest unit of sound that we use to differentiate meanings.",
        "So the word cat and the word bat are differentiated by the k and b sound.",
        "So that's a phoneme.",

        "Nick Lindquist is the policy director for the American Conservation Coalition.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "And what I was interested in doing was looking at these phonemes all around the world to see if the geographic distribution could be used in a similar way to the way geneticists have looked at genetic diversity.",
        "So I was looking at the number of phonemes in different languages.",
        "And there's good reasons, a priori reasons, where we might expect phonemes to show a similar kind of founder effect to what we see in genetics.",
        "Smaller populations of speakers are known to have fewer phoneme.",
        "And both our theoretical models of language learning and computer simulation predict that smaller populations should lose phoneme.",
        "So, based on that theory and background, I decided to go into the data, to a dataset of over 500 languages around the world where we had information on the number of phonemes in the different languages, and put them on a map and then get a computer algorithm to go through a whole lot of potential origin locations around the world and ask: Where do we see, if anywhere, a gradient of decreasing diversity from some potential origin?",
        "And what's the - if you could choose any origin, what would be the best one to fit that pattern?"

        "(Speaking in foreign language)",
        "Any difference there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you might have heard - well, far fewer sounds, but also one of the ways that meaning is encoded when you have fewer sounds, is you tend to repeat the sounds you've got over and over again.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "That's a good question.",
        "The method I've used is looking just at the geographic trends and can't date the origin independently.",
        "But looking at that pattern, you obviously want to find an explanation for it, and it seems like - the clearest explanation is that language would have spread with our genes when we expanded from Africa, which we can date through looking at gene trees and human species, and also through the archeological record to 50 to 70,000 years ago, when we started to expand from Africa.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And did the evolution of language influence the evolution of our species, do you think?",
        "Well, I think it could have been incredibly important.",
        "The advantages conferred by being able to communicate complex information I think maybe would have been most useful for allowing groups of humans to coordinate and cooperate, and could have given us a real competitive advantage over other species at the time.",
        "So in the paper, I suggest that language could have been one of the catalysts for that expansion from Africa.",
        "I'm going to ask Richard Leaky, who's sitting here with us, to comment.",
        "Do you think language is - was important?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "I think this work that's just been published by Dr. Atkinson is phenomenally important.",
        "And one of the big mysteries to me and to many of us has been why the last great expansion to which we can all almost directly relate - and if you look at the unraveling of the genome and you look at the genetics of modern humans, clearly, we have a point of origin between 60 and 70,000 years ago.",
        "And yet anatomically and archeologically, there's nothing that really explains any dramatic change.",
        "And I have long postulated, as have others, that it's perhaps language -that you wouldn't find anatomical evidence for - that might have given the advantage to that population of Homo sapiens, that basically out-competed every previous population of Homo sapiens that had already spread over much of the old world.",
        "And I think the fact that this correlates, more or less, really is very exciting.",
        "And I think we're beginning to see a picture emerge that is consistent and understandable.",
        "What we've now got to do is find a lot more evidence of the fossils themselves and the archeology itself.",
        "And the Turkana Basin Institute, which we've set up in Northern Kenya, is probably fairly close.",
        "I mean, it would - it could be hundreds of miles from the epicenter, but there's an enormous range of deposits that carry evidence from about 10,000 years back to about 100,000 years.",
        "And I think we will find the fossil remains and the archeological remains that cover this period.",
        "And if we get enough good material, maybe all this will come together in the next decade, and we'll finally understand where - what we are and when we came.",
        "What do you think, Dr. Atkinson?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I think it would be great if we could synthesize some of that early archeological, paleontological evidence with the kind of echoes of it we see in cultural diversity today, yeah, and really kind of tell the cultural story alongside the genetic story.",
        "You know, we really don't think about linguists handling these language questions, comparing - we usually really think that that's what they do.",
        "They compare languages, and so on.",
        "But you're now getting picked up by evolutionary biologists, like yourself, with this whole idea.",
        "It's interesting to see how this has evolved, so to speak."
