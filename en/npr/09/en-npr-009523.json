        "A question I've always wondered is that as you look at a modern population of living beings and you look at the extreme variations, say, in skull size or shape and as well as height and all that, how many specimens do you need to find of the same age to determine that you've indeed found a definitive stage of development?",
        "Is it 10?",
        "Is it 50, a hundred?",
        "I mean - or you just find one skull and say, hey, here's a...",
        "Well, let's turn it into a different sort of question on the same issue.",
        "If you look at domestic animals - and I think humans are domestic animal, and have been since we got - developed a strong culture and different behavior patterns associated with being a culture animal.",
        "But let's leave humans aside from this and go to the plains of Africa, the national parks of Africa, or North America or Europe.",
        "If you get a brown bear skeleton or you pick up a mandible or a lower jaw or a femur of a brown bear, it is going to be a brown bear, and no anatomists is going to tell you it could be anything else.",
        "The remarkable uniformity between the anatomy of different species is striking, even for the poorly informed.",
        "And so when you find a fossil that's two million years old, the chances of it being abnormal and not characteristic are very, very remote, indeed.",
        "So I think when you find several skulls that are almost identical to each other at more or less the same point in time, the chances of this not being representative of that species at that time are simply discountable.",
        "I don't think you could - you should be diverted by that.",
        "And I think the difficulty is to pick up a Pekingese skull and compare it to the Great Dane and the domestic dogs and say, well, these clearly are different species, yet you know perfectly well they're not different species.",
        "They're simple being bred by the human culture.",
        "And I think -take modern humans out of the story for the moment and look at wild animals, and you will find that these pre-cultural hominids were behaving just as wild creatures do today.",
        "And every fossil you find is going to be distinctive and diagnostic of the species from which it's coming.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "In the few minutes we have left, I want to give you my blank-check question I give to scientists sometimes.",
        "And they start drooling early when I mentioned that.",
        "And that is: If you had all the money in the world and all the resources, what would you do?",
        "What question would you like to answer and how would you go about spending that money to find it?",
        "Well, I - funny enough, I think, this conversation has pointed to an area that I think is now absolutely critical.",
        "I think for a long time, we in paleoanthropology have tried to persuade people of our evolution.",
        "And we've started at the wrong end.",
        "We've been looking for the oldest fossils, which are least like us.",
        "And people have had an easy time discounting them and saying, no, that's an ape.",
        "I think we need to turn it around and start with us and look at the genetic story, look now at the language story, and then look at the fossil story.",
        "And you will find fossils at 30, 40,000 years that are identical to the skeletons of the two of us sitting here and everybody listening to us.",
        "You then go back in time.",
        "And I think if we'd started that way at the beginning, we would have gone a lot farther with dealing with acceptance of human evolution.",
        "I personally believe that if we could accept human evolution and evolution, science would be much more acceptable.",
        "And I think the only way out of the mess this species that's in today is for science to get greater currency value in the world.",
        "And I think a lot of biological natural science has been discounted because of the fear of evolution."

        "And it's late, but there is still time.",
        "Are you saying it's a worldwide fear of evolution, or is it mostly in the United States?",

        "Well, it did.",

        "There were some concerns it was going to get up to 13 feet.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think we have some confirmed reports right now of 8 1/2 feet over near Apalachicola.",

        "The storm ended up, Rachel, to be a little more compact.",
        "Stronger hurricanes typically are more compact, so that did lessen the reach of the storm surge a bit.",
        "But we had reports all the way as far as Tampa of water flooding coastal roadways.",
        "And we had reports in Cedar Key of a storm surge of 2 to 5 feet.",
