        "And the answer is obviously they're not evenly distributed throughout the states.",
        "No, they're very heavily concentrated on the coasts, particularly California, Connecticut; the District of Columbia actually has got the highest percentage, so you wonder where your tax dollars are going.",
        "Basically, almost all the top 10 are all pretty solidly blue states.",
