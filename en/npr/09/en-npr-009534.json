        "Well, I think what Prime Minister Netanyahu is trying to establish today and what he certainly said in the past is that the Iranians cannot be trusted - that they have somehow cheated their way into a deal they didn't deserve.",
        "And I think that anyone who understands the 159 pages of text that lay out the terms of this agreement appreciates that Iran's nuclear capabilities are better under the watchful eye of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the robust set of verification and monitoring measures that were put in place as a result of the deal.",
        "And so I think, if anything, what the prime minister laid out today really reinforces the utility of the agreement that we have in place.",
        "That is not the read, necessarily, from the White House.",
        "President Trump called the assessment from Israel 100 percent right, and he - as we heard in audio earlier - has still more skepticism about this deal.",

        "It was meant for secret communications, but technically, it was nothing fancy.",
        "Bruce Schneier is a prominent author and consultant on computer security.",
        "What the government did is they made their own network.",

        "The network was expanded intentionally after 9/11 because of the belief that more information sharing between agencies might lead to the detection of terror plots.",
