        "So if a computer that sort of randomly drops three of their marks, three of the twelve.",
        "I guess the outcome could vary greatly depending on whose marks were dropped.",
        "It could, in theory.",
        "I don't think it's happening because there's so many marks now, it'd just be so hard to manipulate them.",
        "I think where you see some problems is in the second score, in the artistic score.",
        "I mean, you're judging art, how do you judge art?",
        "And so, I think where you have skaters and their reputations that starts to factor in, in what they call the component mark, which is the artistic mark.",
        "And there are five of those, and those are on a 0 to 10 scale.",
        "And you'll see some skaters with 8.5's and some with 6.0's, and its hard to determine what exactly warranted a 6.0 and what warranted an 8.5.",
        "Mark, quickly, before we let you go, I'm wondering if this new testing system has led to greater risk-taking as the skaters try to rack up points.",
        "Does that explain all those tumbles that we saw over the weekend?",
        "Well, what I think you're seeing is that, yes, some are taking more risks, but what you're seeing is they're having in practice to spend less time on the jumps and more time on the spins and the footwork.",
        "And so what happens is, they're not jumping as much in practice and not focusing on it.",
        "They're also getting more tired as they get through the program, and there's less focus on the jumps.",
        "That's why you're seeing so many skaters falling.",
        "It doesn't necessarily mean that you're seeing worse skating.",
        "You're probably seeing a better level of skating overall.",

        "It has.",

        "Maybe we should talk about this issue.",
        "And I think it's important that we continue down that path.",
        "So as a young Republican, what do you tell people in your party who may say, we don't believe in the science behind climate change?",
        "Number one, you know, I know it is model based.",
        "But 99% of scientists are saying that this is true.",
        "If someone told you anything was 9 times out of 10 going to happen, wouldn't you do the thing that'll give you the best outcome?",
        "And also, even if it's not as severe as people estimate or not, there's new jobs in clean energy and environmental mitigation and things of that nature.",
        "So kind of tying in the economic aspect of it helps us a lot as well.",
        "So what is your message to the GOP?",
        "It is time for us to get real messaging on environmental and climate issues.",
        "And I don't think that we have to sacrifice our values and our roots in, you know, markets and private-sector innovations helping us get across the finish line.",
        "And also, like, we are the future of the GOP, and it matters to this growing voting bloc.",
        "And it's not going to go away by denial."

        "She continually complained to her superiors but her plaints fell on deaf ears and the abuse escalated and ultimately ended up in a violent rape and a vicious, brutal attack which ended up dislocating her jaw and permanently causing damage.",

        "I mean, according to the Department of Defense, 19,000 men and women were sexually assaulted in the military just last year and of course if you multiply that back over the generations, that means hundreds of thousands of men and women have been sexually assaulted.",

        "They have - it's long overdue that a problem should be addressed.",

        "She knew what happened in the aftermath of reporting that as bad as the assault was, the military's response to these crimes actually, you know, was to either blame the victim and, you know, protect the perpetrators.",
        "So given her experience investigating these cases and everything she had witnessed, she didn't actually first come forward and report her case for fear of experiencing those very same reprisals."
