        "Because she knew that she would be told, you stand to be charged yourself for making a false accusation.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And in fact, Myla only decided to come forward five years later when she was approached by a group of women who were having a lawsuit against this very same perpetrator from various units.",
        "So she figured, OK, if these other officers are coming forward, their strength in numbers may be - might our case will be heard and given validation.",
        "And sadly enough, even with these five women, all filing charges against the same person, all women who did not know each other, the case was rejected, and justice was not served.",
        "Oh, well, who does that anymore at all?",
        "And I have to ask, Kirby Dick, there's a sobering piece of analysis where on the film we see numbers and what happens to the disposition of these cases.",
        "It's an outrage.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I know it is.",
        "I mean, people - justice is so rarely served that only 14 percent of men and women who are assaulted in the military actually report.",
        "Eighty-six don't report.",
        "And even of the ones that do report, very few go to court martial, and the ones that go to court martial, very - there are very few convictions, and of the convictions, there is very few other men serve substantial jail time.",
        "So justice is not being done at all.",
        "We've heard from civilian prosecutors that these kinds of cases are very, very difficult to prove.",
        "That is true.",
        "That is true.",
        "But the military, unfortunately, has a very antiquated military justice system, and they've been unable to actually prosecute - investigate or prosecute these successfully.",
        "And it's not - if I can just jump in, it's not really that these cases are necessarily that hard to prove.",
        "It's also that there's an inherent injustice in the military's judicial system in that the people that are adjudicating these crimes are directly in the same chain of command as the people who are, you know, either the plaintiffs or the assailants.",
        "So it's just - it's a sort of a rigged game.",
        "The commander knows everyone involved, so his sympathies are, you know, obviously, going to be tampered by his knowledge of the participating parties, and so there's no impartial oversight.",
        "And that's really the crux of the problem.",
        "The crux of the problem is not that he said-she said case.",
        "It's actually that there's this, you know, this system in place that doesn't guarantee impartial over-adjudication of these crimes.",
        "So the ultimate disposition of the case, the person who decides whether it goes ahead or not is the commanding officer?",
        "Well, recently, Senator Panetta elevated that decision to the level of colonel or Navy captain.",
        "But he kept it within the chain of command.",
        "So there's still a conflict of interest.",
        "There's still many opportunities for conflict of interest.",
        "It has to be moved outside of the chain of command so that both the accused and the victim get impartial justice.",
        "These men and women are fighting to protect our rights, and certainly, one of our rights is the right to impartial justice.",
        "These men and women deserve the same."

        "When that bond of trust is violated, the wound penetrates to the very most inner part of one's soul, one psyche.",
        "Amy Ziering, she says it's the equivalent of incest.",
        "Yeah.",
        "When you're in the military, you feel like your unit - you're indoctrinated to believe, psychologically and philosophically, that this is your band of brothers.",
        "These are people who have your back.",
        "So imagine how much worse an assault is by your fellow soldier.",
        "It's actually hard for you to psychologically compute, and it does register as incest and an extremely profound core betrayal.",
        "I mean, it rattles these women and it made them extremely difficult for them to have trust in any relationships in the future.",
        "It's absolutely shattering, and I think that's something that the public at large doesn't really understand, and it's categorically different for women and men that are raped within the military.",
        "And men that are raped.",
        "You do also interviewed a couple of men who experienced sexual assault in the military.",
        "And, well, this also is a case that's not reported because, well, it's so difficult.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, before don't ask, don't tell, if any man came forward and reported a sexual assault, they themselves were accused of having a homosexual encounter and asked, were they sure they wanted to report, you know, because - so imagine, you know, the incentive then to not come forward and disclose was extremely intense.",
        "And that's why many men were even further suppressed than the women in our U.S.",
        "military.",
        "And I think what people aren't aware of is that as many men are - as many or more men are sexually assaulted in the U.S.",
        "military each year as women.",
        "Much smaller percentage but, of course, there are many, many more men in the military than women.",

        "You went for the, I guess, might be described as the macro approach.",
        "You speak to many, many women to tell their stories in bits.",
        "You could have gone for the other approach, which was a micro approach; take one woman and tell her story in great depth.",
        "Why did you decide to make this film the way you did?",
        "Well, we wanted to make the point that this is a systemic problem.",
        "This happens overseas.",
        "That happens at base - bases, back home and happens, you know, in every branch in the military.",
        "I think up until this film came out, very few people were aware of that.",
        "There certainly was some reporting and there were a case here, a case there but people thought it was isolated.",
        "They thought perhaps the Air Force Academy scandal was just isolated to the Academy, and, in fact it's across the force.",
        "So what we thought was most important was to address this issue as a systemic problem because it's going to have to be solve as a systemic problem.",
        "And to do so by not just focusing on one story but showing a whole scope of story so people really get a sense of the range and breadth of this epidemic.",
        "And this film does not even - it may have been made before the extent of what the scandal now at the Air Force base in San Antonio at Lackland Air Force Base.",
        "Right.",
        "The film actually came out at Sundance last year in - just before the Lackland scandal that's breaking.",
        "And that, you know, it's continuing to break open even now as, you know, as we're speaking.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "One of the most interesting parts, and the most affecting parts of your argument, Amy Ziering, is that the women you speak with say almost to an individual that everybody who has been sexually assaulted or reported sexual assault in the military has to leave."

        "Yeah.",
        "Sadly, due to the lack of support after they report emotionally and psychologically.",
        "And due to the blowback they receive, a lot of them do sort of start to falter as soldiers, and they don't perform well in their duties.",
        "And they end up getting discharged with personality disorders ironically enough.",
        "And so, yeah, many of them are actually forced out of the military due to their inability to cope with the trauma of their assault and its aftermath.",

        "Yeah.",

        "It was filed by Susan Burke.",
        "And it's really - the fairness doctrine, the decision by the Supreme Court in the 1950s was in - what we believe as an overreaching interpretation of a congressional statute, which the fairness doctrine basically says that, if you're - anything that happens to you while you're in service you cannot sue for.",
        "And it serves, for example, if a doctor operates on the wrong leg, you cannot sue for that.",
        "So these men and women are denied of their basic civil rights.",

        "And Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta ended up watching it as a result, and two days later held a press conference to announce those substantial changes that Kirby mentioned earlier.",
        "And he, in fact, credits the film in part with the reason for him taking that action.",
