        "Well, the distance is a whole different game.",
        "You know, and in part, it's a different game because horses in America today aren't bred to go a mile and a half.",
        "You know, I was looking back at the 1980s, the horses who won the Kentucky Derby, every horse had like a solid mile-and-a-half runner, and the first two generations, it was pedigree.",
        "And so when horses, you know, like from the '70s and that - from that era, you know, went into the Belmont, they were pretty much, you know, mostly equipped, you know, to, you know, to run the distance.",
        "Now, nobody is bred for a mile and a half.",
        "And so when horses get into this race even if they look good finishing it at a mile and a quarter in the Derby, as I'll Have Another did, you know, it's a real unknown factor.",
        "I mean, it's kind of a crapshoot to know who is, you know, who's got the genes to go the distance.",
        "The other aspect of it is that the horse's jockey is unfamiliar with Belmont Park, which is, I think, the only track in the country that's a mile and a half.",
        "I take my horses by - well, I used to be an exercise girl back in my youth.",
        "And I study their genetics, and then I usually go by picking the colors of the jockey.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "The silks?",

        "I think it's very important to act promptly.",
        "It's important that we get the verification situation straightened out immediately and, secondly, that we get back to the table again to talk about tactical nuclear weapons.",
        "Those talks will not occur until we ratify the relatively modest new START treaty.",
        "And I say relatively modest because it makes only small adjustments in the numbers of nuclear warheads and carriers and what have you, but it does get the process back on track.",
        "It's not on track now, and that is dangerous for our national security.",
        "There are some newly elected members of the Senate, like Rand Paul from Kentucky, who have expressed some concern over, you know, whether the treaty could limit American anti-missile deployment overseas.",
        "Do you think those concerns are legitimate?"

        "I think that's a very important consideration.",
        "And I'm hopeful we'll have an opportunity to visit with Senator Paul and with others as they are coming in.",
        "Senator Lugar, in which areas do you see daylight between congressional Republicans and the administration when it comes to foreign policy?",
        "Well, for the moment, I would say that there is a very considerable degree of cooperation.",
        "In Afghanistan, Republicans have given very strong support on Afghanistan.",
        "I would not suggest that Democrats have not given support, too, but the fact is that this has been much more of a debate within the Democratic Party.",

        "On foreign policy issues, it seems to me that many of the Tea Party candidates have views that I would think are very similar to my own.",
        "The campaign we've just been through, as a matter of fact, did not have much to say about foreign policy.",
        "Well, I mean, some candidates have talked about how the president has gone around the world apologizing for America and so on and so forth.",
        "I mean, would you agree with that?",
        "Well, I really wouldn't characterize the president as apologizing for America, although I understand that some feel that he might be accused of doing this sort of thing.",
        "But at the same time, I think as members from the Tea Party come to the Congress, they will face the same worldwide problems the rest of us have.",
        "There are, I think, no doctrinaire lines right now with regard to how to solve extremely complex problems that really have defied solutions for quite a while."
