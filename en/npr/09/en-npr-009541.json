        "That means travelers on hundreds of flights each day would have to check those devices in their luggage.",

        "Homeland Security officials, including Kelly himself, have been discussing with European leaders whether to expand the restrictions on electronic devices to include flights between the U.S.",

        "A Homeland Security spokesman says that possible expansion is still on the table despite reports to the contrary this week as officials also look into other ways to improve aviation security globally.",

        "That happened Tuesday night on a cross-country JetBlue flight.",
        "The plane was diverted because of smoke emitting from a carry-on bag holding the electronic device.",
        "But the crew was able to quickly put out the fire.",
        "That might not be the case if the laptop is packed away in the cargo hold.",
        "And Michael McCormick of the Global Business Travel Association says business travelers in particular are concerned about handing over their laptops.",
        "We've been trained now by our companies - and have been for some time - that you really never let your laptop or any of your electronics out of your site.",
        "McCormick says many travelers fear their laptops could be damaged or stolen, that sensitive data could be hacked or that they'd just be stuck on a flight lasting eight, 10, even 12 hours or longer without being able to work."
