        "Well, thank you, Neal, it's nice to be back on the radio with Stephanie, too.",
        "And as you look at this phenomenon, what Stephanie's been reporting on, one of the things that we're seeing is we used to think of the online world and the brick-and-mortar world as two different things, not so much anymore.",
        "What we're calling it is convergence, which is the meeting of the bricks and mortar, the online world, facilitated by the smartphone, and that for merchants and marketers across the globe, the concept of having separate silos doesn't make sense anymore and that therefore we can look at the look and feel of the store and the look and feel of someone's online presence and look at those inconsistencies.",
        "And look at the - so they have to be consistent, not just in price but in what other aspects?",
        "In language, in the way they're organized.",
        "It's telling that for many of the major merchants, there are many thousands of miles between their bricks-and-mortar headquarters and their online business.",
        "So those things have to merge, and convergence is going to be the new slogan.",
        "But consumers, this kind of power is unprecedented, no?",
        "Well, let's recognize, Neal, we as a culture are over-stored.",
        "We could probably lose half of our retail space tomorrow and be a healthier nation and a healthier business community with it.",
        "We as American merchants have gotten addicted to the sale, meaning that the more we use it, the less it works and the more we need to use it.",
        "Right, they've started offering a price guarantee, which, granted, has a lot of restrictions to it, but they this Christmas season started saying bring in the lowest price from a competitor and we'll match it.",
        "People, the retailers are so anxious to get what little consumer spending there has been for the last couple of years that they have gone into this constant sale mode.",
        "And especially if you watched it around the holiday season, which is when retailers make most of their money, it was 40 percent off and then 50 percent off and 60 percent off as the weeks led up to Christmas.",
        "It was quite intense.",
        "And at 60 or 70 percent off, they're not making any money, they're just moving product."

        "Let's get Mark(ph) on the line, Mark with us from Norman, Oklahoma.",
        "Hi, my name is Mark, thank you for taking a call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I own a small technology company here called Norman Computers, and even since we had to start competing against the big online companies like Newegg and Amazon, you know, our retail market just got crushed.",
        "And what we had to do was use the retail as kind of loss leader and offer services and other things that the other companies weren't offering, you know, like, you know, 24-hour assistance, free diagnostics, that kind of stuff, and use the sales as kind of a loss leader because there's no way you can compete against the big stores online.",
        "So where do you make your money?",
        "Well, we make our money on the service and, you know, by solving problems that nobody else can solve, and then we'll actually get referrals sometimes from, you know, from Best Buy or the big box stores because, you know, we'll fix stuff that nobody else can fix.",
        "But as far as the sales itself goes, there's no money.",
        "I mean, you know, when I first got started in 2000, we could mark up our products, you know, 50 percent, 60 percent.",
        "Now we're lucky if we get a 20 percent markup, maybe 10 percent.",
        "And the other thing that we do is we'll just outright show them, hey, this is our wholesale price, this is our vendor price, and the vendors only mark it up about 5 percent.",
        "So if you're finding it online for less than what the vendors are paying for, you know, there's a change it could be a fake because, you know, in the computer industry, at least, there's a lot of fake product, you know, fake Cisco equipment, especially at the higher end.",
        "Or they're sell factory seconds, factory thirds, just defective stuff.",
        "So it's a little bit of a roller-coaster, but as far as the legitimate product goes, there's practically no money.",
        "And so you have to innovate and find ways where you can compete where there's no other competition.",
        "You know, we do that in the service industry, and we just use the parts just to get people in the door.",
        "Or we'll use the retail space as a loss leader to solicit corporate sales.",
        "You know, we do a, you know, do a good job fixing your computer really cheap, and then when the company's ready to buy a $10,000 network, you know, or some big database application, that's where we make, you know, our money there."

        "So we talked about the price scanners, which is when you use an iPhone app or an Android app to scan a bar code and bring up prices.",
        "Best Buy has started replacing the standard bar codes with its own QR codes.",
        "So if you use a regular price scanner, it does not work on a lot of Best Buy's items, and that means you can't do price comparisons very easily.",
        "And other vendors, excuse me, other smaller stores are asking vendors to put in different manufacturing numbers or different item numbers so that people cannot type them into Google because you don't have a like-to-like comparison.",

        "So they're trying to obfuscate to some degree.",

        "I think one of the poignancies - we have done mystery shopping where we have gone in to stores and confronted clerks with price online coupons and stuff like that and seen how they've responded to it.",
        "And part of the problem is is that the troops that are out there in the aisles of the stores are completely frustrated because management isn't responding fast enough to the process.",
        "And so is management going to eventually have to say look, our margins are now so thin we can't afford to have that many people?",
        "Well, I think there are a number of things that are going on.",
        "First of all, let's recognize that the major driver in American shopping is still convenience.",
        "And that whether I want it now or whether I'm willing to accept paying less prices for it and getting it tomorrow or the next day, is one of the tradeoffs that we have.",
        "Second is that this works really well for commodity items.",
        "If I'm buying a refrigerator or a piece of consumer electronics, the sale generally involves three parts.",

        "And then the third part is the actual sale.",
        "And that part of what of what the merchant's process is, is have to understand at which mode is the shopper in and to be able to confront some of those commodity pricings, just as one of the earlier callers in did with some form of service or bundling option.",
        "So that if I'm selling you a refrigerator, it is a refrigerator with the inside of it customized based on the digital pictures that you bring in of your present refrigerator.",
        "So that the merchant at the point of sale is offering you something beyond the commodity product that Abe's of Maine or Amazon is in the business of selling you.",
        "Those are all, you know, part of what the process is.",
        "Some of it is starting to conceive of the store as some form of catalog showroom.",
        "And that as I walk in the door, I have the option of the price right now, walking out the door with it; the price delivered tomorrow; or the price delivered next week.",
        "But that is clearly a transparency in pricing which we don't have now and that we probably need.",

        "Right, and they - the president of Land Rover said that basically car shoppers want to go in and meet somebody once, just to make sure that if I have a problem, I can come back to you.",
