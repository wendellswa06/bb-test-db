        "On a recent evening at Washington's Newseum, about a hundred rather somber-looking museum professionals went to hear a lecture by Jane McGonigal from the Institute for the future in Palo Alto.",
        "McGonigal didn't talk about funding or curatorial responsibility, she talked about games.",
        "Because I think that games will be one of the most important materials of the future.",
        "Jane McGonigal has been called the guru of alternate reality games, which millions of people play on their computers several hours a week.",
        "She says games make people happy, and she takes happiness very seriously.",
        "She's come up with four things she believes we all need to be happy - one, satisfying work to do; two, the experience of being good at something; three, time spent with people we like; and four, the chance to be a part of something bigger.",
        "McGonigal says these games do all of those things.",
        "Games work better than most of reality because they give us clear instructions.",
        "We know exactly what we're supposed to do when we start to play.",
        "They give us better feedback.",
        "You can't be good at something unless you're getting feedback.",
        "And for gamers, what's really interesting is gamers don't mind criticism.",
        "Getting told why you suck is actually a really fun part of the game experience because that's when you're really engaged in learning and getting better.",
        "So games provide better community because everybody is a part of the same mythology and cooperating, and finally games provide better emotions.",
        "Jane McGonigal says museums should take some cues from game designers, perhaps turn visitors into players.",
        "When people show up at museums, can't we give them a mission or a goal?",
        "Can we give them feedback?",
        "Are there virtual honors that you can show to your friends online afterwards depending on what exhibit you were interacting with?",
        "Is there a better community that we could provide real-time interaction with other visitors?",
        "(Soundbite of visitors talking in the Smithsonian Gallery)",
        "About 50 teenagers from New Jersey are practically running around a pristine Smithsonian Gallery, the Luce Foundation Center for American Art in Washington.",
        "They've broken up into teams to play a multimedia scavenger hunt where objects in the collection are part of the clues and you need cell phones with text messaging to solve them.",

        "This game is a scaled-down version of something the Luce Foundation Center tried earlier this year, an alternate reality game called \"\"Ghosts of a Chance.\"\" For about three months, the players have to solve clues that were planted on Facebook, Web sites, YouTube.",

        "Alternate reality games have a very distinctive narrative.",
        "They have beginning, middles, and ends.",
        "They take place in real time.",
        "So that was very appealing to us because the Luce Foundation Center has over - around 3,300 objects.",
        "We have 3,300 stories associated with those objects.",
        "So the idea of bringing in a narrative and using it to engage people with the collection was fantastic.",
        "The game was designed for the museum by the company City Mystery.",
        "It revolved around restless spirits who are haunting the museum.",

        "But Georgina Goodlander isn't worried about that at all.",
        "I think just kind of changing the mindset and having them think about art museums in a more positive way is our main goal.",

        "That's its evolutionary role.",
        "Beth Merritt heads up the Center for the Future of Museums.",
        "She's a big believer that in 10, 20 years, the best museums will be as interactive and fun as alternate reality games, and they'll be for kids and adults.",

        "And, unfortunately, when the president announced the surge back in January, he said essentially that this would give the Iraqi government breathing space so that they can make the political changes needed to bring about reconciliation.",
        "Ambassador Crocker, who also appeared before the joint congressional committees, didn't have much news to report, but only three benchmarks - three out of 18 benchmarks, you know, that have basically been implemented, that this country is still in the same place.",
        "So what General Petraeus argued for was more the same.",
        "A year from now, we will have 130,000 troops still policing and open into civil war in Iraq.",
        "And the American people have called for change.",
        "So, Robert, what's the message here?",
        "The president says the reduction is contingent upon the progress made in Iraq.",
        "And you have these two different reports.",
        "One by the GAO that says, really, this is not working, and then one from Petraeus that's saying it's working.",
        "Well, I would frankly agree with General Petraeus.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, because he's on the ground and he's the commander in the field - obviously that is taking appalls, if you will, not only of the troops, but also of really what's happening on the ground in Iraq - listening to the troops, listening to the people that are running the Iraqi government.",
        "What does this mean for the American people?",
        "Well, it means that frankly that the surge is working, as Donna mentioned.",
        "It also means that 3,500 troops per month, if everything goes well, will be coming home starting next month.",
        "It also means that the president really needs to explain to the American people, in layman's terms, what all these means to the American people tomorrow when he addresses the nation."

        "This also means, from a political standpoint, that everyone that's running for president right now, particularly the frontrunners, have a little bit of breathing room right now where they can simply say, you know what, the president finally is listening to us.",
        "The American people finally have spoken, and the president has listened, and the troops are finally going to come home.",
        "Albeit not fast, it will be somewhat slow, but again, progress is being made.",
        "Donna, I want to move on to one more thing.",
        "The Petraeus report has overshadowed basically the campaign.",
        "Well, the campaign had been making so many headlines - presidential campaign.",
        "But last week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared on CNN, and the subject of immigration came up when Glenn Beck, the host, said, is illegal immigration a crime?",
        "Giuliani said, no. And when Beck asked if it should be illegal, Giuliani again said no because the government wouldn't be able to prosecute everyone who broke the law.",
        "Was this a surprising answer, and does it go against his, you know, myth or ethos rather, as someone who is really against terrorism and is for strong borders?",
        "You know, Rudy Giuliani is running against his record as a mayor.",
        "He, as mayor, he openly supported the immigrants coming in to New York City.",
        "He established a sanctuary in New York City.",
        "He said that the federal government should not force, you know, cities to impose penalties and fines.",
        "So he's running against his previous record.",
        "I - look, I think this is going to hurt him.",
        "In the Republican primary he's already hurt, the issue of immigration has hurt John McCain.",
        "The conservatives believe that we should have close borders.",
        "Borders - fences as high as you could see.",
        "And subpoena wise, those that have been here illegal and then send them all home.",
        "So I think Rudy, right now, is in deep trouble with his conservative - with establishing his conservative credentials on immigration reform.",
        "Robert, do you think that this is going to undermine him, especially now that Senator Fred Thompson is in the game and he has been getting a lot of traction?",
        "Yes.",
        "Farai, six months ago, if Fred Thompson was on the race and Mayor Giuliani would have made that statement, I would have said he's going to be fine.",
        "But now that Senator Thompson is in the race and he's running to the right, if you will, of Mayor Giuliani, this does hurt Mayor Giuliani.",
        "And, frankly, I think if he had to take that answer back, he would.",
        "And this is really not an issue of just what conservatives think.",
        "I disagree with Donna to a certain degree.",
        "This is what Americans think.",
        "The overall majority of Americans want our borders closed, number one.",
        "But also, number two and even more importantly, they want to make sure that every single person that comes to this country is documented.",
        "It's just as very simple as that.",
        "And so, yes, this will hurt Mayor Giuliani, particularly in New Hampshire as well as obviously in Nevada and South Carolina, some of the more conservative primaries around the country.",
        "Would he be able to recover from this?",
        "I'm sure he will.",
        "But if I'm Senator Thompson and also Senator McCain, I would hammer him on this big-time.",
        "What about evangelicals?",
        "Each of you - I'm going to go with you first, Robert - evangelicals have played such a big role in many previous elections, are they a bit cutout now that there is not as much of a traditional evangelical message from any of the Republican candidates or the Democrats?",
        "Well, that's a very interesting question because there really isn't a bona fide frontrunner right now that really speaks to evangelicals.",
        "The only one that really comes close is Governor Huckabee who is a former governor of Arkansas.",
        "Mike Huckabee is a minister.",
        "He is a social conservative.",
        "He speaks their language.",
        "The problem is that he's not really catching on as much as he would like to."

        "It turns out one of his campaign ads popped up on Amazon.com's Web site, but on the page for a new book that's highly critical of the Israel lobby.",
        "And Obama has been really delicate with the lobby since making a string of statements that have made him appear less sympathetic to its cause than some of the other candidates.",
        "The Obama camp withdrew the ad, even though it wasn't something that they sought, saying that its appearance was coincidental.",
        "And it's the haste with which they removed the ad that has a lot of people in Washington talking.",
        "So do you think that he overreacted to something that wasn't his decision?",
        "Well, I'm sure his campaign made the decision after seeing the ad appear on a site that don't carry his views or his values.",
        "Look, Senator Obama who I still believe is in the hunt to replace Senator Clinton as the frontrunner, is a strong viable candidate that must bring together the Democratic Party in order to win the nomination.",
        "He's out there today in Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "He's running very hard on his position on Iraq, but this ad may have caused his campaign a little bit of embarrassment.",
        "I think he did the right thing in moving and if it's not consistent of what he's trying to put out there.",
        "Robert, could this backfire with some black voters?",
        "And what I mean by this is that many African-American voters, and of course, there's not a monolithic group of people, are critical of the Israel lobby.",
        "Could this backfire with some black voters who say he's bent over backwards?",
        "I'm not sure.",
        "I think, you know, interesting enough, I think Senator Obama has proven himself to the black community that he is a bona fide candidate that's credible, that is seasoned on their, quote, unquote, \"\"issues.\"\" He's also proven himself that he is also a mainstream candidate that, frankly, can transcend, if you will, race and ethnicity.",
        "So I don't see this going anywhere, Farai.",
        "And I think the main reason why is because, as you mentioned, his campaign moved as very quickly off the Internet.",
        "Six months ago, a year ago, Senator Obama's campaign probably didn't move that swiftly.",
        "But, if you take a look at his seasoned staff, if you take a look at, frankly, how much he's grown politically over the last six months, you could see that, obviously, this was a big mistake on their part and they very quickly corrected it."
