        "Yes.",
        "I think that certainly was one of the hopes.",

        "I mean, it's not a popularity contest.",

        "Robert Downey, Jr. was nominated for \"\"Tropic Thunder,\"\" which is not necessarily a traditional awardsy kind of movie.",
        "And in fact, in a lot of ways, I think the road to his getting the nomination started with his performance in \"\"Iron Man,\"\" which came out not too long before, in which he was fantastic.",
        "And I think the combination of those two performances in really blockbuster, summer kind of movies, sort of - in a little bit - you know, combined to give him a little momentum toward that nomination.",
        "Let's see if we get some callers in on the conversation.",
        "Who do you think Oscar smiled upon properly?",
        "Who do you think he snubbed?",

        "Curious, the case of \"\"Benjamin Button\"\"?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And did it deserve - I mean, it did cause a lot of buzz, and it's also caused the sales of a lot of extra bags of malted milk balls, as people realized you had to pack a lunch to get through it."

        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "I mean, I think - one of the things I thought was so interesting that I commented on this morning is that it also managed to get a nomination for its director, which, given the fact that I think even a lot of people who liked it thought it was easily 45 minutes too long, it's sort of interesting to see it come away with not only the nomination for, you know, Best Picture and Brad Pitt, but also for the director who, you know, couldn't part, I guess, with any of those 45 minutes.",

        "Yeah.",

        "There isn't a lot - I think had they come out before \"\"Slumdog Millionaire\"\" kind of made its push in the last just couple few weeks, when it started to become a lot more widely known - that one would've seemed a little bit more like a sleeper.",
        "But at this point, there really were very few surprises - a couple of nominations for \"\"Frozen River,\"\" which is sort of a smaller independent movie.",
        "But other than that, a lot of what everybody expected to see.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Angelina Jolie was nominated for \"\"Changeling,\"\" which he directed, and I think, you know, a lot of people did expect \"\"Gran Torino\"\" to get at least something, probably a nomination, either for Best Picture - there was sort of a fifth slot.",
        "I think a lot of people thought that several of the nominees were sort of locked in, but there was an understanding that the slot that ultimately went to \"\"The Reader\"\" was potentially available to a bunch of different movies, and I think \"\"Gran Torino\"\" was one.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And this was also thought to be perhaps his last movie as an actor and sometimes Oscar - the Academy will go out of its way to smile upon a performance that is deemed to be the last, one way or another.",

        "I'm just surprised to hear it, not because there's necessarily anything wrong with that, but it's not something that I've heard as much, in the sense that the reviews were not great, the box office was not great.",
        "So, it's not necessarily - frankly, to tell you the truth, I didn't see it.",
        "But it hasn't certainly had as much, you know, awards buzz.",
        "I think it's not - I'll put it this way, it's not surprising that it didn't get a nomination today."

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think its sort of depends on what your approach is to the subject matter.",
        "I think the subject matter was - the movie was very specifically intended to be about a sub-culture within professional wrestling.",
        "It's not professional wrestling like you would've seen on, you know, Saturday mornings as a kid.",
        "It's a brand of professional wrestling that takes place in sort of, you know, gyms and, you know, places like that.",
        "It's not, you know, widely attended, and it is extraordinarily brutal and violent.",
        "And I think everybody who knows anything about it has said, whatever else it is, the movie's very true to what that kind of wrestling is actually like.",
        "But yes, a lot of people really cringed at it.",
        "Jennifer, what did you particularly like about it?",
        "Well, I think that the important thing to realize is that, although the movie was violent, it was really important for Darren Aronofsky to establish the brutality of the sport and the brutality of the career, and yet, Randy the Ram is so tender on the inside.",
        "So, I really like that juxtaposition between the tough exterior, the game - the play of wrestling and then his emotional soft inside.",
        "And that was a really nice interplay between those two."

        "Certainly, I think topical movies, as well biographical movies - and those sort of are both biographical movies, in addition to being topical - have a lot of awards-pulling history.",
        "I was a much bigger fan of \"\"Milk\"\" than I was of \"\"Frost/Nixon.\"\" In fact, I would've rewarded the performance by Michael Sheen as David Frost over the Franklin John Nixon performance, which didn't move me as much.",

        "And I know that most critics, like Roger Ebert, right off the bat said, hey, this won't get nominated, but it is the best picture of the year.",
        "And the critics - he's write - went crazy for this film.",
        "They sure did, but a lot of people said from the beginning, it is so challenging.",
        "It's almost like you can - a movie can be challenging up to a point and still get a lot of award nominations, but there's such a thing as it being so challenging and so difficult for people to sort of process and have kind of a wide popular conversation about that you don't necessarily get the kind of recognition in awards contexts.",
        "I wasn't terribly surprised by it, but I sort of understand the disappointment.",
        "Josh, what did you particularly like about the film?",

        "I mean, it's not very often that we get to watch a movie that's at least somewhat wide-released that actually makes you think about it, instead of just watch it."
