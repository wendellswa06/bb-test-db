        "Is there a certain level of success it has to achieve to be considered, even for a small film?",
        "You know, I think that's a good question.",
        "I think, as I said - I don't think any of the movies that are nominated for Best Picture are extremely small movies, but if you look at \"\"The Reader\"\" certainly, I think it's relatively obscure, other than the fact that it has Kate Winslet in it, who has gotten, you know, a fair amount of recognition for that performance.",

        "Yeah, that's a really interesting story, because she really only has the one scene in this movie, and it's already a movie that's dominated by these three much better known, much sort of more awards-friendly actors.",
        "And she comes on in this one scene, and it just blows you away.",
        "To me, it's the most emotionally true part of the movie.",
        "And it's very - it's a very brave performance in the sense that she looks very out of control in it - her nose is running, and she's sort of very desperate.",
        "And it's a great, great scene, and you can sort of see how, you know, just that one scene would get you a nomination.",

        "No.",
        "I think the Academy - you know, I personally think \"\"Dark Night\"\" was much more - was a much better film, but again, because, as you mentioned, it's a superhero film, so it doesn't deserve it, whereas a movie that, you know, kind of lauds a political hero does deserve it, in the eyes of the Academy.",
        "OK.",
        "Yeah, and I do understand of what you're saying.",
        "I think there's a lot of, you know, history surrounding Sean Penn in particular that's - would tend to support that idea.",
        "But I think in this case there's a decent argument to be made that the movie might have succeeded anyway, and certainly for Sean Penn, it's really easy to look at this now and say, now it's been really successful, now it's done great.",

        "And I think for people who did think that it was sort of a masterpiece of pop filmmaking, which is kind of, you know, a popular view of it, they're going to take that opportunity to honor the movie, as well as the performance.",
