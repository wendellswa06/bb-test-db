        "One man I spoke to for the piece, who I call Simon, went into a long-term relationship in 2007, so just as iPhones were coming out.",
        "And when he came out of the relationship in 2014, he was struck by how much weirder it seemed to sort of strike up a conversation with someone in a bar.",
        "He has since found another long-term relationship through an app.",
        "He described it as sort of having stepped out of a time machine.",
        "So that - and we should say there are a lot of different factors at play - but just taken together what we've talked about so far, I mean, one thing that might be happening is people are making these authentic, natural connections in person less.",
        "And some of those relationships might lead to, you know, long-term relationships and thus maybe sex.",
        "And we're spending a lot more time on dating apps, where we're not necessarily getting those connections, but we're losing a lot of time.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "Also, dating apps can be demoralizing.",
        "You have a lot of rejection experiences.",
        "And people are really judging each other more on appearance.",
        "So for people who are less physically attractive, you have less chance to shine for other reasons - because you're funny, say, or kind or all the other things that you take in when you're interacting with a person off screen.",
        "You said that porn is also playing a significant role in perhaps the drop in the amount of sex that Americans are having.",
        "Explain that for me.",
        "So this is a really complicated question.",
        "And unfortunately, the research is not as extensive as we'd like it to be.",
        "We can, however, say that this development does seem to have coincided with some things that clearly are porn-related.",
        "One of those is what seems to be a real rise in the prevalence of masturbation.",
        "That's not solely related, but it does have something to do with porn clearly.",
        "Another sort of interesting effect has to do with learning about sex from porn.",
        "For people who are inexperienced and sort of decide to try moves that they've seen on screen in the real world with a partner, I heard again and again it just may not go over well.",
        "And it may lead your partner to sort of be scared off in future.",
        "Wow.",
        "So porn can either cause people to do something that can replace sex or cause partners to not want to have sex with you, both of which might explain why we're seeing these numbers drop.",
        "It seems so, yes.",
        "The trends you're seeing - is this primarily a heterosexual phenomenon?",
        "This is a fascinating question.",
        "It's difficult to answer because the research on non-heterosexual dating relationships is really limited.",
        "One researcher at Stanford has made an effort to sort of oversample people who don't identify as straight in his research.",
        "What he's found suggests that they have more active dating lives, which raises the intriguing possibility that this phenomenon that I'm describing may be more prevalent among straight people."

        "One was tied to the agricultural revolution 10 to 15,000 years ago and the second being tied to this moment.",

        "That's dramatic.",
