        "And the fact of the matter is there possibly could have been many attacks, it's just that you weren't able to measure them.",
        "So I totally agree with you - I appreciate your work because what it does is, as far as force protection measures, it causes us in the military to consider that foremost.",
        "And so we protect our soldiers and protect our, you know, our bases and whatnot because we know that's a tactic.",

        "And maybe you're right.",
        "Maybe we missed a handful.",

        "It's about the foreign - our military presence on the Arabian Peninsula in the 1990s, Neal.",
        "See, what most Americans either haven't known or haven't remembered is that 1990 was a watershed year in our military deployment to the Arabian peninsula.",
        "Yes, before 1990, we had a few advisors with side arms - mostly Marines with a pistol standing in front of an embassy - but no tanks, no fighter aircraft, no armor units, going all the way back to World War II.",
        "We put them in August 1990 in order to kick Saddam out of Kuwait.",

        "Does your guest think recruits would be as forthcoming if there was no belief in heavenly rewards for martyrdom?",
        "Actually, we have a large number of secular suicide terrorists.",
        "For many decades, the world leader in suicide terrorism around the world was not at a group that was coming at us or coming at our allies, and they're also not an Islamic group.",
        "They were the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a Marxist group, a secular group, a Hindu group.",
        "The secular Tamil Tigers, who had no belief in the afterlife, did more suicide attacks than Hamas.",
        "Further, we have plenty of secular Muslim suicide terrorist groups, such as the PKK in Turkey, which is another Marxist, read anti-religious, suicide terrorist group.",
        "And the reason for that is because if, as I'm suggesting, it's foreign occupation which is really the driving trigger that's triggering both religious and secular suicide terrorists, secular suicide terrorists can readily believe they're going to become heroes."

        "Do you feel that the economics of the societies that generate suicide terrorism, do they have a lack of individualism, of individualist capitalism, and is that a role in the philosophy that people have, which leads them to make selfless acts of killing themselves?",
        "I really don't think that that plays much of a role.",
        "It may well do in ways we cannot track empirically with the data.",

        "So we often see different religions, where Christians occupying Muslims.",
        "Or in the case of Sri Lanka, it's Buddhists occupying Hindus.",
        "And so when you have that religious difference, there is a role for religion in the recruiting of suicide attackers, but it's not in the promise of the afterlife.",
        "It's in scaring the local community about the religion of the occupier.",
        "So the terrorist leader, when there's a religious difference, can go to the local community and give speeches and say that occupier is driven by religion.",

        "Starting in 1998, the Israeli government started a policy that when there was a suicide attacker, a Palestinian suicide attacker, they would respond and destroy not just the home of the suicide attacker but five homes of the nearest friends or family member of the suicide attacker, basically from 1998 to 2003 destroying over 500 homes to absolutely make sure there was no economic benefit.",
        "Well, when they destroyed those homes, it did nothing but fuel more attacks, I'm afraid.",
