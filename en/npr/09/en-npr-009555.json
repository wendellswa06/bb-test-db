        "So think about it for a moment.",
        "What I'm saying is that the local occupation is putting at risk the local community's way of life.",
        "Well, if the local community could still secure themselves, become stronger, then they'd have more confidence in their future way of life.",
        "Well, that idea of empowering local groups, that's what helped in Iraq in 2007.",
        "You see, the success of helping end the violence we attribute to the thing called a surge in Iraq is really attributable directly in Anbar province to the empowerment of Iraqis to protect themselves.",
        "Essentially, we paid 100,000 Sunni terrorists $300 a month in Anbar province to do one thing: don't kill us.",
        "You can go buy guns with that.",
        "You can have political power with that.",
        "But don't kill us, and you get $300 a month paycheck.",
        "Well, that worked wonderfully to bring down, actually, about 40 percent of the suicide terrorism - not quite - not anywhere all of it, but about 40 percent.",
        "And that in combination with what we're doing now - the withdrawal of the ground forces - is why Iraq is so stable today.",
        "A little more complicated.",
        "And inform on those scary guys over there who are still trying to kill us, and you, for working with us now - and so it became a self-reinforcing mechanism, under some question now.",
        "But if this were true, if this hypothesis is correct, why, then, the lack of suicide attacks against colonial occupiers around the world in the 19th century, in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, in other places?",
        "Why is this suddenly a phenomenon of the last 30 years?",
        "Because technology does matter.",
        "The spread of the small arms revolution in the 20th century; explosives, all around the colonial empire in the late 20th century, in the mid-20th century really enables the phenomenon of suicide bombing that we're familiar with today."
