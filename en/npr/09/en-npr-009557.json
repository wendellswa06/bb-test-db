        "So this tweet from President Trump about the issue of land reform in South Africa was probably the first time a lot of Americans had heard of the issue.",
        "But this has been an issue, a very polarizing and emotional issue, in South Africa for a long time now.",
        "So what does land reform mean in South Africa?",
        "So land reform has been a debate that has been around South Africa since the end of apartheid.",
        "And basically, what it is is the idea that the black population of South Africa, which is the majority, needs to have the land redressed.",
        "So you remember with apartheid that black people were systematically removed from their farms, from their homes.",
        "So for example, you saw black families being huddled into, like, a tiny part of the country, like, only between 10 and 15 percent.",
        "That was the only area they were allowed to own land.",
        "And that just became smaller and smaller.",
        "You found that in the 1950s and '60s where black people who had lived in areas that were now suddenly demarcated white areas, you would find the police rolling into those neighborhoods and literally bulldozing black homes because those were now white areas.",
        "So after 1994, one of the many things that need to be addressed in South Africa is the fact that black people own just over 1 percent - even today - just over 1 percent of rural land, and they own less than 10 percent of urban land.",
        "And that is 80 percent of the population.",
        "So let's fact-check specific phrases, if we could sort of take them apart.",
        "President Trump said that the government is now seizing land from white farmers.",
        "Is that true?",
        "So that is incorrect.",
        "There's a lot of misinformation and confusion around the farm seizures.",
        "So our constitution has always had a clause that allows for the seizure of land.",
        "So now we are asking, well, what does that mean - if the Constitution says that you can seize land to redress the past, what does that mean?",
        "So what South Africa is doing - and this is quite boring and, frankly, unsexy - is that the president has appointed a committee, and the committee is going to all nine provinces, to small towns and big cities, and they are having a long, drawn-out meetings with everybody to discuss with them what land reform means to them and how we'll do it.",
        "U.S.",
        "Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns is taking steps to try to get the beef trade with Japan reopened.",
        "For one thing, he's requiring that all export shipments to any country now, get inspected twice.",

        "My family was taken off the land - for example, a black family.",
        "You're seeing white families, especially young, white men who say that South Africa's the only country we've known, and our concern is that if you drive us off, where will we go?",
        "So we're having a real dialogue.",
        "But instead, what's happening is that this misinformation is hijacking the conversation from a far more rational debate that's supposed to happen.",
        "President Trump also referred to the large-scale killing of farmers.",
        "Is that true?",
        "So there has been a growing narrative, and it's really catching hold in the United States, particularly among the \"\"alt-right,\"\" or shall we just call them white supremacists?",
        "And what they're doing is that they're saying - alleging that there is a genocide in South Africa.",
        "And over and over, South Africans have said, there is no genocide here.",
        "But there's an argument here that white farmers are being targeted.",
        "But the reality on the ground is that the farm murders peaked in 2002 and was around about 150, and they've now decreased to less than 50.",
        "In some cases, there are arguments that the crimes are racially motivated, but in a lot of the cases, they're just seen as plain crime.",
        "And the frustrating thing is that when you make it out as if white people are the main victims of crime, you ignore the fact that the highest victims of crime and murder in South Africa are actually young black men.",
        "So it just completely colors who the victim is.",
        "And I think that it rolls back the hard work the majority of South Africans have been doing to try and reconcile after the terrible injustice that was apartheid."
