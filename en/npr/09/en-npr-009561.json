        "He is prepared, I think, to walk away from the deal when he is poised to make a decision on the continuing adherence to the agreement as required by waiving sanctions next week.",
        "We've all been poised waiting for this decision.",
        "And I think what we're seeing today is a president who feels more secure in his own mind that Iran is not a country that can be trusted - that he himself maybe has produced a set of circumstances that may lead to a resolution of North Korea's nuclear program.",
        "And he may be even more inclined to move in a direction that sets the United States and Iran on a path to, I think, what will be a very dangerous situation.",
        "What are you going to be listening for going forward?",
        "Well, the president's hearing from multiple voices.",

        "And Mr. Pronk has been told before by officials in New York to stop writing his blog.",
        "That it had become something of an embarrassment.",
        "But he persisted all the same and he persisted with extremely frank comments about his analysis of the situation in Darfur.",
        "That's why when Mr. Pronk arrives in New York - probably later today or tomorrow - he won't be guaranteed a sympathetic reception.",
        "Some people will be saying to him I told you so.",
        "You should have been writing these sort of comments on the Internet.",

        "There's nothing inaccurate in what's he's saying, is there?",
        "Not really, no. The - what Mr. Pronk is saying is being backed by journalists who've been in the area.",
        "I personally have been in the area in the last month and have seen very similar things to what Mr. Pronk is talking about.",
        "I think what they're so upset about is they regard this as stepping outside of his role as the head of the United Nations in Sudan, that it isn't up to him to be providing this sort of information about the fate of the Sudanese military.",
        "For the last six weeks they've been attempting to achieve a military solution, pursuing rebel movements, and really that seems to have achieved very little apart from displacing tens of thousands more people from their homes in Darfur and driving them out towards camps.",
        "There was a very powerful piece last night on 60 Minutes, which included probably illegal incursion into the Darfur area by an American journalist and a former U.S.",

        "That diplomat said he thinks that the U.S.",
        "government is actually complicit because it relies on the government of Sudan for information in the war on terror and so it's not as tough with Sudan as it should be.",
        "Do people in Khartoum believe that's true?",
        "Well, the relationship between Sudan and the United States is a very complex one.",
        "On the surface, the United States shuns Sudan.",
        "It regards it as a state sponsor of terrorism, there are American sanctions on Sudan.",
        "But on the other hand, there's an acknowledgement that the United States needs Sudan's help.",
        "Of course, Sudan has, in the past, hosted terrorists such as Osama bin Laden and there are still people here who have links to terrorist organizations.",
        "But on the surface - and certainly in the public domain - it's a hostile relationship.",
        "Sudan regularly denounces the United States and its intentions towards Sudan.",
        "And in return, the United States have adopted a fairly hostile attitude to Sudan, in trying to persuade it to accept the United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur."
