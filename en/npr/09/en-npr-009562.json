        "We are in this rut of constantly doing wrong.",
        "So it's, like, how do you trust a party like that, and how do you go out and be an activist, an organizer and support the party when we're constantly having these issues arise?",
        "And that distrust extends to the Democratic nominee herself.",
        "Gigi Traore already sees Clinton as being in a state of perpetual scandal.",

        "If the Clinton campaign or Mrs. Clinton herself will come and say, I apologize for X, Y, Z - like, take ownership of what she did do wrong instead of scapegoating around it or nobody asked me - that's not what a leader does.",
        "A leader shows up and says, you know what; I messed up; I apologize.",
        "That for me would be, like, refreshing.",
        "So what's next?",
        "Traore is resolutely against Donald Trump.",

        "She says the progressive left is looking for some wins, and the party has made some nods in their direction.",
        "The party's reviewing the use of superdelegates, the party officials who get to vote any way they like in the nomination process.",
        "And Lynch credits Sanders for influencing the party platform in ways that would have been unimaginable years before, like a call to abolish the death penalty and support for a $15 minimum wage.",
        "Do you think that he has had a profound influence in the direction of the party and voters like yourself have had an influence, and is that enough for you?",
        "The first part - I agree.",
        "Absolutely it's had an influence on our party.",

        "She isn't just thinking about whether or not she will vote for Hillary Clinton this fall.",
        "It's too soon, and her feelings are too raw to answer that right now.",
        "For her it's about all those enthusiastic kids she's met along the way.",
        "Because I think for a lot of young people, they don't - and this is not a criticism - they don't have life's experiences.",
        "You know, when you've lived - Bernie and I've lived 74 years, and you see the waxes and wanes of things.",
        "It's not about the immediate gratification.",
        "Even if I try to talk to them and say, hey, wait this out; trust that, you know, we can make things better, they don't have that long-term perspective to know that.",
        "And back here in the convention hall, we actually received a text later on today from Anita Lynch - Scott Horsley, she's from your home town of Denver - saying, quote, \"\"it's wild in here; we Bernie people are not happy campers.\"\" Talk about the ways the party has tried to mollify Sanders' supporters.",
        "Well, they've done a number of things.",
        "We mentioned Wasserman Schultz's resignation and then agreeing to even hand over the gavel for this convention.",
        "There's also a primetime speaking role tonight for Elizabeth Warren, darling of the party's progressive wing.",
        "And as you mentioned, the DNC has agreed to a study of the way future primaries are conduction to de-emphasize the roll of those superdelegates who overwhelmingly backed Hillary Clinton this year.",
        "We just heard a short time ago a presentation about that recommendation to study superdelegates both from a spokesperson from the Clinton camp and for the Sanders camp.",
        "And that certainly got some of the loudest applause that we've heard this evening."

        "So does that suggest that he's feeling the heat from Texas Senator Ted Cruz?",
        "He's feeling the heat, but he also senses opportunity, right?",
        "These guys are clearly the two big, big guys here.",
        "The polls tell us that, but also their organization and just kind of their footprint in the state tells us that - so two events today for Donald Trump, both in Christian conservative strongholds, the kind of places that Ted Cruz goes for votes.",

        "And, of course, this follows the appearance earlier this week with Trump of Sarah Palin, who endorsed him.",
