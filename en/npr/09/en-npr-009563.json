        "Let's talk about these couple of new brain studies that came out this week.",
        "This first one, the researchers were looking at how the brain forms memories what - give us a little thumbnail sketch of that study.",
        "Oh well, I think this is really quite an important advance and gives us a keen new insight into how the brain, as a whole, works.",
        "It's based on the study of rats learning to run a maze.",
        "And we've met sometime that these - that the initial memories of learning a maze are laid down in cells in the hippocampus, that's a substructure deep in the brain.",
        "And they are recorded in what the scientists refer to as place cells, because as the rat passes each point in the maze, a different one of these place cells will light up.",
        "So you couldn't tell where a rat is in the maze by looking at your recording systems and seeing in which of its place cells is active.",
        "So this gives you a very good handle on memories, because it turned out that these - that the memory of running a maze is played back, as you just said, when the rats pauses for a while or when he's sleep.",
        "You can see these place cells firing.",
        "Very interesting - it's in reverse order of the route that is traveled.",
        "So you see the place cells are firing again in a very distinctive cascade in the opposite of the way the maze was run.",
        "So that's what the - Matthew Wilson of MIT reported.",
        "I think it was in February of this year.",
        "And now he's looked to see if he can see the same trace elsewhere in the brain.",
        "So it was thought the initial memories were laid down here in hippocampus.",
        "But they sort of seem to disappear from there.",
        "And then we see - we know that long-term memories reside in the cortex, that's sort of sheet of cells on - of cells on the outside of the brain which is the sort of seat of consciousness in the higher cognitive functions.",
        "So it's been a big question as how do - how do memories can get transferred, if that's what's happening, from the hippocampus to the cortex.",
        "So (unintelligible) reported last week, what (Unintelligible) his colleague Dr. G(ph) did, was they - this time they put electrodes both in the hippocampus and in one part of the cortex - the visual part of the cortex, the one that deals with sight.",
        "And interestingly they found the distinctive memory, the sort of reverse, rewind was placed both in the hippocampus and in the visual cortex during sleep.",
        "So this is the first time that we've known that the cortex also has its equivalent of place cells.",
        "So these would have been the cells, I guess that the rat is - it will be the places where the rat is sort of seeing things in the maze corresponding to the actual location that's in the hypothalamus.",
        "So the rat is replaying this in fast-rewind.",
