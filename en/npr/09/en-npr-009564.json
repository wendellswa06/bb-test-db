        "I always think of Pluto as a planet.",

        "One of his students and eventual colleagues, Steven Levitt, took a look at which economist in recent years had inspired the most research by other economists.",
        "Levitt, the co-author of the best-selling book \"\"Freakanomics,\"\" found that Becker was by far the most often cited.",
        "Part of the reason for his influence was that Becker pushed the use of economic theory into the social realm, studying marriage, drug addiction, crime and racial discrimination.",
        "In an interview on this program on the day he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1992, he talked about the marriage market.",
        "It's not an organized market the way the stock market is or a bazaar is in the Middle East, but it's a market nevertheless with the property that there are different people in this who are looking to get married.",
        "Not everybody can marry the same wonderful man or woman, and they have to make choices.",
        "And they may have met somebody who they're pretty happy with.",
        "They wonder about whether if they'd waited they'd meet somebody better, and these are the kinds of choices one makes in other markets.",
        "So using market as a metaphor, but I think it's a very good metaphor for what goes on here.",
        "Becker basically argued that people operate as rational agents in every aspect of life.",
        "That sparked controversy when he concluded that many people who choose a life of crime are making a rational choice based on opportunities, risks, and rewards.",
        "Our brains are very good at extracting meaning from the data.",
