        "There was a study out there recently, I remember reading in the journals about people who have sleep apnea, having bad memories because they're not asleep, their memories, like mine, are just gone.",
        "But if they gave them this positive airway mask to use that within a matter of weeks, their memories improved dramatically.",
        "Are you familiar with that one at all?",
        "Did you come across that?",
        "I'm not familiar with that study, but it's very interesting and it seems to point in the same direction that sleep is very necessary for whatever this purpose is.",
        "And clearly, when one needs to take the brain offline so they can perform this processing, and they didn't take it offline, then the system gets degraded?",
        "Yeah, we've had Robert Stickgold come on, he's a sleep specialist and say that if you don't get a certain amount of - number of hours of sleep a night - and again, he's done it with his undergraduates.",
        "I think it's seven - was the magic number.",
        "If you don't get seven hours of sleep a night.",
        "You don't consolidate a lot of talents like playing an instrument, new kinds of things you want to learn unless you get a lot - enough of that sleep at night.",

        "So anything from here, Nick, I know you're not the researcher on this one.",
        "Do you expect any follow up to the brain?",
        "I mean, is it possible to do this in people that we do not how to put electrodes in our heads, but maybe on the outside in some way - non-invasive way?",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, we allow electrodes if you have to go the brain for some other reasons, for some - to treat seizures or something.",
        "And then, you have a few minutes in which you can put electrodes in.",
        "But I don't think you can get to these recordings from the exterior of the brain.",
        "You need to put the electrodes right in.",
        "I think there will be lots of follow-ups, and this is just - I hope we have this handle, which is you know looking for these distinctive fast rewinds.",
        "I mean, this is a field of research they can take a long way.",
        "I think they can try and learn, exactly what is the nature of the dialogue between the hippocampus and the cortex.",
        "And this is a consolidation of memory as you're suggesting, or is it the cortex trying to build up models in understanding the outside world.",
        "I mean, the answers to these questions may be emerging for the first time.",
        "I want to thank you Nick for taking time to - out of your busy schedule - to be with us today in a holiday season.",
