        "What we've learned is the laws do not sufficiently separate big time career offenders from lower level offenders.",
        "So this bill sponsored by Senator Durbin would target to non violent offenders in drug cases, people who didn't use firearms when they were committing these crimes, and who have no ties to big gangs or cartels.",
        "And Durbin's bill would allow judges to cut mandatory minimum sentences in half for a lot of these drug crimes.",
        "And we should say there definitely has been some push back, right, from prosecutors and also law and order Republicans in Congress.",
        "Detail their objection.",
        "Yeah, the main concern, Audie, seems to be public safety.",
        "Violent crime has reached historic lows over the last decade or so and some federal and state prosecutors, as well as some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, are worried that if you cut back on some of these penalties, violent crime could creep back up again.",

        "SEN.",

        "The supposedly non violent offenders this bill addresses are mostly drug dealers.",
        "Maybe they used no violence in committing this particular crime, but maybe their co defendants carried the gun in committing their drug offense.",
        "Essentially, Audie, with Senator Grassley is saying here is that prosecutors should be the deciders and should continue to hold the reins.",
        "And, you know, Senator Grassley did score one victory today, Audie.",
        "To the dismay of advocacy groups representing inmates, he actually got the committee to approve two new mandatory minimum sentences for domestic violence and sexual abuse offenders.",

        "I mean, jeez, she got her records played, she sold a million copies.",
        "But it was about, she probably could have sold 10 million copies if she had had the same amount of exposure as Georgia Gibbs.",
        "And so that's part of the equation, is that we had these wonderful artists who, in some instances back in the day, as my sons would say, they couldn't even have their pictures on the album covers because the marketing people thought that it might hurt their sales.",

        "This is an idea that's been kicking around for many years.",
        "It pre-dates Paul Ryan.",

        "They're going to go out and buy health insurance, and they're going to buy as much health insurance as the federal government will pay for.",

        "It's no longer going to be on the federal government.",
        "So that will limit the federal government's risk.",
        "And that will be, yes, a good way to save money for the federal budget, but it will also change the face of how Medicare works.",
        "That's the really big change that it would make it Medicare, and that's something that obviously leads to the phrase that Democrats say: It would end Medicare as we know it.",

        "This is a piece of the Republican mantra, which is that they say cut taxes, that people who pay taxes - particularly wealthier people - will go out and create more jobs, and it will boost the economy.",
        "And we should not forget Medicaid, which is now the biggest of the health insurance programs.",
        "They would turn Medicaid back to the states.",
        "They would cut Medicaid.",
        "They say states can do this with less money, and they would let states do whatever they want with Medicaid.",
        "So - basically, those three things would be huge, huge changes.",
