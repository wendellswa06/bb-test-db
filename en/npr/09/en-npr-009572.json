        "The title of a new movie evokes the darkness of night - half past midnight, to be exact, and the secrecy shrouding a high stakes intelligence mission, the hunt for Osama bin Laden.",
        "Zero Dark Thirty\"\" traces that mission to its conclusion with the Navy SEALS raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan.",
        "That story is told from the perspective of a small team of CIA agents, mostly working out of a dreary office in Pakistan under intense pressure to find the allusive al-Qaida leader.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"\"ZERO DARK THIRTY\"\")",
        "Zero Dark Thirty\"\" is directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by journalist Mark Boal, the team behind the Oscar-winning Iraq war drama \"\"The Hurt Locker.\"\" \"\"Zero Dark Thirty\"\" plays like a thriller involving a mysterious courier who could lead to bin Laden.",
        "It's based on extensive real world reporting and its first moments are real - 911 audio recordings of people trapped in the World Trade Center.",
        "For us, the story begins with 9/11, so the question arose of how do you remind the audience of 9/11 without being gratuitous and without showing the imagery that I think has been played out to the point of becoming something other than it was.",
        "And the audio tracks, to us, seemed like an appropriate way of re-creating that moment, and then allowing us to begin our story of the intelligence hunt.",
        "I think it emotionally grounds the film and it gives you a context immediately.",
        "At the heart of the movie, the main character in \"\"Zero Dark Thirty\"\" is a young woman, CIA agent.",
        "She's called Maya, based, I gather, on a real person.",
        "What was the moment that you realized that a young woman was going to be at the center of this hunt and kill?",
        "I think Mark was probably about a month to two months into his reporting, and he realized that there was one woman in particular that really captivated his, you know, his interest.",
        "And so we began to talk about it, and you know, obviously as the material developed and he was writing it into a screenplay, realizing that she was probably the best conduit through whom we could tell this story.",
        "Were you able to talk to her?"

        "I will say that the movie is largely based on firsthand accounts of people that were involved, but having said that, I don't think we're going to ever really get into the weeds of who we spoke to or who we didn't speak to.",
        "Let's listen to a scene from the movie where Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, is briefing the Navy SEAL team about her theory on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, who's also referred to here as UBL.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"\"ZERO DARK THIRTY\"\")",
        "That is the driving drama of this film, this one person's vision that she won't let go of.",
        "She really is extremely persuasive and she drives this theory certainly up the food chain to a point where a credible response seems to be necessitated as a result of her persuasiveness.",
        "You know, there were many leads floating around.",
        "There'd be money on the table if you came in and you gave information about the location of, in this case, UBL.",
        "There was also bin Laden's' family, tracking his family.",
        "So those were the two that were extremely popular at the time.",
        "And the idea that the courier would lead you to him was perhaps slightly less popular, but as she explains in the movie, there is only two people of whom information was withheld by the people that they asked.",
        "And that was the courier and Osama bin Laden himself.",
        "And so she ascribed great significance to that absence of information.",
        "The movie depicts interrogations at a secret CIA site.",
        "Everybody understands that those existed.",
        "There's been talk now for years about torture.",

        "And I think that really contributed to how the whole last act unfolds.",
        "And you know, believe me, a pitch-black set with a hundred-member crew and 22 Seals is an interesting experience in and of itself.",

        "And in July 1987, the very first Tamil Tiger suicide attack occurred when a person by the name of Captain Miller drove a truck into a barracks of Sinhalese army troops who were sleeping, effectively trying to copy that attack.",
        "And that then set off the entire wave that came over the - over the next 20-something years.",
        "Now when you say they copied the attack, was there - and you say there was contact between the Tamil Tigers and Hezbollah.",
        "Were there -did they received training from Hezbollah, or was it simply a matter of learning about it via the media and then trying to imitate it?",
        "How does it…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Training is probably a little too much here, because it's really more of the demonstration.",
        "And it's - when I say copy, I mean, the tactic of a single driver of a truck, a truck that's laden with explosives, that's attacking a camp, an army camp early in the morning, and is essentially attacking a barracks of sleeping soldiers.",
        "So that that - those are the key features of the Beirut - the suicide truck assassination in Beirut in October '83 and exactly the same tactical features of the first Tamil suicide attack.",
        "And then after that attack, even though it didn't lead to sort of the same political success, it did lead to a fair bit of martyrdom for Captain Miller.",
        "So what Prabhakaran did is he decided to make a tremendous political display in the Tamil homelands of this person who had done the attack named Captain Miller.",
        "And a statue was erected.",
        "The statue was displayed prominently in Jaffna.",
        "That's the key Tamil city in the Jaffna Peninsula in the northern part of Sri Lanka.",
        "And that statue and these memorials became a quite important part of the entire, sort of, edifice of martyrdom, so to speak, that became, you know, central to how the Tamil Tigers were trying to wage their war of independence.",
        "NEARY: Now, you use the word martyr.",
        "Were these bombings tied to any religious beliefs?",
        "No.",
        "Actually, the Tamil Tigers are a purely secular suicide terrorist group.",
        "They're not a group that most of the listeners will have heard too much about because even though they're actually the world leader in suicide terrorism from 1980 to 2003, carrying out more suicide attacks than Hamas or Islamic Jihad, they're not attacking us and they're not attacking our allies.",
        "And so, even though they've done really quite tremendously spectacular suicide attacks - for instance, in 1993, it's the Tamil Tigers who assassinated - with the suicide assassination a sitting president, Premadasa, a president of Sri Lanka.",
        "That's the only time that a suicide attack has actually assassinated a sitting president.",
        "And then just a few years before that, Rajiv Gandhi, when he was running for prime minister in 1991, a Tamil suicide attacker, this time a woman by the name of Dhanu assassinated him.",
        "And so, despite the fact there have been these spectacular attacks, they have been occurring not against us or against our allies, and so many folks won't really have been as familiar with them."
