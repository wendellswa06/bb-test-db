        "The email address is talk@npr.org.",
        "So I'm curious, Professor Pape, how were then the suicide bombers recruited?",
        "Because, you know, in the case of militant Islam, you know, we hear, you know, promises of greatness in the afterlife, for instance.",
        "So that, you know, so you could almost begin to understand that, you know, people with a certain kind of belief would think, well, if I do this then I'm going to be rewarded in the afterlife.",
        "But - so what's the recruiting technique if you don't have that kind of even reward to promise?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, maybe when - we should also have an opportunity to come back and talk about the motives for some of the Hamas suicide attackers as well.",
        "But just specifically to answer your question, the critical issue here is that the Tamil Tigers have long been a resistance movement that's been a guerilla resistance movement with thousands and thousands of cadre who have been fighting for the independence of the Tamil regions of the Sri Lankan - the island of Sri Lanka.",
        "NPR's Wade Goodwyn has more.",
        "And the Black Tigers, the suicide attackers for the Tamil Tigers, have been recruited essentially as elite members of the ordinary cadre.",
        "That is they're essentially promoted from within the ranks of the ordinary Tamil Tigers.",
        "A way to think about it is, they're sort of the same relationship our Rangers, you know, have to the Army.",
        "In order to get into the Rangers, our elite - some of our elite special forces, you have to first be in the Army.",
        "And then you have to pass some rather rigorous tests, rigorous tests of skill, rigorous tests of emotional stability.",
        "And that's what's happening for the Black Tigers.",
        "Those that are -volunteer and then are selected to become Black Tigers, for them, it's actually quite an honor.",
        "Now, of course, our Rangers aren't doing suicide attacks.",
        "But the Black Tigers are specially an elite unit where they're being selected because they're viewed as having both the skill and strength of nerve in order to not just so much kill themselves.",
        "That's really not what the point of the attack is, as much as to kill others.",
        "And to attack especially difficult targets such as, as I just mentioned, you know, assassinations of high-level political figures that would be probably pretty difficult to achieve any other way.",
        "Do they ever use children or women as suicide bombers?",
        "Suicide women actually are quite prominent in the Black Tigers.",
        "They're called the Black Tigresses.",
        "Of the 273 that we can count - and that's what I'm in the business of doing, we kind of carefully count suicide attacks and attackers around the world - there had been 273 that we can verify who have actually killed themselves in suicide attacks for the Tamil Tigers.",
        "And of those, 46 have been women.",
        "And quite a large fraction, about half, have been involved in political assassinations.",
        "The youngest of the Tamil Tigers who have been Black Tigers that we can identify has been about 18.",
        "Now the Tamil Tigers as group do have cadre who are younger than 18.",
        "In fact, there are lots of news reports about how they use children.",
        "But I actually don't find much evidence of them truly using, you know, hundreds and hundreds of kids who are 12, 13 years old.",
        "But they do, quite often, have folks in their ranks who are 16 and 17 years old, much the way - by the way, say, in World War I or World War II, many Western armies were composed of folks who were 17 who went to war early."

        "Some of those have been involved in team attacks where they've actually done it as a group.",
        "So if you were to count, say, attacks the Tamil Tigers from 1987 to just actually early May of this year, just a few weeks ago - May 13th was their last suicide attack - have done at least 137 confirmed suicide attacks involving 273 suicide attackers.",
        "That compares to, say, Hamas at 117 confirmed suicide attacks during their period, the life of their suicide - campaigns by about 147 suicide attackers.",

        "But the fact is, Prabhakaran and the Tamil Tigers had tremendous popular support, not so much for Prabhakaran as an individual or even suicide attack, but for the whole issue of Tamil independence because there has just been a tremendous amount of animosity between the Sinhalese who are Buddhists and the Tamils who are Hindus, actually going three decades now."

        "And I think that unfortunately, what's really needed here is a rather massive amount of economic aid, reconstruction aid, and not just by the Sinhalese government, by the international community, and I would say in fairly short order.",
        "And it's rather difficult - this has often been the case in some of these campaigns or some of these conflicts involving suicide attack.",
        "And it's often been the case that promises have come and they haven't been fulfilled.",
        "And so I think that in this particular case, there are good reasons to worry about a resumption of the conflict, not so much tomorrow, but in six months or a year that could be really quite intense specifically because of the rather harsh brutality that's occurred to many, many Tamil civilians in the last few months.",

        "Yes.",
        "That was an effort to try to politically delegitimate the concept.",
        "And the fact of the matter is, the term suicide attack already effectively delegitimates the concept and is not the way the suicide terrorists groups typically refer to themselves.",
        "They often refer to themselves with terms that in their languages refer to not suicide by self-sacrifice or martyrdom.",
        "And I think that the other point to say is that trying to change the name once something has sort of become named something after 20 years, even the president of our country, it's just very, very difficult to do.",
        "And so, I think that the fact is, in the West, we have, since the suicide truck assassination of those Marines in Beirut, called this a suicide attack by suicide terrorists.",
        "And I think that that's probably going to be the name that will stay with us.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your call, Greg.",

        "Well, we track suicide terrorism, the global patterns all around the world.",
        "And in 2002, there were 50 suicide attacks around the world.",
        "In 2008, over 500 suicide attacks around the world.",
        "And I'm afraid that suicide terrorism is mainly not so much driven by religion, independent of circumstance, but it's mainly a response to foreign military occupation.",
        "And as we've seen, ground forces in Iraq, increases of ground forces in Afghanistan, and then actually threatening parts of Pakistan, we've seen suicide terrorism in those parts of the world exploding."
