        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that is kind of the golden rule for all job seekers.",
        "You know, that's - often many companies report that's the best way to find a job.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Unfortunately, a lot of people just don't have that luxury.",
        "I mean, there aren't enough job openings to ensure that people are going to find their perfect job.",
        "The most recent statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that in October there were 3.3 million job openings on the last business day, and this is better than it was in the trough of the recession.",
        "But in the month that the recession began, or the month right before the recession began, there were 4.4 job openings.",
        "So, you know, we're not nearly up to the levels we were at before this - before the recession began.",
        "So, you know, people just can't be quite as choosy and selective as they would hope to be.",
        "Now, when you drill down into the numbers a little bit, there are certain fields and industries where the unemployment rate is much lower.",
        "So if you're an engineer or have - or an accountant, these are industries that seem to be doing really well, or fields that seem to be doing really well.",
        "I think for accountants the unemployment rate is somewhere - or for engineers, it's about half what it is for the national rate.",
        "So, you know, there, you can afford to be a little bit choosier.",
        "In fact, I've heard that in some cases salaries are actually going up, which is a sign of greater competition among employers for those people.",
        "But, you know, if you don't have some of those specialized skills that are really in demand, you know, you are looking for a job along with many, many others, and the competition is stiff.",
        "And for many people, that means choosing something that, in better times, they would have probably passed over."
