        "And the numbers - you mentioned specific numbers, but the job numbers are taking up a bit.",
        "The unemployment figure is down to 8.6 percent, I think.",
        "But some of that is due to people who've just stopped looking.",
        "Yes.",
        "There are a lot of discouraged workers out there.",
        "Hopefully, they will - they are starting to see that things are actually picking up.",
        "Like, for instance, another data point that came up from the Bureau of Labor Statistics was that 1.9 million people quit their jobs in October, and that's about 500,000 or 400,000 up from the trough in that data point which was in January of 2010.",
        "So more people are feeling that - are either finding other positions or are feeling that they have a little bit of luxury of leaving where they are and hopefully finding something better.",
        "And most of those jobs, you know, will have to be replaced.",
        "Those employers will look for replacement workers for who was there.",
        "So, you know, some of the data really does indicate that things are looking better than they were at the worst point, and we are in recovery.",
        "Technically, we have been for awhile.",
        "It's been a very weak recovery.",
        "But even so, it's clear that there are more jobs out there.",
        "And you talked about differences in terms of the kinds of jobs, engineers, for example, that people are looking for.",
        "What about regionally?",
        "Is – are some places in the country doing better than other?",
        "We just heard, for example, pretty good employment numbers for a place like Maryland.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "I've seen a few studies recently that show the Midwest is actually really ticking up in terms of hiring.",
        "And that was somewhat surprising to me because we think of the coasts as being more dynamic economically and that, you know, more innovation would come from the coastal areas.",
        "But I think probably because manufacturing is doing OK, certain kinds of manufacturing, you know, Detroit is coming back, the car industry.",
        "So, you know, the Midwest seems to be popping more than other regions right now.",
        "You know, different - depending on different studies.",
        "You see different kinds of data.",
        "But in the ones about the records of people quitting, the most quits were actually in the South.",
        "And unfortunately, it's something you can't really drill down further into the numbers, so I can't say which industries people seem to be leaving their jobs or moving into other jobs in.",
        "But I was kind of interested to see that.",

        "We have a high volume of products down there, and unfortunately we're just not seeing the volume of applicants that we expected in a downturn economy.",

        "Mattis are leaving.",
        "You can see him acting on more of his impulses, like pulling troops out or shutting down the government.",
        "And so we have long known that he is unfit for office, but Republicans are starting to have a sense for the political costs he creates for their party.",
        "And, as you know, that this isn't going anywhere without congressional Republicans getting on board, either publicly or privately.",
        "So what's your evidence that a focus on - I mean, for you, this is a matter of substance.",
        "This is a matter of fact.",
        "But for other people, you know, whether or not it is a matter of fact, it's a matter of facts that they can or cannot explain to their supporters, right?",
        "So what is your evidence that congressional Republicans would be amenable to these facts as you understand them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, in the end, politicians almost always act in their own personal self-interest (laughter), their political self-interest.",
        "And I think that when Republicans look at the reality - they just lost the popular vote in the House midterms by almost 9 percentage points.",
        "President Trump's approval rating is just 40 percent.",
        "And maybe it's not going to go a lot lower, but it shows no evidence of going higher.",
        "And so I just think that if Democrats are able to keep - try to keep some attention on how unpopular his agenda is and how corrupt he and his administration have been and the many ways he is acting like no president before him, I think there is a significant chance.",
        "It's not guaranteed, but I think there's a significant chance that his support starts to weaken.",
        "And the only other thing I'd add to that is that he already has less support from his own party in Congress than any other president in memory.",
        "So Republicans have not defied him the way I wish they would, the way I think it's their patriotic duty to do.",
        "But they have also not supported him the way Obama or Bush or Clinton or Bush or Reagan - and I could go on - were supported by members of their own party.",
        "I think his support right now is broad but shallow, and it would not shock me if he struggles to keep that support as Robert Mueller issues his report and as the year goes on.",
