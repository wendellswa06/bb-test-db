        "Hi.",
        "Older?",
        "Older.",
        "Because I had a baby at 17 and it was just easier when you have a 5-year-old to say you're 25 and not 22.",
        "But then once you've said that for sometime, well, you're stuck with it.",
        "I suspect you're right about that.",
        "But will the seating, you know, mean less partisan?",
        "When I was a sophomore - I go to University of South Carolina here, and when I was a sophomore we had to create a resume, and I put on the resume that my cumulative GPA was a 3.7, and at the time, it was like a 3.4 something.",
        "But it's interesting because now I'm going into my senior year and I just checked my grades, I made all A's this semester and now I'm at a 3.64, so I'm still pretty confident that by the end, I'll have that 3.7.",
        "And I think it's interesting you guys were talking a lot, that lying can actually help achieve your goals.",
        "It's fascinating.",
        "Yeah, it's interesting.",
        "Almost by saying it out loud, even though it wasn't quite true, you force yourself to live up to it.",

        "And I never actually used the resume, you know, because it was just for an assignment, but I still, like, that helped me set a goal for, you know, to what I want to aim for.",
        "And you know, and I also think like this discussion about exaggerating, it can help us become more conscious about it so that we can recognize when we're doing it because sometimes I think we don't even realize it.",
        "I think sometimes Christine is exactly right, that it seeps out unconsciously, so even though I think she's exactly right, you're committing to this future self where she wanted to be and then the next few years.",
        "Did she actually consciously write down the 3.7, and was she aware that it was a big fat lie at the time, or was she thinking, this is where I want to be?",
        "And so I'm sure as time goes on, this is what I'll achieve.",
        "Right.",
        "Actually, when I did it, I wasn't even really quite aware and I knew that that was higher than what my actual GPA was, but you know, and even say, I was talking to a friend about my grades, and she made a comment, well, she made all A's and I was, oh, yeah, me too.",
        "And then I was like, well, actually, I'm not positive about two of my classes.",
        "And then she caught herself and said, oh, you know what?",
        "I'm not either, but I'm pretty sure.",
        "You know, so we find ourselves just, you know, making comments and accepting to ourselves that it's truth, and then sometimes you have to catch yourself and realize that no, that's not totally truthful.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Great example.",
        "Christina, thanks very much for the call and good luck at what I'm told is the real USC.",
        "Thanks.",
        "University of South Carolina, sorry about that.",
        "Go ahead, bye-bye.",
        "We're talking with Wendy Berry Mendes, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard and one of the authors of the study about exaggeration.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And Wendy Berry Mendes, I read that identification.",
        "Didn't I read in the article that you're an associate professor of psychology?",
        "What a great example.",
        "A slightly unconscious exaggeration, so when I talked to the terrific science writer of the New York Times article, Benedict Harry(ph), we were getting down my exact title at the time, and I had just heard that I was promoted from assistant to associate and just out of reflex, I had already made the mental shift to an associate professor of psychology.",
        "But it turns out that that actual rank isn't official until July 1, so here's kind of a funny example of, it's true, I am an associate professor, as of July 1, which is my future self, not my current self.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",

        "Hey.",
        "Go ahead, Homer.",
        "The thing I find myself doing is I will place myself into a story and retell a story that someone else has told me before.",
        "Oh, so you put yourself, tell a story about yourself, but it really happened to another person?",
        "Right.",
        "Or not even necessarily about me, but I make it seem like I was there so that the story is more convincing or maybe more relevant to the conversation.",
        "Sometimes you could say, you know, like, this one guy that I knew had a friend who told me once blah, blah, blah.",
        "But instead, I would just say, oh yeah, one time I did this.",
        "Or Neal Armstrong looked over to me and said, what should I say when I put my foot on the moon there?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Is this in the realm of exaggeration, do we think, or is this coming on to a whopper?",
        "Right.",
        "So here we would definitely make this distinction that what Homer is talking about, sort of transcending yourself into another situation that didn't happen, probably wouldn't fit, or definitely wouldn't fit our definition of exaggerating to commit to a future self.",
        "So this folds into that other category of just out-and-out lying.",
        "But for fun and for effect, right?",
        "Homer, thanks very much."

        "So I made up a story about when I was younger, that when I was six years old, my birthday at Disneyland was ruined by having a coconut Popsicle and then I found out I was allergic to it, which was, I mean, that never happened at all, but I kept the story going for about six years just to get out of eating coconuts.",

        "Age is also something people might alter, but this isn't modifiable.",
        "Age and height aren't traits that we can modify, so those don't fall into the same, kind of, positive illusions of yourself.",
