        "In late October, a few activists and businesspeople gathered with members of various Egyptian tribes in the remote southeastern desert to celebrate their heritage and traditions, and to explore ways of responsibly bringing people to the Egypt that package tour visitors never see.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "It was the second annual Characters of Egypt festival, featuring Sinai Bedouins from the eastern hills, Nubian tribes from the south, and the far-flung tribes of the western desert, all the way to the Siwa Oasis near the Libyan border.",
        "It was a rare opportunity for the tribes to swap songs, stories, food and art, and to debate whether this new eco-travel movement could provide desperately needed jobs without forever changing their lives.",
        "The head of Egypt's national parks, Mustafa Foudy, said that last concern is part of his job, to see that eco-tourism doesn't turn into a smaller version of mass tourism.",
        "When you talk about eco-tourism, we are talking about responsible tourism, people that they come and gain experience by sitting with these local people.",
        "We train them to work as guides, to take these tourists to safari, for example, to act as bird-watchers, to help the tourists, whatever.",
        "So far, eco-tourism is a term that can have many definitions in Egypt, from expensive luxury eco-lodges, to primitive Bedouin-led desert treks.",
        "One of the founders of the tribal festival is Lynn Freiji, director of the Wadi Environmental Science Center.",
        "In Freiji's opinion, too much well-intentioned effort these days is stuck on what she calls the handicrafts plateau: creating and marketing jewelry and carpets to tourists.",
        "She says the next step should be a sustainable travel sector that values the environment and relies on the knowledge and skills of those who live there.",
        "The tribes are those that have protected the territories.",

        "These tribes who have the knowledge of the desert should be working hand-in-hand with tour operators.",
        "Freiji says there are a number of obstacles to get past, not least the deep mistrust between the government and the tribespeople, some of whom thrive on smuggling.",
        "Clashes, especially in the northern Sinai, are a regular occurrence.",
        "Each year, when she tries to organize the tribal festival, Freiji says she must bring a list of all those attending to the security forces five months in advance, and inevitably a number of names are struck from the list.",

        "As Scott Carrier reports, not everyone is happy with this.",
        "The plan is to build a pipeline from Las Vegas, more than 200 miles north, where it will branch out like a tree to seven separate high desert basins, covering an area roughly the size of the State of West Virginia.",
        "There's very little surface water in these basins.",
        "They have sort of an Outer Mongolian look to them.",

        "Most of the people who do live here are cattle ranchers who've been pumping the groundwater for 100 years to grow alfalfa.",
