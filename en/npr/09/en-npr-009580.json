        "If he can make a joke about that, put everyone at ease, that actually may be his best shot at making this speech memorable tonight.",

        "A funny thing happened as I went to meet Nancy Pelosi...",

        "So I think it's a great idea.",
        "I gather he didn't hire Henny Youngman to help him with that but...",

        "And to some degree, I guess, with divided government, laying out an agenda that may reflect his re-election campaign come two years' time.",

        "Yes.",

        "He - this is the first speech of his re-election, and it is - as in any State of the Union, the blueprint for how he wants to govern for the next year, maybe two years.",
        "So what he's really got to do is substantively shift from - and this is the theme that people are saying, you know, in the administration, he's going to do - shift from emergency, we had to save ourselves from devastation, from - to now I'm focused like a laser on job creation and the long-term competitive future of the country.",
        "And the broad message would you agree, Peter Robinson?",
        "Yes.",
        "I - by the way, I liked your intro, Neal.",

        "The House is not going to permit - the House now controlled by Republicans simply will not permit large legislative matters like reform of health care to go through again over the next two years, nor can the Republicans repeal large matters, such as, again, health care, that got enacted over the next - over the last two years.",
        "So we have a divided government.",
        "Large matters of substance just won't happen.",
        "The president's opportunity tonight, I believe, is to begin a large, serious two-year argument making an honest defense about his understanding of the role of government in the lives of Americans.",
        "I actually think he needs to do that.",
        "He needs to - if he simply tries to make gestures and soothing words and so forth and - that's going to be a weakness for him.",
        "Because in that audience, he has Republicans who are, maybe for the first time since Ronald Reagan, really articulate, Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor.",
        "This is a new thing for a Republican like me to get use to, Republicans who are intent, serious and capable of sustaining an argument.",

        "Members are stepping across the aisle in - I guess, advocating the Third Way ideas of Senator Udall.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a problem.",

        "I think everybody got sick over the last couple of State of the Union addresses, particularly the members of Congress.",

        "When one side would stand up, while the other side was slow in rising, some would glower, some would cheer.",
        "And you could see it so sharply divided in the chamber by party.",
        "I do think this new sitting arrangement is likely to produce more of a sense of normality, ordinary Americans listening to this man.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Boy, if I were a speechwriter, I'd feel a very powerful urge to put in something about current events.",
        "Yes, I would - so speaking as a speechwriter, I'd say yes.",
        "Speaking as a speechwriter who knows a little bit about the way the bureaucracy works, the idea that the State Department would figure out what would be permissible to say in time to include it in the speech tonight, particularly since we know - what was it over a year, 18 months or so ago, when there were demonstrations in Iran, and this president, this administration was very cautious.",
        "It took three or four days, as I recall, for the president to say anything substantive about it.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And specifically, what I'd like to see him do is something like Kennedy did say, that by the end of this decade, we will become energy independent.",

        "And the president has gotten this sort of allowed himself to be seen as a kind of responding to events in a experimental, practical, pragmatic way, which is true, but he needs to weave them together in a narrative that people can understand: this is his theory of how the economy is going to change.",
        "OK.",
