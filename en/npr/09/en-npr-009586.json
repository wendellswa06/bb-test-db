        "There could be two possible explanations for that, the good news one and a bad news one.",
        "The good news one would be that the vaccine that people got this fall, who did get a flu vaccine, has offered some margin of protection against this virus.",
        "And that might mean then that we can just make up huge batches of it and bring this whole thing to a halt.",
        "If that's the case, then that would explain why young adults have not been protected because they generally don't get vaccinated with flu.",
        "And the main recommendations here in the United States is for the vaccine to be delivered to vulnerable populations, the elderly and very young children.",
        "So that would be the good news explanation.",
        "The bad news explanation would be that this is following a pattern we've seen in the past, particularly in 1918 and with the bird flu in Asia over the last five or six years, where the real killer effect of the infection is not actually the virus directly itself, but rather the immune response to this very foreign, very strange virus that, from the perspective of the body, you've never seen before, and you don't have routine antibody capacity to respond to it.",
        "And so, what happens is if you're actually, ironically, young and vigorous and healthy, you have a very strong immune system, and your immune responds with a nuclear-bomb-like effect against this invading virus and fills your lungs with fluids, actually worsens the situation.",
        "And if that is indeed what's going on in Mexico, it's quite worrisome.",
        "Looking at it historically, is there any comparison about this -with this Mexican outbreak and 1918, the great world pandemic?",
        "Well, Jacki, the big thing about flu and the reason that it's always a problem, and we always have a different flu circulating around the country every single year, is that this is a very, very sloppy virus.",
        "It is a large, what's called RNA virus, meaning that its genetics are stored as RNA, not DNA, and it actually has chromosomes, just like humans have chromosomes, except that this virus' chromosomes are really a mess.",
        "They're not well-maintained.",
        "And so, when the virus reproduces, literally, its whole genetic material falls apart, and then it absorbs.",
        "As it reassembles and makes progeny, it absorbs genetic material from the environment that it's in.",
        "So if it's in a human cell, it picks up little human RNA.",
        "If it's in a pig cell, it picks up pig.",
        "If it's in a chicken cell, chicken.",
