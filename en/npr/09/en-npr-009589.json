        "This decision represents the industry's history of moving the technological frontier forward.",
        "The Shell facility will be further offshore, and about twice as deep as BP's disastrous well that blew three years ago.",
        "It took months to quell that undersea gusher, in part because of the inherent difficulties and risks associated with drilling for oil so deep under the sea.",
