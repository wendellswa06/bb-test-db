        "Still, the researchers inject a chip in every angry penguin's shoulder.",
        "Then they take a computerized scale, which looks like a rubber mat, and they place it on the path so the penguins cross it.",
        "And now this system lets Ainley track all kinds of information.",
        "For instance, what time does each penguin go fishing, and when does it come back?",
        "How much weight did the penguin gain or lose?",
        "It gives us a measure of their condition, if they're lighter than they should be or really heavy or doing really well.",
        "Meanwhile, scientists have been doing similar studies in other parts of Antarctica.",
        "They've plotted their findings against the climate.",
        "And here are the striking results.",
        "During the past few decades, climate patterns in some parts of the continent have changed dramatically, and Adelies in some regions have almost disappeared.",
        "Their numbers have plunged 80 percent.",
        "Meanwhile, the Adelies where Ainley does his research have been doing better than ever.",
        "These penguins are definitely being helped by climate change.",
        "Ainley and other researchers think they know why.",
        "Most types of penguins go fishing only in open water, so they're all competing with each other to find food.",
        "But Adelies catch their fish by diving deep under the ice.",
        "In fact, they're just about the only penguin that can physically do that.",
        "So when there's plenty of ice over the sea, Adelies hardly have any competition, and they can get all the food they want.",
        "But now, the changing climate is shaking things up.",
        "Most of the ice has melted in some areas, so Adelies there can't survive.",
        "Cape Royds used to have too much ice, but now it has just the right amount.",
        "So penguins here are doing great.",
        "And Ainley says here's the moral: Global warming is making life unpredictable.",
        "Early this year, he was studying another penguin colony, and a glacier was melting.",
        "Melting, like I'd never seen it before.",
        "There were huge rivers running off this glacier, running through the penguin colony.",
        "And these rivers were engulfing these penguin nests.",
        "And they were - penguins just keep - kept collecting rocks to try to make their nests bigger, raise them up out of the water.",
        "And, you know, for many of them, they couldn't collect rocks fast enough and so their eggs were just washed away.",
        "I mean, I thought it was really, really unfair, that humans a long way away were living lives oblivious to what they're doing to the Earth, to these penguins' home - they're not very many.",

        "They say Inspector General Kenneth Konz appears particularly interested in the role Tomlinson played in getting those new shows on the air.",
        "Konz is also focused on a flurry of hires of CPB officials with strong White House and Republican ties, including new CEO Patricia Harrison, a former co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.",
        "And Konz has probed the move by Tomlinson to hire an outside consultant to monitor the political leanings of several shows on PBS and National Public Radio.",
        "Tomlinson did not respond to requests today seeking comment, but he made his swan song address as CPB chairman late last month to a media industry group.",

        "And in the end, if I threatened the cozy atmosphere of public broadcasting over the failure to balance the liberal advocacy journalism of Bill Moyers, my reaction is `So be it.'",
        "Congressional Democrats say the CPB is supposed to shield public broadcasting from political influence and that Tomlinson has failed to do so.",
        "NPR obtained e-mails showing that Tomlinson urged CPB to hire at least one person recommended by the White House, and he directed CPB last year to follow the Bush administration's stance on a sensitive bill.",
        "Here's how Tomlinson responded last month when NPR asked him about those e-mails."
