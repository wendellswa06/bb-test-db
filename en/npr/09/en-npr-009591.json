        "And I think it's important to point out, you say this is not done maliciously or maybe not even consciously.",
        "Well, it's certainly is not done in a way that people are aware of the impact of it.",
        "Although when I talked to the hundreds of people that I included within my study, almost all of them - albeit two of the people I talked - found 70 percent of the jobs that they held over a lifetime from having some kind of additional help from family, from friends, through someone either telling them about a job that otherwise was not public, using influence to help them stand out from the crowd or in some cases, actually, offering them an opportunity.",
        "And yet, when I asked my interviewees what most contributed to their having the kind of life that they had, almost no one talked about the help they received.",
        "Instead, they talked about how hard they had worked, how motivated they were, the education they'd received.",
        "So there was a big gap between the amount of help that they'd received and how they thought about what had happened in their lives.",
        "And since we live in still a largely segregated society, you write, it is the white who'll be helping other whites.",
        "They're the friends and family they know, and it is minorities who will be left out.",
        "In a clearing amid trees festooned with vines and epiphytes, we find what we came for.",

        "Well, you do get the mountain of stuffed animals?",

        "Activists like Brownell often point to cigarettes as their model.",
        "As taxes were increased and public perceptions of smoking changed, tobacco use declined significantly.",
        "As you might expect, the $110 billion a year soft drink business doesnt like being linked to tobacco.",
        "But in the same spirit as anti-smoking advertisements, New York Citys Health Department has released a YouTube video showing orange soda that has big clumps of fat in it.",

        "Gail Woodward-Lopez is associate director of the Center for Weight and Health at U.C.",
        "Berkeley.",
        "She says Americans are actually getting as much as 9 to 13 percent of our calories from soda and other sweetened beverages.",
        "And she says as Americans have consumed more sugary drinks, obesity rates have soared.",
        "We have very strong evidence linking those two trends.",
        "And those two trends are so startlingly parallel.",
        "If you looked at a graph, the rise in sweetened beverage consumption would be in exact parallel with the increase in obesity rates.",
        "We did a comprehensive literature review.",
        "We looked at hundreds of studies, and every type of evidence supports the link between sweetened beverage consumption, obesity, including correlations.",
        "In other words, people who drink more soda take in more calories and also are heavier.",
        "But we've also seen through intervention trials - thats where you either give soda to a group or have a group drink less soda - and we see that those who drink more soda gain weight, and those who drink less soda lose weight or maintain their weight.",
        "Is it whats in soda, the ingredients, or is it the amount of soda that people are ingesting?",
        "Really, it's a combination of the two.",
        "What we found is when people drink soda, they dont then reduce their intake of other foods and beverages.",
        "In other words, they dont compensate.",
        "So, for example, if you drink a soda or other sweetened beverage with your dinner, you dont eat less dinner because of that.",
        "Because it just doesnt have the same filling properties that other foods and beverages do.",
        "Whereas, if you had a bowl of soup or if you had another snack item right before dinner, you might reduce your intake, with liquid calories it appears that you do not reduce your intake to the same degree.",
        "How are the calories from sugar-sweetened beverages different within the body than the calories that you get from food?",
        "Those calories are different, as I mentioned, in terms of the satiety - or how filling they are.",
        "They're also very different in terms of whether they come with any other nutrients.",
        "So what we find is that when you take in something like a highly processed substance, such as sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, every other nutrient has been stripped.",
        "So basically, you're just getting calories."

        "diet.",
        "So, it is the largest contributor to sugar intake, the largest single food contributor to calorie intake, and sugar intake has been linked to the increasing rates of diabetes.",
        "Teenagers are often told to drink soda in moderation.",
        "So what does moderation mean?",
        "I think I would say that our idea of moderation is very occasional use, which I think would be a maximum of once per week, if you want it on a special occasion, but definitely it should not be a part of your daily intake.",
        "If we listen closely, I think we might have heard the sounds of heads snapping backward in amazement: One soda per week?",
        "Yes.",
        "It just shows the cultural shift that we have made.",
        "I remember when I was a child, it was not considered appropriate to offer a soda with a meal on a regular basis, that milk or water was the norm.",
        "And that maybe if I was flying on an airplane or I was at a party, a soda might be offered.",
        "But I think we've seen this cultural shift, and we need to shift back to those basic principles that we know are right in terms of the intake, especially for children.",

        "She says whats going on in America is that people are consuming more of everything and not exercising enough.",

        "Well, I don't think it's nutritionally unsound.",
