        "The extent to which that is a choice or through other mechanisms is, of course, a debatable issue.",
        "But the critical thing is if 70 percent of the jobs are found through these kinds of inside connections, then how can we actually talk about a job market?",
        "It would mean that those people who are not part of those networks, in fact, would have much harder time finding opportunities and finding jobs, particularly jobs that allow them to lead decent lives.",
        "And as you look at this dilemma, this non-dilemma as you described in the title of your book, it is a situation that is self-perpetuating.",
        "Yes, because it is something that goes on across generations and because my parents or my friends or colleagues helped me, that position is made to have good job skills and sufficient income to then help my children and the next generation.",
