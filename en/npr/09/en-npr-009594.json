        "But let me mention with regard to the caller that a number of the people that I talk to when they realize that they had just told me about this sort of insight edge when we talked about the jobs that they held would say something like, that just got me in the door and then I had to prove myself.",
        "But they didn't seem to recognize that many people might have been able to prove themselves if they had gotten in the door.",
        "And therefore, it was a significant advantage, in fact, to get into the door, get the job and have the opportunity for both training and for proving themselves in these situations.",

        "But the reason I was calling is I've now lived in New Hampshire for 11 years and I came to New Hampshire because someone suggested I worked for a paper in New Hampshire.",
        "From that paper, someone suggested I work somewhere else when I needed a change.",
        "And then when that paper downsized, I started working for the AP because I had a couple of friends that worked there and got me a part-time job and found another job that way.",

        "Yet, there are an awful lot of jobs, and you think about for universities or certainly, public jobs, you know, government jobs, where there's seemingly excruciating search process.",
        "Well, this caller's experience, in fact, was not unusual, given the people that I talked to.",

        "It just is the typical way that people get jobs.",
        "So even if there is a process of an open search and applications come in, still the ones that get selected out, the people that are interviewed, it's usually - have some kind of commonality or contact that allows them to stand out.",
        "For example, I talked to one person who every job he had was through some kind of friends.",
        "People liked him and they helped him, and he told, for example, of going to one job interview where he happened to look down the hallway and there was someone he went to high school with who recognized him who came up and put her arm around him, saying this is my friend.",
        "Take care of him.",
        "That's a very typical kind of story that people tell.",
        "Now, it's important to understand that people know on the one hand that networks are important and that they matter.",
        "But on the other hand again, when I ask people, you know, what most contributed to your having the kind of life you have?",
        "They didn't say because I had good networks.",
        "They said because I worked hard, because I'm smart, because I'm motivated.",
        "So there's this huge gap in terms of how we think about what has happened in our lives and how we actually live our lives.",
        "And I talk about this in the book and I think that it's important to understand in terms of a policy issue is that while all the people that I talked to said that they believed in equal opportunity as a standard of fairness, they spent their entire lives seeking unequal opportunity.",
        "That really is the process by which people are trying to make their way in the world.",
        "Nobody really wants to compete on equal basis where they don't know the outcome.",
