        "These bayous that drain into Galveston Bay are just not getting the water out fast enough.",
        "And so Houston is really thinking about how it is going to plan for the future.",
        "I just sat down with Marvin Odum.",
        "He is Houston's chief recovery officer.",
        "And he made it clear after only two rounds of federal disaster relief funding, he's worried that Washington has moved on.",
        "The further we get away from the storm, the less sense of urgency or at least recognition of the need here, the bigger risk we run that the money that we need won't be there.",
        "So I, you know - I was in D.C.",
        "earlier this week.",
        "How receptive were they?",
        "You always get decent reception.",
        "But I'm only interested in the real action, right?",
        "So from a real action standpoint, I'm extremely concerned.",
        "If you took it at face value right now, and you look at the money that's been allocated post-Harvey but also post-Irma and post-wildfires and post all the other disasters that we've seen out there, the money that, then, could potentially - out of those appropriations, it could potentially be allocated to Texas and to the Houston area - would be woefully short of the examples that were set by Katrina, let's say, or by post-Sandy.",
        "So if you're here, we're feeling forgotten, not defeated because we'll do everything we can to make sure that that's understood, and we get the money that should be flowing in this direction come in this direction.",
        "But it is set up to be a very challenging fight.",
        "And fight is the word that you feel is the appropriate one?",
        "You think you're going to have to fight for this money?",
        "I think you absolutely have to fight for the money.",
        "This is not just purely a mathematical game, right?",
        "This is about appealing to appropriators about the desperate need of the people that are here that were affected by the storm.",
        "Were you surprised by that, though?",
        "I mean, this is a major American city in a state that is run by the party of - both the party in power in Congress and the president that is not getting the funds that it needs.",
        "So if it doesn't get them in the end, I'm extremely surprised and will be enormously disappointed.",
        "But I think we also have to understand this is unfolding as we speak, right?",
        "So the reason I was there earlier this week is, we're getting a message that says, know this may be the last appropriation.",
        "And if that's the case, then that's not nearly enough money to effect a decent recovery here."

        "The - so it was the administration that recommended the 44 or 45 billion - depending on who you're talking to - for the last appropriation.",
        "Didn't come with a lot of explanation as to why that was the right number.",
        "And that's, of course, the - what we continue to push on and make sure that Congress - who actually makes the final appropriation, will make the final calls - understands what the need really is.",

        "And so to continue to do the same thing we've done before, which is - just repair structures, put people back in their homes and basically sit there and wait for the next flood when it starts all over again is absolutely untenable by - from any perspective.",
        "And the math actually does work.",
        "So allocating the money now for the flood mitigation activities so that you can make these neighborhoods resilient, prevent the flood waters from coming into the houses and then not have to pay for this kind of repair three years down the road makes perfect sense.",

        "My question is - 10, 15, 20 years from now, how do we work to combat the mundane?",
        "Yeah, so there's a lot of research that psychologists have done on what they call the misattribution of arousal.",
        "And basically, the idea is that when you do something really stimulating - that leaves you excited, sweaty palms, heart racing - or even just something novel and interesting, you tend to attribute those really intense feelings that you're having to who you're with not just to what you're doing.",
