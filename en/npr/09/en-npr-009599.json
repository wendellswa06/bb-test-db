        "Well, the wink, wink, nudge, nudge, was most definitely an allusion to the drug use, and Johnson obviously was trying to possibly that way Bill Shaheen, the - Hillary's former co-chair in New Hampshire, was alluding to that.",
        "Since Obama has admitted to not just smoking pot, but actually using cocaine, now, the political game is, well, you know, was it more than just using it?",
