        "He's been in the United States for three decades and he teaches at the University of Maryland.",

        "I first met him two years ago this month just outside Washington DC.",
        "He was voting in the Iraqi elections, and I wanted to check back in with him.",
        "As he left the polling place with an ink stained finger back in 2005, he was full of pride.",
        "Even so, his joy was tempered a bit.",
        "You know, I'm thinking the whole time when I was printing my fingers that somebody in Iraq is doing that and they have to hide their hands because some insurgents are going to try to come and kill them.",
        "And it's indelible ink and that is one big problem they have in Iraq.",
        "Shihab Shamma is with us now in the studio.",
        "When I met you at that polling place, I remember so clearly how happy you were.",
        "You were almost like a teenager rocking back and forth on your heels.",
        "I'm just curious, what are your feelings about Iraq right now?",
        "Well, you reminded me of that time.",
        "I am much - obviously, like all Iraqis - much sadder as to what has happened since.",
        "I think also I can speak for probably a lot of Iraqis that it's not hopeless.",
        "And you'd never really come to a point where you say I've given up.",
        "But yeah, it is much, much sadder time.",
        "Professor Shamma, I noticed something in your face changed when you listened to that tape.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's - I never really thought that the situation would deteriorate this far.",
        "My father and mother were in Baghdad right before the war, and my father came down with a mild form of Parkinson's, which affected his memory and emotion.",
        "And when he passed away about a year ago, I caught myself telling my mother how glad I am that he had Parkinson's because I really feel much happier that he wasn't completely aware of how bad the situation is in Iraq.",
        "And when I caught myself saying that, I was really not very pleased."

        "Well, I wouldn't call this marriage by definition.",
        "Historic definition of marriage is a union between a man and a woman.",

        "So why this social experiment now?",
        "Why the pressure from a Governor O'Malley at this hour?",
        "Last year, we were able to block it successfully.",
        "This year, a lot of arm-twisting, pressures, measures I won't want to go into that I think are a little bit unethical politically, calls from Hillary and Bill Clinton last year, all kinds of things have gone on in this state just to move this thing down the road.",
        "There are other issues we could be concerned about.",
        "Look at the economy.",

        "No longer is there a six-month requirement for both parties to be residents here.",
        "Now there's going to be an exception that all the gay people that got married want to get divorced really quickly.",
        "That's an overstatement, all the people.",
        "Well, no, no, no, not all the people, forgive me.",
        "I didn't mean to say that - there are a lot of folk - and I thank you for the correction - but I think that what we're dealing with is we're tampering with these things as though this is some kind of Tinker Toy, and oh, we're overcommitted here, we'll dial it back a little bit there, and I think that's fundamentally unfair.",
        "I think the people should have a vote on this.",
        "So I believe you'll see a lot of signatures and a referendum, and I believe that as it was in 31 times out to vote on this, there will be yet another victory should the opportunity to vote come to the people of Maryland.",
        "It would be interesting, there could be referenda on gay marriage not just in Maryland this year.",
        "There probably will be in Washington state, as well, Perhaps in New Jersey, and we know it's going to be on the ballot in Minnesota.",
        "So it's going to be a very interesting year.",
        "But it's going to be interesting for a couple other reasons, and that is at the Supreme Court level, we all know it's headed that way.",
        "And if there's no pushback from Maryland and others, the Supreme Court is going to look and say: Hmm, have things really changed?",
        "How vociferous is the opposition at this time?",
        "Well, they might also look at opinion polls and say it looks like most people are now in favor.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So it's important, I think, to both sides that at this particular time, folks will step up, let their voices be heard so democracy in action can really occur."
