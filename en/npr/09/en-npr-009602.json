        "Now that it's passed, do you think you're on the cusp of achieving a victory here?",
        "Well, I think so, but I think that victory is much broader than the specific piece of legislation.",
        "I've been able to support the Civil Marriage Protection Act because I believe that it's critically important in a pluralistic democracy that we don't use theology as a basis for public policy.",
        "And so I believe - while there are well-intentioned people on all sides of this question, I think that it's a dangerous public-policy precedent to use one's subjective and personal theology as a basis for determining whether all citizens, and in this instance the residents of the state of Maryland, deserve the same basic civil liberties.",
        "Is your congregation unanimously in support?",
        "Well, I don't think any congregation is unanimous on any issue.",
        "No, I've heard from a percentage of our members who, you know, who are opposed to this measure.",
        "But I would say that the overwhelming majority of our membership, certainly well in excess of 90 percent, 95 percent of those that I've heard from, applaud the stance that I've taken, that the question as a matter of public policy should not be what does our local church believe or affirm as it relates to marriage, but simply do our neighbors deserve the same basic civil liberties.",
        "And so they overwhelming understand that distinction.",
        "Those who advocate rights for gays and lesbians, transexuals and people who are bi, also argue that opinions begin to change when people that you love, you know are gay or lesbian or bisexual or transgender, that when your cousin or your uncle or your aunt or your teacher you learn is gay, then all of the sudden your opinions begin to change.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, I do think that it's important that we not - it's easy to demonize people that you don't know.",
        "And I do believe that it's important for people of faith to have conversation and dialogue with, you know, a host of people whose choices and decisions they may not understand.",
        "So dialogue is critically important across ideological perspectives, racial lines, theological lines.",
        "It's very important to have, you know, ecumenical conversation, and I think that's to be encouraged.",
        "But again, for me, you know, what I want to emphasize is that my support for this legislation is that it provides two things.",
        "It protects local faith institutions to define marriage, religious marriage in the way that they desire.",
        "So it protects, you know, religious freedom, and it protects individual clergy, yet at the same time extending equal rights and civil liberties to all of the residents of our state.",
        "And so were it not for those religious protections, then I wouldn't have been able to support it.",
        "But I think the legislation has been crafted in a way that allows people to affirm whatever it is that they desire to affirm as a matter of their own faith and theology and yet, you know, provides for equal rights for others.",
        "Nothing is imposed on anyone.",
        "Just to clarify what you're saying, no church would be required, under state law, to marry people if they didn't agree to."

        "And I think the balance, the bill does a great balance protecting religious institution and religious freedom yet providing civil liberties, as well.",
        "Does it also afford the opportunity, and as Bishop Jackson suggested, it's very likely this is going to be on the ballot as a referendum item in November, but does it also afford the opportunity to open a dialogue in the African-American community where sometimes conversations about homosexuality are not always welcome?",
        "There's no question that there's going to be ongoing dialogue about this topic.",
        "I see it already in the responses that I've received from colleagues of mine on both sides of this question.",

        "And as long as it's done constructively and compassion, I think it's good.",
        "It's going to provide a greater opportunity for people in our communities to receive the kind of hope and healing and help that we all need rather than viewing our churches and religious institutions as a place for - of condemnation and judgment.",

        "If it's an issue of recreation, like let's say slots or casinos coming to a particular community or state, I can understand that.",

        "We don't do either of those things.",
        "Neal, you raise a great point, and I want to thank the caller for the sentiments she expressed.",
        "The real question is whether people of faith ought to legislate their belief or whether they should live in their belief.",
        "My belief, my view is that we ought to live in our faith, not legislate it because the question becomes whose interpretation of the Bible, whose understanding of scripture, which scripture, which religion is going to be the basis for public policy.",
        "I think this is a very dangerous precedent.",
        "I think it's very sincere.",
        "I think it's well-intentioned, but I think practically, even within, you know, the Christian community, within the faith community, we want to make sure that we protect the public square from private and subjective religious belief."

        "All Americans of all backgrounds are part of the human family.",
