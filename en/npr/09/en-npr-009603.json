        "This is something different.",
        "It's always odd to me how convenient parts of Scripture are used when it's for their benefit.",

        "We're talking about people's not civil rights, and blacks don't own the civil rights.",

        "Why do we care?",
        "The first gentleman you had said, oh, no one in my congregation is gay.",
        "Well, as he was the leader of your congregation, of course, no one is going to admit they're gay.",
        "That was a ridiculous statement.",
        "But the same arguments were used years ago against making rights available for blacks and for other minorities, which gay and lesbians are a minority right now, unfortunately.",
        "And how can you as a Christian, loving person say that two loving individuals should not be able to do that?",
