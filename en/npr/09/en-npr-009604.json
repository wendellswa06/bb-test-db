        "You mean the people that you talk to on the phone from Baghdad, they're trying to calm you down.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're trying to calm us, because you know, they're worried about us worried about them.",
        "But it's difficult to joke about it at this point and you sense it in their voices.",

        "Well, you know, we grew up not knowing what sect we are.",
        "The first time I ever even heard of these words is when I was in my sixth grade.",
        "I was clearly told that it was very impolite to discuss these kinds of things and they're irrelevant.",
        "And people never defined themselves, really, by sects and by religions, at least in the milieu in Baghdad, which is where all this ethnic strife is going on - I'm sorry, sectarian strife.",
        "Was that unique to your family or do you think that was a common experience in Baghdad?",
        "No, I think basically most people defined themselves and really worked up their emotions over political ideas and ideologies and all that, but I really think a lot of the sectarian labeling is like Dr. Seuss sneeches.",
        "It's about as relevant as that, and in the end, if people buy into it, they're all losers.",
        "And basically people are fearful",
        "You seem to be saying that the sectarian conflict is being amplified or misunderstood on this end.",
        "But, you know, on the other hand, you have Sunni insurgents that are doing battle against the Mahdi Army, which numbers in the thousands, some say the tens of thousands.",
        "That doesn't seem to be an exaggeration?",
        "Well, the so-called Sunni insurgents, they're not really Sunni, primarily.",
        "They're not there in order to advocate the Sunni philosophy.",
        "They may happen to all be Sunni between them, but that's not really what brings them together.",
        "And they're not even anti-Shia per se, that's not really what brings them together.",
        "So designating them as Sunni insurgents -",
        "But is the label - I'm trying to understand something.",
        "So for instance, is it -",
        "The label is irrelevant to these groups."

        "Is it that you disagree with the labels that are being used or the degree of sectarian violence?",

        "If that isn't sectarian violence, what is that?",

        "You know, I'm not privy to any strategic information or anything, but you reminded me of the election and of millions of people who came out in all parts of Iraq, lining up under threat.",
        "The reason they came out is because they felt that their action really does mean something, has some consequence.",

        "So if the city were to flood to, say, an elevation of 10 feet for the storm surge itself, then you would have water in some places in the city that would be 20 feet above the ground.",
        "So the balconies in the French Quarter?",
        "French Quarter's a little higher, but certainly with this Category 5 1/2 storm that Katrina is, we could have flooding up into the midpoint of the second story of buildings in the French Quarter.",

        "We are forced, in some ways, to speculate a little bit here because you could imagine that if this information - if he feels that it's necessary to get it out, that if he didn't reveal it until after the election, others would say he had made a political choice by not releasing it to the public before the vote.",
        "And to that I would say that the response by Director Comey at that point under your hypothetical would be there was nothing to announce.",

        "He has said she's crazy.",

        "They are the ones who are willing to say things in maybe a harsher tone than the principles are willing to do.",
        "This year, that is not happening.",
        "But because these two men aren't the attack dogs, does that mean that we could perhaps get a more substantive picture about what a Trump or Clinton presidency would look like?"
