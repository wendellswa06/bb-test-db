        "It's not going to be any surprise if you put 10 tons on a bridge that tells you it can only hold five tons, you know.",

        "So we don't have shelters because there's no place in the city that can be designated as free from flooding under any reasonable, foreseeable circumstances, like a Category 5.",
        "And how concerned--and, of course, we're concerned--about the potential loss of life should we be?",
        "Well, I would say, you know, from looking at what we've done in the past in terms of exercises where we've run these models, I think they're anticipating tens of thousands of casualties under, quote, \"\"the worst-case scenario.\"\" And that means preparing to treat and deal with and manage that number of people in terms of medical supplies and food and shelter and the rest of it.",

        "In Hong Kong they have continued to be hands-off when it comes to censorship, theyve left it alone, its economically successful and they want it to stay that way.",
        "That said, for people within mainland China, its quite possible that when they go to search and theyre directed to this site in Hong Kong, that what will happen is from within China the government may do something and actually try and censor it, since Google is no longer doing that."
