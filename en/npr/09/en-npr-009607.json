        "For NPR News, I'm Gillian Ferris Kohl.",
        "Over the past 24 hours in the United States, there have been two mass shootings.",
        "Overnight in Ohio, a gunman killed nine people and injured 26 in downtown Dayton.",
        "And in El Paso, Texas, yesterday morning, 20 people were murdered and more than two dozen injured.",
        "The suspect there is a 21-year-old white man who is under custody.",
        "A manifesto, which may be linked to the gunman, espouses racist ideology and specifically mentions a Hispanic invasion of Texas.",
        "President Trump called the attack an act of cowardice.",
        "We're joined now by the Democratic - by Democrat Ben O'Rourke, the former congressman who is from El Paso.",
        "And he's also now a presidential candidate.",
        "Good morning.",
        "BETO O'ROURKE: Good morning.",
        "First off, my deepest condolences on what is a terrible morning.",
        "You are in El Paso.",
        "You visited the victims, I understand, last night at the University Medical Center.",
        "Can you share some of what you saw and what you heard?",
        "O'ROURKE: Yeah.",
        "I just - I saw extraordinarily courageous people, many of whom have some of the most horrific injuries that we can imagine.",
        "I met a woman who was shot in the chest by the gunman, her lungs pierced, being drained as - her lungs being drained as I spoke with her, surrounded by her family, learning that her mother had also been shot, as was her aunt.",
        "Both of whom were also recovering from surgery - very common to hear that from families here, that it wasn't just a single family member.",
        "It was a husband and a wife or a mother and a daughter.",
        "I met another family where the husband, who had been raising money at a booth outside of the Walmart for the soccer team he coaches, was shot in the chest - husband was shot in the chest.",
        "The kids were with him at the booth.",
        "They luckily were able to flee to safety - talking to his wife in the waiting room who had no idea on on his condition, was just waiting to hear from doctors.",
        "So getting to be with those families, getting to meet some of the doctors and nurses providing that care, hearing the stories about the first responders, just so proud of El Paso and the way that this community has responded to this attack and just want that to be something that the rest of the country knows.",
        "It's a very strong community.",
        "It has on average about 18 murders a year.",
        "So to lose 20 lives in just a day yesterday is something so out of the ordinary but something that this community has met with extraordinary strength.",
        "El Paso is on the border.",
        "It is heavily Hispanic.",
        "And it appears this man may have been inspired by white power ideology to commit this attack.",
        "What are your thoughts on how this happened?",
        "O'ROURKE: That's what it looks like to me.",
        "From everything that I've seen, everything that I've heard from the El Paso Police Department, who've done an amazing job so far, this person, not from our community, from north Texas, about a nine or 10-hour drive away, brought that hatred to El Paso.",
        "And in the manifesto that looks like he may have written and posted before shooting people in our community, he is anti-immigrant, he's anti-Hispanic.",
        "He sees people not just as different but dangerous.",
        "I think it's really important for us to understand this in a much larger context of what is happening in this country, especially at a time where we have a president who seeks to make us afraid of one another based on our differences, who warned of Mexican immigrants being rapists and criminals, though we know that immigrants in this country commit crimes at a far lower rate.",
        "Those hosts on Fox News talk about an invasion coming to our border, politicians who seek to make us afraid of people who do not look like the majority in this country - it doesn't just offend our sensibilities as a country of immigrants and asylum-seekers.",
        "I really believe it is changing our country right now.",
        "It is an invitation to hatred - not just to hatred but to violence.",
        "So in addition to looking at and changing our gun laws, universal background checks, an end to the sales of weapons of war to our communities, we also have to put an end to the hatred and the racism and the divisiveness that so defines our politics in this country today.",
        "I have always been fleeing categories, Harley Allison(ph) once gave me the advice not to have myself categorized as any particular type of writer, but categories are a fact of life.",
        "And I write supernatural suspense - that is what I'm primarily known for, although I have written short stories that might be considered science fiction, because they have a symbol full of science and then it's an extrapolation about okay, how will this impact an individual in the society or a child in a society.",
        "But most of what I write, definitely, is supernatural suspense."

        "And Steven, when you - one other cut on why African-Americans write speculative fiction that I've heard discussed is because we want to live to a certain degree, in a sense of hope for an alternative reality.",
        "Obviously, not all science fiction is positive, in terms of the way that the future is envisioned, but do you think that there is an urge for people who may have critiques of modern-day society to look for alternatives in the future?",
        "Well, I think that the drive of the artists of any kind is to express something what they feel inside themselves and externalize it so that others can feel, know and react to what they see.",
        "I think that African-Americans might have a little bit special push there, but the truth is that every individual human being feels that sense of disconnect with the society outside themselves.",

        "Gays as a group have a disconnect.",
        "You know, blind people, as a group have a disconnect.",
        "So - anytime there's a cultural edge and you feel, my perspective, the way I see this, is not being presented or it's being presented inaccurately, or it's being presented viciously, it's being presented in such a way as it creates a derogatory context and I feel the pain, and my children feel that pain, then you do this as part of the artistic urge.",
        "Sheree, tell us about \"\"Dark Matter\"\" because that was one of these landmark anthologies.",
        "Did you ever talk to the writers about why they wrote what they wrote?",
        "Yes, I had many fun conversations with writers from all over the country and a few other places about how they got involved in the field, how they got interested.",
        "And many of them said, it was, you know, from childhood, you know, listening to elders in their families who told stories and really, just sparked their imagination.",
        "It inspired them to write and to look for work of their own.",
        "Also, it seems to be a part of - just a part of the environment.",
        "If you are a part of a culture, for example, you maybe Caribbean and there are tales -legendary tales about guppies and all kinds of amazing animals, and lugaroos(ph), some hadeo(ph), what have you.",
        "You know, it's part of - just part of the atmosphere.",
        "And then, also, some of them were just interested in the sciences in general.",
        "I mean, that was just the thing that they were very curious about.",
        "They wanted to how the world worked and, you know, science is a great way to put order to what might be chaotic around you.",
        "And so they began to apply that to their writing.",
        "Sheree - and I'm going to ask all of you this - name your favorite work of speculative fiction, tell us very briefly what it's about, and why you like it?",
        "You've got to be kidding.",

        "Thomas, editor of \"\"Dark Matter,\"\" an award-winning compilation of speculative fiction.",
        "Let's move a little bit from the writers to the audience.",
        "Tananarive, your books have really crossed a lot of audiences.",
        "Who do you think is your audience?",
        "In the very beginning, my audience was almost exclusively African-American women, I would say.",
        "That was how I was marketed, sort of, on the heels of Terry McMillan, oh, black people will buy a commercial fiction.",
        "There was a lot of excitement in publishing about that.",
        "I have attracted horror readers over time.",
        "Steve and I just wrote mysteries and we're attracting mystery writers now.",
        "But I will say this, it's interesting, even though there is an attraction to the supernatural because of what people have in their own backgrounds culturally, I think there's also been a reticence on the part of some black readers to open my books because of the sense - either because of religious reasons or stories their grandmother told them that somehow they're inviting an evil into their world.",
        "So I hear from book clubs that they have to fight sometimes to get my books on the list.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Steven, what about you?",
        "And, you know, bouncing off of what Tananarive said, are there barriers to broadening your audience?",
        "I would say so.",
        "I mean, I think that the typical reader of one of my books is a science fiction reader who enjoys social speculation or anthropological speculation or - and enjoys a certain amount of suspense and action.",
        "I think that there are problems with broadening it out to the broadest conceivable audience that I would have not faced had I been white because, I think, that science fiction is - in fantasy(ph), a very much the mythology of the 20th and 21st century and the central mythology of any group of people is God created us first and loves us best.",
        "So science fiction is absolutely 99.9 percent white people and their imaginary friends.",
        "You know, that - they don't believe that about themselves.",
        "They don't believe that they're heir to the same perceptual problems that the rest of the human race has, but they do.",
        "And so if you put a non-white person on the cover of the book, you'll hurt the sales.",
        "That's really interesting.",
        "And before we move on to Sheree, I'm thinking as you talk of Ursula Le Guin, who broke a lot of boundaries with women's issues in the same way that you're talking about breaking boundaries with African-American issues, she found a great audience.",
        "Do you think over time that African-American speculative fiction writers will find, you know, ways to broaden non-black audiences?",
        "Well, it's already happening, but it will never be as popular.",
        "I mean, you know, Ursula Le Guin - one thing all she had to do is to reach out to women who are 51 percent of the population, you know.",
        "So just numerically, she had a gigantic advantage.",
        "So I know that as time goes on, the aversion factor, the sense of the other, the sense of guilt based on things that happened in the past - all of those things combining with the natural human tendency towards us considering your group to be more beautiful and wonderful and intelligent than whatever the other group is.",
        "And these barriers take time and it takes education and, you know, hope springs eternal."

        "Where else has it gone?",
        "Well, it's definitely been a part of the book clubs.",
        "They really reached out.",
        "And I totally agree with Tananarive about the struggles they might have had, to have the book on their list because there is this streak of conservatism that we have in our community, maybe not more so than in the other community, but we're more conscious of it, I guess, because we're so small compared to the rest of the country.",

        "All kinds of things that really do affect us on a daily basis, it's in that work.",

        "What happens if this happens?",
        "So hopefully, you can take a science fictional element, a futuristic element or a fantasy element to hold up a mirror to our society and show readers, listen, you need to have a voice, you need to be active because this is where we could be headed.",
        "Steven, what are you working on right now?",
        "I'm working on a sequel to a novel set 30,000 years ago in East Africa.",
        "It's called \"\"Shadow Valley.\"\" And also, we're getting ready to do the second book, the second Tennyson Hardwick mystery novel.",
        "And Sheree, are you continuing to look at gathering together African-American speculative fiction?",
