        "There's only one abortion provider in the state of Mississippi, and we're pretty sure that the loss of that other abortion clinic has contributed to the decline in abortion rates in Mississippi.",
        "The two percent decline in abortion providers in this survey, however, is much smaller than the double-digit decreases of previous surveys.",
        "A major reason, says Jones, is the increase in providers offering medical as opposed to surgical abortions, in most cases via the abortion pill RU-486.",
        "And we estimate if it weren't for these providers who offer only early medical abortions, that the number of providers would have declined by eight percent instead of by two percent.",

        "Our abortion rate is still higher than every other nation in the Western world.",
        "We can do better than that.",
        "Despite the disagreements over the relative merits of the abortion pill, however, remember this - next week, when sign-wielding pro-choice and pro-life groups are yelling at each other, they actually agree on one fundamental point: the best way to continue to reduce the number of abortions is to continue to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies.",
