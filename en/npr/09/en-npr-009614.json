        "A'HEARN: Well, largely it was because it was very small, and that coupled with the large amount of gas were the two dominant criteria.",
        "The first one, though, was that it was small and therefore different from Temple 1.",
        "And what do you hope to learn from this?",
        "You know the source, you say.",
        "You know where the gas is coming from.",
        "What does a mission to a comet like this really tell you in the long term?",
        "Prof.",
        "A'HEARN: What we really want to know is how we got here, how the planets formed four and a half billion years ago.",
        "And the comets preserve a much better record of those conditions than the planets do.",
        "So we want to use them to study how the planets formed.",
        "The problem is, comets are influenced by their evolution every time they come very close to the sun, and what we're trying to do is separate out the parts of the comet that are due to evolution...",
        "Right.",
        "Prof. A'HEARN: ...from those that have been there since four and a half billion years ago.",
        "And looking at comets of very different sizes changes the importance of different processes relative to the primordial characteristics.",
        "So these comets really are left over from the time the Earth formed, our solar system formed then(ph)?",
        "Prof. A'HEARN: That's correct.",
        "Everything formed together four and a half billion years ago.",
        "Wow.",

        "Where did you find this comet?",
        "Where is it living?",
        "Prof.",
        "A'HEARN: Well, this is one of a large group of comets called Jupiter family comets.",
        "They - their orbits take them out a little bit beyond the orbit of Jupiter and bring them in somewhere in the inner solar system from a little bit inside the Earth's orbit.",
        "Some of them only come in to the orbit of Mars.",
        "But Jupiter's gravity is what is dominating the perturbation(ph) - the changes in their orbit over time.",

        "Several weeks later, Karli-Rae could have used another hit of laughing gas to help her come to terms with her newly arrived hospital bill.",
        "It detailed it almost $5,000 price tag for the nitrous oxide alone.",
        "I was shocked when I saw the itemized charges, and at first, I thought there was a mistake.",
        "Remember, Karli-Rae makes a living helping other women give birth, and her facility charges a flat fee of about $100 for laughing gas.",
        "Working in health care, I have always tried to be proactive about finding out how much things would cost before going into them.",
        "With the nitrous, I never even asked because I had never conceived that someone would bill it so high.",
        "I knew many places that provided the service for free.",
        "Karli-Rae says she and her husband have a lot of student loans and carefully spend their money.",

        "Still, she thought it was ridiculous and didn't want anyone overcharged, but her insurance company didn't seem to mind.",
        "They said, well, since it's part of the global fee, we don't really care.",
        "It's just - it is what it is, and we're not going to worry about looking into it.",
        "Karli-Rae gave in and paid her share of the bill even though she thought she was being overcharged.",
        "At that point with a new baby and a toddler and my own job, you know, looking forward to going back to, I just didn't - the hassle was just too much, and I didn't want to fight them on it anymore.",

        "And, Elisabeth Rosenthal, let me bring you back in here - $5,000 bill for that laughing gas at the hospital even though, as we heard, her facility charges a hundred bucks, flat fee.",
        "How do you explain that huge difference?",
        "Well, when we examined Karli-Rae's bill, we saw that her hospital had gotten to $5,000 by charging her - get this - by the minute.",
        "She was billed over $100 for every 15 minutes that tank was in her room, and it didn't matter that she was only taking hits of the gas now and again.",
        "She would have been billed that much just for it sitting by the bedside.",
        "It's kind of like if you rent a car for the day, you're paying for 24 hours even if you're only driving for an hour.",
        "Even if you never drive it a mile.",
        "It's crazy.",
        "Is that common, to bill by the minute or by the hour?",
        "Well, unfortunately, more and more because it's very lucrative to do so.",
        "So you can charge surgical suites by the minute.",
        "You can charge recovery room time by the minute.",
        "It's a dubious but kind of legal way to bill.",
        "For example, in that recovery room case - right?",
        "- you're sitting there for three hours.",
        "Well, it may not be for a medical reason but because your surgeon is making rounds or dealing with another patient or just can't find a parking space.",
        "By the way, the thing that really shocked me is that when we ask the hospital, well, what would you charge for an epidural, the charge was $1,500, so a third of what having that tank sitting in the room costs."
