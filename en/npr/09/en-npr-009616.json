        "Some of the biggest names in college football have said that the BCS is an absolute sham, that there should be a playoff system, and it's only because of greedy and small-minded college presidents who cling to the bowl system, because over 50 percent of all colleges get to play in a bowl.",
        "Right.",

        "The kind of underdog that, surging with adrenaline despite physical odds to overcome, won a championship over a school called Georgetown, which is in Washington, D.C.",
