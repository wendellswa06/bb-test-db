        "They'd get a little piece of the pie when this is all said and done.",
        "I mean, I talked to a lot of college athletes and the first thing they say to me is not I want the bowl system, but while I'm out there on the field, I wouldn't mind getting a little piece of that myself at the end of the day.",

        "Well, I'm one that stands - that falls on the side of the current system: It makes every game matter, it makes every game count.",
        "And this season was a perfect example of that.",
        "I watched more football probably this season than I have in any other season in recent memory because every single weekend, you had teams that put - that, you know, either suddenly made a move where they could play for a championship or - you know, and teams that we thought that would be going to a championship that lost in an upset.",
        "And I think if you go to a playoff system, you end up with either one of two situations.",
        "You either have a small field of four or eight teams, and then you have the same problems that you have with the current selection process.",
