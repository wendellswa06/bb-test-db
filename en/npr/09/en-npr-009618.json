        "Right.",
        "Or you have a larger field of 16 or more teams and then you dramatically reduce the importance of the regular season games.",
        "And I just - I think that the sport would suffer for that.",
        "You see, this proves that NPR has intelligent listeners.",
        "Nice.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, Tom, take the compliment and thanks very much.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "Ed, what do you hear from - I read a Gallup poll saying only 15 percent of people were satisfied with this system.",
        "Earlier, you made the point that the reality doesn't matter what percent of the system…",
        "Yeah, it doesn't.",
        "I mean, there's no question in my mind that if you took a fan poll, it would heavily favor some form of a playoff.",
        "But, you know what, as Dave said, it gets back, certainly, to the presidents - or it begins there.",
        "It trickles down into the conference chairs and the coaches.",
        "Heck, from what I've heard, the folks at the Pack 10, Big 10 in Rose Bowl are the major blocking force - or certainly have been on record as saying, they don't even want a plus one.",
        "So in the end, I just don't see it dramatically changing, although there certainly has been discussion about a plus one.",
        "The trouble with the plus one, some years that worked real well.",
        "This year, I think, you would look at it and say, well, there are a lot of schools - USC, Georgia, and Kansas - who would feel they have every right to play the winner of tonight's game, too."

        "Yes.",
        "This year would be one of those years where you'd want an eight-team field.",
        "But let me just ask you, Ed, while we have you on the line.",
        "Do you think - is your assessment, knowing what you know about ratings, do you think the college presidents and the conference presidents are being penny-wise, pound-foolish?",
        "Because I could see a scenario.",
        "If you marry the popularity of college football - maybe you could talk to just how incredibly popular college football is as a sport - and you marry that with the buzz of March Madness, which is the NCAA basketball tournament for a regular season sport that I don't think is as popular, I would think that you could have an event - a weeks-long event that could even rival the NFL as the greatest television property we know.",
        "Well, maybe so.",
        "But understand - and everybody likes to bring the NCAA basketball tournament into the equation as an example.",
        "The reality is that the BCS ratings, right through the championship game, are well in line, if not even better, than the final four of the NCAA basketball tournament and ourselves, guys, we've been very fortunate.",
        "Madison Avenue loves the current system based on the fact that we are sold out for four years, which is just an amazing testimonial to the college BCS product.",
        "And the current system meaning you're sold out for all the ballgames or just the championship?",
        "All of them.",
        "Amazing.",
        "Let's take one more call and if you could stay with us, Ed, for a second because I know you've got a lot to do.",
        "But Andrew(ph) from St. Augustine, Florida.",
        "Go ahead, Andrew.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I'm going to be a staunched defender of a system.",
        "I think it reflects the university culture.",
        "It's what I call the seminar approach to choosing a winner, I suppose, and that's, in a sense, what these coaches are asked to do - to come together and develop some kind of a consensus and understanding and in doing that, they reflect the university culture and take away some of that competitive nature of the sport.",
        "And, of course, show that, you know, coaches can come together and make a good decision together.",
        "That's my comment.",
        "Wow, thanks for the call there, Andrew.",
        "Go ahead, Dave.",
        "If you could meet with him now, if you could talk with Bergdahl, what is it you'd want to say to him?",
        "Yeah, I was going to say it's remarkable considering how cutthroat college sports can be on every conceivable level, from the university level to the network level, that when it comes time to defend a system that 85 percent of the people don't want, all of a sudden it's draped in ivy and we're speaking about it as if the long day has gone by, as if we've got - we're all going to sing \"\"Auld Lang Syne\"\" here in a second."

        "Now, I just think it's so much more critical, I think, to understand that we have to look at what college football could be and what it could generate.",
        "I mean, Ed's absolutely right, that the current system people profit from it and it does very well.",
        "But that vision that - of what it could be, I think the basketball analogy is very appropriate, because 20 years ago, no one would have thought that you would have the office pools, the bus, the excitement and the people who are casual sports fans stepping to the fore and becoming something much more intense.",
        "Well, that's really going to convince college presidents that off these pools are the figures to expand the format.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So Ed, I'm going to let you go in a second because you, of course, got a lot to do.",
        "But we've been going around a little bit and the same point is made that no matter how many ideas you have to improve it, reality says it's not going to improve.",
        "But a few years ago, there was a different system and the BCS does represent a gradual improvement.",
        "Are there any baby steps that you think can be made to address some of the concerns we've heard?",
        "Well, I do believe that moving forward, you will hear more and more discussion at the very least about the possibility of a plus one.",
        "I don't see it happening in the next two years because of current contracts.",
        "There are some speed bumps along the way, but between a plus one and what we have today.",
        "And I will say this speaking for Fox Sports: Our number one priority is to continue the relationship with the BCS.",
        "It has been outstanding and if it doesn't change one iota, we would love to continue that relationship down the road.",

        "There would see a million to one shot that we would have a shot at the title.",

        "We are, I guess, equivalent to like an Appalachian State going out beat Michigan?",
        "Yeah.",
        "But you're in Division I-A or what they used to call that.",
        "Are you on the top division?",

        "It's something weird now.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "What's the solution?",
        "All right.",
        "It's an 18 playoffs - it will be 18 playoffs and they'll consist of the six conferences that are already in place.",
        "It will also - the first round of the playoffs will also consist of the four ballgames that are already existing - the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl and Cotton Bowl.",
        "We can keep traditions alive, too, by having the Rose Bowl house automatically a Pac-10 versus the Big Ten in the first round of the playoffs.",
        "And then you also have the tradition of the Notre Dame club, which is the Notre Dame housed to more than 10 wins are automatically in the playoffs and so that gives one spot there plus the bowl's one or two spots for the mid-majors like the Utahs and the Boise state.",
        "The second week will become two new ballgames.",
        "Why not?",
        "You can make it, you know, something really nice like the Gold and the Silver Bowl or something like that.",

        "It will not - it will actually add some more revenue to the whole situation without having to mess with the other bowls.",
