        "Hey.",
        "I'm a University of Georgia grad and I just wanted to make a comment about how frustrating that game was because we are big team coming in.",
        "We should have, debatably, played in a national championship, but…",
        "And that game, we should say, was this was you beat the undefeated Hawaii team and beat them to a pulp soundly.",
        "Yeah because she can't stop at the 7-Eleven in Verona, but...",
        "No.",
        "Yes.",
        "And it's frustrating because they're undefeated but they're coming from a minor conference with only two teams that have winning records in that conference.",
        "So why - what are we doing playing that school, you know?",
        "In their defense, they were jetlagged.",
        "Well, come on.",
        "It was a heck of a flight.",
        "But the point is at a day that you should have been celebrating the victory of your Georgia Bulldogs, you were having these ambivalent feelings.",
        "Right.",
        "And we couldn't really win for losing because we were beating them and then everybody says, oh, well, they're just playing Hawaii, they come from a minor conference, what do you expect?",
        "But then, the announcers turned around and said how disappointing it was for the country because, you know, Hawaii was an underdog it wouldn't have been great for the country if Hawaii would have won.",
        "So it's just kind of frustrating coming from - to play in the Sugar Bowl, which is traditionally for years and years and years had been a big game for the FCC."

        "Bergdahl's captors released him in 2014 in a prisoner exchange, and he went on to share his story.",
        "As he described it, he says that he left because he was trying to report leadership problems at your post.",
        "What did you make of that when you heard it?",
        "If there were leadership problems, not a single other paratrooper that I served with saw them.",

        "Correct.",
