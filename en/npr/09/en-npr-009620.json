        "What do you want people to know about working so many different jobs and having to work so many hours?",
        "That it's very tough.",
        "And I really wish I didn't have to.",
        "I would love to be able to wake up, go to work, come home and hang out and, you know, relax like so many other people do.",

        "We asked him to give us a picture of what minimum and low-wage jobs look like in this country.",
        "And he said it was a lot of what we'd think - fast food, retail.",
        "But it's also home health aides who work with people who can't care for themselves.",
        "I asked him what we know about what happens when you raise the minimum wage.",
        "There's a fierce argument across the political spectrum and conflicting data.",
        "Right now, we are just conducting this large-scale economic and social experiment because some cities have and states have raised the minimum wage or have signed legislation that will raise it in the coming years.",
        "So that's really what we're waiting to see.",
        "So it basically depends on where you live, for example, on what the possible effects might be?",
        "It's not just a one-size-fit-all issue.",
        "Very much, very much.",
        "Depends on what the kind of wage structure of your city is.",
        "And if the median wage - the wage of a typical worker in your city - is very high, then those cities can typically absorb a high minimum wage.",
        "So Seattle, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., which enacted its own $15 an hour minimum wage increase - all those cities, economists believe, are perfectly capable of withstanding a very high minimum wage, even as high as $15 an hour.",
        "But if you go to Binghamton, New York, or, you know, places in the Inland Empire in California where people don't make that much, then suddenly there is a concern that the cities will not be able to withstand that a high a minimum wage.",
        "The woman we spoke to - her name is Christy.",
        "She's a teacher.",
        "And she uses the minimum wage jobs to fill in the cracks.",
        "And she mentions she knows lots of teachers, police officers and other people who have sort of a main job that doesn't pay enough who also do that, not for luxuries, but maybe to have a second car or to pay their mortgage.",
        "Do you get a sense that her story is common?",
        "You've had success with two chooseable path books now.",
        "So is it - if it's not a gimmick, are you going to do another chooseable path book (laughter)?",
        "Very common.",
        "It's been a historical trend since the 2008-09 recession and financial crisis.",
        "And I think it really helps fuel the growth of the so-called gig economy.",
        "We see a lot of people driving for Uber or doing odd jobs on TaskRabbit.",
        "And a lot of what's happening on those platforms is people either supplementing steady jobs that they have and just don't quite pay the bills or stitching together a bunch of different gigs so that they add up to a livelihood."

        "How do you solve the problem of keeping the economy going while paying workers a living wage?",
        "That seems to be the crux of the debate.",
        "It's an incredibly complicated and vexing question.",
        "To simplify massively, you sort of have two views of low-paid work.",
        "One is that it's really not sustainable for someone, particularly someone with a family who lives in a city with any kind of expenses, to get by on the minimum wage in most places.",
        "The other view is that low-wage employment is kind of an apprenticeship.",
        "It's kind of a temporary stop on the way to bigger and better things.",
        "You often hear of people who are critics of the minimum wage point out that a lot of teenagers work minimum wage jobs.",
        "I think those claims have been overstated.",
