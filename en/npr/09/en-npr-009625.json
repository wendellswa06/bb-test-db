        "Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Turkey today, amid heavy security, on his first visit to a Muslim country as pontiff.",
        "The trip follows angry protests over comments the Pope made a couple of months ago.",
        "Back in September, he quoted a 14th century Christian emperor who characterized the prophet Muhammad's teaching as evil and inhuman.",
        "The Pope later expressed his regrets, but at a joint appearance today, Turkey's chief of religious affairs Ali Bardakoglu, made an indirect reference to the controversy.",
        "He said, quote, the so-called conviction that the sword is used to expand Islam in the world and growing Islamophobia hurts all Muslims.",
        "Since 9/11 there's been intense debate about the tolerance, the militancy, and the goals of Islam.",
        "Yet many of us know little about the religion and the man who founded it.",
        "Religion writer Karen Armstrong has just published her second biography of Muhammad that places the life of the prophet in the context of his times, and that's our main focus today.",
        "Later in the hour, we'll talk with NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly about terrorism, the Taliban, and America's uncomfortable alliance with a military dictator in Pakistan.",
        "But first, Muhammad.",
        "Who was he?",
        "What do we know about him?",
        "And how can our understanding of his life help us better understand the world today?",

        "And, Karen Armstrong, always nice to have you on the program.",
        "Thank you very much indeed.",
        "Good to be back.",
        "And I guess we have to begin with the point that a cleric raised today in Turkey, what he described as the so-called conviction that the sword is used to expand Islam in the world.",
        "And I guess that goes back to our perception of Muhammad himself, who was both a prophet and a warrior.",
        "Well, he was a warrior rather against his will and inclinations.",
        "He was a merchant by trade and came from Mecca in the Arabian Hijaz.",
        "And the people of Mecca, because they were engaged in traded, actually abjured warfare.",
        "They were not warriors, and the Koran shows that when warfare became part of the scene in the early days of Islam, many Muslims found this extremely distasteful and disturbing.",
        "Muhammad, however, found himself after he'd been preaching in Mecca for a number of years, having made very little headway - the subject of persecution, his - and eventually the people of Mecca, the Meccan establishment, attacked him, and their vowed intention would have been to exterminate the Muslim community.",
        "He - Muhammad married a six-year-old girl and had unusual sexual practices with her until she was nine years old before he consummated the marriage.",
        "Can you please speak to that?",
        "That's right.",
        "One that stands out is in New Hampshire.",
        "Girls who want to seek - who are seeking an abortion, first have to tell their parents or a judge.",
        "That is something that abortion advocates see as a clear pattern of trying to increase the level of oversight, the level of interdiction that - intervention, rather, that authorities can have before abortions actually take place.",
        "Some on the other side, the pro-choice movement, think that this is going to be an open - open the door to lawsuits in New Hampshire and other states that are trying the same legislation.",

        "I'm calling to make a comment upon the new law, which requires women under 18 to notify their parents or a judge.",
        "I think that it was a political boon for the Republicans, a really easy issue to convince parents that there should be a law that their teenagers tell them if they're getting an abortion.",
        "But truth be told, I mean, stuff can get really weird up in New Hampshire.",
        "You know, home situations are not always perfect, and I think that this is a really dangerous law for teenagers, women under 18.",
        "All right, McKayla, thanks for the call.",
        "So Corey, this was controversial, I take it?",
        "Absolutely, and it's not the first time this law has actually come up.",
        "This has been kicked around before this past year, when it was passed.",
        "So there's not - this wasn't one of the laws that was passed in New Hampshire that had an enormous amount of public sentiment behind it.",
        "We should note that a lot of laws also are taking effect to restrict immigration, tighten voter ID laws.",
        "We'll be talking a lot of about that in a few moments.",
        "But what do you - what trend overall are you seeing here, Corey?",
        "We've had a lot of - last year, we were talking about conservatives taking control of legislatures, right?",
        "So...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "That – conservatives, or rather Republicans, taking broader control over state legislatures and governors offices.",
        "Consider this, Jennifer: Republicans now control 28 of the 50 state legislatures, and Democrats only control about 15.",
        "The rest of the state legislatures are split between Democratic and Republican control.",
        "And it doesn't stop there: Republicans control not only the legislature but also the governor's office in 23 states.",
        "So not only do you have legislative control, but now your party in many of these states, in the majority of states, have control of the governor's office, who actually can actually sign this legislation.",
        "So it does reflect this sort of red-state wave that happened in 2010, and now you're seeing on the local level and on the state level a lot of legislation come out of that, like you said abortion, immigration, crackdowns on so-called voter fraud, all those things are happening.",
        "In the case of voter fraud, in the case of voter ID, you had several states last year that passed legislation, I think it's eight, that passed legislation requiring some form of ID before they vote, which obviously we'll talk about later."

        "How's it going?",
        "Good.",

        "You can pay five cents for them, but nobody seems - around me wants to pay that.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Oh dear, they'll have to get the enforcement up to gear there.",
        "All right, Matthew, you think it's a good law or no?",
        "I personally think that it's good and that people are just going to end up having to, you know, carry bags with them, the reusable, maybe a backpack.",
        "I personally think that it's a very good thing, and I can take my comments off the air.",

        "Illinois has an interesting one, a registry for convicted murderers.",
        "Explain that.",
        "Exactly, when you think about registry, most of us think about the sex offender registries that are very common now in many states.",
        "But for people convicted of murders, once they do their time, and they're released from prison, the law requires or will require that they register on a database that the state will maintain, and it's done in an effort, in their minds, to alert the public of potential dangers.",
        "But it does raise a question of how restrictive that database will be.",
        "In the case of sex offender registries, the big problem is that sex offenders are restricted from living in certain areas, obviously within certain vicinities of schools and such.",
        "So in many states what you're finding with sex offenders is that they often get pushed further and further away from communities that they actually can afford to live in.",
        "And so we might see the same thing with convicted murderers who have served their time, or is that the concern?",
        "That is the concern because you have to - you have to give everything.",
        "You have to give - you register your name, your address, place of birth - place of birth, your place of resident, of course, residence, of course.",
        "But yes, it - when you have people trying to re-enter society, the opponents of this legislation raise the question of whether or not they'll be able to effectively do that.",
        "All right, so a new registry of convicted murderers in Illinois.",
        "Right.",
        "Very briefly, what about this end of happy hour in Utah that we mentioned?",
        "How can they do that?"
