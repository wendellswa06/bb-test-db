        "And I know when I was - it's been a few years, about 10 years ago that I was a public employee, the first 15 years of my career I spent as a public employee.",
        "And at the time, I know I wasn't getting paid market value, but one of the reasons that I stayed with it was to make sure that I had a retirement plan."

        "OK.",

        "Actually, they're - well, I guess there's been a general march to scapegoat public employees in general at the state House.",
        "So there's been a lot of public protests, you know, from public employees on a number of issues, larger ones to current employees are benefit changes and things like that.",
        "But, yeah, so that's...",
        "All right.",
        "Well, Jerry, thanks for the phone call.",
        "And NPR national correspondent Corey Dade, Jerry's not alone out there.",
        "No, he's not, especially in the Midwest states, where they've been hit particularly hard with budget shortfalls as a result of just revenue drying up to the states.",

        "We've seen efforts similar to this in Ohio.",

        "They were actually having budget shortfalls before the recession hit.",
        "So the caller is right insofar as there's been a lot of criticism from people in so many different - in parts of the state about the different cuts that are being made - that are being placed on public employees that governments really have faced so much not only criticism from them, but really, they haven't been able to find any other levers to pull because so many of these local - state governments also, but also so many of these cities have industrial economies that have not been able to diversify.",
        "So they have no choice, in some degree - at least the argument that comes from the governor and other public officials - but to go after the benefits of public employees.",
        "All right let's move on now to some of the big trends that we're seeing.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "As you know and many know, that last year in particular, Arizona, other states - well, Arizona did this before, but other states like Georgia, Alabama, have started passing laws that tighten up immigration enforcement.",
        "And that's specifically laws that allow law enforcement to actually become more aggressive in questioning people suspected of being illegal immigrants for documentation to prove that they're here illegally.",
        "Alabama has the most strict law, of course, at this point, and it goes further than any other law.",
        "Now there's so much blowback to the Alabama law, that - it's being criticized as going too far, that now the legislature itself, when it comes into session this month, is actually looking at ways to scale it back.",
        "So along with that, the laws or the provisions that are actually coming into effect this year are the E-Verify provisions.",
        "And this refers to the federal system, the federal database that businesses in states like Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, businesses in those states will have to go to that database, go to the E-Verify database to confirm that their new employees are actually in the country legally.",
        "And they face fines, a variety of different penalties if they do not.",
        "And this has been a program that's been pretty controversial, and people say there's, you know, false positives or negatives.",
        "It doesn't - it definitely does not have a 100 percent accuracy rate here, but they're working on it, and it has been spreading quickly.",
        "It has been spreading, and it's actually one aspect of many of these immigration enforcement laws that's been held up by the courts.",
        "It's been allowed to proceed, while the other provisions are still under challenge - in some cases injunction - by the federal courts.",
        "Of course, that's because the federal government is actually suing to overturn this legislation on the state level.",
        "But E-Verify certainly has survived the legal challenge.",
        "So another step there for some business owners.",
        "In terms of court challenges, the Supreme Court is going to look at this issue, is that right, this coming year?",
        "The Supreme Court will not look at E-Verify because that's already been decided by the courts.",
        "But the high court did decide to take up the Arizona case, which everyone was expecting will happen.",
        "Certainly, the proponents of this law in Arizona were hoping that this would happen.",
        "And so whatever side the Supreme Court comes down on will have enormous consequences for all these other laws.",
        "Right.",
        "So other states may have to change or tweak their laws depending on what comes out of the Supreme Court."

        "And what about - are there other states out there thinking of creating laws, waiting to see what happens?",
        "Yeah, these types of laws are actually in the works in one form or another in so many different states, too many to name.",
        "Some of them have been rejected by certain legislatures over the last year or so.",
        "But I think at this point, what I'm seeing is that many states are actually pausing to see what happens with these federal cases, and they're trying to look at that and possibly actually tweak their laws before there actually is a federal decision in these different court cases or a Supreme Court decision, so that they can perhaps find a way to thread that needle and get their legislation passed eventually.",
        "So this is a very pivotal year for this whole issue.",
        "Now, we've been talking about laws restricting - aiming to restrict illegal immigration.",
        "Some states have taken a different tact - California, for example.",
        "That's right.",
        "California has its own version of the DREAM Act, and of course the DREAM Act was the federal provision proposed by Congress that would have actually put on a path to citizenship a certain population of Latinos in particular, but illegal immigrants whose parents came to this country and brought their children with them as babies.",
        "And there are a bunch of different provisions that would qualify these groups of people, but on the state level in California, what they're doing is actually extending scholarships to the children who were born in other countries as infants, but have spent their entire lives here - scholarships for college.",
        "So not just the ability to go to a public institution...",
        "To attend, right.",
        "But to qualify - now, I read private scholarships at public institutions?",
        "Right.",
        "They are - what - this is actually similar to what Illinois is trying to do.",
        "They're using their leverage - the state government is using their leverage to actually bring together private investment, nonprofits, et cetera, to fund this.",
        "And this is, in some degree, a political answer, the idea being that we're going to help these children and these young people get an education at institutions, but we're not going to put it on the backs of the taxpayer.",
        "OK.",

        "That's right.",
        "We're talking specifically about a government-issued photo ID.",

        "They will require their voters to show government-issued photo ID.",
        "Laws were also passed in South Carolina and Texas, but both of those states - because of the Voting Rights Act - require the Department of Justice to approve their voting law changes.",
        "And just a couple of weeks ago, the Department of Justice blocked South Carolina's law from going into effect because they said that it would discriminate against minorities who are less likely to have this photo ID.",
        "I think read somewhere 20 percent less likely.",
        "About 20 percent, yeah, less likely.",
