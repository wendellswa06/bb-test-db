        "It's a really hot topic.",
        "Wow.",
        "Now, these laws have, obviously, been extremely controversial.",
        "Why do lawmakers say that they need them?",
        "Well, the proponents - which tend to be Republican.",
        "Most of the ones - the new laws have been passed by Republican legislatures, although it's not totally the case.",
        "But they say that a photo ID is needed to prevent fraud at the polling place.",
        "They argue that - especially in this era when we have so many close elections - that even if there's a little bit of fraud, somebody coming and voting using a false identity - that, you know, it could steal the election.",
        "Although, quite frankly, there's very little evidence that there's much of this type of fraud, and what there is - it tends to be more with absentee ballots, with a lot - which a lot of these laws don't address.",
        "Oh, really?",
        "You don't have to show the same ID, obviously, I guess, (unintelligible).",
        "It depends, state by state.",
        "Some states, you do have to show ID if you submit an absentee ballot, but some others, you don't.",
        "Hmm.",

        "Good.",
        "Out here, we are the only state to have that bill shut down, because it's a very, very bad bill, like you said, your guest said.",
        "There's never been no case of voter fraud here.",
        "Now, what is the fraud is that 217,000 people here in South Carolina, it would have disenfranchised.",
        "You would have - (unintelligible) would have - took them - their rights away from them.",
        "Now, that is the fraud.",
        "And a matter of fact, it's five million across the nation that a lot of these bills that some states have allowed to pass would disenfranchise."

        "Even though this time you had been - it wasn't harassment; it was assault.",
        "But what it has done, it has poisoned the mind of a lot of people thinking that now they can't vote without this voter ID.",
        "So no, I think they need to - the states need to be responsible for putting it out there that they can vote with their - without their ID.",
        "And do I understand, Calvin, you're actually part of a party - a lawsuit against this.",
        "Exactly.",
        "We are the ones that went to Justice Department, along with several groups like the NAACP, the ACLU, Progressive Network, the Women's League of Voters, AARP.",

        "So - but right now, we're expect them to appeal this, and we will be - we're ready to sharpen our nails and fight this tooth and nail to the very end.",

        "I actually did go down to South Carolina to do a story about this, and, in fact, found a number of people and interviewed quite a few people who, as hard it is to believe, don't have any kind of government-issued photo ID.",
        "And the issue is is that most of the states that require this are saying they'll provide free ID to anybody who needs it.",
        "But the problem is a lot of people do not have the underlying documents that they need to get the free ID.",
        "Such as?",
        "A birth certificate, or maybe they have a birth certificate, but the name is different than the one that they have on their Social Security card.",
        "And I found, especially in South Carolina, that a lot of this was common in certain rural areas.",
        "Many years ago, when people were born on the farm with midwives, they just, quite frankly, never got a birth certificate.",
        "And as hard it is to believe, they've gone through life without one.",
        "And so those people - that's what the argument is, is that it imposes a huge burden on these people who are legitimate voters, or probably legitimate voters, that they have to spend a lot of money and a lot of time trying to get these documents so that they can get the photo ID."

        "But this particular law is now the target of a lawsuit by the ACLU, which is challenging the constitutionality of it because it says it not only discriminates against minorities, but also the elderly and students who are also less likely to have the required ID.",

        "No, actually he found after five years of this defensive warfare that warfare has an awful momentum of its own and that, as we found in our own time, that when you go for war to make peace, very soon both sides are committing appalling atrocities that go against the principles for which they were fighting.",

        "The cities of Arabia, including Mecca, were newly born, and in fact there was a great deal of discomfort, as you describe it, between the lifestyle of the Bedouin, in which warfare was constant, and indeed the city lifestyle, where it gets in the way of business.",
        "War is no good for business.",
        "Indeed, and so the Quraish - which are Muhammad's tribe who were in control of Mecca and had become spectacularly successful in business and commerce - they gave up violence because Mecca had to be a place where all the Arabs could come and trade regardless of tribal warfare or regardless any enmity they might incur from neighboring tribes.",
        "And so Mecca was the most adventurous city in the Hijaz.",
        "But not only was there a conflict about violence, but also because of the infant capitalist economy, some people were getting richer, some tribes were getting richer, and some people were getting poorer.",
        "And the tribal ethos demanded that everybody look after all the weaker members of the tribe.",
