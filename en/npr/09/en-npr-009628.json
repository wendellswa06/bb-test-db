        "The bedrock message of the Koran is not a doctrine.",
        "The Koran is very scathing of metaphysics and orthodoxy.",
        "But it's a message that it's wrong to build up a private fortune selfishly and good to share your wealth fairly with other people and to create a just and decent society where poor and vulnerable people are treated with respect.",
        "That is the criterion of Islam.",
        "That's the message that came out from the very first of the revelations that Muhammad received from God.",

        "And let's see if we can get Bennett on the line, Bennett calling us from San Antonio, Texas.",
        "Yes, it's interesting to know about Muhammad, but the practice of Muhammadism in many countries is highly discriminatory.",
        "It's very - almost impossible in Saudi Arabia, other countries, to have churches, for clergymen to walk the street carrying crosses, or Buddhist to practice, whether it's Pakistan or Iran or formerly Iraq and whatever.",
        "Some of the more moderate countries permit it, but only not too much exhibition.",
        "And I think the practice is more important than the theory.",
        "Absolutely, Bennett, is it, from San Antonio.",
        "You're absolutely right that practice is always more important.",
        "For centuries, for generations, Muslims, the Muslim world, was far more tolerant and friendly towards other religious traditions than Christianity was in Europe.",
        "There was nothing in - until the 20th century - that resembled the Christian anti-Semitism that raged for a thousand years in Europe, one of the great shames of Christianity.",
        "So - but - and now, unfortunately, as you quite rightly say there are some countries who under the pressure of modernization and the pressure of politics have adopted a harder line.",
        "But it's meant to be listened to.",
        "The word Koran means recitation, and it's chanted and still has the power to, when listened to, to bring about a sense of peace and awe and wonder.",
        "The language was astonishing to the Arabs of that time, and many of them were converted by the sheer beauty of the Koran.",
        "Let's get a call in from David, David calling us from Sacramento, California.",
        "I would sort of question Pakistan, however.",
        "I was in Pakistan earlier this month, and I know in England Pakistan, I'd probably hear, too, is acquainted - someone said to me in Pakistan, what do you think in England when you hear the word Pakistan?",
        "And I said, trouble.",
        "You know, we usually think of it with terrorism and the Taliban.",
        "But an utterly delightful people with a lot of thriving Christian community and a very, a very different picture of Islam from the Arab countries into which I visited.",
        "Yes, there are Christian churches, but they have to operate at a low key.",
        "They cannot be too public.",
        "When American soldiers were in the Middle East, they couldn't have church service.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "As I say that there are some countries that have turned away from the old practice that prevailed for about 1500 years in Islam of being extremely supportive of - if you look at Christian Spain, for example, in Europe under Islam, there Christian and Jews were allowed full religious liberty, and there was nothing else remotely comparable to it in Europe at that time, where Jews were persecuted and where Muslims were slaughtered in Crusades."

        "Would you say that perhaps the European influence in Muslim countries turned the whole thing around in the 20th century?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think the intervention of colonialism by the - first of all, by the British and the French, the Italians, Germans, and others - has certainly affected things.",
        "Though even so, you can't make a hard and fast rule here because many of my Muslim friends who grew up in the colonial period used to - they were Muslims, but they'd go to convent schools or Jesuit schools because they were the best schools around.",
        "It's only recently, as things have halted up, perhaps more with the United States that has given Christianity a bad name.",

        "And one of the curiosities of studying a life of Muhammad, Karen Armstrong, is that you don't know very much about it until he's about 40 years old.",
        "Yes, indeed, because until that time he was a relatively obscure citizen of Mecca and nobody bothered to make a record of his life.",
        "Legends grew up, pious legends grew up - as they do around any great man about his infancy - showing that he was immediately marked with divine favor from the cradle.",
        "Even then he knew, yes.",
        "Even then.",
        "But these really have not much historical value.",
        "And our primary source for Muhammad's life are first of all the Koran, which doesn't of course tell the story of his life, but which often refers to events and problems that he was encountering in the early Muslim community.",
        "And also quite early, four Muslim historians tried to find an objective way of describing and telling the story of their prophet's life, and they weren't hagiographic.",
        "They showed the prophet sometimes in a quite critical light and were honestly attempting to find - to do history, modern history.",
        "It wouldn't - they - these wouldn't satisfy a modern historian.",
        "Of course, they're eighth, ninth century, but they do nevertheless give us more information about Muhammad than we have about the life of nearly any other founder of a major world faith."

        "And is there any way - even when you get into the historical period where people were - to separate out legend from fact?",

        "But by and large, they're pretty factual.",
        "They give us - they go into enormous detail about the circumstances that each revelation was revealed to Mohammad.",

        "The early sources show him agonizing.",
        "He'd sweat and grow pale, and even on a cold day, he would be sort of - he would sweat and be - need to be covered up or he'd shiver with the effort of trying to bring peace to his people, a religious and spiritual solution that would bring peace to war-torn Arabia.",
        "And you hear him almost listening for the Koran rather as a poet listens to the words of a poem as they gradually declare themselves to him, rising up from his subconscious to his conscious mind.",

        "That's what I got from you.",
        "But I want your comment, while I do agree with you that first 10 years that Muhammad was in Mecca, he was not involved in violence - physical violence at least.",
        "But immediately, once he immigrated to Medina, very first seven or eight months that he was there, he sent his groups - a number of people, ranging from 10 to 50 people - to raid some (unintelligible), to raid other communities and get booties and those kind of thing.",
        "And in those - one of them - I believe it was Naclar(ph), as it is written in biography of Muhammad by Alwakati(ph) or (unintelligible), that first they started killing and taking the booties.",

        "Nobody thought it was bad, because there simply were not enough resources to go round.",
        "One tribe were - it was a sort of national sport - one tribe would raid another, taking great care as far as possible not to kill anybody so as not to cause a vendetta, but taking off camels or produce or other bootie because it was a way of ensuring a rough and ready distribution of wealth.",
        "When Muhammad went to Medina, he had no means of livelihood.",
        "There was no - very little possibility for trade up there in Medina.",
        "And he was not - they were not, the Meccans, were not farmers.",
        "They didn't know anything about date farming.",
        "So he started acquisition raids against the Meccan caravans.",
        "And the first lot, the first eight or nine raids, were utterly unsuccessful because the Meccans were no good at this.",
        "They were extremely inept.",
        "And finally they got to Naclar and, as you say, unfortunately one man was killed.",
        "Now the justification Muhammad gave for this was that they had been persecuted in Mecca.",
        "Before they were forced to leave their homes, go leave their tribe - an unthinkable catastrophe in Mecca - in Arabia at this time, because they had been - the Meccans had tried to starve them out, they'd attacked their more vulnerable people, they'd expose some of them to the sun and laid stones upon them.",
        "I mean it had been a very ugly scene indeed.",
        "And there had been several attempts to assassinate Muhammad.",
        "So he was saying this is - it's bad to raid your own people, but it's also bad to persecute others and drive them from their home.",
        "Now my point is, and I mentioned this earlier, that Muhammad found that he was on a very slippery slope.",
        "Once you start doing that kind of thing and start using violence, then, as I say, warfare acquires its own ugly momentum.",
        "And the warfare then began.",
        "And on both sides atrocities were committed, and as we found that in our day when we've gone to war to make peace and look what's happened on both sides.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So - and it was at that - finally, I think after a particularly appalling atrocity, Muhammad suddenly realized something's got to cut this cycle.",
        "And that's when he initiated his non-violent policy after five years of this warfare.",
        "Among the atrocities is one that sort of rings down through history, and that is the extermination of the Qurayza tribe who were Jews.",
        "And this has obviously had resonance throughout time."
