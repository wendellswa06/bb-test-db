        "Are moderate Republicans still vowing to vote against it?",

        "You know, this is the third time leaders have announced they were going to bring this bill to the floor, and it's the third time people like me have sat here and watched the floor go into recess while the leaders frantically tallied up their votes again.",
        "It seems those first two times leaders have acquiesced to moderates by taking things out of the bill.",
        "Just this morning, Republican leaders rolled back some of their changes in the food stamp program and in eligibility for Medicaid to get more moderates to vote for it.",
        "But they've also lowered the total amount of spending the bill would cut to under $50 billion; that's down about five billion from where it was a few weeks ago, and conservatives now on the other side have warned before that they won't vote for something that's under 50 billion.",
        "So that could be part of the problem that leaders have today.",
        "Andrea, you noted that House Republican leaders have been trying to get this done for weeks now.",

        "Absolutely, Michele.",

        "But with DeLay gone, this has been a real test for the abilities of Roy Blunt, who is trying to do DeLay's old job of majority leader while also continuing his own job as majority whip; that's the vote-counter.",
        "Also, Speaker Dennis Hastert has had to try and hold together a party that is increasingly divided.",
        "So the Republican leadership is definitely weakened right now.",
        "And there are chairmen and rank-and-file members who, behind the scenes, would really like to take over some of those posts.",
        "So they have little incentive to toe the party line right now.",

        "The people who crafted the final bill also left out about $8 billion that was meant to go to prepare for an avian flu outbreak.",
        "And what made it even harder for some to vote for it was the fact that the final bill dropped more than a billion dollars in earmarks for individual projects for specific members of the House and Senate.",
