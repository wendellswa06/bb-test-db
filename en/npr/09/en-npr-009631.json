        "The police will say, we've got to go in the areas where young African-American men are committing these crimes and we have to focus on that.",
        "Community policing is something that's been invoked here for 15 years now and it has had mixed results.",
        "I think in communities where people feel that they have a good relationship with the police, they're willing to come forward and talk - it works.",
        "But in many of the cases that we have seen over the last few weeks of young people who have been getting shot, a lot of times, folks don't come forward with information with evidence because they don't trust the police to follow up on it.",
        "I think though that the general view is more intelligent, thoughtful, respectful policing is always better than less.",

        "For the first time, a state's highest court did not find a statute unconstitutional that excluded gay and lesbian couples from marriage.",
        "The hope was in that the court really didn't make a substantive decision on the issues; instead it really deferred to the legislature, and actually said it hoped the legislature would be the ultimate decider of this issue.",
        "So advocates were picking up that suggestion, and turning to the legislature.",
        "Okay, let's look at Georgia.",
        "Two years ago, 76 percent of voters approved a measure to ban gay marriage.",
        "Now that judges have kept that intact, what's the recourse there for supporters of same-sex marriage?",
        "I think that's pretty much foreclosing any opportunity to proceed in the short term in Georgia.",

        "So, the state does not allow marriage, but it does allow same-sex couples access to almost all the rights of marriage through domestic partnership.",
        "The state can't argue, like the reasoning in the New York opinion, that marriage shouldn't be provided to same-sex couples because it may harm children, because parental rights are already provided to same-sex couples through domestic partnership.",
        "In light of last week's rulings, what do you expect to happen in Massachusetts, where the highest court has legalized same-sex marriage?",
        "A constitutional amendment needs approval of 50 of the 200 legislators.",
        "We're seeing a repeat of something that was already tried by gay rights opponents to reverse a court decision in Massachusetts, and that's using a constitutional amendment process.",
        "It looks like there may be enough votes for this step Wednesday, which is step one, an approval by the legislature.",
        "That step has to be repeated again, so step two is another legislative vote in a year.",
        "And then, in 2008, this would go to the voters.",
        "I think gay rights advocates are banking on the hope that with a lot of experience by citizens in Massachusetts, with neighbors who are gay and lesbian couples and who are married, they just won't see this as an issue, kind of these fears of what will happen if we allow gays to marry will not have come true, in fact, in the state, and therefore will not support the measure openly.",
        "And so what strategies, from your perspective, would be most useful?",
        "Well, I think we see both sides picking, forum picking, going to the forum that's best for them.",
        "For opponents of gay rights, that's meant going to the legislature or going to the people largely.",

        "Well, and that is an even wider question, whether it, from your perspective, is the best strategy to continue to push for marriage rights, state by state, or would you have more chance of success pushing for civil unions or domestic partnerships?",
