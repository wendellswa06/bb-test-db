        "The Iranians are obviously being strangled by some of the sanctions that the United States and other countries have put on them, and they have detained two tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, releasing one but holding a second one hostage.",

        "What do you expect?",
        "At this point, I'd expect there to be some degree of disappointment, quite frankly, and quite possibly on both sides.",
        "The Democrats want Mueller to boldly go where he's never gone before, contradicting the summary of his investigation that we got last spring from Attorney General William Barr while also laying out the full extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election and the links some had to some Trump associates, and then describing the president's resistance to the probe itself in terms that could be called obstruction of justice.",
        "Republicans, for their part, are going to try to discredit Mueller and the rationale for investigating all of this in the first place.",
        "There will be aggressive efforts on both sides, but in the end, neither side is likely to be satisfied with the result, Scott.",

        "Because we immigrated, we were - I was raised in a one-bedroom apartment in Hartford.",
        "It was in a way a small village of Vietnamese women who raised me.",
        "And so Vietnam was preserved in this American city, the city of Mark Twain, Wallace Stevens, Harriet Beecher Stowe.",

        "Well, definitely, because at least one of them is going to be president, eventually.",

        "He was the candidate who lost to incumbent Hamid Karzai in the disputed 2009 election.",
        "He's well-known for his closeness to the Ahmad-Shah Massoud, the legendary commander who fought the Soviets and the Taliban.",
        "And that association to the Mujahidin has been a huge positive for Abdullah.",
        "Running neck-and-neck with him is a former top World Bank official, Ashraf Ghani, whose appeal to voters seems to be his experience in education and development.",
        "And the third key candidate is Zalmai Rassoul, and he's a one-time foreign minister who's seen as Karzai's chosen successor, which is turning out to be both a positive and a negative for him.",

        "For us, we don't see this as the election that will solve everything, that will bring radical change to our lives.",
        "We will see this as a way of saying no to Taliban, saying no to terrorism, saying no to wars over power.",
        "The win for me is that we have a smooth transfer of power democratically from one person to another person, and people show up to vote in all parts of Afghanistan.",
        "Watch a Wes Anderson film, and you tumble down a rabbit hole into a world that's both weird and wonderful.",

        "Most of it's when the wind speed is low.",
        "What if we tweaked the operation of the turbines so that they don't rotate as much when the wind is low?",

        "Well, and to be honest, when we started with this, we weren't sure whether the bats, like many birds, run into things, and they were running into wind turbines.",
        "And it wasn't necessarily that they were actually being hit by the blades.",
        "And as it turned out, many of them aren't actually hit by the blades, and yet they still die because they are near the turbines.",
        "Well, wait.",
        "Let's stop there and explain that.",
        "How do they die if they don't smack into the blades?",
        "Well, it turns out that the blades of wind turbines, like the wings of airplanes and the wings of bats and birds, create low-pressure areas of air around them when air flows over them.",
        "So as the blades turn, particularly near the tips of the blades, there are these...",
        "Vortex?",
        "A little vortex?",
        "There's a vortex, and that vortex has low air pressure in it.",
        "Right.",
        "And when a bat goes through that, the lower pressure is very sudden, and that means that the lung air, the air in the lungs, expands rapidly and causes damage to the lungs.",
        "Why doesn't that happen with birds?",
        "Birds have a very different respiratory system.",
        "Their lungs essentially are stronger and can withstand that sudden drop in air pressure.",
        "And so when we were looking for bats and birds underneath wind turbines, we'd frequently come across bats that looked perfectly intact, absolutely nothing wrong with them on the outside.",
        "When we looked inside, it turns out that their lung cavities were full of blood, and the little blood vessels in the lungs had been damaged.",
        "We never find birds that look like that."
