        "You state in your research paper that when you did try your scheme of turning down the speed of the blades at the time the birds were migrating, at nighttime, that the wind farm revenues went down 3,000 and 4,000 Canadian dollars per month of the study.",
        "Do you think companies are willing to lose money like that, for the bats?",
        "Well, it's obviously a cost-benefit analysis they have to go through, and that was three to $4,000 for 15 wind turbines.",
        "So it wasn't per turbine.",
        "So on a per-turbine basis, it starts to look economically not too bad.",
        "Now, obviously, the economics of wind energy is different in different localities, and it's a competitive market.",
        "They have to compete with other types of electrical generation systems.",
        "But it's an industry that depends on a green image, a low environmental impact.",
        "And obviously, companies have to assess the costs of killing bats and birds versus the costs of perhaps reducing that through this technique.",
        "Do you think that other companies could make use of these operational changes that you've done?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are similar experiments going on in the U.S.",
        "as we speak, with similar results, and it's not that a particular type of turbine or a particular location, necessarily, this is going to work better at than others.",
        "As I said, bats are small animals.",
        "They simply can't fly very well when it's really windy.",
        "They fly mostly when the wind is low, and so if you start the turbine blades turning only when the wind reaches a higher velocity, then the bats can get through the wind farms without running afoul of the turning blades.",
        "Let's go to the phones - John in Missouri.",
        "Hi, John.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Hello, nice to be on the air.",
        "Yeah, I just had the comment that a lot of detractors of wind energy always use the whole bird-bat-dying scenario to kind of say that wind power is not a viable option when they don't ever also say or compare how many birds have - or bats or fish or all the other animals that have been killed by coal-fired power plants in the form of mercury poisoning or other types of contaminants.",
        "And I work in the renewable-energy industry, and every time this bird-bat thing comes up, it just makes me roll my eyes because I think it's such a small number that it's not that big a deal, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Professor Barclay?",
        "Well, of course, it's difficult to compare the environmental impacts of different types of electrical generation.",
        "But absolutely, coal-fired generators, we have lots of them out here in Western Canada.",
        "They have different environmental impacts, and you're sort of trying to compare apples and oranges."

        "Bats will teach each other to avoid the sound.",
        "Yeah, and that was one of the first suggestions that came up, and the industry would love to have a whistle or something that people couldn't hear but bats could.",
        "Bats have very different hearing than we do.",
        "And the bat biologists around the table sort of thought about it and said, you know, we can't think of a sound we've ever produced that's scared bats away.",
        "It always seems to attract them.",
        "Really?",
        "There just don't seem to be that many sounds that bats might be afraid of.",
        "That being said, there is a group in the U.S.",
        "that's trying to produce very loud but ultrasonic - in other words, above our hearing range - sounds that might interfere with bats' echolocation abilities - basically, make it harder for them to detect the sort of echoes that they're interested in.",
        "And if that's the case, they might avoid those sort of areas.",
        "So if you could put that sort of sound generation around wind turbines, it might mean that the bats go elsewhere during their migratory flights.",

        "Well, we're - there are other ways, of course, to reduce the impact of wind farms on both bats and birds, and one of them is to try to figure out where the bats are migrating.",

        "We don't suspect that there's just this wave of them crossing the entire continent.",
