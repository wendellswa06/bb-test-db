        "But, anyway, Gustave is witty and he's profane and he's possibly a part-time gigolo.",
        "He's fastidious.",
        "He's very delicately sexually ambivalent in a way that's not specified, which I think is great.",
        "Or he might seem rather precious and vain, actually, he's revealed to have a great big and brave heart.",
        "You know, as funny as this film is, like most of your work, Wes Anderson, that there is some darkness there, in this case, because of the onset of World War II, you know, is looming.",
        "How did you sort of deal with war and Nazis at \"\"The Grand Budapest Hotel\"\"?",
        "Well, our story is some kind of pastiche, I guess, of this period and this region.",
        "You know, we have our own made-up country and our own war, which is maybe a mixture of the First and Second World Wars, and we have our own fascists.",
        "But that's really a background to the story, and what's happening isn't really about the war so much.",
        "That's just the context.",
        "This is a much more violent movie than I've ever made, and the violence doesn't necessarily have much to do with the war.",
        "But there is great brutality, and I think that's why it's there.",
        "It relates to this dark cloud that is over the continent, you know, at that point.",
        "Why did you need that dark cloud there?",
        "What role do you feel like the war played here?",
        "The story was - there are many different inspirations for it, but one of the biggest is the work of Stefan Zweig, the Austrian writer.",
        "Who fled Europe in the 1930s and was the inspiration for this film, in some ways.",
        "Yes, in many ways.",
        "And Zweig's memoir is very much about the Europe that existed before the First World War where art was the center of everything, where this very refined culture that he had joined and had participated in this evolution was so suddenly destroyed.",
        "And really, when he looks back on his life, this is the thing he describes the most forcefully.",
        "Ralph Fiennes, you starred in one of the most famous movies ever made about World War II, \"\"Schindler's List,\"\" and you played an incredibly tortuous role.",
        "When you do a movie like this and the war is sort of playing a different kind of role - it's a comic film - I mean, where is your head?",
        "Well, I think comedy can treat serious matters very effectively.",
        "I think it's difficult to pull it off, possibly.",
        "But when I saw the set, with these sort of pastiche SS banners and things, I thought it was very cleverly realized, and there's no question what Wes is saying in the film.",
        "But my head is not in \"\"Schindler's List.\"\" My head is in \"\"The Grand Budapest Hotel.\"\" There's a lightness of touch and a deftness and a sort of wonderful simplicity.",
        "When people use the word comedy, I think everyone thinks, oh, people laugh.",
        "But actually, comedy, you know, the French use the word comedie to talk about drama, and the so-called comedies of Shakespeare are full of pain and loss and disappointment.",
        "And so it's actually sort of full of ironies and ambivalences and sort of gray areas.",
        "I just want to ask you both: a lot of people will say that more than any other director, when you walk into a theater and a Wes Anderson movie starts, you can tell immediately that this is a Wes Anderson film.",
        "Ralph Fiennes, how do you define a Wes Anderson movie?"

        "Well, one reaches for words to describe something which, in the end, everyone's experience of a Wes Anderson film would be slightly different.",
        "I get the feeling, Wes, that in your films you, you know, have a huge warmth for your characters.",
        "Every one of them has sort of been loved by you into how you've created them.",
        "You know, every time I start doing one of these things, I'm thinking about everything that's different from the last one, and the new things that we want to do.",
        "Then, when the thing is done, they say, well, it's a lot like the one you did before.",
        "And I say, well, I say, I mean, but this one is in Germany - I mean, we filmed in Germany, and it's in a made-up country - I don't know how it relates to one that's on a train in India.",
        "Sometimes I'm aware I might be doing something similar to something I've done before, and the reason is because I don't like the alternatives that I can come up with.",

        "The commentary here's been interesting, though, Scott, because Australians are known to be a bit skeptical.",
        "So there's been quite a few academics and social commentators here saying that, you know, Instagram isn't necessarily only doing this because of sort of the sense of mental health and care for its users, but there's got to be some strategic or, you know, financial basis behind their decision, which I suspect might be true as well.",
        "Why would Instagram do this in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand and not the United States?",
        "I've wondered about that.",
        "The states, obviously, I would say would be one of the highest users of Instagram and potentially one of the - you know, you have so many celebrities and people who are making money from their mass followings, whereas I wonder whether Australia and New Zealand and Brazil and Japan have got markets that have a good saturation of use but not enough to totally upset the economic relationship between influencers and products that they're promoting.",
        "That's my feeling.",
        "Kumi, may I ask, you are in a position to judge the reaction of at least young Australians in your own family, aren't you?",

        "A lot of those people have treated it with a bit of humor.",
        "But the other really interesting thing I've noticed here - so there's been a kind of backlash against that influencer culture where there's been a bit of a schadenfreude thing going on that's sort of like, oh, you know, so-and-so lost 1,200 followers in the last two days because the Instagram change, but, hey, she was getting a little bit too big for her boots anyway.",
        "So I think a lot of people are quite enjoying seeing a lot of these quick-made celebrities now no longer have a follower likes sort of count on their feed.",
        "How has this new policy changed how you share things - content?",
        "It has shifted a little bit in the way I look at things.",
        "But I think when you're sharing that personal, close-family stuff which has come from a really good-hearted place, I don't think it will shift or change how people engage with that content because, essentially, you're just wanting to see families doing their thing or kids going well at the speech night (ph) or a nice book that you're reading on a holiday.",
