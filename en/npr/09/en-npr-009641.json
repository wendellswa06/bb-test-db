        "Conversely, you look at our western coal field, which is Illinois Coal Basin, it's booming.",
        "It's doing very well.",
        "It's a higher sulfur coal, but right now especially domestic use of that coal, as well as some international, are on the increase.",
        "So we're kind of - Kentucky's kind of caught between that very economic dynamic you were just discussing.",
        "And are you seeing people move from eastern Kentucky, where the mines are deeper, and the coal's a little harder to get to, better coal, but are they moving out to the west?",
        "They are in some cases.",
        "It's important to remember that a lot of folks in Appalachia are third- and fourth-generation.",
        "They don't want to leave, you know, family who are there, and that's basically where they've lived most of their lives.",
        "So there's a resistance to that movement, although in some cases economically they have to.",
        "But where coal very much is the dominant employer in that area, it doesn't just affect the coal mines, it affects all the support industries and everything from restaurants to car dealerships to really the entire community is affected.",
        "When coal declines, that community declines.",
        "And the coal in the western part of the state, as you say, higher sulfur content.",
        "Is that being burned in power plants here in this country?",
        "It is, but with a lot of the technology we have now, with scrubbers and other ways to retrofit existing coal plants, you're able to use that now.",
        "So the competitive advantage of low-sulfur eastern coal is no longer the same in the market.",
        "And that's been a real game-changer for our east and west coal fields.",
        "Even so, that coal in the western part of your state has less kick, fewer BTUs per ton, than the harder coal or indeed than the natural gas.",
        "Absolutely, but again when we had that period of time where it wasn't used as much, you have more attractive coal reserves that can be mined more easily, more cost effectively, and that allows them to compete in the marketplace in a better way, especially against very low-cost natural gas.",
        "So are you seeing competition from natural gas?",
        "How is that changing your environment there in Kentucky?",
        "We absolutely are, especially when you look at the utilities we sell primarily most of our coal to.",
        "Right now natural gas is very low in cost, about $3, and while we expect that to increase for a number of reasons.",
        "One is overseas rates for natural gas are very high, $10, $14, $18 even in some cases.",
        "We think that will go up, but the question of when that cost will increase, that will have an effect not only with the utilities but also the people that pay for electricity."

        "And when you look at a possible five billion tons consumed by China by 2030, they can't mine that much coal.",
        "So the three big questions we ask all the time are: How much coal can Kentucky mine; how can we mine it; but most importantly who will be the end user for that product?",

        "Does that east-west divide in Kentucky where there are problems in the eastern part of the state, but the western part of the state - does that mirror the rest of the United States?",
        "Yeah, no it really does.",
        "And what we're seeing in general is a decline of eastern coal's full power generation.",
        "They're still fairly strong for steel-making, but a decline of eastern coal for power generation and a rise of Illinois Basin, as the other speaker mentioned, and also in the west, Powder Riven Basin, mined mostly in Wyoming is very cheap.",
        "And it's not a coal that currently has that same upside that we're seeing in the Illinois Basin, but it is very cheap to mine, and it'll be around for a very long time.",
        "And as those trends continue, is this going to develop into more and more of an export industry?",

        "I don't know that there's a big sort of boom story there, though, but at the same time I don't really see them declining drastically.",
        "And how much of a role do federal regulations play?",
        "The EPA has already issued new regulations for new power plants.",
        "They're expected to shortly issue regulations for older power plants that could put coal in even more jeopardy.",
        "Yeah, that's right, and at IHS we're seeing a large amount of retirements, mostly to do with the mercury and air toxics rule that the EPA is bringing in mid this decade.",
        "And, you know, that predominately hits mostly Appalachian coal-burning units.",
        "So yeah, and it accentuates the decline.",
        "And Bill Bissett, when James Stevenson says retirements, he's talking about power plants switching from coal to natural gas or shutting down altogether.",
        "You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News.",
        "That's what I thought, but - docile.",
        "In many cases shutting down altogether, and we're even seeing that with some power plants located literally within our coal field, which is very concerning when you have a large utility like AP saying that it economically cannot burn coal to create electricity within our own coal field.",
        "That's a serious concern."

        "Yeah, it's difficult to come at it exactly that way.",
        "A lot of the units that are being retired are older ones that were somewhat inefficient anyway.",
        "And - but certainly the ones that are being impacted are mostly eastern units that are central Appalachian burning.",
        "And now part of that is that, you know, unfortunately central Appalachian mines are more expensive than mines in other parts of the country, and that feeds, you know, the difficult economics that they face particularly in a climate of very cheap natural gas.",
        "Particularly in a climate of very cheap natural gas.",
        "As you look at those economics, Bill Bissett, how does that eastern coal, eastern Kentucky coal, West Virginia coal, Pennsylvania, Ohio, how does it compete?",

        "I think you look at met coal, that will continue.",

        "Met coal, you mean metallurgic...",
        "Metallurgical coal used to make steel, which internationally of course is, you know, can be in great demand.",
        "It has a bit of a slump recently.",
        "But really the concern for us is I think it's at three tiers here.",
        "There's a concern for Kentucky by the economics of coal production and coal usage and what it does for us as a commonwealth.",
        "There's also kind of the national debate that's going on as the country seems to move from the administration away from coal.",
        "But internationally again we're seeing that trend of increased coal usage, and I think Dr. Stevenson's right.",
        "You know, you look at these older coal-fired facilities, they're being taken offline, but at the same time we're not really building anything new to provide the electricity that the demand is only going to increase in this country.",
        "So I think the serious concern for everybody is not only the production of energy but also the reliability of that production.",
