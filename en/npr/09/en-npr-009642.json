        "Hi, gentlemen.",
        "Hey, this is interesting.",
        "I'm traveling, actually, between two power plants right now.",
        "I work for a company that sells equipment to power plants.",
        "And my comment is this, is the power plants, from what I can tell, they're willing to invest, you know, in the better, cleaner-burning technologies like low NOx burners, scrubbers and, you know, other technologies that will make the emissions cleaner.",
        "But from what I can tell, their fear is this, is even if we do invest in these technologies, who's to say that they're not going to be shut down shortly after spending this money on these new technologies.",
        "In other words by new regulations, ever, ever more strict regulations.",
        "Yes, ever more strict regulations, thus negating, you know, the money, the millions that they spent on these newer technologies.",
        "James Stevenson, does he - is the concern well-placed?",
        "Yeah, the one area that really isn't regulated so far is carbon, and that absolutely could impact a future generation.",
        "And it's just a very, very big unknown.",
        "But really the bigger picture problem is that coal plants are also expensive to build, and when you incorporate the costs of building a coal plant that just the construction will probably take you four years and then a few years in planning versus an efficient gas unit, you know, which the actual construction only takes one year, coal has difficulty competing on that cost of capital basis.",
        "So almost regardless of whether or not carbon or, you know, some other regulation could impact new or existing units, coal units are fundamentally expensive to build.",
        "Ryan, good luck to you, drive safely, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "We're talking about changes in coal and coal country.",
        "Stay with us.",

        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "It's worth mentioning coal is not the energy source to fall victim to cheaper natural gas.",
        "So is nuclear power.",
        "An article this week in the Washington Post pointed out that five years ago, executives and politicians promised a nuclear renaissance in this country.",
        "Now several nuclear plants are being shut down.",
        "Their owners say they can't compete with natural gas.",
        "Safety, of course, is also a concern for many."

        "Also with us, James Stevenson, associate director of coal at the consulting firm HIS, where he leads coal market analysis.",
        "And this email is from Jason(ph), who reflects a lot of messages we're getting: I can't believe you're not calling people out on just how horrible coal is for the ecosystem.",
        "So what if it gives jobs?",
        "Bill Bissett, how do you answer that?",
        "Well, I think that's easy to say if you don't live in Kentucky or one of the coal-producing states or more importantly a coal-using state.",
        "And every form of electricity production has some kind of economic and environmental cost to it.",
        "And that to me is a whole issue to itself, let alone the issues of reliability and scope: How much electricity can it produce, and how consistently can it produce it?",
        "There you go.",
        "And that becomes what kind of world do we want to live in, literally?",
        "I mean, you know, electricity benefits all of our lives.",
        "We've got nearly two billion people on this planet that don't have electricity.",
        "They don't live as long as we do, and they don't have the same quality of life.",
        "So at the end of the day, yes it does have a price, but it's a price that does benefit our lives.",
        "And James Stevenson, it's also worth pointing out even shipping coal by train to West Coast ports to send it to China, that causes pollution problems, too.",
        "Those cars are open, and there's coal dust spread all around the track and into the air.",
        "I think those stories are probably a little overstated.",
        "Coal producers do, I think, a good job of spraying sealants on coal, and I think that's a story that gets a headline, but it's a bit of a beat-up over and above reality.",
        "I don't think there's that much dust pollution.",
        "So as you look, though, at the environmental impact, that is another factor in coal's ability to compete.",
        "Certainly, certainly, and, you know, we certainly see that more currently in Europe, you know, where we're seeing a carbon thrust coming in later this decade that will close the gap between coal and gas, coal being cheaper in Europe.",
        "Here in the U.S., environmental costs have really been more in the form of regulations that are driving, you know, the retirements that we talked about earlier.",
        "Here's an email question from Max(ph) in Charleston, West Virginia, and he directs it to Bill Bissett: How much of a negative impact have the EPA regulatory initiatives had on Kentucky's coal severance tax revenue?",
        "What segments of Kentucky's populace suffers the most as a result for coal severance tax revenue?",
        "You're going to have to explain to us first: What's the coal severance tax?"

        "Sure, for every ton of coal mined, a tax is placed on it when it leaves the portal, and that way, really in many ways that money is cut in half in Kentucky.",
        "There are different formulas for different states.",
        "But half that money goes back to the community where the coal was mined.",
        "playgrounds, things needed for the community.",
        "Now a lot of that money goes literally to operating costs for the county.",
        "So there's a serious concern, especially in the eastern Kentucky coal-producing counties, of how are they going to run their county and local governments without this severance tax.",
        "So Max is right.",
        "It's a very serious concern in both eastern Kentucky and West Virginia as state budgets have waned, and we've seen that in Kentucky.",
        "It really has an impact locally, but also as coal has suffered, it further chokes out the one remaining revenue stream.",

        "I know there's nuclear power plant permits being let out I believe in Georgia or Alabama, one of those big power producing areas down there.",

        "How has - you say there's idle coal cars in the yards.",
        "There have to be fluctuations in the amount of coal being shipped anyway, right?",
        "That's true, but the reduction in the number of trains passing through is more than your normal fluctuation.",
        "And I think that's - you know, it's probably got a lot to do with the price of natural gas and that type of thing and, you know, these new air pollution regulations that have been imposed.",

        "And James Stevenson, it was just, what, several, five, 10 years ago we saw a great expansion in the amount of rail capacity for specifically shipping coal.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, I think certainly the eastern railroads have taken a pretty hefty hit.",
        "Rail car loadings are down, you know, 15 percent, 15, 20 percent this year, you know.",
        "And rails are sort of in a way the forgotten loser in all of this.",
        "Obviously coal producers hurt, and coal-burning utilities hurt, but the, you know, the rail companies and the barge companies that transport the coal, trucking companies, hurt, as well.",
        "You know, I do think that, you know, with the export story and, you know, potential growth of exports out of the West Coast, certainly the Burlington Northern has a bit of upside there.",
        "But, you know, eastern railroads I think are hurting disproportionately more just as the eastern coal companies are.",
        "Bill Bissett, as the Powder River Basin ships to China, are there markets for that - those coal fields in the East?",
        "Well, and that's one of the questions we're looking at right now.",
        "As you look at - you know, you talked about the criticism of dust off coal trains.",
        "In the West, I mean, we're wondering if there is some type of blockade in Washington state and Oregon, does that create a better market for our eastern coal?",
        "And that's the kind of issues we're watching that are going to have a dynamic.",
        "But I think at the same time, that overall global demand for electricity is expected to increase greatly, and with the coal in the ground here in Kentucky, it remains our hope that in sort of a long-term planning stage, that can produce more opportunities for us.",
        "And getting back to politics just for a moment, we saw obviously it - the war on coal mantra that ran through the election last November, we're coming up on midterm elections in a couple of years.",
        "Do you see coal playing a factor in, for example, the Kentucky Senate race?",
        "Well absolutely.",
        "You have Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who's been a very stalwart friend of coal, I think, during his time frame, you know, in the Senate, who might possibly run against Ashley Judd, who, you know, is a big supporter of UK basketball but is very anti-coal in her beliefs and also kind of considered very out of step with a lot of conventional, let's say, philosophy here in Kentucky.",
        "So I think again, much like we've seen in other races, I think coal will be a big factor, especially when you consider that, you know, the president only carrying four out of 120 counties here in Kentucky.",
        "I think it's going to be a struggle, and one of the things that we look to in a second-term President Obama was kind of who he (technical difficulty) say a message to us, and with Gina McCarthy, who was sort of the right hand many people consider of Lisa Jackson, the former EPA administrator, it's a serious concern."
