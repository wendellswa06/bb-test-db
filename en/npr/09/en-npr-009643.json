        "Absolutely.",
        "But I think the key is to look at 21st century coalmining in addition to 21st century coal usage.",
        "And, you know, being from West Virginia, I know the kind of stories the gentleman was talking about from Ashland, but I think we also, you know, when you travel through Hazard or Lynch, you know, or any - Pikeville right now, it's a very different setting than it was 40 years ago.",

        "And the thing I stress to everyone, you know, granted I speak for the industry, but talk to someone who actually lives there, and the vast majority of folks will tell you, much like you heard from the gentleman with the railroads, we're hurting here, and we believe in coal is the way that we can earn a good livelihood and help the nation.",

        "And the United States has never embraced that technology.",
        "We've looked at it.",

        "So I just take my comments off the air, but I'd like to hear your comments on that.",
        "All right, John, to be fair, the cleanliness of power plants has improved a lot since 1906.",
        "But I wanted to ask you, James Stevenson, about the gasification of coal.",

        "So there's a (unintelligible) story out through the West Coast, but others domestically a declined.",
        "And then exports, you know, hopefully, making up a little bit of that decline.",

        "And then Sandy hit and cost some $200 million in damage.",
        "Would dunes have spared that Long Beach, that damage?",
        "Possibly, because several neighboring communities that did build dunes escaped the worst of Sandy's wrath.",
        "What's our next step?",
        "Do we abandon the most vulnerable barrier islands, allowing them to be shifted or swallowed up by the sea?",
