        "And where was that?",
        "This was in New York.",
        "Oh, up in New York, OK.",
        "I was not aware of that.",
        "But it's not a Corps project.",
        "It was not a Corps project.",
        "What's your opinion, Jeff Williams, about the best way to protect the beaches or the homes on them or to - what should be done for the new reality?",
        "Well, I think what needs to be done is to recognize that was has happened in the past, as far as shore protection, is not something that's necessarily going to happen in the future.",
        "A lot of the techniques of protecting the shoreline, such as beach nourishment were developed following the Ash Wednesday storm in 1962.",
        "Clearly, the next 50 years is going to be very different than the last 50 years.",
        "And I think we need to take a larger look at the shoreline, not only the New Jersey-New York shoreline but all of the shorelines and start to identify areas that are most vulnerable and then have a discussion as to what that shoreline is going to - is likely to look like in the next 50 years to 100 years and what, if anything, can we do about it.",
        "Clearly, some areas, it probably makes sense to build hard structures, if you have urban infrastructure such as New York.",
        "Other areas where recreation is important, it might make sense to do beach nourishment projects.",
        "But frankly, many areas along the coast, very low-elevation areas that are highly vulnerable, it might not make sense to rebuild in those areas because we're going to see recurrent losses from storms from the result of sea-level rise in the future.",
        "And it just doesn't make sense to keep putting federal money, state money into rebuilding those areas.",
        "And the other limiting factor on beach nourishment is we know from geologic and geophysical surveys out on the continental shelf that the quantity of really high-quality sand for beach nourishment is very limited.",
        "It's a very finite resource.",
        "And so if we want to truly have a sustainable coast, we need to recognize that we can't necessarily rely on beach nourishment for decades and decades into the future.",
        "There just isn't enough high-quality material to use for beach nourishment.",
        "We're talking about coastlines this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow talking with Jeff Williams, Robert Young and Keith Watson.",
        "Rob, you've been a vocal critic of rebuilding efforts - dumping sand on beaches, calling - or they say beach nourishment.",
        "Why are you so critical of these things?",
        "I guess I was primarily been critical of the approach.",
        "You know, I'm not saying that coastal communities don't have a right to do beach nourishment, and I'm not suggesting that we should send in the storm troopers and force folks to abandon the coast.",
        "You know, the question is how we do this.",
        "We have 3,600 miles of shoreline on the U.S.",
        "East Coast and Gulf Coast, approximately.",
        "You know, we can't afford to hold all of it in place, and we can't afford to protect all of it with federal tax dollars by doing beach fill projects and coastal engineering.",
        "We just simply can't afford to do that.",
        "And if we are going to spend federal money on some of these projects, we need a national plan for how we're going to do this.",
        "So we spend the money in the places where it makes the most sense, does the least amount of environmental damage, gives us the best chance to adapt to long-term sea-level rise.",
        "And the way we spend the money right now is we spend it in the place that got hit by the last storm, and, you know, that's reactive and not proactive, and it's the wrong way to do this."

        "And so where should we be spending it then?",
        "Well, that's a good question, and I'm, you know, I'm not sure that I can give you a definitive answer.",
        "But the Senate on Monday is probably going to authorize spending about $3.5 billion for future coastal construction projects for shoreline protection and risk reduction.",
        "And the vast majority of that money has to be spent in the North Atlantic division of the Corps, and it's mostly going to be spent probably in New Jersey and New York.",
        "Is that the best place to spend the money?",
        "I'm not sure that it is.",
        "If we're going to be spending that kind of money, we should have a national perspective.",
        "We should - there are a lot of vulnerable shorelines in the United States of America.",
        "And we need to bring the best science to the table.",

        "Let me just say that there are some beaches in my home state of North Carolina, like the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where we've been trying to hold North Carolina Highway 12 in place for a couple of decades, where I think we're wasting federal money as well.",
        "So I'm not turf guarding here.",

        "Well, Ira, back to one of the points Mr. Young was making earlier, that the North Atlantic division, and specifically the Jersey Shore, has over 30 million people living within a two-hour drive and all the economics that goes behind that.",
        "The shoreline is, you know, developed and the people are there and the society is there.",

        "And that's why we're doing our projects.",

        "Is it possible to engineer and build a beach that could resists a storm of the strength of Sandy one more time, or a few hits in the future of a few of those storms?",
        "Well, unfortunately, we just had Sandy come.",
        "And the areas that - along Long Beach Island, for instance, that had the federal project completed saw virtually no damage from the storm the size of Sandy, which along that stretch, you could argue a few of the parameters of the storm.",

        "And, you know, those areas that had the federal project saw very little damage.",
        "And...",
        "One mile down the shore, you have millions and - hundreds of millions of dollars damage on the rest of the island.",
        "Was that due because there were very strong sand dunes in there for - protective sand dunes growing for years?",
        "There's only one area that had a very large sand dunes not federally constructed on that island and - actually, two, Ship Bottom and Barnegat Light, were the two areas.",
        "Barnegat Light probably have some of the largest dunes on the Jersey Shore for any other communities.",
        "But the only other areas that did not take significant damage from the ocean were Harvey Cedars and Surf City and this area in Long Beach township known as Brant Beach where we had constructed the federal project.",
        "What was the - describe for us that project that you were talking that resisted Sandy.",
        "Sure.",
        "In those communities on Long Beach Island, they were constructed beach fills.",

        "It's based on North Atlantic - North American Vertical Datum of '88.",

        "Let me just say that the - basically, the beaches that we have, the barrier beaches that we have now, for the most part, are just several thousand years old.",
        "And there's no new sediment that's coming down the rivers or coming from the continental shelf to really feed those beaches.",
        "And so what we have are all that we're going to get.",
        "And as sea level rose, we have to remember that at the end of the last glacial period, sea level was about 400 feet lower than where it is at the present time.",
        "As the climate warmed and sea level rose naturally, a lot of that sand that was out on the continental shelf got carried landward, and that's what constructed the beaches that we have now.",
        "But as a result, the continental shelf is fairly devoid in many places - particularly along the New Jersey coast - fairly devoid of sand deposits that might be used for beach nourishment.",
        "So the - I'm sorry.",
        "There are some shoals out there that contain sand that can be used, and that's what the Corps has been using.",
        "But those shelves are very limited, and once they're dredged and that material is brought up on the beach, they don't replenish themselves.",

        "And should federal taxpayers be paying for the protection of private property along every beach in America?",

        "We know these solutions are temporary.",
        "So, you know, in order to make wiser decisions at the coast, I think we need to allow markets to play a greater role in deciding where it makes sense to rebuild and where it doesn't.",
        "And as long as federal taxpayers are absorbing all of the risks of those decisions by piling money back into these communities and by putting the beaches back and maintaining those beaches in place, then, you know, there's no disincentive of rebuilding.",
        "Why did the shoreline move?",
        "I think a point that needs to be made about that is the beaches aren't only there for the folks that are there, living there.",
        "They're also used by everyone else in the country that comes to the beaches for recreation, tourism and all the other reasons that they're there.",
        "We can have debate on where the federal dollar is to be spent, but we can have that debate on just about anything that the federal government does.",
        "The Corps of Engineers doesn't decide.",
        "We only act when we're called upon to protect the areas that it's, to our rules and regulations, is justified to do the work, from a federal investment standpoint.",
        "Yes, but those beach communities are reaping all of the economic benefits.",
        "And so, you know, in America, we believe in markets and we believe in allowing markets to play a role in setting property values and, you know, deciding where it makes sense to build an economy.",
        "And in this case, the fact that federal taxpayers continue to subsidize maintaining those beaches in front of those homes means that we are in - that's a false economy, in effect.",
        "And you're right.",
