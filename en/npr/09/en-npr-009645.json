        "And, you know, the beaches - to get back to your question, Ira, the beaches are moving because sea level is rising.",
        "And so, you know, the shoreline is naturally trying to slide landward with rising sea level.",
        "And if there was no development there, the beaches would not disappear, you know?",
        "Some shorelines like the Barrier Islands off the coast of Virginia are moving very rapidly in response to rising sea level.",
        "But the beaches don't disappear.",
        "The beaches are still there.",
        "You know, the beaches start to disappear when you have roads, seawalls or development.",
        "And then the beaches, when sea level rises and the coastline tries to retreat, the beaches themselves disappear in front of that development.",
        "And so beach nourishment projects, fill projects, are an effort to maintain those beaches in front of the investment property.",
        "And if the investment property were not there, the beaches that the rest of the Americans would like to visit would be there.",
        "It's just that the houses wouldn't be there.",

        "Is that - can be enough to nourish and rebuild all those beaches along the East Coast, Keith Watson?",
        "The amount of monies that are in the bill that's pending in Congress would be enough for us to repair the beaches that are damaged and construct the other federally authorized projects within New Jersey.",
        "I can only speak for the territory that, you know, I am in charge of.",
        "But I think also for the entire North Atlantic division.",
        "Since about the 1930s, Ira, we've spent around $1 billion total on all of the beach building projects in New Jersey.",
        "We tracked this in a database at the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines.",
        "So that's $1 billion in 2012 dollars to rebuild all of the beaches through the last several decades in New Jersey.",
        "So actually, $3.5 billion is a huge amount of money.",
        "I mean, they can rebuild every beach from Delaware to Connecticut, and there's going to be money left over.",
        "You know, I'd really to know what they're going to do with that money.",
        "And it's not spelled out in the authorization bill.",
        "All right.",
