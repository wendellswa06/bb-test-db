        "And as NPR's Joe Palca tells us, a new study sheds light on that.",
        "This is a story that starts a long time ago.",
        "It's believed life started around four billion years ago, and the first evidence of multicellularity is a little over two billion years ago.",
        "John Koschwanez is a researcher at Harvard.",
        "He's investigating how those first cells joined together.",
        "We can't take a time machine back two billion years ago to find out exactly what happened, but instead we can do a couple things in the lab.",
        "One of those things is to see if there any benefit for cells that are normally loners to gather their pals and form a clump.",
        "Koschwanez tried this with yeast.",
        "A single yeast cell has a problem.",
        "It can get energy from sugar, but it spills lot, so it doesn't make the most efficient use of the sugar around it.",
        "But if the yeast clump together into a group, instead of spilling the sugar on the floor, as it were, they're all spilling it on their neighbors.",
        "So in essence all the cells within the clump of cells are feeding each other.",
        "So Koschwanez tried growing loners and clumpers in conditions where sugar was scarce.",
        "And we compared the single cells against a group of cells.",
        "Sure enough, as Koschwanez reports in the journal Plos Biology, the clumpers beat the loners hands-down.",
        "So if in the course of evolutionary time a group of yeast cells did happen to clump together, they would probably stick around and thrive."

        "Rick Grosberg is a biologist at the University of California Davis.",
        "He says the new study shows you don't need some unique and strange event two billion years ago to encourage cells to form into groups.",
        "The conditions that really promote group formation in organisms as simple as yeast are very simple conditions.",
        "There's nothing complicated or surprising or special about them.",
        "They must have been very general conditions.",
        "Now there is multicellularity, and then there is multicellularity.",
        "Nicole King is at the University of California, Berkeley.",
        "There are simple forms of multicellularity, in which cells typically are living on their own but they can come together under certain environmental conditions.",
        "But King thinks more interesting is the kind where different cells take on different tasks within a single organism.",
        "In the case of humans, that would mean heart cells or brain cells or something specialized like that.",
        "That's the kind of multicellularity that most of us think about, and know and love.",
        "And how that happened is really complicated.",
        "In her work, King studies tiny single-celled organisms called choanoflagellates.",
        "These are organisms that have already begun to develop special bits, like a kind of tail for swimming around on a collar of tentacles to grab bacteria for dinner.",
        "Yeah.",
        "All of them are single-celled, but the exciting thing is that some of them can form little multi-celled colonies as well.",
        "Inside the colonies, individual cells can start to take on these specialized functions, like swimming or digesting.",
        "King doesn't know precisely how that happens, but she does know one thing.",
        "If you compare the genomes of these tiny single-celled creatures with the genomes of some of the first true animals, they look remarkably similar."

        "It's called molybdenum-99, or moly-99 for short.",
        "This drug has been problematic for two reasons: first, doctors have had trouble to getting a reliable supply, and second, it is made with nuclear material, material that could also be used as a weapon.",

        "It's basically a radioactive tracer that's made of material milked from moly-99, which in turn is made in a process that starts with highly enriched uranium.",
        "And it's no small irony that the very same stuff doctors use to save millions of lives a year is exactly the stuff terrorists would use for the opposite effect, if they could steal it from a processing plant.",
        "It's a sitting duck for al-Qaida, because these facilities are not guarded like military facilities, but they have bomb-grade uranium.",
        "Alan Kuperman, an expert in nuclear proliferation at the University of Texas, says the highly enriched uranium used to make moly-99 is a nuclear terrorist's dream.",
