        "And those hours are less safe statistically.",
        "They're trying to reduce nighttime crashes, they may be causing daytime crashes.",
        "Now, Osiecki says, may be causing crashes.",
        "In fact, no one knows for sure if crashes are up or down because the Department of Transportation hasn't put out accident data for the past year yet.",
        "But Osiecki says truck crashes had been going down before the rule was changed last year.",
        "The rules have also hurt industry profits.",
        "You're talking about a billion dollars in lost productivity to this industry.",
        "So the industry and its congressional allies wrote a provision into the spending bill undoing, at least temporarily, the new rules requiring truckers take off those two nights in a row.",
        "The Obama administration opposed the change, saying that driver fatigue is a leading factor in large truck crashes, which killed more than 3,500 people in 2012.",
        "And safety groups are angry, too.",
        "It stinks.",
        "That's Daphne Izer, who founded Parents Against Tired Truckers after her son and three of his friends were killed by a truck driver who had fallen asleep behind the wheel on Maine's turnpike.",
        "Drivers will be allowed to drive up to 82 hours a week, work and drive.",
        "That's insane.",
        "That's twice the normal work week.",
        "And drivers don't get paid overtime.",
        "There's going to be more death and destruction on our highways.",
        "The provision in the spending bill also calls for a detailed study of the effect of the regulations on truck crashes.",
        "The measure only rolls back the new rules until next October.",
        "Both sides expect to resume their arguments then.",

        "Well, there's this report out this week from the FBI.",

        "I see it's a hot topic on our blog, so what are folks writing about it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "According to that report, incidences of hate crimes are up by 8 percent in 2006.",
        "Now, one of our readers, Paul Murray-Smarten(ph) wrote: The increase intuitively make sense.",
        "It would go with the increasingly divisive tone of public discourse these days, if actions tend to follow words.",

        "Now, on the show last week, we also covered a poll about African-Americans and racial identity.",
        "It was released by the Pew Research Center.",
        "So how did people react to that one?",
        "Right.",
        "There was a lot of stats in that report, which was said to have found the values gap in black America divided by class, our friend Mojo Adurinde(ph) posted a comment that reads: Part of the poll seems too broad in analysis to really be conclusive, but I do agree on the part that blacks have lost confidence in leaders within the community, like the NAACP not having new and impactful ways to reach the younger generation.",
        "Another reader named Lyon(ph) didn't get what all the fuss was about.",
        "He wrote: Education and economics have always played a major role in evolving social groups.",

        "Is there any help on the Web for weary travelers?",
        "We have folks who are driving who check sites like BeatTheTraffic.com that give real-time views of traffic congestion, and sites like Google Maps and Yahoo!",
        "Maps, do that as well.",
        "People who are braving the airports should, of course, check their respective airline Web sites to check for flight delays, and the Web site flyfaa.gov can give you real-time information about backups at your local airport."

        "In an op-ed piece in The Los Angeles Times, historian Naomi Oreskes objects.",
        "She argues that most of the skeptics are shills, scientists are, in fact, the jury, and that their verdict has long since been handed down.",

        "Automatic blowout preventers, which were not required in 1969, would kick in and shut the well off.",
