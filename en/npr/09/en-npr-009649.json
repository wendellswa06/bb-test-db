        "The problem is when a normal give and take of scientific debate is misrepresented to make it seem different than it really is.",
        "So in the scientific community today - and not just today, but actually for the last 10 years at least if not longer - there has been a general consensus that climate change was underway.",
        "And we're talking about climate change caused by things that people do.",
        "Not the normal ups and downs of weather and natural variability, but a different new phenomenon caused by greenhouse gases and deforestation.",

        "What did you mean by that?",
        "Well, right.",
        "And I was, of course, being a little deliberately provocative, but the point I was trying to make was drawing on an analogy with the jury.",
        "This was a great experience because we had a wonderful judge, and one of the things she said to us at the very beginning - and I wrote about this in the op-ed piece - she asked us at the very beginning during jury selection: If I sent you out right now and then asked you to come back - and this is before we turn any evidence and before the jury had even been impaneled - if I asked you, do you think these people, the defendants, are guilty, not guilty or you don't know enough to know.",
        "And the vast majority of people in the room raised their hands for we don't know enough to know.",
        "And the judge said: That's the wrong answer, that in this case, open-mindedness is not the correct answer because the law establishes a presumption of innocence.",
        "The law tells us that those defendants are innocent, presumed innocent until the prosecution has proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "And it was a kind of eureka moment for me because I thought, oh, of course, the judge is completely correct here.",
        "We think of open-mindedness as a virtue.",
        "And in many walks of life it is a virtue, but there are some situations when the situation calls for something else.",
        "In the courtroom, it calls for us to assume that the defendants are innocent until the state makes its case against them.",
        "So then I thought about, well, what about in the case of science?",
        "Well, science is a little different.",
        "It's not exactly the same as a courtroom.",
        "Innocence and guilt don't really make much sense when we're talking about science in the natural world.",
        "So then the question becomes, well, who is making this judgment?",
        "And so the argument I was trying to point out is that, as ordinary citizens, many of us feel, well, we don't know what to think.",
        "You know, we've heard a lot of conflicting things about climate change so - and I've heard many people say to me, I'm open-minded about it."

        "And so the argument I was trying to make was to say, well, in this case, being open-minded - although it might sound good at first and may sound good in principle - it actually doesn't make sense when you have now more than half a century of accumulated scientific data put together by thousands of different scientists all around the world, men and women, black and white, Republicans, Democrats, you know, all, you know, very diverse scientific community, over half a century of work.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, this is the subject of a book which I published last year with my co-author Erik Conway called \"\"Merchants of Doubt.\"\" And in the book, we asked exactly that question.",
        "We said, well, if there's so much scientific evidence, why do so many of us have the impression of a raging scientific debate?",
        "And so we've spent five years researching this question.",
        "And, you know, it's funny for me because it's funny for me to even be having to have this conversation, because I first published on the scientific consensus on climate change back in 2003.",
        "So I've now been working on the consensus piece for almost a decade.",
        "But for the last five years, Erik Conway and I have been working on this question why so many of us think there's a raging debate.",
        "And what we showed in the book is that there have been systematic efforts organized by people outside the scientific community to undermine the scientific data and to convince all of us that the jury - scientific jury was still out in order to delay government, business and community action on taking steps to prevent further manmade climate change.",

        "In fact, one of the sort of remarkable things about our book was that we were able to show how much of this activity took place in open air, in plain sight.",
        "A lot of the research we did wasn't actually that difficult to do.",
        "Many of the documents we found were in the public record.",
        "So it's not a conspiracy in the sense of, you know, creepy, evil people in backrooms doing terrible things.",
        "No. It's actually out in the open, which in some ways makes it more shocking and in a way more alarming that the media haven't done more to talk about the events that have actually taken place in the last five years to convince the American people that there was a debate, you know, an argument that really flew in their face of a huge amount of evidence.",
        "There is a - your case is not bolstered when stories come out.",
        "This publication of emails by scientists in England who seem to be, though not fabricating data, suppressing publication of data that seem to fly in the face of their conclusions.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "And, of course, this is where the media has played a huge role because that is exactly how the story was told in the media, you know, a year or so ago.",
        "But what we know now from many different investigations that have taken place, including the House of Lords in Britain, is that those emails were completely taken out of context, very much misrepresented.",
        "And what was the real give and take of scientific debate and also the real frustration that scientists feel at the misrepresentation of their work was taken massively out of context.",
        "And, you know, you mentioned that this took place in England.",
        "Earlier in your show, you mentioned that Meryl Streep has - had her 17th Oscar nomination for portraying Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.",
        "And I thought, you know, that's a great thing to remind people about because Margaret Thatcher was one of the first political leaders to understand the threat of the human-caused climate change."
