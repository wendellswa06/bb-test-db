        "Can Cleveland do it?",
        "You know, if you didn't know that much about basketball or the NBA, but you just knew maybe one thing about the Cavaliers, you'd say, well, I guess it all depends on LeBron James.",
        "And here I am to say it pretty much depends on LeBron James.",

        "He leads both teams in points, assists, steals, blocks and is tied with his teammate Tristan Thompson in rebounds.",
        "...But I think it would, in addition to providing better information to the American public, also help to deter bad conduct from happening in the first instance.",
        "The difference Steph having a great game and Steph having a game that he has been having, which sometimes is only good - that could be the difference in this series.",
        "OK.",
        "Side question, perhaps, but I don't understand how the team with the biggest star in basketball, the Cavs, came to be the underdog in this contest.",
        "This is crazy.",
        "I think we, of course, take LeBron James for granted.",
        "That's why I didn't get an MVP vote.",
        "But I should also say he's playing better in this series than maybe we've ever seen him play and pretty much better than we've seen anyone play, Jordan-esque (ph).",
        "I mean, he's put back to back 40-point games.",
        "And when he has his - such complete game, but when his jump shot is dropping - and I don't know why it does - the basketball gods either bless him or don't.",
        "When his jump shot is dropping, he is unstoppable."

        "And all he would do is score whatever he wanted to.",
        "Or when the entire team collapsed around him, he'd lob it to Tristan Thompson who would get a dunk.",
