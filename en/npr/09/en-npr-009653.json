        "So these are the taste buds?",
        "These are taste cells right in the taste buds.",
        "So the taste bud contains about 50 or 100 taste cells, and maybe a quarter of them are responding to sweet stuff, and a different percentage of them will respond to salty and sour and bitter and something called umami, which is actually a Japanese word that has to do with delicious amino acids like monosodium glutamate.",
        "Okay, and so this chemical interaction or biochemical interaction between the protein that makes the receptor on the surface of the taste bud, that's a chemical event.",
        "But something happens in the brain that makes this turn into a perception of an event or a sweetness event.",
        "Correct.",
        "So you can think of the sweet receptor protein and the sugar or sweetener as kind of a lock and key, and when they encounter each other, it opens the lock.",
        "The door opens up.",
        "It excites the sweet taste cell, and that sends a signal to the brain, to particular centers of the central nervous system that respond to sweet."
