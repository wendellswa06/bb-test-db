        "They have to sort of get Americans not to listen to him, have doubts about him, and they've turned very nasty.",
        "And to me, it's not the McCain that people had liked in the past.",
        "And so…",

        "Or do they see some sort of perceived vulnerability that they want to exploit?",
        "Well, I think they're going past what Bush did in 2004 to John Kerry.",

        "What strikes me over the past week is how quickly the campaign has come to its core issues.",
        "The core McCain argument is that this guy, my opponent, has no achievements in his record and no really experience in how to make change.",
        "The core Obama argument is that McCain is a heroic guy, but he has no new ideas for the future.",
        "And everything we've seen in the last week, and maybe probably for the next few months, are really derivations of those core arguments.",

        "Well, from a military point of view, I think the general and the ambassador have done that, and I think most analysts and those of us who've been to Iraq in August saw that in some places in Iraq it's safer because our military people and Iraqis who were fed up with terrorists have gotten together and are beginning to run terrorists out of neighborhoods.",
        "So would you say that this changes your opinion of the war or of funding for the war in any way?",
        "Well, not a funding for the war, because I've consistently voted to fund the men and women who are fighting there.",
        "But the one change is this, three words - province by province.",
        "I think what we've learned over the last several months, especially since General Petraeus has been there, is that changes in Iraq on a military basis and maybe even on a political basis are going to happen province-by-province, neighborhood-by-neighborhood.",

        "I saw three weeks ago some neighborhoods outside Baghdad where there was that kind of progress.",

        "But it looks to me now like that's more likely to happen province-by-province than in all of Iraq at once.",
        "Right.",
        "And if you listen to what General Petraeus was saying over these last two days, he's saying to focus only on training and advising would be premature.",
        "He keeps talking about population security, and that means combat.",
        "That does mean combat.",
        "It's tantalizing.",
        "I liked what General Petraeus had to say.",
        "He's in the right direction with troops coming out instead of going in.",
        "And he's - he talks more clearly about a strategy than the White House has, frankly.",
        "He talks about a change of mission, a long-term defined presence in stepping up diplomatic efforts, but he seems to walk right up to the water but not jump in.",
        "I mean, it's almost Baker-Hamilton province by province on a Petraeus timetable."

        "I believe there is more pressure for a consensus and, as I've said, I believe the Baker-Hamilton recommendations, which General Petraeus comes close to embracing, are the best basis around which to have that consensus.",

        "Denys Johnson-Davies, who according to the late Edward Said is the leading Arabic-English translator of our time, has set out to remedy that situation.",
        "In his 500-page paperback original, he gives us a cross section of stories and scenes from novels by some of the most talented fiction writers in the language.",
        "This sounds like a daunting task.",
        "But if you consider that the tradition of modern Arabic fiction writing is only a little more than 100 years old, you realize that it's certainly possible to have worked for the writers who need to know between the covers of one book."

        "So we're finding that, at least, the sense of sweet taste has a lot in common with these endocrine or hormone-producing cells elsewhere in the body.",
        "Wow.",
        "So if you injected a sugar substance into the pancreas, you wouldn't perceive the sense of having something sweet in your body, would you?",
        "It would be your pancreas would do something, or something would happen, but you wouldn't feel like you just had a sweet meal, or something.",
        "Right.",
        "That's not something that we're generally consciously aware of, although you can actually train mice and rats to tell if they've gotten something sweet in their stomach or in their small intestine.",
        "So you can bypass their taste buds in the oral cavity and directly put sugar into the stomach or small intestine, and those animals can be trained to know that that's something good and something positive, and they will seek more of that stimulus.",

        "Interesting.",
        "Okay, two very good questions.",
        "Let me start with the second one, about taste bud repair and taste bud turnover.",
        "The taste cells in the bud, they turn over pretty quickly.",
        "Their lifespan is about a week, maybe as long as 10 days.",
        "So you have new taste cells being developed from precursor stem cells.",
        "They mature, and they differentiate into the salt responders, the sour responders, the sweet responders.",
        "And then after a week or 10 days, they will die, and they'll turn over, and they'll be replaced.",
        "And this is one of those things, again, where the taste cells in the oral cavity do have some similarities to taste-like cells in the gut, which also will turn over in a few days, in a small number of days, up to a week or so.",
        "Now, the first question, about the interaction of salt and sour and how that might be sweet, it's complicated.",
        "And on the one hand, some of this relates to our current work in this recent paper, in the Proceedings of the National Academy, where we have found a sugar transporter that likes to transport into the sweet taste cell, sugar, at the same time that it transports the sodium ion part of salt.",
        "So we speculate - we don't know for sure, but we speculate - that if there's a little bit of salt around, that can make the sweet taste of sugar all that much sweeter.",
        "And in fact, if you take a very dilute solution of sodium chloride, table salt, so dilute that it doesn't taste salty, it actually tastes sweet."
