        "And we're not 100 percent sure of how that works, but it could be stimulating the sweet taste proteins, or it could be stimulating this ion channel that we've found that's called STLT-1, sodium glucose co-transporter.",
        "Now, the final point about the salt-sour interaction is this is something that psychophysicists, people that study the psychology and the perception of taste talk about as mixture suppression.",
        "So the salt detection mechanism and the sour detection mechanism are almost like they're talking at cross-purposes.",
        "Or the salt will block the sour channel, or the sour will block the salt channel.",
        "So a certain amount of salt alone, or a certain amount of sour alone, will have a certain saltiness and sourness, but if you mix them together, it decreases both the saltiness and the sourness.",
        "And cooks know this, and people that like their salted margaritas know this, too.",

        "Hi.",
        "Last year, I heard a talk at the Cornell Plantations from a person who wrote a book called \"\"The Fruit Hunters,\"\" and he talked about the miracle fruit, which is this interesting fruit where if you eat something sour first, like let's say you suck on a lime, and then you eat a little miracle fruit, what happens is your mouth fills with this incredible sweetness, and the sour taste of the lime just disappears.",
        "And he talked about how this was a way to get a taste of sweetness without any kind of sugar.",
        "Did you try it, Esther?",
        "I haven't tried it yet.",
        "Oh, you should definitely...",
        "I've been wanting to...",
        "So that's fun to do.",
        "I've done that.",
        "And one time, I took the miracle fruit component - and it's called miraculin - and mixed it in with unflavored, sour yoghurt, and it tastes wonderfully sweet.",
        "So we have a pretty good idea of what's going on there."

        "Miraculin is a protein, and you find it in the miracle fruit.",
        "And there a number of other related proteins that can be found in special plants and berries, oftentimes in Africa.",
        "So in addition to miraculin, you have things called thaumatin, brazzein, monelin.",
        "Now, those other proteins, they're intensely sweet on their own.",
        "They don't need acid or sour stimuli, and we know how they work.",
        "They will bind tightly to the sweet receptor protein.",
        "This is, again, this lock-and-key type of model.",
        "Now, miraculin is a little bit special.",
        "It probably doesn't normally bind to the sweet receptor protein - or, at least, it doesn't bind in a way that will open up the lock.",
        "But at low pH, under acid conditions, either the miraculin adopts a particular conformation or the sweet receptor does, so that it's now perceived as sweet.",
        "So it's not that miraculin is working on the sour channel, the sour taste cells or the sour responding taste nerves, it's tricking the sweet taste cells and the sweet-responding taste nerves to say there's something sweet out there.",
        "Very strange experience.",
        "And it really - I've tried it, and you taste a piece of lemon, and it's like you're eating a sugar candy.",
        "And it's with lemon before - for sure, lemon, because you can test yourself beforehand.",
        "Very odd.",
        "Other animals - I mean, do we all have sweet tooths?",
        "Are there some people who are born without the ability to taste sweetness, or animals that are born without that ability?",
        "Well, that's a very interesting question, and, to my knowledge, all people can taste sweet, although there are wide ranges in the preference for sweet.",
        "But certainly, not all animals can taste sweet, and one prime example is the cat, the domestic cat.",
        "Other scientists at Monell - Joe Brand and Gary Beauchamp and Peihua Jiang -have looked at the sweet receptor protein gene in the cat, and they found that it is a pseudogene.",
        "That means it's a non-functional, mutated gene.",
        "So the cat cannot make the functional sweet taste receptor protein and can't respond to sweet.",
        "Now, a related protein is for this umami amino acid protein glutamate taste, and cats have a very good umami receptor.",
        "And, in fact, they probably devoted what humans would respond to sweet more towards umami amino acids and proteins.",
        "They don't need to worry so much about leaving your chocolate cake out if the cat's around, as much as you do with the dog around."
