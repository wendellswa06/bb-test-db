        "OK.",
        "We should be clear the commission is considering just a small step.",
        "It's a step that would target one type of online political ad that it calls express advocacy.",
        "This is an ad that doesn't just address an issue, it directly endorses a candidate.",
        "What we know about from the last election, a lot of ads were placed that were what are generally termed issue ads, ads that are designed to inflame people's passions but stop short of saying, and therefore you should vote for or against a particular candidate.",
        "I think that there is more that could be done to address those ads and to ensure that those ads are not being funded by foreign money, but that's not what we're doing.",
        "Let's say someone writes an opinion piece about an issue but stops short of calling for a certain candidate to win.",
        "The person pays Facebook to target that to a certain audience.",
        "That would stop short of being express advocacy because it's not calling for one candidate to win over the other.",
        "We would look at the ad itself and look to whether it is express advocacy in order to determine whether this particular rule that I am hoping we're going to be able to get passed will apply.",
        "A specific ad keeps coming to my mind because it's infamous.",
        "There was this ad that was linked to the Internet Research Agency backed by the Kremlin in Russia.",
        "It has this image of Satan and Jesus...",
        "I knew you were going to bring that one in.",
        "...Arm wrestling.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A lot of people talk about this one.",
        "There's text that has Satan saying, if I win, Clinton wins.",
        "And then you have Jesus saying, not if I can help it.",
        "If you're talking not specifically about Clinton versus Trump, but about Satan versus Jesus, I mean, is that express advocacy?",
        "Where does that fall?",
        "You know, that has not been specifically presented to the commission, but I bet if it were that we would have a disagreement about that.",
        "Personally, I would say that's express advocacy.",
        "I don't think there's really any confusion about what the designer of that ad was trying to accomplish."

        "What would the argument against that be?",
        "That it doesn't specifically say vote for or vote against, and it does not specifically reference the election.",
        "So how much do you think this rulemaking will prevent foreign influence in the upcoming election, 2018, looking forward to 2020?",
        "Is this going to make a big difference?",
        "It's a small step forward, but it's a positive step forward.",
        "And I think that what has happened is that, really, the awareness of the platforms has also been raised.",
        "So whether there is an ultimate fine levied on anybody who doesn't run a disclaimer, I think the platforms are paying a lot of attention to this issue and that they are going to make sure that the ads that are run on their platforms comply with our rules.",
        "Is there a risk in going too far if the government and government commissions try and regulate what is supposed to be, you know, a free and open marketplace, which is the Internet?",
        "Well, certainly not from this rulemaking.",
        "Right now, all that we are looking at is making sure that when you see an ad, whether it's on your phone or on your desktop or your laptop or your tablet, that you will have some way of identifying where that ad is coming from if it is one that is trying to persuade you to vote for or against a candidate.",
        "I think that the agency has come together because we recognize that this is not an issue that can be ignored.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Let me put the hard central question first.",
        "Based on your experience, could the Syrian regime just be using talks as a tactic to buy time and continue to crush the resistance?",
        "Well, there's a serious chance it will, given its past practices.",
        "Right now, it feels vindicated.",

        "It feels that society is polarized, that the opposition is fragmenting.",

        "A few weeks ago, the objective (unintelligible) was regime change.",
        "Today, it seems to be a plea for a cease-fire, some monitoring presence on the ground and an ill-defined political dialogue to support the reform process.",
        "So, the regime does see this, I think, very much as a diplomatic gimmick for the time being; something that doesn't threaten its existence at core and which, in fact, may provide some resources, as you said, in terms of playing for time.",
        "Well, let me put it this way: is the U.N.",
        "being played for fools?",
        "Well, I don't think so.",
        "I think it's an experienced team and they know the risks, but it's going to be a very difficult mind game, not least because of the levels of violence on the ground.",
        "So, I think that there is a temptation among Syrian dissidents abroad, some Arab players, to pull the plug on this mission, to use it simply to demonstrate that the regime is acting in (unintelligible) and then move on to more forceful options, and in particular a build up towards a military intervention.",
        "There is this idea that the only way to deal with this regime is militarily.",
        "So, that's very true of some strands of the Syrian opposition.",
        "It's very true of some Arab states, like Qatar and Saudi Arabia.",
        "And they see this mission as a distraction.",
        "They would like to get it out of the way, go back to more serious propositions.",
        "It sounds like you think this is an experienced team who knows exactly what they're getting into.",
        "Well, they've got considerable experience in other contexts around the world, but there is little expertise available on Syria when it comes to the power structure or Syrian society.",
        "And creating a configuration in which this process becomes extremely difficult to maintain, but all parties involved will make that effort because there is no clear alternative on the table at this stage.",

        "Taco, T-A-C-O, jacket.",
        "The tragic reality that people have been dying for nearly 15 months now.",

        "If this was an easy case, the international community by now would have come up with a workable solution.",
        "The problem is that this regime has a number of important allies - Hezbollah and Iran in particular.",
        "Syria sits in a very volatile and sensitive part of the world.",
        "So, there is this belief that moving in militarily to bring this to an end would in fact precipitate a civil war within Syria that could produce far more kills than what we've seen until now."
