        "And that disconnect between theory and actual human behavior, you argue is one of the reasons economists are held in such low regard.",
        "I think we are right lots of the time, we offer good arguments, but there are so many occasions when our models seem, just to the average person, transparently unrealistic.",
        "And when we're wrong on those occasions, I think we really squander our credibility.",
        "Robert Frank teaches economics at Cornell and we also want to hear from you today.",
        "Are there examples in your life that defy economic theory and make you skeptical of economists?",

        "He is the author most recently of \"\"The Economic Naturalist's Field Guide: Common Sense Principles for Troubled Times.\"\" And Robert Frank, you write in your book that when searching for examples that contradict the predictions of standard economic models, a good rule of thumb is to start in France.",
        "It works for me.",
        "I spent a sabbatical in France earlier in this decade, and one of the experiences I'll never forget was a transaction I had with a local wine merchant.",
        "It was almost Thanksgiving and I was shopping for some champagne, we had friends coming over and so he proudly told me about a bottle that was from a good producer on sale for only 18 euros.",
        "It had been normally priced at 24 euros.",
        "He was sure I would like it, so I was all set to buy.",
        "And then I asked him, could he recommend a bottle of cassis.",
        "I knew some of our friends would want a Kir Royale, a cherry liqueur mixed with champagne.",
        "He said oh, well, in that case, you won't need any good champagne.",
        "Once you mix cassis in with it, nobody will know the difference whether it's high quality or not.",
        "Oh.",
        "In that case, what would you recommend?",
        "I asked him.",
        "And he said he had just the one to bring out, and he brought one out that was not on sale, it was selling for 20 euros and he recommended it.",
        "So my choice then was between buying the premium one, on sale for 18 euros and the lesser one for 20 euros.",
        "I looked at him, I said, I thought I knew the answer to the question but I asked him would the Kir Royal taste worse if we made it with a premium champagne.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "The good champagne.",
        "And he seemed dumbfounded that here is this barbarian American asking such a question.",
        "He says, well, no, of course not, and so I ordered the good champagne and I could just tell he was rolling his eyes as I left the store, as here is another guy who just doesn't get it.",
        "You're not supposed to waste the good champagne on the stuff with cassis in it.",
        "So, the aesthetics of the French wine merchant overruled, in this case, the Homo Economis.",
        "That's right.",
        "The economic model predicts clearly you will go with the cheaper one and that's what I did.",
        "But their system makes a certain amount of sense if you are looking to make the best use of the champagne overall; it'll be put to better uses if you follow their system."

        "Yeah, but efficiency.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think from my perspective, it was a clear choice.",
        "The nice thing is, sometimes individual interest is in conflict with group interest; that was an example.",

        "Tom Schelling, the Nobel Laureate in 2005, said if helmets are so great, why don't you just wear them.",
        "And he thought it through and reasoned that well, if it's individually advantageous to take them off for the reasons you suggest, then of course individual players will do it.",
        "Then the other side is going to match, they don't want to fall behind.",
        "So you've got an equilibrium where everybody is skating without a helmet.",
        "That's not good.",

        "Oh, good morning.",
        "Or good afternoon.",
        "I just wanted to put forward a idea that a lot of rural people, in rural America, farmers, traditionally allow people to come onto their land and hunt without cost.",
        "And in recent times, there has been some movement towards charging people to hunt on private lands.",
        "And the area where we live, that's - that really goes against the grain.",
        "And my wife who is not from the area, we own a small farm of about 350 acres, she says why do you let these people hunt on the land for free when you could be charging somebody to come out and deer hunt or whatever the case might be?",
        "And I simply tell her that I couldn't stand the embarrassment of facing my neighbors with them knowing that I'd actually charged people to hunt on our land.",
        "So I think that there's concepts beyond just economics, social relations between individuals and in communities that rational actions are not always going to be what would be considered to be rational by an economist.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a great example and I think it's really an example of the favor bank and how it works in areas where people know one another well.",

        "What we simply do is when the neighbors ask if they want to hunt or if we want to hunt, we just stipulate, well yes, but if you can, shoot a doe besides shooting a buck and shoot one, and shoot many until your tags, but the idea of having - of charging somebody to do it just kind of goes against, just totally against the way you are raised and how you treat your neighbors and how you view and utilize your land.",

        "There are plenty of examples where one vote has tipped the balance, but if you're talking about a presidential election in the United States, there the electoral votes are awarded on a statewide, winner-take-all basis in most cases, and there's never, ever been a case where a state has been decided by one vote.",

        "It was as close as could be, but not one vote.",
        "So if anybody had stayed home that day, the outcome would have been the same.",
        "That leads economists to predict that since your vote won't be decisive, and since it's costly to go to the polls, then people won't bother, and again, half of them do stay home.",
        "So the prediction isn't completely full of hot air, but half of them do vote.",
        "And we don't have an explanation for that other than to say we encourage people to do their citizen's duty.",
