        "Is this a prestige thing, do you think, that expensive coaches are better than cheap ones?",
        "I think maybe that's the - I think maybe that's what they're thinking, but it's never made much sense to me because, you know, coaches, we're - all of us professional coaches are credentialed, and there are coaches that have - that aren't as high - don't have as high a license as I do who if they charge more, sometimes they seem to get more business.",

        "What is an economic naturalist?",
        "Well, this is a play on the title of my most recent book, which appeared - you and I discussed it, in fact, in 2007, called \"\"The Economic Naturalist.\"\" It was just a collection of examples in which we use economic principles, very simple economic ideas, to try and answer some interesting questions based on personal observation and experience.",

        "Yeah, it sounds like they considered the trade.",
