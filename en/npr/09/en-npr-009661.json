        "For kids, how much do you have to spend so their party will seem special to them?",
        "That's a relative concept.",
        "You know, you have to spend as much as people like you spend, or else you risk being seen as somebody who doesn't appreciate that it's a special occasion.",
        "So I think there's oftentimes an escalation of spending to really no point.",
        "It's as if everybody stood to see better.",
        "No one sees better than if everybody had remained seated.",
        "That's a good example, really, of Charles Darwin's insight that competition works at the individual level, primarily, not at the group level.",

        "My husband is a professor of economics at Stanford, and I spend a good deal of time debunking his theories.",

        "One of his long-held views is that more information is always better, so he does not understand why some people choose to wait to find out the sex of their baby until it's born.",
        "This drives him nuts.",
        "He argues there is zero economic benefit to waiting, that someone will have equal surprise either at five months or at nine months, and that given all the things that need to be purchased for a newborn, waiting to find out is just mind-bogglingly silly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's often puzzling that people seem not to want the information.",
        "Huntington's disease - Woody Guthrie died of it.",
        "Arlo Guthrie didn't know whether he was carrying it.",
        "There's a test, actually, that reveals whether you are carrying it.",
        "You can take that test early in life, and you'll know whether or not in middle age you're going to get this dread disease.",
        "Most people don't want to take the test.",
        "And what's especially puzzling there is that the people who do take it seem happier whether they learn that the result is positive or negative.",
        "Even if they learn they're going to get the disease, that seems somehow comforting.",
        "They can organize and plan accordingly.",
        "So I understand Jenny's husband's prejudice in favor of wanting to have more information.",
        "There's some evidence that it helps, but not in all cases.",
        "There are times when knowing is just going to be a big distraction.",
        "And so I think if you imagine that the brain isn't a perfectly rational calculating machine, that it's just really a bunch of protoplasm and it's got constraints and it doesn't work perfectly, some information's better kept out of there.",
        "And if there was one thing that you thought economists could do to restore their credibility with the general public, assuming they ever had any, what would it be?"

        "The young economists seem to know that.",
        "Are people perfectly rational?",
        "The young economists are quite willing to admit the possibility that people use rules of thumb to make decisions, that they don't always get it right, that there are systematic errors the way they frame specific decisions that they make.",
        "So there's been real progress.",
        "I think the old saying goes, in science you make progress with every funeral.",

        "Also, like with energy drinks, you know, they'll pay two and a quarter for an energy drink of basically the same buy yield.",
        "And so we've been having a hard time understanding that strategy.",
        "In 30 seconds, Robert Frank, can you explain his problem?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think when you're putting cash into a machine, you know, it's a lot easier if it's a dollar than if it's a dollar and a quarter.",
        "If you're at a convenience store, you just put whatever bill you happen to have on the counter and you get the change you need.",
        "So I think people are more habit-bound when they're dealing with machines.",

        "Yeah, but efficiency.",

        "They'll vote unanimously in a secret ballot for a rule requiring helmets.",
        "That was always the mystery.",
        "Tom Schelling, the Nobel Laureate in 2005, said if helmets are so great, why don't you just wear them.",
        "And he thought it through and reasoned that well, if it's individually advantageous to take them off for the reasons you suggest, then of course individual players will do it.",
        "Then the other side is going to match, they don't want to fall behind.",
        "So you've got an equilibrium where everybody is skating without a helmet.",
        "That's not good.",
        "Nobody has a competitive advantage and so it's easy to see why each side would favor a rule requiring helmets.",
        "You can't just put a notice in the locker room saying you might get hurt if you don't wear one.",

        "I just wanted to put forward a idea that a lot of rural people, in rural America, farmers, traditionally allow people to come onto their land and hunt without cost.",
        "And in recent times, there has been some movement towards charging people to hunt on private lands.",
        "And the area where we live, that's - that really goes against the grain.",
        "And my wife who is not from the area, we own a small farm of about 350 acres, she says why do you let these people hunt on the land for free when you could be charging somebody to come out and deer hunt or whatever the case might be?",
        "And I simply tell her that I couldn't stand the embarrassment of facing my neighbors with them knowing that I'd actually charged people to hunt on our land.",
        "So I think that there's concepts beyond just economics, social relations between individuals and in communities that rational actions are not always going to be what would be considered to be rational by an economist.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a great example and I think it's really an example of the favor bank and how it works in areas where people know one another well.",

        "Bob, let me ask you a question, though.",
        "If there are deer on your property, presumably it's a good thing.",
        "You'd prefer that somebody hunt them in season rather than they eat your crops.",
        "So, having them come on for free might be an economic advantage.",
        "Well, but you would get more hunters if you were advertising to bring people on because what we're at, it's trophy buck, whitetail country and you could get a lot of money for having people come on and hunt deer.",
        "What we simply do is when the neighbors ask if they want to hunt or if we want to hunt, we just stipulate, well yes, but if you can, shoot a doe besides shooting a buck and shoot one, and shoot many until your tags, but the idea of having - of charging somebody to do it just kind of goes against, just totally against the way you are raised and how you treat your neighbors and how you view and utilize your land."

        "There are plenty of examples where one vote has tipped the balance, but if you're talking about a presidential election in the United States, there the electoral votes are awarded on a statewide, winner-take-all basis in most cases, and there's never, ever been a case where a state has been decided by one vote.",

        "It was as close as could be, but not one vote.",
        "So if anybody had stayed home that day, the outcome would have been the same.",
        "That leads economists to predict that since your vote won't be decisive, and since it's costly to go to the polls, then people won't bother, and again, half of them do stay home.",
        "So the prediction isn't completely full of hot air, but half of them do vote.",
