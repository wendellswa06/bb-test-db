        "There is.",
        "I think we'll look back 100 years from now and reject the idea that Adam Smith really laid the groundwork for modern economics.",
        "That's the conventional view now.",
        "I think when we look back 100 years from now, we'll recognize that it was really Charles Darwin who laid the foundations for our discipline.",
        "He had a very much more subtle view of competition than Adam Smith's modern disciples do.",
        "I think the idea of the invisible hand was a good idea, you know, the idea that producers compete with one another to expand their market share and that consumers ultimately benefit from that when they cut their prices and come up with cost-saving innovations in the process.",
        "That's true.",
        "It happens often, but Smith was under no illusions that you always turn selfish people loose, you get good outcomes.",
        "It was really Darwin who saw clearly that the evolutionary forces really operate on the individual's interest, not on the group's interest.",
        "And often they coincide, but often they don't.",
        "And we'll talk about how that can lead to some economic messes when we come back from a short break.",

        "Just before the break, he was telling us that Adam Smith's invisible hand, normally given credit for the foundation of modern economics - he plumped instead for Charles Darwin's natural selection.",
        "But Robert Frank, you've also written: Human brains forged by natural selection do not work as assumed in economic textbooks.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think the standard economic model assumes, against all available evidence, that people get satisfaction based primarily, or even only, on the absolute amount of stuff they consume.",
        "That does matter, to be sure, but I think what's equally important in many contexts, even much more important, is how much you consumer relative to the frame of reference that you find yourself in.",
        "So if you think about an investment banker who's been commuting to Nantucket in his twin-engine Cessna and feeling very good about it, is that person going to be just as happy when a new neighbor moves in, and he sees him commuting at the same airport he uses in a Gulfstream IV international jet?"

        "People flock to them from other funds, and that's how they get paid.",
        "They get paid by how much money they manage, not by any other variable.",
        "And so when you're not offering the thing that's rising in price, then people desert you, and so everybody does it.",
        "You can't just sit out of the market and watch your neighbors, who are dumber than you, get rich while you're not in on the action.",
        "Again getting back to Darwin, natural selection, we were selected to be a short-term benefit analysis, not for the long term.",
        "You know, the human brain really focuses very intently on immediate costs and benefits.",
        "We're not sure why that is, but a good guess is that while the brain was evolving, there were just so many immediate threats to survival that if you focused on anything else than the immediate threats, then you just wouldn't live to see the long run.",
        "And so sure, you might be at risk in the long run if you invest in a certain way, but it's the short run that really dominates people's thinking.",
        "And when people are allowed to borrow a lot of money and lever up their portfolios and invest in a rising price asset like houses, as we saw in the most recent bubble, we always get a crash in the wake of that."
