        "And I don't know the facts on the ground of this case, but it's not hard to imagine that people might have considered that a price not worth paying.",
        "Well, wouldn't this go against the economic models that say people act in their own self-interest because a tax-free future, they're free from property taxes, is a pretty good incentive, I would think.",
