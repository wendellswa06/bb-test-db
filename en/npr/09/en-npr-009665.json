        "And we don't call ourselves political junkies here for nothing, Meghan.",
        "No, and I feel that what's happened with this campaign is it's taken a lot of people who weren't even necessarily interested in politics and made them overnight junkies.",
        "And what's your distinction between election fatigue and obsession?",
        "Well, election fatigue is pretty common in any campaign.",
        "Obsession, which I think kind of started to happen around the week that Sarah Palin was introduced into the mix, maybe for about seven to 10 days after that.",
        "Obsession was a sort of, you know, it implies an acute and very intense interest in the details of a campaign.",
        "Addiction is what happens when the obsession is still going on but we're not really enjoying it anymore.",

        "You have these Netflix movies sitting around that, you know, you should watch but the weeks go by and you can't peel yourself away from CNN or MSNBC.",
        "You're starting to have negative consequences.",
        "The conversations feel very urgent but nobody really wants to be having the conversations.",
        "There's a shame spiral, if you will.",
        "A shame spiral?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, you need to be thinking about the election and reading these blogs and like I said in the column, reading not just the comments but the comments about the comments.",
