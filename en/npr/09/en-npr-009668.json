        "That's where Elizabethtown is, and I just wanted to say, you know, growing up in a party that's been traditional values and conservative values, having a woman as the vice president, what that means to me is our party is, you know, moving forward.",
        "You know, we're becoming more progressive.",
        "And it's just wonderful for a young person like me who - this will be my first presidential election I'll be voting in.",

        "So I think it's a fascinating thing that we can have leadership that, you know, that are women.",
        "But if the overall lives of the women in your country are deteriorating and every indicator, I don't think it matters if you elected 99 senators who are women.",
        "In the end, what really matters to me is not that we sort of pin the tail on a donkey that looks like us or is of a different gender, but that our society as a whole is dealing with the gender that we're celebrating simply because they're running for our party.",
        "In other words, having a female president and having the lives of women be worse than it was in 1983 does not sound to me like any form of progress.",
