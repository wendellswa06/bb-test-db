        "That means that - you know, for things like terrorism recruitment or terrorism propaganda, we want to make sure that it's not on the site because we think that that could lead to real-world harm.",
        "It's a vast challenge and delicate.",
        "Facebook wants to block dangerous content without blocking free speech.",
        "Its techniques include hiring more human monitors of doubtful content.",
        "Bickert also hopes to block some offensive images before they're published using image-matching software.",
        "To tell if somebody is, for instance, trying to upload a known propaganda video.",
        "Blocking harmful or violent videos, I guess, before they reach anyone.",
        "How would that work?",
        "There's software that we have that allows us to recognize if a video that someone's trying to upload to Facebook is a video we've seen before.",
        "So let's say that somebody uploads an ISIS formal propaganda video.",
        "Somebody reports that or somebody tells us about that.",
        "We look at that video.",
        "Then we can use this software to create what's called a hash, or a digital fingerprint of that video, so that if somebody else tries to upload that video in the future, we would recognize it even before the video hits the site.",
        "And, you know, I want to point out that it doesn't necessarily mean that we would take automated action.",
        "There are some types of videos that would violate our policies no matter what, like a beheading video.",
        "But there are other times where we need people to actually review the content that this software is flagging for us.",
        "What if somebody creates a - god forbid - a fresh beheading?",
        "Do you have an algorithm or software that can recognize that as it's happening?",
        "Photo-matching software is not going to recognize that.",
        "But if we can find out from the community, you know, what the new image contains - and we also talked to others in industry about this, so that whoever finds it first can share it with the others - then we can go ahead and create a digital hash of that and stop anybody from uploading it to Facebook."

        "People in the United States have been more and more forcefully reminded that many of us risk being in an information bubble, where the more content of a certain slant that we click on, the more content like that we get.",
        "And there are left-wing information bubbles and right-wing information bubbles.",
        "Are there terrorist information bubbles, do you think?",
        "Well, there's maybe two different things we're talking about here.",
        "And one is whether it's hate speech or terror propaganda that's being discussed among a certain group of people.",
        "And another is whether or not there is speech that pushes back on that.",
        "We do find that there is a lot of speech that pushes back on ideas like promoting terror groups or hate speech.",
        "And, in fact, we're involved in trying to enable and promote some of those campaigns.",
        "Oh, but that's kind of my question because, as everybody knows, you can have lots of speech that pushes back on Democrats that Democrats never see and lots of speech that pushes back on Republicans that Republicans never see.",
        "Are there information bubbles for people who are extremists or leaning toward extremism, where they might spend all day on Facebook and never see anything that challenges their views?"
