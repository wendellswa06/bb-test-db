        "Hubert Humphrey waited until the deadline had passed for all the primaries to have gone before he got into the race.",
        "So he got the nomination without winning a single primary, and there was bedlam in Chicago, as you remember."

        "But the reconfiguration of the entire map, as the state delegation moves from 32 people to 36, clearly gives nothing significant in terms of a more - a greater advantage to Hispanics.",
        "In other words, after a decade of population growth, driven in large part, two-thirds of that population growth was Hispanic, there's really nothing in this new map that demonstrates or represents their increase in population."
