        "And, you know, bottom line is, I don't envy these guys, their task at all because, as you know, we have an extremely powerful delegation and to try to figure out which one of them have to go away is, you know, it's a completely thankless task but...",

        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "And they're going from 11 to 10, and I think there's a lot of pressure on least - if they don't force one Democratic member to run against another Democratic member in a primary, then maybe they can get them to run against Scott Brown for the Senate, but this is a very unenviable task because even though the Democrats control everything, it's only - it's a Democrat who's going to lose his seat.",
        "So almost to the opposite situation as they have in Texas.",
        "Nancy, what were you hoping to see come out of this process?",

        "The map that passed the legislature, I guess, Governor Quinn is either about to sign or has already signed 10 of the 11 Republicans in the state - the congressional delegation are either going to be merged with other incumbents or moved into Democratic seats and...",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "...so it looks like as many as six Republicans could lose their seats in 2012, which would wipe out the gains they had in 2010.",

        "Maybe even Washington State."
