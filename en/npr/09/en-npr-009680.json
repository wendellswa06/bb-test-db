        "Well, what did you know that no one else did?",
        "Oh, we were just beings responding to stimulus that I think the National Science Foundation gave us.",
        "And we submitted proposals seeking support for a facility that they had in mind, only, I think we made the mistake of looking for a very wide range of applications in actually one facility.",
        "And so that's how it all started.",
        "Larry Goldberg, the NSF has invested a lot of money and a lot of effort in nanotechnology, has it not?",
        "Yes, it has.",
        "And this is one investment, which we're particularly proud of because it dates back some 30 years, if you will, to 1977, an era when one really was talking about structures on micrometer scales, not yet shorter dimensions.",
        "But that investment has grown over the years to now a network of user facilities in which Cornell is a participant.",
        "That really served the broad science and engineering and technology sector in this new burgeoning field.",
        "Barbara Baird, let's talk about one of the most interesting fields of nanotechnology and that is nanomedicine.",
        "Let's talk about some of the advances in this field.",
        "Care to pick one out to begin with?",
        "Well, I'd like to take a step back from that and talk about nanobiotechnology, which underlies nanomedicine.",
        "Sure.",
        "And it's a recent thrust out from this main trunk of advances in micro and then nanotechnology.",
        "And the recognition - again, I'd like to think that Cornell was ahead of the game in the NSF - with the NSF support and stimulus to take some of the advances that had come about through development of electronics to smaller and smaller length scales to recognize that it was now possible to address biology at its most fundamental length scales - the molecular length scales of macromolecules, proteins, DNA and so forth, that make up the workings of cells, that make up the workings of organs and tissues and so forth."

        "I've spoke with 35 different scientists in various fields, from biotechnology, to physics, to engineering science.",

        "Do these scientists think of the social and ethical issues that may pop themselves up in their work?",
        "Oh, this is a question I was hoping you would ask, because I think that they would like to be able to think about these things, talk about these things, but there are two immediate problems.",
        "One is that it's really difficult to do it without making it feel personal.",
        "So what I found as an initial reaction is well, these are fascinating questions but, of course, I don't need to ask them of myself, because I'm doing the best I can and I believe I'm doing the right thing here."
