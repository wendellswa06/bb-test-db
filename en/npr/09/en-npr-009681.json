        "The other side of the game is to get the cheap things coming out, and the cheap things are when we do the photography, the lithography techniques, then we can multiply - make many copies and do them at a very low cost.",
        "The new thing that seems to be coming through is an imprint lithography technique in which one impresses and creates a master and a mold, and one creates things of that nature.",
        "Those seem to be able to take us down to the nano scale, but it's a long way, in fact, from taking that technology now and creating new things.",
        "The insight, I think, that I brought away from that particular talk was a question, which is, how does the world want to nanocompute in a nanotechonology era?",
        "This is at a small scale.",
        "We're going to be looking at new forms of doing the computation.",
        "It brings - a lot of things have to be developed in order to take this.",
        "The most promising era, I think, is one that's going to have a compatibility with a seamless technology, which is what we've been using all along.",
        "But there are other possibilities that are coming out.",
        "As far as advances in the instrumental tools, the ability, perhaps, to go even further with electrons is one that excites me and that we have finally, after something like 60 years, begun to see solutions to the problem of making our lenses better.",
        "So that's one that looks as though on a long range that might improve the shorter range, I think, of the new ways of designing how computers are going to compute and do their job.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Barbara Baird, we talked recently on SCIENCE FRIDAY about biocomputers, these tiny devices that are actually constructed from DNA and RNA and proteins that researchers hope will be able to read a cell's signals and pick up the signs of trouble right before they manifest themselves as diseases.",
        "Do you think nanomedicine will change how we diagnose medical condition?",
        "I think there's no question about that.",
        "And part is that - I mean, it's driven by the availability of these tools, and the goals are to be able to look at smaller amounts of complex, physiological fluids and be able to test for a variety of conditions with a fairly simple and fast test.",
        "And so that, no question, will enable faster diagnoses in field test, in the military or in undeveloped countries.",
        "All of these things should become available and ultimately cheap and very thorough in terms of diagnostics.",

        "How much of nanotechnology is being investigated by corporations themselves instead of the university for making products?",
        "And I ask all of you.",
        "You know, we've seen cosmetic companies making sunscreens and women's makeup and we have seen everything from nanowax for cars - the list can go on and on and on - baseball bats, tennis rackets, things like that made out of nanomaterials.",
        "It's seems like the consumer industry has almost taken over the field?",
        "Well, I'll speak to that first, I guess.",
        "I think what all of those products that you described are based on materials, and it's a development of better materials and being able to make more finely controlled materials, allows you to control them in terms of lightness, strength and so forth.",
        "And so that certainly, there has been and will continue to be in a big investment in that and it will continue to improve.",
        "I think the big companies are more cautious in the more difficult, challenging devices, which are multifunctional to do certain things especially in biological or medical types of context.",
        "That's a much more ambitious and risky undertaking.",
        "And certainly small companies are beginning to probe some of these things that the big companies, I think, are waiting for them to be developed a little by the small companies, would be my idea."

        "And here's where I think the Cornell and other facilities that are being supported across the country have a really important enabling role in that they provide, if you will, a prototyping laboratory for these new ideas with the equipment that is needed to test out what really could become a commercial product.",

        "is to remain ahead in many of the fields today, it's through innovation and new products that are going to come about by this type of research.",

        "Well, I think that would be ultimately regulated by the FDA for types of materials that would be used for medical purposes.",

        "And as I was saying earlier, part of the excitement about nanotechnology is that this can be used to understand how cells work on the most fundamental levels and ultimately, how organisms work.",
        "And with that level of information, you can design more and more sophisticated computer programs or software that more realistically reflect what the response would be to a particular type of product, a drug or a nanoparticle or anything.",

        "They come off our clothes, off our products.",
        "Sometimes, they might even be in our water.",
        "How much - and from the research that I have in front of me, looking at the amount of research that's going on, I know the NSF, for example, is also funding research on nanoparticles, it doesn't appear to be, to me at least, that there's a great percentage of the money invested in nanotechnology, invested in the health and possible environmental consequences of what might happen here?",
        "I think, Ira, there is a significant investment being made at the federal level in order to study these questions and develop the basic science underlying them in order to have informed policy making.",
        "And at the NSF, we have invested in science and technology centers that deal with biological environmental nanotechnology several years back.",
        "And we've had continuing grant competitions in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, looking at the science issues in this field of risk.",

        "I wouldn't place these in too different a category than drugs.",
        "And as the regulation - regulatory agencies already exist, these things are tested.",
        "And there may be unintended consequences, but I don't think there's any more reason for alarm in these cases than there are in other developments of technology.",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "But one - a point I wanted to make is that with the investment of the federal agencies in nanotechnology, there has been from the very beginning a concern that this aspect be considered.",
        "I have served on a number of advisory committees, both with the NSF and the NIH, and together with the consideration of what new products, what new research, what new frontiers can be addressed, has been the consideration, or how can we deal with the unintended consequences?",

        "So, that we can head those off."
