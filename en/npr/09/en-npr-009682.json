        "And the size of these can become quite small, and so you can envision this capability really serving wide societal needs, both environmental sensing, sensing in the whole medical aspects.",

        "And so building a membrane that can or a combination of devices that senses what's wrong with the water and then be able to filter out whatever it is that's wrong; first prescribing what's necessary and then being able to eliminate what's there and to develop pure water.",
        "So that requires a combination of things, not just one thing.",
        "And that's another point, I guess, I wanted to make is nanotechnology, for my view, is one tool and it's to be put together with a variety of other tools to be maximally effective.",
        "So that's - I would - so that's how I would address a question like that.",
        "And if we took - went over to the health side, a goal would be able to detect diseases before they're manifest.",
        "And that comes from first it's what they call personalized medicine now, understand what you susceptibilities are and then be on guard for when that might manifest and be able to deal with it right away.",
        "So that's a combination of diagnostics, being able to sequence DNA very quickly, and then have the knowledge based to know what that DNA would predict for your health future...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and then whatever diagnostic is necessary to be able to determine whether that is in fact happening, and to deal with right away."
