        "Rosalyn Berne, any ethical...",
        "There was an interesting talk about this yesterday on our panel.",
        "In fact, a man named (unintelligible) who's written a book about ethics and military applications of nano, his concern was the disproportionate allocation of funding in our country for military applications of nano in comparison to other areas of interest and also, in comparison to other initiatives around the globe saying that in the United States, in past initiatives it's been around 65 percent, he cited that, now, we're at 80 percent of our funding going to nano.",
        "And I'm not sure where his figure is coming from, so I'm not going to be the authority on it.",
        "But he was concerned about whether we're doing enough assessment of military applications of nano.",
        "There was also reference to the soldier - Institute of Soldier Technologies at MIT.",
        "Some of it seems to be there to protect and make things more efficient.",
        "Some of it seems to be there to make us more powerful and more competitive.",
        "This man's concern was that there is a gap.",
        "And studying and thinking about the implications of these allocations and these applications - it's an important question that our caller has asked.",

        "In a few moments we have left when we all sit here 30 years from now, and we're talking about 60 years past of nanotechnology research.",
        "Do you think that we could - it's able to even predict, I mean, technology moves so fast these days.",
        "If you consider how fast the 30 years, things have happened in 30 years, from where they began.",
        "Do you think it's impossible to actually predict where nanotechnology or, you know, or even to predict, you know, what might not happen 30 years from now?",
        "I think the only safe prediction is that you ain't seen nothing yet."

        "Sure.",
        "I think one revolution that we're just beginning to see or just approaching is really even more integration amongst the disciplines.",
        "This has really been driven by the engineering and somewhat from the physical sciences side and being able to make things smaller and have all these different specifications.",
        "I think, it is yet to be embraced as much as it can be and will be by the medical side, say, or the biological side where there's really an integration of the knowledge bases of those several disciplines.",
        "And so as they become more integrated, you'll see a lot more integration of devices and particles with biological systems.",
        "I think that's for sure.",
        "And certainly, the miniaturization or the nanoturization(ph) or microminiaturization of computers will really play a big role in that.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Go ahead.",

        "So we have to train more students here.",
        "Yes.",
        "One comment I would make is your question about new physics.",
        "In fact, some of the very appropriate physics has been around since the early part of the 20th century and before, but as a teacher, it's actually great to point to actual quantum effects that students can see, seeing quantum dots and other things, and it's not some kind of magic.",
