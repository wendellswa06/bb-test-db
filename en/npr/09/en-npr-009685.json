        "Oh, yes, many Nigerians still send their children to be educated in Britain.",
        "And more and more, many West Africans - English-speaking West Africans - are sending their young people to the United States for education - more and more.",
        "I mean, my era, you know, those of us who are in our 40s, 50s - tended to go to Britain if we were being sent abroad to school.",
        "But those in their 20s and their teens are going to the U.S.",
        "more and more.",
        "So Nigeria has very close links with the United States.",
        "Now, it appears - and this isn't confirmed, because the family have given a very basic statement, but from what other family members have been saying -that he said he didn't need the family's wealth or money because he could study Islamic studies in Yemen and he didn't need money to do that - that to study was free.",
        "And it's around that time that it seems he cut off ties with the family and disowned the family, and appears to, perhaps, have quarreled with his father about how his future academic progress should be.",
        "And it's from that time that the family - the father apparently informed the U.S.",
        "embassy, the Nigerian security services, and the Saudi Arabian security services that they had lost touch with the young man and could they please find him and bring him home.",
        "Tell us a little bit more about the situation in Nigeria.",
        "You mentioned the northern part of the country is the Muslim part of the country.",
        "This is one of the great fault lines between Christianity and Islam - no?",
        "You could call it that.",
        "But you could also say that for a country that's about 50 percent Muslim, 50 percent Christian - the most popular nation in Africa, with 114 million odd people - that Nigeria has, more or less, done pretty well.",
        "I mean, these two huge communities have lived side by side together in - mostly in harmony.",
        "Yes, there have been incidents of religious sectarian violence that have led to hundreds of deaths, but these have been spasmodic.",
        "Mostly Christians and Muslims have lived side by side in the north, in the west, in the south - together.",
        "But early of this year, Neal - and I remember reporting on it extensively -there was homegrown militant Islamic group called Boko Haram, which means western education is forbidden; Haram, as in Arabic and in the Muslim religion.",
        "And it seemed to have recruited a lot of young men.",
        "And everybody was trying to find out whether it had Islamic militant links with - had links to al-Qaida, whether it had extremist links - but it ended very bloodily, with quite a few deaths and the Nigerian police and security forces being engaged.",
        "But that was a sort of Muslim-Muslim incident, as opposed to some of the sectarian violence that we have seen separating Christians and Muslims, with Christians being killed, Muslims being killed; some of the violence, sometimes started by Christians with Muslims retaliation and vice versa.",
        "And again, we should point out that this young man was radicalized - he was radicalized apparently outside of Nigeria.",
        "But nevertheless, we heard from Dina Temple-Raston, the NPR counterterrorism correspondent, earlier today, that she had been hearing reports, lately, of al-Qaida being active in northern Nigeria.",
        "Have you heard that as well?",
        "The Nigerian government is saying absolutely not, absolutely not.",
        "And the imams, Islamic religious leaders, are also saying that al-Qaida and other militant Islamist groups do not have a foothold in northern Nigeria.",
        "But, of course, you ask yourself the question.",
        "Nigeria is one of Africa's top oil exporting countries.",
        "And it should be a very wealthy country.",
        "But it's desperately pull from many, many, many millions of its citizens.",
        "And people think the explosive combination of oil, wealth and poverty, of course, could be a magnet for people - Muslims as well as Christians - who are feeling disenfranchised, who are feeling they are not part of the wealth of Nigeria, that they don't benefit from the wealth, could be linked to all sorts of extremist groups.",
        "And it's not just religion.",
        "We've seen, in the oil-producing area, where there has been militant activity, and this a mainly Christian area, for the past three years.",
        "So of course, there is scope for this sort of concern in Nigeria, whatever the government is saying and whatever the Muslim religious leaders are saying."

        "So it's obviously a Muslim family, as I say - respected, prominent, well-to-do.",
        "But how this young man seems to have turned away from his family and espouse, as we believe, militancy and extremism isn't clear.",

        "Is there a lot of anti-Americanism in Nigeria?",
        "On contrary, I think Nigerians have a pretty good relationship with the United States.",
        "Washington and Abuja have good relation.",
        "I mean, during the military regimes - and that's been most of Nigeria's experience since independence almost 60 years ago, there were tough - there was tough talking from Washington.",
        "But since the return to democratic rule in 1999, although election since then has not been the best, generally, Nigeria has excellent relations with the United States.",
        "There have been problems over security issues, problems of course with the fact that the U.S.",
        "gets a fifth of its oil supply from Nigeria, but there have been militancy and violence in the oil-exporting area, but not so much.",
        "We haven't heard so much about problems with al-Qaida or other extremist Islamic contact.",
        "But of course, the U.S., in the whole of West Africa, have concerns about the growing militancy and the fact that it feels al-Qaida has now got a foothold in this corner of Africa.",

        "And of course, northern Nigeria is very closely linked because it has a border with Niger and - not Americans, but other Western tourists and aide workers have been abducted in Mauritania, in Niger and in Mali.",
        "So there is definitely concern in Washington about growing Islamic militancy in this region of Africa.",
        "And this is, obviously, part of Anglophone Africa, former British colony.",
        "And there are great and continuing ties, a considerable African community in London where this young man went to study mechanical engineering.",
        "I should think so, and he lived in a very good part of London, so he lived a very privileged life.",
        "But of course, there are certain mosques in London, in Great Britain, that the British authorities fear are radicalizing the youth.",
        "A lot of them have been in, actually, northern Britain, and it's been more the Asian British, the Pakistanis and so on (unintelligible) as opposed to Nigerians."
