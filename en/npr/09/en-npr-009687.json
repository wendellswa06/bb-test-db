        "The idea is to encourage the global use of technologies that will save energy and reduce pollution.",

        "Well, I think we do have to recognize that in some of the technologies - like LEDs, like solar, like onshore wind - we have seen pretty remarkable cost reductions in the last six, seven years.",
        "And we have seen as well very substantial upticks in their deployment.",
        "LED costs have dropped probably 90 percent in the last six or seven years.",
        "And in solar, we have between 10 and 20 times as much deployment because costs have come down between 50 and 60 percent.",
        "So we're making a lot of progress.",
