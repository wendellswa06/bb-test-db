        "And they're a hot commodity.",
        "First of all, because they're immune to the disease now - and so they can work in clinics without all that heavy protective equipment.",

        "It's hopeful.",
        "One of the major barriers in Liberia in West Africa to treating the disease is that people are afraid to go to hospitals.",
        "It's seen as a place where people die.",
        "And so holding up a survivor and saying this person survived Ebola - that's a really powerful thing.",
        "Is there any stigma within - any problems with the fact that they did have the disease - people might be afraid that they're still carriers?",
        "Yeah.",

        "Now, these kids are at high risk for getting the disease - some of them are not showing symptoms yet.",
        "And so the work she's doing is really important.",
        "It's also really stigmatized.",
        "Becky, when you were in Liberia, the CDC announced new screening protocols for travelers coming to the U.S.",

        "What was your experience coming back to the U.S.? And what precautions have you been taking since you've been back?",
        "People are being given this piece of paper that says hand this to your doctor if you get sick in the next 21 days.",
        "And this is a piece of paper that has all of the symptoms of Ebola on it.",
        "And it's meant to help doctors, who are dealing with patients who are coming back from West Africa from one of the countries that's been affected by Ebola.",
        "It has a hotline for the CDC.",
        "It has a list of things to watch for.",
        "And the first thing is says is isolate this patient.",
        "That combined with taking your temperature daily - and I've been doing that twice a day - is really the best defense because this disease is not dangerous until you show symptoms.",
        "And so the most important thing is to screen for symptoms and watch yourself for symptoms - and that's what I'm doing.",
        "ALL THINGS CONSIDERED's own Rebecca Hersher.",
        "Becky, great work.",
