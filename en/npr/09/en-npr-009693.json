        "You know, the whole issue of discussing alcohol in the same topic of marijuana as a so-called medicine is a perfect example of the mixed messages we're getting.",
        "You know, are we talking about a medicine or are we talking about an illegal drug that's addictive and impairing?",
        "And that's really what's going on with this issue of marijuana as a so-called medicine.",
        "It's a movement that has been totally financed by individuals and organizations that want to legalize not just marijuana but all drugs.",
        "I think it's very telling when you look at who the advocates are out there in the public pushing for marijuana as medicine.",
        "The organizations behind it--I did several interviews yesterday, and those representatives from those organizations are all organizations that are advocating for the legalization of drugs.",
        "Where do you draw the line?",
        "If we let individuals and organizations with a hidden agenda push marijuana as medicine, do we then allow them to push for crack cocaine as medicine?",

        "But that does not mean that they're getting medical treatment for it.",
        "So somewhere we have to have a process, and our country through the years has worked very, very hard to create a very solid process.",
        "It requires that we do research, that we show through scientific research that a drug has medical efficacy and that it goes through a very strict protocol before it's approved.",
        "And to totally by-step that process and totally ignore that process, it takes us back, really, to the dark ages.",
        "It takes us back to a time when we had snake oil salesmen out there declaring tonics and all kinds of things medicine and duping the American public, and I don't think we want to go back to those days.",

        "We are talking about two different things.",
        "One is whether marijuana has any medical benefits and one is what kind of drug it is along the spectrum of legal and illegal drugs.",
