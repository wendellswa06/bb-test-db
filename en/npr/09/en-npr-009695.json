        "OK.",
        "Now, to move onto that challenge you gave last week.",
        "The challenge was: Name a country.",
        "The name contains the symbol for a chemical element.",
        "Change the symbol to the symbol for another chemical element in order to name another country.",
        "I said there are two answers.",

        "And they are?",
        "Well, actually, it turned out to be three answers.",
        "My intended ones were Mali to Malta.",
        "You change the I of iodine to TA, tantalum, to get Malta; Algeria to Nigeria - changing AL to NI.",
        "And then one I didn't know about was Ireland to Iceland.",
        "You can change the RE, which is a chemical symbol, to CE, which is another.",

        "Typically, those transitioning from male to female are held in a male facility and isolated if there are security concerns.",

        "Jeffrey Perry, a former Massachusetts legislator and now special sheriff, says that's problematic, and managing an inmate during surgery, he says, even more so."
