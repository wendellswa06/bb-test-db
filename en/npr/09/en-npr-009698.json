        "And later on, what they decided was that whoever it was, was actually aiming to get the dog team, and they waited until my vehicle went over the device and command detonated it.",
        "From what I was told, it flipped my vehicle a couple of times and rolled it several more times.",
        "And I don't know what happened from there.",
        "Mike, can you fill in what happened?",
        "I was on the first helicopter in.",

        "I had an open abdomen for about six weeks because it was so distended, they couldn't close it.",
        "And in the end, when they did close it about six weeks later, they actually used a titanium mesh that holds my muscles and my abdominal wall together.",
        "So they weren't actually able to repair my pelvis and my spine until the end of August.",
        "And when they did that, they put six screws in my pelvis, and they put two pins in my spine.",

        "So I whistled.",
        "And he came in and jumped up on my bed with his front feet, and then he jumped up the whole way.",
        "And I had IV lines everywhere and, you know, all kinds of tubes and stuff connected to me, and he was getting all tangled up in them.",
        "And people were spazzing out, but I didn't care.",
        "He was there.",
        "I was happy."

        "So on the way home, I picked up my phone, and I called her and basically apologized for opening any new wounds that she may have had.",
        "And we spoke for about 45 minutes on the phone until I was standing in my driveway, realizing it's getting even later.",
        "Talking to Mike helped me get some closure because I think, in a sense, it was also helping him out.",

        "Both volunteer for the local fire and rescue company.",
        "Their marriage may read like a storybook, but real life is tough.",
        "Although she still suffers from the effects of the explosion, Jamie works as an abuse investigator for the county's child protection services and is studying for her master's degree in social work.",

        "Mike wants to help.",
        "Mike wants to fix it.",
        "And there's a lot of things with me that you can't fix.",
