        "But very clearly, some of his wires were not attached properly.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "With backing from a man named Arnold Beckman, he founded Shockley Semiconductor in Palo Alto and he was going to build - at least at first he was going to build silicon transistors.",
        "It was his decision that they use silicon as opposed to germanium, otherwise we'd be talking about Germanium Valley out there instead of Silicon Valley.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's right, yeah.",
        "He had this enormous talent of picking geniuses, of exceptionably bright people to work for him, and it took him about a year and half to screw it up.",

        "How?",
        "He was paranoid.",

        "They do.",
        "They form something called Fairchild Semiconductor, which only lasted for about two years.",
        "And then they quit again and went out -because they decided they could get filthy rich on their own - and founded Intel.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And so what happens to Shockley in the meantime?",
        "Shockley had decided he was going to change technologies.",
        "He was going to do something that was called the Shockley diode, which had virtually no market whatsoever.",
        "That was one of the fights he had with Noyce.",

        "That's correct.",
        "He was a eugenicist.",
        "He believed in eugenics, which essentially is that all the people - all the brighter people are reproducing at a slower rate than the not-bright people, or the worthy people are producing less quickly than the unworthy people, which he called dysgenics; in other words, evolution backwards.",
        "The problem with eugenics, which may or may not have any firm basis in reality, is that you almost cannot mention the word eugenics without mentioning the word Nazi in the next sentence because it was the basis for the Nazi's program.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Was there any one thing, Joel, you think that sent him over the edge - that was there an event in his life, perhaps?",
        "Yeah, well, that's a matter of considerable debate.",
        "One of his best friends said that Shockley and his wife were in an automobile accident in 1960, and Shockley, in fact, hit his head on a windshield.",
        "He blames it on that.",
        "I think it was far more complicated than that.",
        "It may very well have gone back to the telephone call that Bardeen and Brattain had made when they told him that they had come up with a - they had the transistor effect in the laboratory.",
        "I think, in fact, there was not one event.",
        "I think he was simply sliding off into whatever mental state he wound up with, but I think it was in there all the time.",
