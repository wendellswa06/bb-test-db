        "That picture was made during a night at Abu Ghraib prison when a soldier had been - I mean a prisoner had been brought in, an Iraqi prisoner, by members of the criminal investigative division of the military.",
        "Most of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib were picked up by soldiers during sweeps around the country.",

        "They were people basically held pending or during interrogation, primarily by military intelligence, but also by other clandestine and intelligence services, including the CIA to a large degree, and in this case, the criminal investigative division, who had picked this guy up on suspicion of being somebody who had killed other CID agents somewhere else in Iraq.",

        "On this occasion, it was particularly cold, so that Charles Grainer, who was the MP in charge of the block at that night, actually cut - the poncho that you see is a prison blanket, where he cut a slit and put it over the prisoner's head to keep him a little bit warmer, which is not the reputation Charles Grainer generally has in the public imagination.",
        "He is usually seen as the ringleader and the sadist of the bad apples.",

        "He and Sabrina Harmon, one of the other MPs who had stepped into the shower room where this was happening, and they took these photos.",
        "Although nobody's ever quite said it, it seems pretty clear that they took them in part to take the photos.",
        "They put the wires on him to take the photos.",

        "We don't know, but that was the sort o, extent of that story, and that incident which the MPs themselves did not consider to be a moment of torture, or by any means the worst thing.",
        "And I think one of the reasons that picture has power - because when you look at it, you see that something terribly wrong has happened, that something has gone terribly wrong, and yet in part, you don't know what it is."

        "The people who had taken the picture of the man under the hood went into that shower stall later and started taking pictures.",
        "And one of them in particular, a soldier, one of them named Sabrina Harman, who had aspired in civilian life to become a forensic photographer, in fact, when she unzipped the body bag and looked at this body, she took it upon herself to take a lot of pictures.",
        "She had been told by her commander that this man had died of a heart attack.",
