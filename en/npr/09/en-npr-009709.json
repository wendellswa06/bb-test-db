        "But there were charges as a result of that incident.",
        "There were some charges against Navy Seals who had been involved in the capture.",
        "Those were dropped or didn't go to anywhere.",
        "And there were charges originally leveled Sabrina Harman for taking the photographs.",
        "They were basic - the charges included the phrase \"\"tampering with evidence.\"\" Which as she put it, it seemed to me that they'd done that for me, by bandaging a man who had not been bandaged before his death.",
        "They ultimately dropped those charges against her, didn't take them all the way through court, she felt, because nobody wanted to bring the entire case into the courtroom at all.",
        "Once you did that you had to introduce all these photographs.",
        "And there were two photographs, from the incident with the corpse, where one of her and one of Charles Grader, each taken by the other, posing with the corpse - with the thumbs up, with the smile that Neal mentioned in his introduction that shocked many people.",
        "Hi there.",
        "Unfortunately, as a nine-year veteran in the Army, I can fairly unequivocally say I would probably have followed orders.",
        "The name of this documentary is very appropriate, \"\"Standard Operating Procedure.\"\" You will follow orders.",
        "I had a seminal moment where I asked a major that I worked for one time when we had very willingly, very knowingly put American civilian lives at risk, during a training accident, or not a training accident, I'm sorry, a training incident.",

        "And I think, in many ways, I think, distracted us from the dead man behind her, and the evidence that she also photographed, and she readily acknowledges that they look bad, as she puts it.",
        "The souvenir or trophy photographs that soldiers take, certainly not the first time, and she says and they are ample photographs to support this, that she had fallen into the habit, much the way a politician will have this automatic smile or many of us in a snapshot anytime a camera was pointed at her, she made this thumbs up.",
        "And there are pictures of her in front of tourist sites in Iraq, in front of antiquities, in the market with her friends and with prisoners.",
        "All with her thumbs up.",
        "The body of that prisoner was eventually removed on a gurney, with an IV line running into his arm, to make it look as if he was still alive, a complete charade, as, of course, we know.",
        "We're talking with Philip Gourevitch about his book, \"\"Standard Operating Procedure.\"\" It's also the name of a new film by documentarian Errol Morris.",

        "And we're talking with Philip Gourevitch about his collaboration with Errol Morris on the book and the movie documentary, \"\"Standard Operating Procedure,\"\" about what happened at Abu Ghraib.",

        "But why were those pictures taken ultimately?",
        "And why were those prisoners treated the way they were?",
        "And that goes back to that broader question that you raised - about policy.",
        "Well, there was a distinct change in American policy in the War on Terror, which is the context that this took place.",
        "And although it took place in the Iraq theater, in the aftermath of September 11th, there was a serious and concerted effort by the administration to consider how to change interrogation policy to allow for much more what they called \"\"aggressive and robust\"\" practices, but also quite specifically by the lawyers, the White House counsel Alberto Gonzales, who later became the attorney general and was forced out for forcing out attorney generals elsewhere in the country.",
        "And from Rumsfeld's Pentagon, from the Justice Department, at that time under Ashcroft, before Gonzales.",
        "And in the vice president's office, of course, to really essentially decriminalize torture and to question the applicability of the Geneva Convention to the theaters of war.",
        "People often think the Geneva Convention sounds very foreign and French or Swiss and not really like a sort of international convention like the U.N.",
        "But it is Army doctrine.",
        "The Army doctrine for the treatment of prisoners during wartime is based on the Geneva Convention.",
        "And in the field manual quite strikingly, and in the Army regulations, it specifies that in the event of a conflict, the Geneva Convention should be referred to as the sort of higher document, which is quite striking.",
        "And they basically detected weaknesses, very clear weaknesses, both in the definition of torture, which is a vague definition, based on the level of pain that is inflicted and the intention to inflict that pain.",
        "So that you have to prove both intent and intensity at levels that are very, very difficult to define in any kind of court.",
        "In fact, there's never been a torture case in an American court, and there are very few that have held up in any kind of international court of this kind.",
        "And, also, to say that, gee, the Geneva Convention really seems to mostly apply to wars between state actors.",
        "So when we're fighting Saddam's army, Saddam is a sovereign and that is a certain kind of war.",
        "In Afghanistan against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, there was a decision not to apply the Geneva Convention.",
        "The people who are at Guantanamo, the idea is that most of them came from that theater and that they are not covered by the Geneva Convention because they are not state actors.",
        "They are unlawful combatants, in the terms of the Administration lawyers.",
        "And there was a very clear and striking thing, that if the famous mission-accomplished speech on May 1st of 2003, which has been often mocked because the president seemed to be prematurely triumphalist.",
        "What was really important in that speech was the second half of the speech, which was really largely devoted to describing the Iraq War now as a new phase of the war and redefining that war and that theater as part of the War on Terror.",
        "Saddam Hussein is never mentioned by name, al-Qaeda and September 11th are repeatedly invoked and that you realize that there a kind of legal pivot that then applied to the building of these prison camps as they started to fight the insurgency.",
        "There were large sweeps, people were brought in, and the policy was very explicitly to allow techniques - nudity, dogs, depravation of sleep, stress positions - all of things that had not been standard practice before.",
        "So these guards, who are the face of this terrible, terrible scandal, those guards say, we were following orders.",
        "We were told to do what the military interrogators, and military intelligence told us what to do.",
        "MR.",
        "GOUREVITCH: Well, it's pretty clear, if you follow the dotted line down the chain, that there was an awful lot of pressure on them to do these things and that these, many of these practices.",
        "Now, did somebody say stack those people and make them in a pyramid?",
        "No. Did a climate in which nudity had become invisible, where the keeping people up for night after night in loud noise, and keeping people in dark cells, keeping people in situations that the Red Cross was reporting to the Army on repeated visits which the Army was trying to stymie, that these prisoners were being held in violation in violation of all of these laws.",
        "These soldiers were brought into that climate and they found that even when they said, wait, this seems wrong.",
        "This ain't what we're supposed to be doing.",
