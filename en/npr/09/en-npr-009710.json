        "CORB O'CONNER (Audience Member): Hi, my name is Corb O'Connor (ph) from outside Chicago, and now a student at the George Washington University.",
        "My question is - I've noticed we've been discussing a lot in the past tense.",
        "But I'm curious what our - as a result of Abu Ghraib or maybe changing since then, what our new standard operating procedures are for military corrections facilities or detaining facilities.",
        "Walsh's kick is up, and it is no good.",
        "He missed it.",
        "Are you kidding me?",
        "The season can't end like that.",
        "It's an excellent question, and you're absolutely right that it's not the past tense.",
        "There has been - there was a tendency in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib pictures coming out to isolate those pictures and to say - what's in the pictures is the whole story, what is in the frame is entirely contained within the frame.",
        "And it is these rogue soldiers who are - who disgraced and embarrassed the country.",
        "But meanwhile, consistently, a great deal of very nasty stuff was taking place in American detention facilities, according to policies that to a large extent have become more institutionalized, have been pushed forward.",
        "We now have this debate on water-boarding, and you have support from both sides of the aisle for basically practices that until very recently this country was identified internationally as having stood for two hundred and some odd years against.",
        "And having been a refuge from, and a bulwark against.",
        "And so when people often say you know we don't even know what the war in Iraq is about, it's so complicated and so confusing, there were so many reasons given and so few have held up exactly.",
        "Well one thing it was about, however vaguely, was some fundamental idea of America and its projection of its force and its image into the world as a force for good.",
        "And it seems to me that one of the legacies of Abu Ghraib has not been that we came to the brink and we pulled back, but we came to the brink and that the push back from the administration was - no, we're not - you can't expose us because we're not ashamed, we should institutionalize these things.",
        "We have a president now who strikingly is trying to make it a cornerstone of his legacy that these two ideas, aggressive force with prisoners and over-reaching executive powers should be combined.",
        "Our guest is Philip Gourevitch.",
        "With Errol Morris, he's co-author of \"\"Standard Operating Procedure.\"\" You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And I have to ask you this.",
        "Some controversy has arisen over the way Errol Morris obtained these interviews from which he made his documentary and you wrote your book, that some of the interviewees were paid for their contributions?",
        "Yeah, I mean, I don't think there's any controversy, actually, about that.",
        "There was a report in the New York Times where they put headlines in there was a controversy, and then ran an article saying that there wasn't, that it actually is a standard procedure in documentary film, has been for a long time.",
        "Many of these people were paid also by HBO and they found one college professor to say that, well, sometimes, maybe, theoretically, if you gave people money they would become more self-dramatizing or something.",
        "I can tell you as a matter of fact that the most self-dramatizing people need only to be paid attention, not money, and that you really will find that the unpaid often come forward and are unreliable.",
        "You're job as journalist is to determine what's reliable and what isn't and nothing of substance has ever been suggested as to the nature of these interviews.",
        "I've pored over them at great length and they're really remarkable and constitute a pretty unimpeachable set of documents.",
        "Obviously they're subjective, but one would assume that people speaking about fraught situations are speaking in - at times with self-interest.",
        "And it's - what makes stories interesting.",
        "It's what our challenge is as journalists."

        "An email from Eric in Tucson, Arizona.",
        "Could you please ask your guest to respond to criticism of the film, saying it doesn't go far enough to follow the chain of command that allowed and even encouraged torture and mistreatment of detainees and led directly to Abu Ghraib?",
        "I can respond to the question of how I approached this in the book, because I did not direct the film.",
        "But I did - I think the film dealt with the same issue in the same way, and I - and that is - there's been a great deal of coverage of the memoranda that have circulated at the high levels of the administration of policy discussion.",
        "Ten days after these pictures first appeared on CBS and in the New Yorker you had calls for the resignation of the Secretary of Defense on the cover of The Economist Magazine - not known as a lefty or a dovish magazine.",
        "On all sorts of places, all of which faded away.",
        "But nevertheless that story came out and in the wake of it there was a great deal of leaking of more and more and more.",
        "And strangely the story hasn't totally bit.",
        "It's always ended up feeling like either a partisan story, a political story, a story of Washington shenanigans, a story that people don't feel a personal stake in.",
        "And what I was interested in was what - we know what the policy is.",
        "And I do go through that at some detail in the book, I show how it devolved down through different layers, through the Gitmo rules being brought into Abu Ghraib, being - going through five different drafts of interrogation procedures out of Sanchez's shop and with his lawyers' fingerprints all over them.",
        "But what really interested me is the experience of these American soldiers, the lowest level soldiers, nobody under a Staff Sergeant ever got charged for a crime there in court, who were brought into the situation and what it meant for a soldier to find himself at the forefront of policy on the ground.",
        "Philip Gourevitch and Errol Morris tell their story in a book called \"\"Standard Operating Procedure,\"\" also the name of a documentary film on the very same subject by Errol Morris.",
        "Philip Gourevitch, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Thank you.",

        "It's the Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "Today is the deadline for print journalists to send in their work for the Pulitzer prizes, but few people will note the work of those who helped those Pulitzer hopefuls with their spelling and grammar and that's because there is no Pulitzer category for copy editors.",
        "Well maybe there should be if the experience of writer Roy Peter Clark is anything to go by.",
        "That's it.",

        "We looked at the top 100 airports around the country and compared them from a decade ago to today.",
        "And basically, the larger the share that the top two airlines had of seats in that airport, the more likely you were to see a rise in airfare from a decade ago.",
        "Which sounds like you would put two and two together and get four.",
        "But, you know, we've reported that the Justice Department is investigating United, Delta and Southwest.",
        "Did you find what might be called a smoking gun that is evidence of airline executives actively conspiring to raise prices?",
        "I don't think we found a smoking gun here.",
        "What we found is that there's a clear link between the number of airlines serving your airport and the price of a ticket.",
        "It doesn't mean that the airlines necessarily work together to carve up the country, although they have done that.",
        "But it is very clear that you might have had one or two or three big airlines at your home airport a decade ago.",
        "Today, it's one airline and maybe a few others around, a few gates here, a few gates there.",
        "Well, give us an example of what you found with what airlines.",
        "What was the money involved?",
        "How big of a difference was the fare?",
        "I mean, one of the - my favorites here was Dayton, Ohio.",
        "This was an airport that was served by 10 different airlines a decade ago.",
        "Airfares there were about 5 percent below the average.",
        "Today, that airport just has four airlines and fares are 10 percent above the average.",
        "So consumers there are paying a lot more for their tickets, and they really don't have that many options of who to choose to fly.",
        "The Justice Department might now be looking for possible price collusion.",
