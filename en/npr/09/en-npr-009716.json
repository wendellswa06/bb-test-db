        "Why are they so bad?",
        "Well, Dr. Frieden is right.",
        "It's artificial.",
        "I mean these are literally vegetable oils that have undergone an industrial process that's called hydrogenation - did I say that correctly, hydrogenation - where hydrogen is literally pumped into vats of oil and it creates a more solid base.",
        "The oil is more solid, and this is in fact what makes it last longer in baked products like donuts and cookies and cakes, and it's also what enables restaurants to use their oil that they fry their chicken and french fries in, they can use it for a longer period of time.",
        "And supposedly it adds to the taste of the product, but that is up for debate.",
        "And as Dr. Frieden said, they're found everywhere.",
        "And it's sort of like a liquid shortening; I guess you could think of it that way.",
        "And just let me tell you one extra thing, which is that trans - there is a naturally occurring amount of trans fats and they're found in milk and butter and certain meats like lamb and beef.",
        "But they're miniscule levels compared to the amounts that are found in these other foods that have an artificial process.",
        "I think it would be fun to see someone try to set up a restaurant where the servers begin lecturing you about bad food choices.",

        "And we've talked with restaurants that have been quite supportive of this, ranging from Sylvia's, which is a very famous Southern or soul food restaurant in New York, to high-end places, places from all different ethnicities, really saying this is not necessary to make food that tastes just as great.",

        "And I wonder, Dr. Frieden, is that - am I just - is it me, or is that a common feeling that when you first kind of do without the trans fats you notice a difference in taste?",
        "No, food made without trans fat can taste exactly the same.",
        "The alternatives are things like replacing a margarine with a butter, which would generally give you a richer taste, or replacing one oil with another oil, which can be a better-tasting oil or a worse tasting oil.",

        "Since the early '90s there's been numerous studies that have looked at literally thousands of people and found those who ate diets that were high in trans fats - and this means lots of fried foods and pastry-type things - these people had significantly higher cholesterol, more rigid blood vessels, which means less ability to dilate properly and that can increase blood pressure.",

        "Speaking for myself, I try to listen to the ever-changing advice of the nutritionists, but I'd like to decide for myself and I think a lot of other people feel that way, too.",
