        "The idea that Mr. Frieden is going to snatch away our occasional treat, which, believe me, you know, okay, doing this as an occasional treat is probably not going to kill you.",

        "Isn't it the role of a city's health department to look out for people's health in this way?",

        "This was an interesting point.",
        "Mr. Olson, what about that, that folks cannot possibly know everything and so that this is that - those who have that kind of knowledge like Cullin should utilize it for our benefit?",
        "What do you think?",
        "It would probably find its own niche, but I don't think most people would be patrons.",
        "And I also don't think that most of the servers necessarily know better about people's health situations.",

        "You know, like I said, unfortunately a lot of people aren't educated enough about making healthy diet choices in their life, and if it takes the government - I'm not proposing that the government step in and make all our decisions, but clearly there's a health risk here.",

        "I've always been scared of the idea that whoever pays for the health insurance gets to run the lives of the insured, because you see this a bit with employers saying that they're going to fire obese employees or not hire smokers because they don't want to pay the higher premiums.",
        "If that is the price of having the government insure everyone, then maybe we're going to need to reexamine whether that was a good idea.",

        "What do you think motivated the food industry to respond?",
        "Do you think that they looked at what was going on with the smoking ban and decided to get ahead of the argument, or was it responding to consumer demand?",
        "Well, I think it was probably in part consumer demand, but, again, I think it was the FDA requirement that trans fat labeling be on all food products.",
        "And actually, when you talk about what consumers know, at least when it comes to buying food you can now - and I have a label right in front of me, nutrition facts.",
        "And it says: total fat, 13 grams - saturated fat, five - trans fat, 2.",
        "Now, interestingly the American Heart Association, the FDA, the Institute of Medicine, all say that the average American should consume - or the average person should consume two or less grams of trans fat a day.",
        "So this is information that is at this point out there for individuals to read, and if they do look at the labels of the food they buy they can see that.",

        "We're surrounded in our corporation by food scientists, and I work with food scientists everyday and we have that resource.",

        "The other half of the New York regulation - I don't know if you discussed it - is mandatory labeling of how many per slice or per serving.",
        "Again, if you are a national chain and you've got very standardized serving slices, you may be able to get them a number on that and know that it's not going to deviate very much.",
        "If you've got different people slicing the pie and cake every night and, you know, they're whipping it up by hand, you may be off 25-30 percent on how many calories are in it.",
