        "When Nathan Bell, director of research and policy analysis for the Council of Graduate Schools, started sifting through the latest graduate school enrollment numbers...",

        "Most women got their Ph.D.s in public administration, health sciences and education.",

        "The increase in female doctoral graduates is also remarkable because of another trend that Nathan Bell found in his study.",
        "A lot more men than women today are enrolling in graduate school.",
        "First-time male enrollment is up 7 percent compared to just under 5 percent for women, reversing a 10-year trend, says Bell.",
        "And the interesting thing I think that says is that, yes, women did earn the majority of the doctorates, but it does not mean that men have abandoned doctoral education.",
        "There is still interest by men in earning doctoral degrees.",
        "Especially in mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences, where no more than 30 percent of doctoral graduates are women.",
        "In business, about 39 percent of Ph.D.s go to women.",
        "The biggest disparity is in engineering, where 78 percent of doctorates go to men.",
        "But even there, Bell says women have seen gains.",
        "Twenty years ago, women earned about 10 percent of the doctoral degrees in engineering.",
        "Now, they earn 22 percent.",
        "And so while they're still not the majority by any means, they have vastly improved their representation in the field of engineering."
