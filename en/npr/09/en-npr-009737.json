        "The evidence lay out a narrative of how Ivins could have committed the crime.",
        "For example, there was a drying machine that could have helped Ivins dry the anthrax spores and made them lighter before they went into the letters.",
        "Ivins was one of the only people in the lab who knew how to use that machine.",
        "There were lab records that seem to suggest that in 2001, before the letters were sent, Ivins was feverishly working on something.",
        "Here's Taylor again.",
        "In the days leading up to each of the mailings, the documents make clear that Dr. Ivins was working inordinate hours alone at night and on the weekend in the lab where the flask of spores and production equipment were stored.",
        "Ivins's lab badge was pulled in November 2007 as the FBI started closing in.",
        "And then there was the question of the envelopes.",
        "The anthrax was mailed in envelopes that had a printing anomaly.",
        "Taylor said the FBI was able to trace the envelopes to a small number of post offices in the Northeast.",
        "Based on the analysis, we were able to conclude that the envelopes used in the mailings were very likely sold in a post office in the Frederick, Maryland area in 2001.",
        "Dr. Ivins maintained a post office box at the post office in Frederick from which these pre-franked envelopes with print defects were sold.",
        "As investigators laid out their case, it appeared they could link Ivins to both the anthrax and the envelopes.",
        "But the anthrax packages came from New Jersey and Ivins lived in Maryland.",
        "Taylor had an explanation for that too.",
        "Throughout his adult life, Dr. Ivins had frequently driven to other locations to send packages in the mail under assumed names to disguise his identity as the sender.",
        "The strongest forensic evidence they have is from a new science they say they essentially invented for this case.",
        "It is a kind of genetic fingerprinting that allows them to identify the anthrax in the letters more precisely.",
        "They were able to identify what they called the parent material of the anthrax, and that led them to Ivins."
