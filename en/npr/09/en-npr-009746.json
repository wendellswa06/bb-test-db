        "Well, I think there was two things - that she didn't get the support around her that she could have had, but I think that's what we are still looking at our parent as my mother, my father, where, in fact, at some point, you have to just look at them as this being.",
        "Not like a plant or a piece of furniture or a pet or something to just separate these things out because our childhood, you know, dramas and emotions that come up, but they're still very active as for adults.",
        "And I think just what Yvonne is going through is just so common.",
        "I know, though, that there were going to be listeners who feel - and maybe at some point you agree with them on this - who are going to feel, hey, that's the deal.",
        "That's the contracts within a family.",
        "They took care of you.",
        "You take care of them.",

        "In the year 1900, you know, the life expectancy was about 40 in the United States, so everything was different.",
        "You know, now, it's, you know, it's into the - into the 80s, so nobody - were this really interesting, unique time almost of human biology, or because of our lifespans have extended by several decades now.",
        "It kind of rejiggers the whole notion of, you know, kind of marriage, children, family, and caregiving and even financially at some point.",
        "I think many of us - if I am 50, I have two girls, would've put them through college.",
        "I'm actually - our family finances are going to go to cut up the children of the caregiver of my dad (unintelligible).",
        "Sandra, if you're a listener now listening to this program, and you're 91 years old and you're weak and you need the help, what - how do you feel?",
        "What are you supposed to feel about this?",
        "Well, I mean, I think that, for instance, for my father, let me say, if there's a 91-year-old person who's sentient and livid and listening to this, I think that's great.",
        "My father is in a position where he is sort of unbrokerable(ph) about these things.",
        "We have taken - you just wait for your caregiver to get there at 8 in the morning.",
        "No. He'll get on the bus at 7:45 and flee the caregiver.",
        "So I think my father is a particularly irascible person that you can't reason with about things.",
        "But if there's a 91-year-old person who one can reason with through all this, so I think that's kind of wonderful and great.",
        "But some people when they get older like my dad, they just lose more.",
        "They don't want to broker.",
        "They don't want to make any deals.",
        "They don't want to follow any instructions.",
        "And so it's like kind of riding a wild bucking bronco.",
        "So it's not every one - 90-year-old.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I just don't want that sentient person who's 91 listening to this to feel that we're talking about us and them, and they are them and not part of us.",
