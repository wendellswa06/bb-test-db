        "Well, according to the reports, he said that he had a fundamental difference with the board about what the organization should be doing.",

        "There are many others who are doing social service work, and Mr. Gordon wanted to turn the organization's attention to social service work.",

        "And I think it saddens me because, you know, what I appreciate about Bruce Gordon's rising into this position is that we have the best and the brightest, all of that good strategy from corporate America, hopefully, applied to an organization that could benefit from it.",
        "But if they have a fundamental difference about purpose I don't know that this was going to work out.",
        "I think I would have hope that they could have at least come to a point of understanding, let's strategize and put all of his good skills to work around the strategy.",
        "And then, you know, along the way, maybe if he still felt very strongly that there ought to be some other kind of social service work that other organizations are doing, then that will be time to bring it up.",

        "Now Glenn, when Callie mentioned social service, I think more of welfare, which was our first topic today on the show.",
        "But really Bruce Gordon, and I'm not saying that you didn't mean this, Callie, was talking about employment for black men, that was one of his…",

        "And I'm really saddened to see him leave under these conditions.",

        "The fact is that racial discrimination, while it still exists, it is not the huge endemic cancer across all parts of society as it was a hundred years ago when the NAACP was first founded.",
        "The organization needs to recognize that, needs to recognize what the challenges are that are affecting the black community now and go about doing them.",
        "Unfortunately, the other big problem you have is in Julian Bond you've got a chairman who did all he could to, in a sense, almost marginalize not just Bruce Gordon, but Kweisi Mfume before him as well, for throwing out all of these political bombast of attacking Republicans personally, attacking George W.",
        "Bush personally.",
        "And it always seemed like the president, whoever it was at the time, had to then - excuse me, the president of the organization - had to then run around and try cleaning up after Bond's remarks.",
        "I don't think the organization is going to change until Bond is gone.",
        "What about the generational issue?",
        "The NAACP has an average membership age that is definitely at least the same, if not higher, than the AARP's.",
        "What about getting younger people into the mix?",
        "Anyone want to take that on?",
        "Well, I think that's an issue that's across the board for a lot of organizations, not just the NAACP.",
        "But back to the point about if a major issue, and it is, is unemployment of young black men, then it becomes one that has to go to the front of the line for black organizations.",
        "So I would agree with that."

        "But Callie, don't you think if the NAACP focused on the issues of young black men, they might get more of a buy-in from younger African-Americans.",
        "I think that's absolutely correct.",
        "But let's remember, Bruce Gordon was, you know, not 30 years old.",
        "I mean he brought to the table an aggregate experience based on, you know, being a veteran in a different field, but certainly being of the same generation.",
