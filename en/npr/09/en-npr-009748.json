        "And in case you're just tuning in, this is NPR's NEWS & NOTES.",
        "I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "This is our Roundtable.",
        "And boy, have we got news from the South -Selma, Alabama.",
        "I have walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge myself, and it was a big day in Sunday in Selma with two top Democratic presidential candidates in town to speak, vying for the black vote.",
        "Barack Obama was at Brown Chapel AME.",
        "Hillary Clinton was at First Baptist Church.",
        "They marched together to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of Selma's voting rights march.",
        "Now, here is Hillary on the Voting Rights Act yesterday.",
        "The very idea that in the 21st Century, African-Americans would wait in line for 10 hours while whites, in an affluent precinct next to theirs, waited in line for 10 minutes, or that African-Americans would receive flyers telling them the wrong time and date to exercise their constitutional right to vote - that's wrong.",
        "So, Robert, can Hillary out-black Obama in Selma?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's a great question.",
        "No, I don't think she's going to out-black Obama.",
        "And, I mean, she can't even out-black her own husband, so I don't think she's going to be able to do that.",
        "I mean, that was - it was a nice kind of solid speech.",
        "But, I mean, what I think this shows is that even though she is still the frontrunner in terms of the polls, she is reacting as if Obama is in the lead, because he is, in the sense, setting the tone.",
        "He had been invited to give his speech weeks beforehand, and she managed to find another church nearby to invite her to give a speech as well and came down.",
        "And it seemed like she's trying to piggyback on his things.",
        "And in another part of her speech, she sort of thanked, in a sense, the civil rights movement for opening up doors for, you know, women and other groups and so forth.",
        "And while I think that's true, I have - I sometimes wonder whether African-Americans are so thrilled with all of this piggybacking on the civil rights movement, and to see, in many cases, whites and immigrants and gays and so forth almost, you know, leapfrog over them in terms of their social and economic development.",
        "Glenn, what do these political parade say to you?",
        "Well, it reminded me of how momentous was the change that was associated with the Voting Rights Act, and how far we've come.",
        "And that's just worth mentioning here.",
        "Yeah, Hillary Clinton, the inevitable Democratic nominee, now is confronted with the rise of Barack Obama, and, you know, she's scrambling to try to protect her lead."

        "But it was interesting to watch.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, before I go to you, Callie, I have a bonus clip from Barack Obama himself.",
        "Let's take a listen.",
        "They looked at each other, and they decided we know that in the world as it has been, it might not be possible for us to get together and have a chat.",
        "But something's stirring across the country because of what happened in Selma, Alabama, because some folks are willing to march across a bridge.",
        "And so they got together, and Barack Obama, Jr. was born.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "So don't tell me, I don't have a claim on Selma, Alabama.",
        "So, Callie, there - you heard Barack Obama really claiming his African-Americans, although, his father was African and his mother is white.",
        "Was American.",
        "And he also mentioned - a little bit before where we went in on the clip - he also mentioned outright that his mother's family had owned slaves.",
        "I think that was an effort, perhaps, to diffuse this issue which has come up about presidential nominee's families in the past owning slaves.",
        "So is Barack Obama there trying to really deflect to the idea that he is not black enough, which apparently still echoes in some corners of the black community itself?",
        "I have to say it drives me crazy.",
        "I think I just get so angry about hearing that.",
        "I don't - deflect would not be the word that I would use.",
        "I think that he was there to claim what you said about the other part of his legacy.",
        "He was there to claim and to remind people that if you are black in this country and have lived the life that he has, then somebody marched for you.",
        "And you are connected to the larger black African-American community whether or not you were born in Cleveland and your daddy, you know, worked in the factory.",
        "Well, let me ask Tara Wall to jump in here.",
        "Tara, what do you know about this meeting, and was Bruce Gordon the kingmaker?"

        "He talked about the Joshua generation and what it owed to other generations, sort of speaking of his generation in a biblical metaphor.",
