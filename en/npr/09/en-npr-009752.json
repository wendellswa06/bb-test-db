        "Thanks for having us.",
        "Upcoming elections nationwide have garnered a record number of black Republican candidates.",
        "You have a Republican looking to run for governor in the state of Ohio, in the state of Maryland.",
        "Is this a new leaf for Republicans, or is this a fig leaf covering up Republican deficits?",
        "Tara Wall?",
        "Well, it's certainly not a fig leaf, Juan.",
        "I think that this is part of this long-term investment we've been talking about.",
        "There are actually about 53 black GOP candidates that are running this cycle across the country.",
        "I think that's absolutely historic.",
        "And, again, I think it's testament to the fact that we are reaching out.",
        "Our message is resonating in the black community, and I think that it's a positive step in the right direction.",
        "We should embrace this.",
        "Professor Walters, so when we look at a black person running for--well, running for governor in Pennsylvania, like Lynn Swann, are the Republicans simply looking to slightly increase their black turnout while relying on a substantial white base to get their candidate, regardless of color, into power?",
        "I think that that's certainly been the strategy, Juan, and that strategy goes all the way back for several presidential election cycles.",
        "And at one point, of course, I was in the meeting of the Republican convention, Black Caucus, where that strategy, actually, was born.",
        "I think that the--the whole question here of trying to get the black vote really has amounted to a strategy of getting a sliver of the black vote, just enough.",
        "Lynn Swann, for example, if you look at his election prospects in the state of Pennsylvania, 63 percent of the people in an early poll last year said they didn't even know who he was.",
        "So that he's going to run behind and he's going to probably pick up a few votes from people who are maybe football enthusiasts.",
        "But he's not, I think, at the end of the day, going to be a factor.",
        "The increase in the number of black Republicans--I think there's a lot running, and I think that that ought to happen.",
        "The problem, of course, is that nine times out of 10, these candidacies fail because--especially where the African-American community is any size at all, they tend to vote for Democrats, even white Democrats, because the black Republicans have a relatively conservative message which does not comport with the issues of the black community.",
        "That's the bottom line.",
        "And so until you have black Republicans that are able to do what Michael Steele is trying to do in Maryland, which is to split the difference and to get a larger share of just a sliver of the black vote, I think you're not going to have the success for many of these candidacies.",
        "One of the people seeking the Democratic nomination for Senate in that state is Kweisi Mfume, the former head of the NAACP.",
        "In that case, do you expect to see Mfume win a Senate seat as he opposes a white Democrat, most likely Ben Cardin, a member of the Congress right now?",
        "Ron Walters?",
        "Oh, well, that's a very interesting question because Ben Cardin is running as the favorite right now.",
        "Kweisi Mfume, of course, has been complaining that Ben Cardin really is favored by the state Democratic Party.",
        "I think right now what you see in the polls is that Kweisi Mfume has pulled even with Ben Cardin and so the odds-on handicapping in the state right now is that Kweisi Mfume has an opportunity to win.",
        "And if he does win and face Michael Steele, that's going to be one of the most high-profile elections in American political history."

        "I do not see Jesse Jackson.",
        "I do not see the Al Sharptons.",
        "What's going on here, Professor?",
        "Well, I think these are the people really who have run protest demonstrations against the president's policies in Baton Rouge and in Louisiana, and I think that there's a sense which the president's staff probably doesn't want people in these meetings who are that strongly opposed to his policies.",
        "I think on the other hand, what he's trying to do is to carve out a number of more moderate African-American leaders with whom he can have some not only discussion but perhaps some encounters that may turn out to be productive.",
        "And I think that in this sense, what we can say, I think, is that the administration has paid more attention to Katrina, if you look at the bills that have been passed of $46 billion, of $3 billion to build the levees.",
        "And I think that might be a result of that meeting that was held.",
        "So I think that while some people were not in the meeting, it doesn't mean that I think there was not some progress made with the people who were ...(unintelligible).",
        "So it sounds like you're endorsing the president's policy, a little surprise coming from you, Ron Walters.",
        "No, I'm not endorsing it, because I think that there was a lot of consternation about how that meeting got brought together.",
        "Well, tell us.",

        "Well, I think the consternation turned out to be that there were certain people who began to select African-American leaders, and I think that's the problem...",

        "Both.",

        "Let me also say that, you know, I would hardly say that Bruce Gordon agrees with everything that the president says or does.",
        "We need to hear different voices.",
        "You had a very good cross-mix of individuals in this meeting, and the president was genuine and is genuine in his response to what has happened in Katrina, how we can follow up with that, and I think that we ought to give credit where credit is due, no matter if you disagreed with what came out of it or disagreed on certain points.",
        "A large number of money has been spent in helping these folks to rebuild, and we need to move forward in an attitude of not pessimism and continue to--negative snipes about what did or didn't happen at this meeting, but the fact is, he sat down with these leaders.",

        "He is a retired Navy admiral.",
        "He served as the supreme allied commander of NATO in Europe from 2009 to 2013.",
        "He's currently serving as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.",

        "So we now know what course of action the president chose to take in retaliation for the reported chemical attack by Bashar al-Assad.",
        "But we were wondering, what were some of the other options that the president might have had in this situation?",
        "I think he probably had three additional presentations made to him.",
        "One would have been a very heavy strike, which would have been multi-day, multi-access, many more allies, taking a little bit longer to bring more of those NATO countries on board in the operational side, as you were just discussing with Secretary General Stoltenberg.",
        "And that would have been a provocative and starting to lean toward regime change kind of solution.",
        "I'm sure that was presented to him.",
        "I'm glad he did not pick that option.",
        "And then I suspect there was probably a lighter option even than the one we took, which was perhaps using only U.S.",

        "So this isn't the first time that the U.S.",
        "has used force to try and stop the use of chemical weapons in Syria.",
        "Many remember that there was a missile strike last April.",
        "But if the reports of what happened last week are accurate, as the U.S.",
        "and allies obviously believe are accurate, it didn't work.",
        "And I wonder why you think that is.",
        "I mean, why is it that the previous strikes evidently were not enough to discourage further chemical warfare and if you think this one will be?",
        "I think the previous strike simply was not large enough and at scale.",
        "It looked like what it was, which was a very simple signal.",
        "This time, we've gone after actual combat capability.",
        "We've gone after research of chemical weapons, storage of chemical weapons, production of chemical weapons.",
        "So we're upping the ante, but we're doing it carefully, Michel, because we don't want to get into a war with Russia.",
        "That's really weighing on everybody's minds, especially Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis, who's very, very thoughtful.",
        "So I think we'll continue to up the ante if we have to.",
        "Let's hope we don't have to.",
        "But the key next time is going to be to go after transportation and delivery re the Syrian Air Force.",
        "That'll be much more complicated, much more dangerous.",
