        "Yes.",
        "And the expressions are different, and the features - and I wonder if, I mean, it would be impossible to know, but presumably, some of the people working on these statues modeled them on themselves.",
        "Well, and that, of course, is the big mystery because if there are 7,000, which there are believed to be, and of the thousand that they have found, all are different, it is believed that these were modeled after someone, whether the people building them themselves or, you know, whether they had models who were actually part of the emperor's entourage.",

        "And this was an incidence where he could essentially say, you know, here I am taking the high road and trying to box Obama in a little bit, because Obama's Democratic allies are attacking McCain with some very tough language."
