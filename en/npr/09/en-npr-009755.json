        "Hi there.",
        "Hello.",
        "So is it true or not true that, as we just heard Rubio say, there has never been a time when the climate has not changed?",
        "So technically that's true.",
        "The climate has always been changing.",
        "But for various reasons, the current change that we're experiencing now is particularly alarming, and that is because in the history of human civilization, the climate has never changed this rapidly.",
        "And that's really what concerns scientists.",
        "It's not the fact that there is change, but it's the speed of that change.",
        "Has there been a time when the climate was warmer than it is now?",
        "Yes, there has been.",
        "There's been several.",
        "Certainly when the planet was forming, it was incredibly hot here.",
        "But since there's been life on Earth - and one of the most notable in recent periods was about 56 million years ago.",
        "Temperatures were about 11 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than today plus or minus a couple degrees.",
        "Today's global average, for reference, runs around 60 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of a year.",
        "And then back then, it was probably closer to 70 or 73 degrees Fahrenheit."

        "And when the Earth was 11 degrees warmer than it is today, I imagine the continents looked very different than today.",
        "The places where cities are today might not have been places you would have built back then.",
        "That's correct.",
        "So what makes this moment different?",
        "What has happened since industrialization that is a change from what we've seen over the last thousands of years of human existence?",
        "So if you were to walk back about 11,000 years, which is when most research tends to agree that human civilization began, global temperatures were actually really consistent.",
        "And that was great for human civilization.",
        "Most research thinks that because of the stability in our climate, it's allowed things like agriculture to thrive and our civilization to thrive.",
        "And in fact, a study was done a couple of years ago that looked at temperature over the past 11,000 years, and it showed that temperatures climb for a few thousand years, and they kind of leveled off.",
        "And then it started to cool, and we had what's commonly known as the Little Ice Age where temps dropped.",
        "And that lasted about until the 17th century.",
        "And then towards the end of the 17th century, we start to see them rise.",
        "And then we see the Industrial Revolution, and we see temperatures rise quite quickly.",
        "Global temperatures hit this cliff face in just 100 years, and we go from some of the coldest temperatures that human civilization has experienced to some of the hottest.",
        "And you actually need to go back around 125,000 years to find temperatures as high as they are today.",
        "Well, what does that kind of change mean for human civilization?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that's the second part of the question really - is, so what?",
        "Why should we worry about this?",
        "And the reason is really because our entire society is built around the climate that we know and that we've experienced.",
        "And the real question is, what kind of changes are we experiencing today that are going to impact the way we live our lives?",
        "The planet's still going to be here.",
        "The question is, what kind of lives do we want to be living while we're on it?",
        "Rongley stayed in India for five years.",
        "He hated the place, had a terrible time.",
        "But he worked in the industry and he learned what to do and what to avoid.",
        "So in 1999, he moved to Shanghai and two years later he opened a software company.",
        "He calls it Bleum, a made-up name that he says sounds good.",
        "His bet is paying off now.",
        "He says Bleum has done $20 million in business and has 150 employees.",
        "Most of his clients are banks and credit card companies, like Capital One.",
        "You can see pictures of that entourage of warriors Susan Norton was describing at our Web site, npr.org.",
        "And if you're coming to Washington, D.C., between now and the end of March, you can see them in person at the National Geographic Museum."

        "And today, a little more than a century later, Whittier's mayor, Bob Henderson, is hoping history will repeat itself.",
        "Let's say you do 1,000 barrels a day.",
        "You can see that you're talking tremendous amounts of money, between $3 or $4 million and maybe as high as $30 or $40 million."
