        "That's Stephen Cooper, commander of the Criminal Investigation Division for the police department in Midlothian, Texas, outside Dallas.",
        "He's done a lot of sex crime investigations, but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case.",
        "We wouldn't want to have any part of that, given the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social media or who's watched it on TV has turned this on, so any potential witness or victim is, let's say, tainted.",
        "If Cooper did have this case, he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing.",
        "That's because in recent years, police have been moving toward a model called trauma-informed interviewing.",
        "Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard, which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong.",
        "What trauma-informed interviewing is saying - just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying; it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case.",
        "It means keep an open mind and continue the investigation.",
        "That kind of slow, nonconfrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like.",
        "Background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something.",
        "The FBI is just gathering information for a prospective employer, and the standard of proof is lower.",
        "Still, Tom Tremblay says you could do an actual criminal investigation in a case such as Kavanaugh's, assuming the state's statute of limitations allowed it."
