        "One part of it went to the 28th Congressional, the other to the 23rd, and so the Court's basically indicated that the 23rd, which is now Congressman Bonilla's district, was brought down in terms of the number of Latinos and that it violated the Voting Rights Act."

        "This particular decision basically says that you, you know, if you have a minority district that you don't cut back on the number of Latinos in that district and that's what they've done here and that's why it's violated the Voting Rights Act.",
        "And if the legislature decides to do it again, Texas maps have always gone back to the courts, so I would presume that if they redraw it we might go back to the courts again.",
