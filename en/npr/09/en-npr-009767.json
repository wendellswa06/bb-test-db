        "Your only real chance is to break the conventional mode and play defense the whole time.",
        "And one of the things you point out is that playing full-court press all the time requires that your team be in much better shape than the other team, and so you have to run and run and run and then run some more, which is difficult to do.",
        "You add, however, a crucial point.",
        "Not, insurgents work harder than Goliath but their other advantage is that they are willing to do what is socially horrifying.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Give us what - explain to us what you mean there.",
        "Well, very often, you know, the seven conventions that we have in place are - about how battles ought to be fought - are very often based on a sense of what's acceptable.",
        "You know, when - if you look at the history of warfare, when countries first started engaging in guerilla warfare and not wearing uniforms, wearing things that allowed them to kind of blend in with their surroundings, there was an objection made by kind of the dominant powers.",
        "It was considered to be a violation of the ethic of war, right?",
        "Similarly, when Vivek starts playing the full-court press with his 12-year-old girls, the opposing coaches get furious, and that - they scream at the ref and they scream at Vivek.",
        "One of them challenges him to a fight in the parking lot after the game.",
        "There's a sense that they are violating the spirit of basketball by playing this kind of unorthodox, effort-driven style of play, as opposed to letting the girls shoot and pass and execute carefully orchestrated offensive plays.",
        "And that, you know, that is - at every level, when you examine the victories of Davids over Goliaths, you see something that appears shocking, even in the original story of David and Goliath.",
        "Remember, Goliath is disdainful.",
        "More than that, he's horrified by the fact that he's up against this shepherd who is carrying a staff and a slingshot into battle.",
        "Goliath says, that's not what the battle is all about.",
        "The rules of engagement here are that you don armor and carry a sword.",
        "And so even from the beginning in that story, there is a sense that David was breaking the rules, was challenging conventions.",
        "And that is always going to excite some degree of disapproval from the dominant power."

        "There are examples where Goliaths can use unconventional tactics to great success, too.",
        "And you think about the NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo during the Clinton administration, and this was a context where, clearly in terms of military power, the United States and its allies could completely dominate the Serbs if they wanted to but nevertheless, they would be subject to guerilla-types tactics had they gone in on the ground.",
        "The bombing campaign, by contrast, hits the Serbs where they could not fight back.",
        "They were unable to shoot down the aircraft.",
        "They were helpless before this.",
        "And eventually, though many predicted that this would end in failure - no campaign had ever been won by air power alone - this unconventional tactic worked for Goliath.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, it's interesting.",
        "You can see, I mean both sides can obviously choose to challenge convention, and often to extraordinary effect.",
        "It is David, though, the underdog, who has the greatest to gain from that, obviously, because if they don't take some attempt to change strategy, they're almost destined to lose.",
        "That was Vivek Ranadive's initial conclusion - that's why his initial conclusion was with this girl's basketball team, that he had only one chance of winning, whereas had he had a dominant team, he would have had many different strategies he could follow.",
        "There are different ways to win.",
        "The other thing you point out about the important part of the David story, not necessarily that he went into battle without a sword, without armor, with a slingshot and a staff, but what he did immediately as the battle began.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He charges Goliath, right?",
        "This is a part - I think it's an important part of that story.",
        "It's not just that he chooses a different set of weapons that level the playing field between him and a giant.",
        "It's that at the initial moment when he and Goliath sort of walk on to the stage where they're dueling, David runs directly at Goliath.",
        "He speeds up the pace of the encounter, right?",
        "And I think that's a - it's a lovely metaphor for one of the things that Davids always have to do if they are going to defeat favorites, and that is that they have to - I talk about substituting effort for ability - that they have to try harder.",
        "You know, when you look at - I look - I give the example in the piece of Lawrence of Arabia in 1917 in the Middle East, leading the Bedouin tribesmen against the Turks.",
        "One of the things he does that makes that extraordinary upset possible is he dramatically outworks the Turks.",
        "Instead of, you know, they think that they're going to mass for a battle, you know, every couple of months or there'll be some big, climactic engagement, what Lawrence of Arabia does, instead, is attack the Turks on almost a daily basis, traveling 100 miles across the desert in a typical day.",
        "I mean, he uses a degree of effort that was inconceivable to the kind of military powers of the day.",
        "And it utterly stuns the Turks and takes them by surprise.",
        "And it's always when you see David victories, what you see is this -what we think is an insurmountable deficit in terms of ability is offset by the decision to go to these heroic levels of effort."

        "So the importance of getting on the road and marching, time.",

        "I think that geography is the biggest play with David with - and a good example of it is Barack Obama.",
        "Barack Obama was the underdog.",
        "With his campaigns and everything else, three years ago, 2006, nobody thought Barack Obama had a chance.",

        "Why does he play that way?",
        "Because he's Indian.",
