        "Excuse me, I beg to differ because it is his audience, because you've go to get the U.N.",

        "Not just those three nations, that fragile alliance, the old Europe of Britain, France and United States and Germany.",
        "You're certainly entitled to that view, but it was clear the president, as E.R.",
        "said and I think as John intimated, was speaking beyond them directly to the people who would be hearing it.",
        "No, he was speaking to the United States audience.",

        "Well, you know - go ahead, John, then I'm going to bring this point back.",
        "I was just going to say in terms of what's been said and what the tone of it was, I just think it has to be remembered that people who say things like Ahmadinejad says, they mean it.",
        "I think that we have a tendency to think that somehow when they say very threatening things, say, about Israel, that it's all just kind of a bluster.",
        "That they are these colorful foreign people who use language in different ways than we do.",
        "But, no, the fact is that they're saying things that they actually do mean.",
        "And when, for example, the American Jewish Committee has an ad in the Times today saying, you know: If Iran had nuclear missiles, would anyone within its range be safe?",
        "That's an important question.",
        "They mean things just as we do, and so sometimes there might need to be a tone.",
        "We have to respect them as human beings by talking to them as serious people.",
        "Well, you know, to follow up on the point that you raised, Mike Meyers.",
        "If in fact the president was speaking to the American people as you suggest, there's a new poll that's out today - USA Today and Gallup - suggesting that the president has gotten another bump or so in his approval ratings.",
        "Still below 50 percent, but a bump is a bump.",
        "And perhaps there'll be another poll in a few days that will suggest that he got even more of a bump depending upon what the response to this speech was.",
        "But here's the question.",
        "At the same time that poll shows that the American voting public is split on support of Democrats and Republicans running for Congress, 48 percent to 48 percent.",
        "So how do you see this speech, if it directed at the American public, affecting that?",
        "I just like the old sword swinging."

        "This is a situation where he is using every opportunity he can to scare people, to use the terror scare.",
        "We have gone from the land of the free and the home of the brave to the land of the gullible and the knee-jerk to the home of the scared.",

        "Well, okay.",

        "But the thing that people have to remember is that a poll reflects a moment in time, the moment when the poll was taken.",
        "And it also reflects the views of people who may not be telling the truth because they're saying what they think the polltaker wants to hear.",
        "So whatever his numbers were a week or so ago may not be the same as next week or next month.",
        "And this poll you're referring to came around the time of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 and a few other things.",
        "So people might've been thinking more about the fact that he's the commander-in-chief at a time, that Michael did allude to, when people are more afraid, more cautious.",

        "As we know, Academy Award-winning actress Mira Sorvino helped lead a rally of about 20,000 people in New York City's Central Park on Sunday to protest violence in Darfur, the latest in the push of celebrities who are speaking out - George Clooney among them.",
        "On Monday we caught up with actor Don Cheadle at a charity event, and he shared his thoughts on why countries are not doing more to aid Darfur.",
        "For one, it's happening very far away and we cannot see the effects of their deaths on our lives, day to day.",
        "We have compartmentalized ourselves enough, I think, to where we can see something like that happen and bemoan it, and say it's terrible, but we still get on with our lives day to day.",
        "I think if it were someone in your family, I think if it was your neighbors, I think if somehow we felt that we were going to be personally threatened by it, then you would see people act.",
        "But we're sort of anesthetized right now, and it takes something very dramatic to people to get them to react."

        "The fact that they're being killed - with the equivalent of the N-word being used - kind of doesn't come through, and it seems so abstract.",
        "But one thing that does strike me, and there's all sorts of blame to be left here on Darfur, is that, yes, it's far away.",
        "Yes, it's an awful lot of people.",
        "Yes it's hard to conceive of it.",
        "But I am quite convinced that if the people who were raping and killing and burning all of these people were white instead of brown and black themselves, then not a soul would have been harmed in Darfur over the past year.",
