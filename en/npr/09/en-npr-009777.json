        "Why does the Trump administration have an interest in placating the Turkish government at all right now?",
        "Well, it started I think with Mike Flynn establishing a business connection with this Turkish gentleman who, it turns out, was working on behalf of the Turkish government.",
        "And I think Trump has some business interests in Turkey, and he wanted from the get-go to have good relations with Turkey's strongman, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
        "There was an ongoing relationship, and some people close to Erdogan convinced Erdogan that Trump would be a better choice than Hillary Clinton, who obviously was not perceived as someone who would take a new approach to the Fethullah Gulen issue or to the other big problem that Turkey has with the United States, which is support for the Syrian Kurds in the fight against ISIS.",

        "However, it has been two years since the first demand was made.",
        "And I think there is diminishing hopes that this will ever happen.",
        "This is why I think Turkey now is after a longer list of 80 people who are linked to the Gulen movement and their extradition as an alternative to Fethullah Gulen.",
