        "So, the cease-fire was put in place so that these elections go off peacefully, and then the army would resume its offensive.",
        "Now, that still has to be seen, but I think one reason for this very severe reaction by this Pakistani government has been possibly that the Pakistanis may have told the Americans that look, the cease-fire is only in place for a few days, just for these elections, don't get worked up, we'll resume the offensive after the elections.",

        "The state of California is waiving fees to encourage oil producers to get their idle wells pumping.",
