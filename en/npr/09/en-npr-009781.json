        "As you look at American foreign policy, the resources devoted to this a lot of - well, certainly some - Barack Obama has said that the war in Afghanistan has been slighted by the diversion, as he calls it, by the war in Iraq.",
        "Nevertheless, as you suggest, both presidential candidates seems to now suggest that we need to focus a great deal more on Afghanistan.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "But I mean, I think, the U.S.",
        "is equally concerned about the advances made by the Pakistani-Taliban in Pakistan because obviously, this is increasing the territory under their control, it's increasing the ability ofal -Qaeda to operate freely in so-called Taliban-controlled territory, it will allow more foreigners to come in and to receive training.There're already very strong reports both from the Americans and NATO, and from the Pakistani military, that a lot of Arabs have come in over the last few months from Iraq.",
        "The word in Iraq is thatal-Qaeda has lost the battle in Iraq and that…",
        "Ahmed Rashid, I'm afraid we're going to leave it there.",
        "But thank you so much for your time.",
        "We'll let you get to bed.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Ahmed Rashid, his latest book, \"\"Descent Into Chaos.\"\" This is NPR News.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "This is Talk of the Nation, I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "It's not yet clear who the U.S.",
        "military targeted yesterday in its reported raid across the border into Pakistan but the area, a mountainous region controlled by local tribes along the Afghan border, is considered one of the likely hiding spots for Osama bin Laden and other top leaders of al-Qaeda.",
        "Today, we're talking about the hunt for Bin Laden, seven years after 9/11.",
        "Are Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda still the number one priority for you?",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "Peter Bergen is with us, a journalist, senior fellow at the New America Foundation.",
        "His most recent book, \"\"The Osama Bin Laden I Know: An Oral History ofal-Qaeda's leader.\"\" And Peter, a lot of people say, Osama bin Laden isn't relevant anymore, just an icon.",
        "Well, I think that's a stretch.",
        "I think he still provides broad strategic control to, not only al-Qaeda, but also people operating in the name of al-Qaeda.",
        "So, for instance, he's called for attacks in Pakistan the last year.",
        "One of the reasons we're seeing all these attacks in Pakistan is because of that call.",
        "So the influx also of Arabs, as Ahmed Rashid described them, into the tribal areas of Pakistan over the past several months, that's an indication, too, that these training areas are open for business.",
        "It's also an indication though, Neal, of al-Qaeda in Iraq suffering really quite a major defeat, sort of - because of its own actions in Iraq, alienating the Sunni population.",
        "And I've talked to European counter-terrorism officials who say that the numbers of Europeans going to Iraq, which would have been dozens here and there in 2006, has dropped to zero now, and those people are now going to Afghanistan and Pakistan."

        "Mike, calling from Mystic in Connecticut.",
        "Hello.",
        "It's good to talk to you guys.",
        "My major concern about Osama bin Laden is not that he's out there.",
        "It's that we've been going after him for so long and we need to really, really - we're entering into a new administration, whether it's going to be a McCain administration or an Obama administration, it really doesn't matter, we need to have open dialog and open diplomacy with these Mideast countries because Obama, really, is an icon in my opinion, and we need to keep our nation safe but we don't need to be blazing - be seen as blazing guns all over the place.",
        "Yet, Senator Obama has talked openly about if he saw targets of opportunity in Pakistan, he would not hesitate to attack al-Qaeda targets there.",
        "I don't know if that's the same though.",
        "Attacking open al-Qaeda targets in Pakistan isn't the same as having an aura about you that means that you're just going to go off, you know, bombing and shooting everything in sight, and taking over nations.",
        "Peter Bergen?",
        "Well, both Senator Obama and Senator McCain actually seem to have a very similar view about Afghanistan.",
        "For instance, they both called for two or three brigades more, i.e., up to 10,000 more American boots on the ground.",
        "So, you know, whatever their aura is, the fact is that the policies on this issue are not dissimilar.",
        "Of course, there is a problem if you keep a lot of American boots on the ground in Iraq, you can't magically produce them in Afghanistan.",
        "But with that caveat, both candidates understand that this situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has really got significantly worse in the last year or so and that there need to be a rethink about everything we're doing there.",
        "Mike, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And Peter, as the focus returns to Afghanistan, how much worse is the situation?",
        "We keep hearing these reports of large-scale Taliban attacks on American bases.",
        "This would have been unheard of a couple of years ago.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you're referring to an attack that happened back when I was in Afghanistan in July, where Taliban overran an American base, killed nine American soldiers in a, sort of, direct attack.",
        "That's unusual, but more broadly, you know, violence has gone up 40 percent in the last several months in the east of Afghanistan, we've seen - ten French soldiers were killed just 30 miles outside of Kabul in the last few weeks, and the Taliban are trying to encircle Kabul and cut it off.",
        "Now, they're never going to be able to do that, but they are certainly operating pretty close to the capital in a way that would not have been true even a year ago."

        "Hi.",
        "I would just like to say that Bin Laden is - definitely should be a priority of every American, considering that we were attacked by Bin Laden on our soil.",
        "And ifanyone's thinking that in the last seven years, they're just sitting back on their laurels thinking that they did a great job and not planning further attacks, really - isn't in reality what's happening.",
        "And as a side note, my brother is in the military.",

        "Peter Bergen, though, a lot of people would say that, well, there's been no attack on American soil since 9/11.",
        "There's been no attack in Europe since the London bombings, that Osama bin Laden andal-Qaeda don't represent the same kind of threat they did seven years ago.",
        "(Soundbite of archived recording)",
        "Well, I think that's true.",
        "I don't think they represent the same kind of threat, obviously, that they did on September 11th.",
        "I mean, the American public is more vigilant, the American-Muslim community has rejected the al-Qaeda ideas, al-Qaeda doesn't appear to have sleeper cells here, and it's very hard to get terrorists in the country.",
        "So if you can't get people in, you don't have people in the country, it's very hard to carry out attacks.",
        "However, that being said, if you remember the planes plot of the summer of 2006, Neal, in London, the plan to bring down seven American, Canadian and British airliners with liquid explosives.",
        "If that had succeeded, that would have been 1,500 Americans and Canadians and Brits dead, and we'd be having quite a different conversation in terms of, isal-Qaeda a threat or not, since that was an al -Qaeda-directed plot.",
        "They are weaker than they've been in the past.",
        "They are regaining strength on the Afghan-Pakistan border, you can't count them out.",
        "Their threat, I think, directly to the United States is relatively low, but their ability, for instance, to do a mass-casualty attack on Americans outside the United States remains pretty high.",

        "I'm stationed at Fort Bragg, and splitting my time between Fort Bragg and FortBenning .",
        "I'm an army officer.",
        "I've served both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I've got to come down fairly hard on the line that the disruption ofal -Qaeda is still a significant priority to American security.",
        "While I would disagree with your previous caller that the kill or capture of Osama Bin Laden isn't necessarily as high of a priority, it would do significant things for American conscience, American ego, American mental health, perhaps.",
        "But as far as the disruption ofal-Qaeda, the cellular nature of such an organization, the decapitation really doesn't disrupt that cell to any great extent.",
        "Now, as far as Mr. Bergen was saying, I do agree that al-Qaeda's ability to target Americans here in America has been degraded.",
        "However, we have seen that in Afghanistan and other places that their ability to attack has actually increased.",
        "Several years ago, about three or four years ago, you would see, at most, about 10- to 15-man-sized elements ofal -Qaeda and Taliban incursions into Afghanistan, and then, about the time that I was in Afghanistan in 2006 and 2007, we saw that the size of those forces jumped up to about 200 people.",
        "So, their ability to reorganize - and they're using these Pakistani provinces and states to reorganize and really strengthen their numbers so that they can come in force across the border and attack Americans andAfghanis, and other NATO allies there.",
        "Andrew, let me ask you, the men that you command - if you're a lieutenant, you're with a platoon, I assume, and that's a fairly small unit, and you get to know them pretty well - those guys, are they still as motivated to go after Osama as they were when you were there last time do you think?",
        "Well, Neal, I'm not so certain about that.",
        "I'm actually a captain now.",
        "I've moved on out of the platoon leader stage, but while I was there - both in Iraq and Afghanistan, I was a platoon leader -and while we were there, we started to feel the dragging down.",
        "And I think that we talk about information operations being a significant portion of the military psyche.",
        "So, I think that a victory with regards to Osama bin Laden and the ability to capture him would actually boost themilitary's psyche and their morale in terms of going after some of these other harder missions - including a lot of the humanitarian side of things that we don't hear a whole lot about, of building bridges and wells, and clinics - that we are doing in Afghanistan.",
        "And those types of things really start to wear on the military in terms of not being - feeling a little bit ineffective, not being able to pursue the enemy as much because you're diverting your attention to a lot of this nation-building, for lack of any better term.",
        "So that scene is a diversion from the - what really ought to be the mission?",
        "To a lot of soldiers it is, as you start - I think the senior military commanders and then down into a lot of these special forces, they start to realize that that is significantly more important in that as you build these relations, you decrease the likelihood of extremists and Taliban forces attacking.",
        "Andrew, thanks very much.",
        "Andrew calling us from Fort Bragg, which is the home of the U.S.",
        "Special Forces, and we appreciate the phone call.",
        "And good luck to you.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "Okay.",
        "And one of the things he was talking about - is Osama bin Laden at this point just a symbolic leader?",

        "Bin Laden is still giving strategic guidance.",
        "Whenal -Qaeda gets involved in an operation as in the London attacks of July 7, 2005, which was the biggest terrorist attack in British history, you know, the leaderless jihad becomes effective when they hook up withal -Qaeda central and get training.",

        "The people -al -Qaeda in Iraq was self-financing, most of the suicide attackers who came brought their own money, gave it to the organization, the foreign fighters.",
        "So, these operations don't require a great deal of money.",
        "Running an insurgency, however, does require money.",

        "And I am wondering if - what kind of attempt we have been making to try to calm that down, and if we've had any kind of success in doing that?",
        "I know themadrasas have been a breeding ground of a lot of that and a lot of the countries are going to try to get some of that under control.",
        "And I am just curious if any of that has ever been done.",
        "Well, you know, I mean, the United States - the First Amendment - I think it's very difficult for the United States to be get involved in telling people what to think and how, even if we disagree with their ideas.",
        "I mean, our whole culture is based on the idea that we don't do that.",
        "So, as a general proposition, I am opposed to the idea of the United States going around telling people what to think or what to watch or what not to watch.",
        "I guess my question is, we just don't hear about it much here in the United States anymore as far as the recruitment.",
        "And you know, they just said millions of the young people in the Islamic world were rallying toal-Qaeda and anti-American causes, and we just don't hear about it here in the States anymore, or at least I don't, here in Louisville.",
        "So, I am curious if that's still the case, if there's still that many people.",
        "And also, when you said thatthere're no sleeper cells here in America, you know, our southern border is so wide open I can't imagine that some of the people, al-Qaeda people, aren't coming across that border and just waiting for a chance.",
        "Well, I can't prove negatives to you, but if al-Qaeda sleeper cells exist, they're so asleep, they're comatose or dead.",
        "They've done nothing.",
