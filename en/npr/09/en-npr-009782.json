        "On Joe's other point though, public opinion polls in the Arab world show that al-Qaeda and its ideology are increasingly less popular.",
        "Indeed, Neal.",
        "I mean - and that's human nature.",
        "Because when the bombs go off in another country, you don't care about it, but when they start going off on your own doorstep - it took 9/11 for the United States to wake up for this problem.",
        "So, when the bomb started going off in Iraq,al-Qaeda lost popularity.",
        "When the beheadings, the suicide attacks, etcetera, the bombs starting going off in Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia started losing popularity.",
        "Support for suicide bombing in Pakistan has dropped from 33 percent five years ago to eight percent now.",
        "So, you know, that is reality and that's in the long- term, this is - that's very damaging toal-Qaeda's ability to continue to recruit.",
        "But, you know, the caveat there is small groups of people can influence history.",
        "Look at the Brigate Rossi or the Baader-Meinhof gangs in the 70s in Italy and Germany.",
        "These were very small terrorist groups with zero popular support, yet they conflicted a great deal of damage on Germany and Italy.",
        "So, even asal-Qaeda's popularity wanes, that doesn't mean they're out of business.",
        "Joe, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And the other thing is, what about the targets of al-Qaeda?",
        "As we've looked at their inability to mount successful attacks in western Europe and the United States, we have seen though, continued attacks in other places, obviously, Iraq has been a - from their point of view - a disappointment but there have been others as well.",
        "Well, I mean, you know, obviously, the Iraq playbook was imported to Afghanistan.",
        "You go back to 2003, there are one or two suicide attacks in Afghanistan.",
        "Last year, there were 140.",
        "So, the tactics and ideology thatal-Qaeda was involved in in Iraq have migrated to Afghanistan.",
        "We're also seeing in Pakistan, there were 60 suicide attacks last year, which is more suicide attacks in one year than they've had in their entire history.",
        "So, while they may not be able to attack in Western Europe or the United States - although it's easier for them to attack in Western Europe, the United States is a harder target.",
        "But, you know, clearly, mounting a suicide operation in Pakistan is very easy for these groups.",
        "We've seen them happen every week.",
        "And what about targets in the Arab world?",
        "There was a great threat in Saudi Arabia, for example.",
        "Well - and that has reduced a little bit in Saudi Arabia, but you may recall the attacks in Egypt on the Taba Hilton which killed a number of people.",
        "The attacks in the Sinai and the Red Sea resorts, we've seen an attack in Jordan that killed 60 at American-owned hotels in 2005.",
        "So, they continue to have an ability to do these kinds of attacks in the Middle East.",
        "Peter Bergen is with us.",

        "Yes.",

        "I mean, what looked like a model victory may become a model defeat if we don't get our act together in Afghanistan.",
