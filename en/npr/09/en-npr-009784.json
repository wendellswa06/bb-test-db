        "Yes.",
        "That's a beautiful summary.",
        "Couldn't have said it better myself, and apparently I wasn't saying it better myself.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We should point out that two names have come out, including a fairly important public official who resigned.",
        "Yes.",
        "And this fellow, in a previous incarnation, was one of the first AIDS czars, and part of his - part of the policy of any country seeking to get American aid is their AIDS prevention program was to take - assume an anti-prostitution stance.",
        "Of course this hypocrisy is delicious down the road when were saying that this fellow, for all intents and purposes, all but admitted by default and resignation that he has procured some services of prostitution himself.",
        "So that adds a little bit of a ha-ha factor for the poor boy, but that's the risk you take.",
        "You know, being a client of an escort service is just as much as a risk-laden endeavor as being an escort itself, so you can't assume that it's not going to have some blowback somewhere down the road.",
        "Let's see if we can get some callers in on this conversation.",
        "Again, we're talking with Lily Burana.",
        "She's with us from our bureau in New York, author of the memoir \"\"Strip City: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across America,\"\" and the author of an op-ed that appeared yesterday in the Washington Post.",
        "Giles is on the line, Giles calling us from Wilmington, North Carolina.",
        "Yes, and I wanted to say that one of the reasons these scandals in Washington get so big is that people seem to decide the candidates are gods when they are elect - are gods when they elect them.",
        "And once they get in office, same thing, and of course the whole administration helps or, you know, staff helps just continue, like this Roosevelt not standing up, you know, sitting at a desk.",
        "Right.",
        "You - in your piece, Lily Burana, you talk about the complicity of the press in keeping these scandals relatively quiet until the relatively recent times.",
        "Yes.",
        "I do believe that when the - one of the interesting side effects of free love - when sexual information became much more part of the public dialogue in the 1960s, the press took that to heart, and it became much more invested in the personal lives matching the political stance of people who worked in politics and policy makers."

        "So I think that the hagiography of the American politician continues.",
        "We do prefer to have this illusion that they are morally spotless, that they are morally consistent at all times.",
        "And time and time again, we see that this simply is not true.",
        "Well, one of the reasons we believe that is because they tell us that.",

        "Yes.",
        "And I just have one more thing to say.",
        "Go ahead, Giles.",
        "This gets partisan sometimes, of course, and when Clinton was being just, you know, beaten into the dirt with the Monica Lewinsky thing, I kept saying that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones.",
        "And look at all the people that were gone from Washington - you know, Gingrich and all the other people - and Clinton was still there, because they threw stones at the man and they were just as human as he was.",
        "Well, it's another quote, perhaps going back to Machiavelli - if you're going to strike at the prince, be sure you're going to get him.",
        "And he survived, so that may have been the problem, but thanks very for the call, Giles.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And he joins us now from our bureau in New York.",
        "And nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.",
        "I'm not a person who reads celebrity tabloids.",
        "I don't particularly care in the hijinks of the fancy, beautiful people who are incredibly rich and, you know, we see them all the time and therefore become somewhat over familiar.",
        "However, when you see somebody sort of hoisted on their own petard, it's very difficult to look away.",
        "So let me not pretend that I am somehow removed from this and just go puh-puh.",
        "I can't possibly imagine why somebody would find this fascinating, because I - count me among the people who are - got my eyeballs peeled on this one."

        "Hi.",

        "Now, maybe they are so very important that some heavy thumbs have come down from the White House to the Capitol and it said you must not report the story.",
        "And didn't we see something similar maybe with a \"\"60 Minutes\"\" story some time ago?",
        "I don't remember exactly what it just about was.",
        "So I don't really have a question, just that comment.",
        "What do you think, Lily?",
        "I think it's sort of have a healthy cynicism, wondering if we're ever getting the full story on anything, and that's just part of the temper of the times.",
        "It's - we do wonder how much control forces in Washington, forces elsewhere, forces in big business, have over what gets disclosed and when.",
        "And certainly there are some cases that are pushed absolutely to the fore in a way that seems almost astonishing and out of scale; and others that sort of go poof without any kind - leaving any kind of wake whatsoever.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So I don't think it's out of line for somebody to wonder what the real story is and to also a little bit skeptical about the fact that what they say we're getting is really the whole truth.",

        "And it's interesting - you were talking about earlier the, you know, how times have changed and as sexual information became far more freely discussed, nevertheless, a politician caught in a sex scandal is just as vulnerable to defeat and disgrace as ever; the case of Mr. Ryan, the politician in Illinois.",
        "Yes.",
        "What we're seeing is politicians who have not actually broken any laws but have done things that, in terms of popular opinion, might be considered bad taste but certainly not illegal.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "tangentially.",

        "It'll be out in the National Inquirer or the tabloids, but mainstream media still kind of keeps everything underground.",
        "Steve, I would not want to impugn the reputation of another journalistic outlet, but the National Inquirer, its record is not spotless.",
        "Ah, but its reporters do a very good job.",
        "I was interviewed by the National (unintelligible) Roger Stone affair, he and his wife; the scandal came out about the time when the Clinton scandals did, and they did a very good job of reporting.",
        "However, the Washington Post interviewed me and cut off the story.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, do you think, Lily Burana, that the big-time media and particularly in this town, the big local paper, the Washington Post, tends to bury these stories?",
        "Well, the question that I have for our caller, which is a sincere question, which is what scope of scandal are we talking about?",
        "Are we talking about laws being broken or people just doing kinky stuff or - I mean, there may also sort of be some parameters set, not so much in terms of do we bury versus not bury, which is speculation on anybody's part.",
        "But whether it's newsworthy or not, if it's simply a matter of somebody doing something that's a little far out but isn't necessarily inconsistent with their personal politics or is not illegal, maybe they just feel it's nobody's business."
