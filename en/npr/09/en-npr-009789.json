        "And it's really quite tragic.",
        "For example, I recently had a victim of an attempted murder.",
        "He had three gunshot wounds, but he himself was a parolee.",
        "And because of that, he refused to testify against the person who shot him and tried to kill him because he would be classified as a snitch in prison.",
        "Yeah, and seeing cases like this multiple times, I'm just saddened by the prospect of his life on the outside.",

        "To break that cycle, you need to educate people and give them opportunities.",
        "So you can't expect someone to change their colors when they're released back to society, but they don't have any opportunities in housing, in employment, in social programs.",
        "The stuff is just not there to assist with the transition.",
        "Jane, I think California is one of the states where such programs have been cut back over the years.",
        "Is that a problem, do you think?",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "I would certainly agree on that.",
