        "First of all, the implements of Woody on him.",

        "Well, the documentary that this caller just referred to, I saw some of it, too, that just recently aired on some public stations done by Martin Scorsese, really showed that influence that Woody Guthrie had on Bob Dylan.",

        "My grandfather was Caruso's personal physician in New York.",
        "And in 1917, Caruso drew a caricature in black and white, a sketch that I still have here in my home; Caruso drew it of my grandfather.",
        "I'm wondering, first of all, did you know that Caruso had that talent?--because it's a wonderful sketch--and did you find that other people whose principal talent was known to folks had other hidden talents that they were equally good at?",
        "I'm sure they were, but you pointed out something very good.",
        "He was a wonderful cartoonist, a caricaturist.",
        "He had that--there are several others that I can't think of at the moment I'm sure who had similar qualities of cartooning and drawing.",
        "But Caruso's one of the best cases in point, and so there you are.",
        "Here's someone very close.",

        "They were right out of Scripture, Old and New Testament.",

        "Is there one you can think of?",
        "Well, there are so many.",

        "And people think of Callas as the great Fioretta in \"\"Traviata,\"\" and she was--but not better than Muzio, who sang at the Opera Company in Chicago a couple of times.",
        "Muzio, in the opera, is dying.",
        "The courtesan is reading a letter of apology from the rich guy whose son was in love with her, and she was in love with--she was a courtesan, and he says the son has to leave her 'cause she'll ruin the family's name.",
        "And she reads the letter of apology from the old man, and then she starts singing the song, \"\"Addio, del passato,\"\" \"\"Farewell, Then, Forever.\"\" As she reads that letter in Italian, you think Eleanora Duse, the greatest of all actresses, was doing it.",
        "That to me is one of the high moments ever for me."
