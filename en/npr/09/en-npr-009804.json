        "Seventeen men were arrested and taken out and executed, and the people who carried this out were wearing Iraqi national guard uniforms and driving government-issued vehicles.",
        "What is the thinking there when something like this happens?",
        "Might these be government national guardsmen taking revenge on Sunnis, or do people think these are just terrorists who've stolen these items?",
        "I think--and in this case, the additional information, the victims in that case were actually Shiites in a Sunni neighborhood.",
        "Whether or not these people were ING--one would certainly hope that they were not ING, but it's causing a lot of stress and a lot of confusion for ordinary people because people show up at your house wearing uniforms in official cars, they tell you you're under arrest and they end up assassinated just minutes later.",

        "That's why these attacks came as such a shock.",
        "But what has been happening generally was a lot of recovering and healing from the terrible bridge stampede that killed a thousand people and then also working on getting the final touches to the constitution.",
        "They say they've sent the final draft of the constitution to the UN for printing.",
        "Again, that could have played a role in these attacks because the Sunni Arabs in Iraq are still very opposed to much of--many of the provisions in the constitution, and a lot of their concerns were not addressed in the negotiations and now apparently won't be.",
        "So the fact that the constitution is now heading for this October 15th referendum and was really finalized today might also have been a factor in the violence.",
