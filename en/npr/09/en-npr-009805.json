        "But you know, just the symbolic importance that we are able to choose between people who had historically represented the disenfranchised and even the non-citizen is significant to us.",

        "Well, I think its been brewing for a while.",
        "I mean the notion that circumcision could actually make a big difference in reducing the number of HIV infections, especially in high incidents countries such as in sub-Saharan Africa has a lot of evidence there.",
        "It's not clinching kind of evidence.",
        "It's based upon the observations that parts of Africa that have low rates of circumcision have high rates of HIV, like east Africa.",
        "Other parts that have high circumcision rates have lower rates of HIV.",
        "And then last year there was a study that came out of South Africa in which they randomly assigned men to be either circumcised or not, and then they followed them for a couple of years.",
        "The ones who were circumcised had like 60 percent fewer HIV infections.",
        "And so now there are a couple of studies being done in Kenya and Uganda to see if that can be duplicated.",
        "There are a lot of people in the public health community and, you know, some of the big leaders who are talking as though they think it's going to come out positive, and therefore they're gearing up to do a circumcision campaign in Africa.",
        "But you don't want - there are a lot of ifs here.",
        "One is if it actually would be successful in telling enough people or getting enough people to be circumcised, and I guess you'd be starting with children, newborns first?",
        "Well, it's - I don't think any - the strategy's not written yet.",
        "I think that the idea would be to start with adult men who are now transmitting the virus, and hope that you can interdict that.",
        "It's - surprisingly, there were a couple of stories that came out of Toronto that indicated there was this pilot project to see how acceptable circumcision would be to adult men in Africa - one in Zambia, one in Swaziland.",
        "And there was a great demand for it.",
        "I mean even before they'd done any social marketing or anything, men were lining up and they had to turn them away.",

        "Of course, there are - that fits into a more general, broader issue of prevention that was talked about at the meeting.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "In fact, there was a lot of emphasis.",
        "One of the major themes of this year's conference was prevention and trying to find new methods of prevention.",
        "You know, the last three AIDS conferences, beginning in '96 - and they happen every other year these days - have been about treatment.",
        "And that's understandable because, you know, ten years ago, there was this revelation that you could actually control HIV infection and transform it from a, you know, a death sentence into a chronic disease.",
        "So then that put enormous pressure on to get treatment out to parts of the world where people were just dying in great numbers.",
        "We can come back to that.",

        "It was the 22nd of May when they beat the Indiana Pacers to begin that series.",
        "That was their last back-to-back win, so perhaps that's more salient in recent point.",
