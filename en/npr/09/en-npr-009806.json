        "They've been outscored by a lot in this series when both those guys are on the floor.",
        "When its LeBron alone, has more room to operate, the Heat have outscored the Spurs.",
        "But LeBron James in Game 6, took over and if Heat win this series, will all the criticism that he is scared or soft or tentative, will all that go way?",
        "He will never be indemnified because the answer to this was, yes.",
        "Last year, if he wins the title will he get a free pass?",
        "There is just something about LeBron James.",
        "Maybe it was that one bad media spectacle that left a taste in people's mouths.",
