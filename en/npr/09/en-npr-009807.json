        "As soon as people figured out the link between Komen and Planned Parenthood - that there was a funding link there - Lifeway pulled all of the Bibles off the shelves; stopped selling them immediately.",

        "There are five trials under way with different candidates.",

        "The vaccines that are in wide scale, so-called phase III trials out there in the real world right now, are not expected to be very effective, frankly, because they only target one of the two parts of the immune system."
