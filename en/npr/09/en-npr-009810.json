        "Many economists have different views on that.",
        "But I think when you mentioned 700 to $800 billion, that is certainly the ballpark in which we are now talking.",
        "The components of that will be, first of all, it's critical that we get this economy moving and create jobs, but we need to help those who have been hurt by this economy, make sure that unemployment insurance is available, make sure that food stamps are available to people.",

        "But the fact is that almost everybody believes that it needs to be a very substantial number.",
        "And I think the 700 to $800 billion is probably where we're going to be, which is deemed by almost all the economists I talk to, to be a sum necessary if we're going to have the positive effect on the economy that this is designed to do.",
        "Congressman Hoyer, it seems that it wasn't all that long ago that the big debate on Capitol Hill seemed to center around balancing the budget or deficit reduction.",
        "As you well know, the numbers in the deficit just keep growing and growing and growing.",
        "Is there any hope that you might be able to sort of chip away at that deficit or hope to get close to balancing the budget within an Obama term?",
        "Michele, I think balancing the budget within the next four years, frankly, is not fiscally possible.",
        "Every economist understands that we're going to go into deeper debt in the short term to try to get this economy moving.",
        "And if we don't get the economy moving, the debt is going to get deeper simply because revenues are going to plummet and our economy is going to slow down even further.",
        "So, frankly, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.",
        "So we need to incur this debt.",
        "But we are very focused on, in the medium term and long term, making sure that we get back to fiscal balance."
