        "Her book is called \"\"Parenting Inc.\"\" She says spending a lot on children isn't just unnecessary, it can often be counterproductive.",
        "You can read an excerpt from her book \"\"Parenting Inc.\"\" at our Web site @npr.org/talk.",
        "And we want to hear from you.",
        "Have you felt pressured to outfit your baby in Burberry shoes or thousand-dollar strollers?",

        "Michael, calling from Davis in California.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hello.",
        "I just wanted to call and defend, not so much of the stuff, but baby signs in particular.",
        "I've actually worked at the Child Development Center, where the psychologist, one of the psychologists who developed baby signs, tested it out.",
        "And I found that it was very useful in reducing frustrations like, you know, the author was saying for babies, but also for parents; very helpful in getting what it is that your child really wants, so that you're not as frustrated, which is something that all parents deal with quite a bit.",
        "Pamela Paul, I know you looked into it a little bit and came - found some other conclusions that said the record on teaching children American Sign Language was mixed at best.",
        "Yeah, mixed at best.",
        "I mean, there are, obviously for children that hearing impaired or otherwise have, you know, learning challenges, there can be benefits.",
        "But for children who are, you know, fully healthy, and have full-hearing ability, there really are minimal benefits.",
        "And, you know, I - look, I understand, I have two kids under three, so I understand parents' need to minimize frustration.",
        "But, you know, part of me just thinks, well, you know, raising kids is difficult, it's messy, it's tough, they get hurt, it's hard.",
        "And, you know, yes, you want to minimize them a bit, but a lot of it is just, you know, part of the job.",
        "And I don't think that classes, most classes, and products are really the thing to eliminate that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I understand what you're saying, you know?",
        "This is definitely a part of the job.",
        "I think, especially, the classes are a little bit much.",
        "If you're interested in it, you know, a simple book on baby signs or something like that is much easier and not expensive.",
        "Yes, although, you know, all the research that's out there that shows benefits, which also in fact are disputable - but the research that does show the benefits is all on with parents who were especially trained to teach baby sign language.",
        "And there's no research that shows that parents who've been trained by books or DVDs has been able to…",
        "Aha.",
        "…get, you know, some of the alleged benefits from baby signing."

        "In fact, I think, actually, a lot of them are pretty useful, and I think the money is better spent.",
        "I mean, you better spent spending $300 to have a sleeping coach to help you and your entire family get some sleep for a full year than you are spending $3,000 on a crib, you know, in which your baby is just going to cry, you know, for hours on end.",

        "Well, you know, I've got to say, after the 1st birthday of - for my older daughter, we eliminated birthday presents.",
        "I think one great idea is a book exchange where people, you know, everyone brings a book and everybody, you know, gift wraps and every child goes home with a new book, or even you know, a book from your collection.",
        "But I really think that in terms of toys that the best thing is toys that are 90 percent child, 10 percent toys.",
