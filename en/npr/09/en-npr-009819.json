        "And let me go to the other end of the economic equation and - which you point out at the beginning of your book, a lot of parents now have to sit down and decide whether they can afford a child.",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "I mean, when I talk to parents, they are making that decision for the first and the second child, you know, never mind, let alone that the third child, which is sort of seen as this luxury height based on how much money they make.",

        "Are you there?",
        "I'm sure you did.",

        "Oh, I know.",
        "But they, of course, they weren't saying that in English.",

        "And their parents can't really give them advice about, you know, oh, you need the number one nipple versus the number two nipple versus, you know, the bouncy seat, and — the, you know, Jumperoo because they didn't have any of this stuff.",

        "You know, I'll just say that grandparents now buy one in every four toys and four in every 10 baby books.",
        "Bill…",
        "Oh, absolute — yeah, we're probably heavy on the books.",
        "Yeah, granny definitely is heavy on the books.",
        "We probably supply them with more of that than toys.",

        "And just in general, I don't mean Bill in particular, but do we tend to over-romanticize the past when things were easier when we lived in our log cabins?"
