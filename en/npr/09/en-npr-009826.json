        "As in the Libby case, his lawyers argued that he'd led a life of public service and that he as already ruined, and unlike Libby, that he was in poor health.",
        "The trial judge sentenced Rita using the federal sentencing guidelines.",
        "And as in the Libby case, following the guidelines, the judge added time to the sentence for the crime that Rita was not charged with because the perjury testimony and obstruction was a cover-up of that crime.",
