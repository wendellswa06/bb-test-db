        "Well, what I did this year is I took the circulars from Target, Wal-Mart, Office Depot, Staples, and they have the for sale items to get you in the door, nickel erasers, 10-cent paper and things like that.",
        "So I took those, each circular, with me to each store, and I bought those cheapest items at that store.",
        "So I might have bought erasers and pencils and paper at Target, but then I went over to Staples and got the note cards.",

        "We were led to believe that Queen Elizabeth's speech opening a new session of the British Parliament next week was being delayed because it had to be printed on vellum, a parchment made from the skin of a calf, and that ink on vellum takes quite a while to dry, hence the delay.",
        "Fascinating, so British.",
        "Well, it turns out the queen's speech used to be inked on vellum but those days are long gone.",
