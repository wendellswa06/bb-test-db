        "I mean, I'm also, you know, not saying the opposite, that people shouldn't live healthily and, you know, eat well and exercise, but as a solution to obesity, telling someone to exercise or to diet is simply beside the point.",

        "There are so many pressures, physiological, environmental and social, that conspire to keep them obese once they are obese, that, you know, they're essentially set in this condition, which is one reason why, when we conceive of obesity, we should stop thinking of the image you see on television all the time of the headless adults - well, not headless - but adults whose heads are cut off by the top of the screen walking down the side of the street the way that TV footage illustrates any story about obesity and think of kids under five years old.",
