        "In the time being, I've run two marathons, and you know, just had such an amazing difference in my life, and you know, so much of what he wrote was so spot-on, and the gestalt that I see between the life I lead now and the life I lead then is just an amazing, amazing thing.",

        "It worked well, but it - and he points it out.",

        "You know, I've said to others that my body kind of needed some time out to relearn what it needed to do.",
        "I mean, the thing about the gastric bypass for me is that now that I'm three years out, I could, if I wanted to, eat enough of bad things that I could probably get myself into the same pickle, or if I hadn't figured out how to incorporate a fitness regime in my life, I could begin to gain the weight.",
        "And I'm sure Marc has seen a lot of people go down that gastric bypass path and end up gaining the weight back and worse off, and I was lucky that I've been able to take advantage of it.",

        "It's personal behavior.",
        "It's your own willful misconduct that has caused this, and that's not true.",

        "I think, you know, the objection one hears to, well, why do you have to involve the government in what is fundamentally a personal choice, you know, my response to that was, well, that objection may have been a valid objection 30, 35 years ago, when the nuclear family was more intact than it is, when, you know, both parents in families weren't working, when you didn't have nearly the number of single parents, and the inequality in the health - the inequalities in the health care system weren't such that, you know, that those inequalities can in a sense be a marker for - a marker for obesity.",

        "But what has happened, I found the motivation that helped me maintain it was not only did I have this help, but I looked at my family and my wife and I knew I could not be a father or a husband to these children and get them raised and into college unless I was able to move around and be a parent.",

        "But one of the problems that I would worry about if too many people reverted to this type of surgery is that you would have surgeons who aren't well-trained in it doing it, and then the complications rates - complication rates would rise.",
        "On the other hand, you're starting to see the surgery now used as a way of - in a sense, I'll use the word cure, type 2 diabetes among thinner people who have very severe type 2 diabetes and who have tried other interventions and it hasn't worked.",
