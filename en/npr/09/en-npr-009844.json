        "Moussaoui's mission, he said, is murder, not suicide.",

        "And that is nothing but pure hogwash.",
        "After the jury left, Judge Leonie Brinkema paid tribute to the attorneys for both sides, to the government for the quantity and quality of the evidence, and to the defense, for working with a man she called an impossible client.",
        "Brinkema said Moussaoui will never appreciate what his lawyers have done, and she said she truly thought he'd gotten a fair trial.",
