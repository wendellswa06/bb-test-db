        "I think it's about four percent or so.",
        "Bill would have the figures on hand, compared to 15 or 16 percent for Hispanics and Asians.",
        "So most of the new diversity, most of the browning, if we characterize it as that, is occurring to the rapid growth of the Hispanic and the Asian populations.",
        "When you take a look at the idea that Asians and Latinos cluster more than African Americans--we're a bit more spread out--does this speak and say anything to what ultimately will become, Mr. Harrison, social and political power?",
        "Well, it could, but the Hispanic population and the Asian as immigrants will take some time before they can translate the growing numbers into power politically.",
        "It is occurring in some of the cities that have large concentrations, but we most remember that many of these populations have large, foreign-born non-citizen components and registration--voter registration--is lower than in the total population.",
        "So those ratios substantially reduce the political power of these growing populations.",
        "Mr.",
        "Frey, what we are also seeing in this gravitating back to the South is a delineation between what is termed the Old South and the New South.",
        "Most of these blacks are going to areas like Georgia, as you mentioned, Florida, North Carolina, Texas--versus what was deemed old school, old South, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama.",
        "Yes, that's right.",

        "But even before that happened, you saw large movements of blacks from Louisiana and Mississippi to Atlanta, and to Florida; the Eastern parts of the South, and also to Texas.",
        "So, yes, there really is a distinction between kind of the growing, you'd say, go-go South and the stagnating part of the South, which as we know from the last several months is becoming even more difficult for some of the Southern states.",
        "Mr.",
        "Harrison, we talk about stagnation there.",
        "I'm curious what you feel this will mean for regions.",
        "We talk about Atlanta being the new black Mecca, and I think many people have really looked to that over the last few years as being real.",
        "But areas that perhaps held that distinction before, Detroit or Cleveland--what of those African Americans who don't necessarily have the wherewithal to move where jobs and money growth are going on.",
        "What does it meant for these regions?",
        "Well, I think it makes life difficult for important segments of the population, particularly, those in central cities.",
        "Bill points out there's important movement of blacks from central cities to suburbs in many of the Northeastern and Midwestern cities that are not experiencing great economic growth over the period--in fact stagnation and decline in many cases."

        "But still I think Bill mentions that the South -- the new South is attractive to young generation of college-educated blacks.",
        "Well, college educated blacks who stay in the North or the Midwest are much more likely now to be locating in suburbs.",
        "William Frey, what are the social dynamics that this sets up when you look at an area like Atlanta, even New York City proper, when it becomes a minority majority, as is coined by the media?",
        "What does that do to the social dynamic with whites who still own a vast array of power economically and often politically in these areas?",
        "I think the dynamics are complicated.",
        "But I think it's important to make a distinction between what I would call a melting pot city like New York, which has a broad array of race and ethic groups, whites being in the minority.",
        "But there are rich and poor of all of race and ethic groups, certainly the poorest of them are not fairing very well.",
        "But I think there's this openness to some degree in terms of at least day to day social relations and even translating perhaps into political dynamics, as compared to sort of the cities that are largely white and black, certainly the worst ones in terms of having difficult social dynamics are in the Northeast and Midwest, especially like Detroit for example.",
        "But even in the growing South, like Atlanta, you do have new highly educated blacks moving into the South into these cities, but also you have poor people who are staying there for many decades and several generations.",
        "And I think when you have that kind of dynamic, I know that some recent stories have come out about Atlanta showing that the city of Atlanta is gentrifying.",
        "Whites are moving in building up neighborhoods, and many blacks are being displaced to go out to the suburbs.",
        "And I think when you have that kind dynamic, it becomes difficult in a city that doesn't have a broad racial and ethic mix like you would in New York or Los Angeles.",
        "Interesting point, Mr. Harrison, that I know that you have discussed the idea that African Americans have a tendency to go in areas they feel most comfortable.",
        "I should suggest that they want to find predominately black areas where Hispanics and perhaps Asians don't look at that necessarily in terms of priority?",
        "I think certainly part of the phenomena, particularly the movement of college-educated blacks to the suburban areas of the metropolitan areas in the South, those reflect people, blacks seeking communities where they see substantial numbers of other blacks.",
        "And there is some statistics from the Detroit area study that showed that blacks tends to think an area is integrated when it's about 35 percent black, but whites it's closer to 10 percent, so that is part of that phenomenon.",
        "William Frey, it seems to me, as I listen to both of you talk, that there is a danger, if you will, of building communities in cluster of minorities who are perhaps under-educated, under-employed, are not able to move, as I suggested earlier, with the jobs.",
        "Is this a danger, and if so, what can be done for these areas?",
        "I think more broadly in the United States today, this is probably a more immediate issue with the new immigrant groups, especially from Latin America, coming into metropolitan areas that have already become very much gateways for these groups, Mexicans moving to Southern California or to Arizona or to Texas, and the reason I say this is because there is this continuing flow moving in.",

        "In the case of blacks and maybe some other minorities, they're not growing as much.",

        "And I think it does put a real burden on the local public school systems, on the state agencies, to deal with that continued flow.",
        "I think what needs to be done in these areas is to have much more maybe federal support given to the states and to the localities to help them improve the education systems for this continuing flow of immigrants that are coming in.",
        "How long do you anticipate seeing this kind of continued growth by African-Americans to flock south and southwest?",
        "You know, I actually have been surprised by how large it has been, and you know, one would think that if it were only economics, you would see the black movement follow to wherever the jobs happen to grow at the particular year or the particular time.",
        "But the movement back to the South, at least the prosperous South, has been pretty constant over the last 15 or 20 years, and I think this cultural comfort zone that many African-Americans see as moving to the South is an important aspect of that movement.",
        "So I think it will continue, and I think as more blacks settle there, have more children there, I think the South will continue to be a place that becomes a magnet and a place of comfortable residence for a lot of African-Americans.",

        "And what constitutes an undue burden?",
        "Well, that's really the key question, right?",
        "And the way the court described it in Casey is they said, look; a measure that imposes a substantial obstacle on a woman's ability to access abortion is unconstitutional.",

        "And in the midst of all these questions that are still left open, how have states responded?",
        "I mean, what types of restrictions have states sought to put on abortion access?",
        "Right.",
        "So one reason why abortion is going to be a battleground for the court going forward is that states constantly impose new restrictions on abortion of different kind.",
        "So you've seen in - immediately after Casey - Casey itself upheld a waiting period.",
