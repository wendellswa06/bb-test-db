        "OK.",
        "Then you also see restrictions on certain methods of abortion.",
        "The Court famously upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban in 2007.",
        "You also see a raft of measures that would impose what are really quite onerous requirements that an abortion facility become a surgical ambulatory center and meet a whole bunch of very expensive requirements that are meant really for more invasive surgery and not medically required at all for abortion.",
        "States required that doctors at abortion clinics have admitting privileges at hospitals within a certain area.",
        "So those are some.",
        "More recently we've seen measures that have banned abortion after six weeks or 15 weeks.",
        "Those have been stayed by courts, but those may very well go forward.",
        "There's a whole raft of these measures.",
        "Out of all the regulations you've listed, how many of them are getting challenged in court now and could very quickly end up before the Supreme Court even next term?",
        "A lot of them are currently being challenged.",
        "I think there are cases pending in the lower courts right now that could make it up to the Supreme Court if not next term then the term after.",
        "And when these challenges come up, the Supreme Court will likely lean conservative.",
        "How does that shift the strategy for abortion rights advocates?",
        "I mean, will they focus even more now on legal challenges at the state level, to state laws reducing access to abortions?",
        "Quite probably.",
        "One important point to note here is that the Supreme Court has leant conservative for a while.",
        "Casey was a pullback.",
        "So abortion advocates have been very careful in thinking about what their strategy should be for decades.",
        "And they will simply become more cautious now.",
        "That said, you know, if you've got a state that's imposing a ban on abortion wholesale, that needs to be challenged.",
        "It's directly at odds with Casey as well as Roe.",
        "And I think abortion advocates would be hard pressed not to bring a challenge if a state were to enact that kind of a measure.",
        "As the Democratic nomination contest nears what may be a conclusion, many eyes are on the superdelegates, those roughly 800 Democrats who get to vote however they like.",
        "Many people become superdelegates, because they're members of the Democratic National Committee.",
        "A select few enjoy super status because they've won elections themselves.",
        "With more on who gets to be a superdelegate and why, here's NPR's Laurel Wamsley.",
        "When George McGovern announced that he was switching his endorsement from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama, every news report had to mention that McGovern, the party's 1972 presidential nominee, is not a superdelegate.",
        "But, why isn't he?",
        "Bill Clinton's a superdelegate so is Al Gore, Walter Mondale, Dick Eckhart, and a lot of other former presidential candidates and party luminaries.",
        "So, why not McGovern?",
        "Because he never had a job that makes the list, that's according to Tad Devine, who wrote a lot of the Democratic Party delegate rules, 20 years ago.",
        "The nominee, but not a former president, vice-president, majority leader of Senate, Speaker of the House, party chairman."

        "I think that's the list, isn't it?",
        "Devine's list defines the most super of all the delegates, the ones known as distinguished party leaders.",
        "They get their status from the positions they used to hold.",
        "Devine made his name in the rules business when he worked Michael Dukakis' 1988 presidential campaign.",
        "And no, Dukakis isn't a superdelegate either.",
        "Only winners, not losers.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But even the least distinguished national committee folks get a seat.",
        "Doesn't Michael Dukakis think that he should be a superdelegate?",
        "No.",
        "Look, those of us who have run, and unfortunately not won, are still in a position to try and do the best we can to help.",
        "And if we are going to win this thing, and we certainly should, it's going to be, because we organize every single one of the 200,000 precincts in the country.",
        "So, that's what I'm focusing on, and I hope I can persuade people to move in that direction, and that's a much greater contribution, frankly than being one of 4,000 delegates, or whatever it is.",
        "The list of distinguished party leaders also leaves off previous nominees for vice president, like John Edwards.",
        "Tad Devine thinks the Democratic Party would be well served to have these former candidates in the ranks of the supers.",
        "You know they've been through this process, like no one else.",
        "I think to run as the candidate, to give that acceptance speech, to understand the way campaign works from the inside, and to have seen America through the eyes of a candidate is a unique experience.",
        "But George McGovern says that he doesn't mind not being a delegate."

        "The Democratic Party superdelegates have come under fire this primary season.",
        "Critics question their number, their power, even their existence.",
