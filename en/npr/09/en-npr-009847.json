        "There is, absolutely.",
        "And you could ask the question, after two terms of a Democratic president, is the nation ready to switch and go to the Republican Party?",
        "But not if they keep losing female voters, not if they lose Latino voters.",

        "Standing with his family in a hastily called news conference, Daley, the longest serving big city mayor in the country, stunned Chicago by saying it's simply time, time for him and time for the city to move on.",
        "The truth is that I've been thinking about this for the last several months.",
        "In the last several weeks I've been increasingly comfortable with my decision.",
        "It just feels right.",
        "Daley often has said he doesn't want to be mayor for life, though many in Chicago thought he would be.",
        "Some close to him have said Daley thought the stress of the job may have contributed to his father's death while in office in 1976 and that he didn't want the same to happen to him.",
        "And the 68-year-old Daley's decision comes as his wife Maggie battles cancer and has had recent setbacks.",
        "But it also comes with the city's bank account deep in the red and no easy ways to erase the record $655 million budget deficit, and all kinds of other problems that would have been big Chicago potholes on Daley's road to re-election.",
        "Street gangs terrorize some city neighborhoods, there's a shortage of jobs and affordable housing, and federal corruption investigations at city hall, plus Daley's autocratic style, all have contributed to Mayor Daley's approval rating among city voters dropping like a Chicago thermometer in January."
