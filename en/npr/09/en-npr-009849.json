        "And this is a checking account that pays a relatively high rate of interest - up to about 2 percent at the moment - but you have to play by their rules.",
        "And what that means is, use your debit card a lot.",
        "So as long as you're willing to use your debit card, say, a dozen times a month, and sign up for direct deposit and e-statements, you can get a much higher rate of interest on your first 10,000, $20,000 or so.",
