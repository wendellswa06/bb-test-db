        "The practical result, though, has been a backlog of more than 300,000 names awaiting approval.",

        "He has disclosed that in February 2001 - that is some seven months before the 9/11 attack - Quest turned down a request from the national security agency to cooperate in monitoring calls.",
        "Nacchio says that as a consequence, Quest was denied government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "It should be noted that Nacchio was defending himself against charges of insider trading.",
        "The administration must now believe it was acting illegally in conducting warrantless surveillance because it has demanded legislation immunizing telephone companies from lawsuits for past involvement in wiretapping.",
        "The President has expressed concern that obtaining warrants is too time-consuming when the surveillance targets are suspected terrorists.",
        "House Democrats have joined the Republicans in an attempt to answer that concern with a bill that would ease the burden of having to acquire individual warrants."

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I was interviewing pretty much on a consistent basis and deciding which companies seemed like the best fit for me.",
        "I got a lot more calls from recruiters than I actually wanted to have interviews with those companies because especially after the second layoff with a high-tech company that was a startup, I really wanted to have a company that was more stable and not have something that could potentially rear its ugly head again in about three to six months.",
        "And what did you hear from the companies who didn't hire you?",
        "It really varied.",
        "In some cases, they knew that if they waited one more week, there would be another 5,000 people in the Internet industry, and that's the industry that I work in, that are available due to different layoffs.",
        "In fact, of course, AOL has mentioned they're going to be laying off several thousand people this week.",
        "So it just continues along that way, and companies feel well, if we wait a couple more weeks, there will be more people in the marketplace.",
        "The other thing they would do is change the job description midway through the interviews, and they would potentially look at somebody - or they would change the description to have it be a lesser role.",
        "And I saw titles I had never seen before, things like junior account executive assistant, I mean, things that obviously they were looking to try to lowball the salary and be able to get somebody that still has a lot of qualifications.",
        "So I'd hear that.",
        "I would also hear that they were just continuing to look into the marketplace and in some cases would hire out - hire a person that they were looking originally in San Francisco, and they might decide to hire that person in L.A.",
        "instead for a variety of reasons.",
        "And of the people you knew who were laid off with you, and your wife, who at one point was also laid off, are people getting back to work?",
        "Well, luckily, my wife was able to find a job within about a month, but yeah, certainly that was a scary month there, where neither of us had a full-time job.",
        "And I was still doing contract work with some companies, but nothing had been full-time.",
        "And the people that I had been talking to, some of them were able to get other jobs within about three to six months.",
        "There's a couple people I know that still aren't looking.",
        "In some cases, it has opened up in some of the arenas, but in other cases, it's still very tight.",

        "Nice to be here, Rebecca.",
        "Now, you were on the show in December, 2008, when Kevin Wilk was on before, and after you heard his story, you said then, quote, \"\"It's very cold out there in the job market.\"\" Would you still say that today?",
        "It's probably a little warmer now, but it's still fairly cold - and Kevin, congratulations.",

        "Many unemployed wish that they had recruiters knocking at their door.",
        "But Rebecca, things are not as cold as before.",
        "A year ago, the nation was losing nearly 700,000 jobs a month.",
        "Over the past three months, we've averaged losing one-tenth of that, 70,000 jobs a month, which is still too much.",

        "Well, in December, the number of jobs were down 85,000, but then in revising the figures for November, we see that actually there was an increase in jobs.",
        "So voila, eureka, we had a nice little increase, but then things seemed to turn bad again.",
        "And now economists are debating: Are we going to have a double-dip recession where we finally started recovering, and now things are getting worse?",
        "Hopefully, you know, some of the $787 billion stimulus package is still going to be played out, still going to be pumped into the economy, and that will create more jobs.",
        "That, revising the numbers for November, it always sounds a little bit like cooking the books.",
        "What exactly goes on when those numbers are revised?",
        "The government surveys employers, and employers tell them how many jobs they have on the payroll, how many less, how many more.",
        "And they do a preliminary survey, and they release it each month, and then in the subsequent month, they study it more.",
        "Businesses give more-definite numbers, and they might say - and the government might conclude whoops, we were too high last month, we were too low last month.",
        "So originally, for November, Rebecca, the government had said the U.S.",
        "had lost 11,000 jobs.",
        "Now it says we actually gained 4,000 jobs.",
        "So there are these constant revisions.",
        "But again, one shouldn't look too much at any one month.",
        "It's more the overall trend, and the overall trend is getting better.",
        "We've gone from losing 700,000 a month to losing just 70,000 a month.",
        "And some economists are predicting that, you know, certainly over the next few months, we will see bona fide job growth.",
        "But other economists say well, the housing industry isn't doing very well, and manufacturing has been going up for the past five months, and that's created some optimism, and the stock market's doing well, and oil prices are going up, which consumers hate, but it does point to some growing economic strength.",
        "And temporary employment is up, and that's usually a green shoot, a robin in the lawn indicating that things are going to get better.",
