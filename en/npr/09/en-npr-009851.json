        "I mean, things are really bad, and that might have to get played out.",
        "I've seen stories saying that the states next year have a total deficit of, like, $350 billion, and that could drag us down pretty seriously if the states really start laying off hundreds of thousands of workers.",

        "No, no, it just - quite frankly, we get the feeling here in Michigan that when we hear all this stuff from the rest of the country, it's either whistling in the dark, or they just don't know what's really going on.",

        "There are a lot of different economies within the national economy, and when you hear a voice like Tom's in Michigan or hear that, you know, 65 percent of Nevada homeowners are underwater, recovery means different things in different places."

        "You know, during the break, I wrote down three words: macro, Detroit and Dayton.",
        "And you know, my concerns are: one, what happens if the job recovery stalls out and the stimulus package really starts to lost its force?",
        "Then the whole nation really - the whole nation's economy might stall, and we might face a situation like the ones Japan faced in the 1990s, where it's just listless year after year with very little economic growth, very little income growth, very little job growth.",
        "So that's one problem we as a nation have to worry about.",
        "The other problem is exactly the one Tom raised, when I wrote down Detroit and Dayton.",
        "There are these important manufacturing, declining manufacturing centers that have been hit extremely hard, not just during the recession that began in December, 2007, but for the whole decade.",
        "In writing my book, \"\"The Big Squeeze,\"\" one of the statistics that astounded me is that, you know, we as a nation have lost so many manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.",
        "We've lost nearly one in three manufacturing jobs, six million manufacturing jobs in the past decade.",
        "And until recently, it seemed that the nation and the government largely ignored, you know, the decimation, the collapse of manufacturing in so many communities across the nation.",
        "And Michigan - and again, I'm sorry, Tom - is ground zero.",
        "Detroit, Flint are ground zero for this problem.",
        "And I think we as nation really have to try to figure out how are we going to turn around these beleaguered manufacturing communities.",
        "You know, the Obama administration and Congress are starting some initial efforts with, you know, trying to create lots of green jobs, trying to spend more money on infrastructure, but a lot of people are saying, especially in places like Flint, that it's still too little and maybe too late.",
        "And that idea that there may be a double dip to this recession, that it's too early to talk of recovery, is echoed by a lot of economists.",
        "Paul Krugman, for example, who wrote an op-ed in your newspaper, the New York Times, he says: During the good years of the last decade, such as they were, growth was driven by a housing boom and a consumer spending surge.",
        "Neither is coming back.",
        "There can't be a new housing boom while the nation is still strewn with vacant houses and apartments left behind by the previous boom.",
        "And consumers, who are $11 trillion poorer than they were before the housing bust, are in no position to return to the buy-now-save(ph) habits of yore.",
        "Rebecca, it's not an easy situation.",
        "You know, Paul Krugman won a Nobel Prize in Economics, something I could only dream about.",
        "But you know, he - the learned professor, no, the learned columnist, makes some very, very good points.",
        "Before the - during the 1990s and early this decade, earlier this century, the economy was really lifted by housing, by consumer spending, in the 1990s by the high-tech bubble.",
        "Now with the economy teetering, wavering, it's still not clear where is the oomph, where is the momentum going to come to really life the economy.",
        "Consumers - we would like consumers to do it, but so many consumers are strapped with debt and hurting because their housing prices have declined, and about two million people are expected to have their homes foreclosed upon.",
        "You know, again, over the past 10 years, a lot of people took money from their houses.",
        "The housing prices skyrocketed, so they would take a second mortgage and use that money to buy a new car, to buy a big-screen TV.",
        "With housing prices declining, that ain't going to happen much anymore.",
        "Where is the momentum going to come from?",
        "Perhaps the higher stock market will create some confidence, and people will have some money to spend.",
        "But I think one of the hopes are increased government spending on infrastructure and green jobs, but the Obama administration is running into far more opposition than it expected.",
        "Whenever it says we have to spend more to create jobs, the Republicans argue that the deficit was already a gazillion dollars, so we don't - I exaggerate, more than a trillion dollars, and...",
        "And that's not a number, by the way."

        "The deficit was already huge, and we can't stand an even larger deficit and then pass it down to our children and grandchildren.",
        "And the Obama administration very quickly responds: Well, with the economy going so slowly, with so many people unemployed, with the nation spending so much on unemployment benefits, that is itself causing reduced tax revenues and more spending, and that is increasing the deficit.",
        "On the subject of consumer spending, we have an email from Reed(ph) in Sacramento, who says: the economic indicators in my own life, which tell me things are improving, I'm finally getting my credit card debt paid off.",
        "The tough economic times light a fire under my hind to take control of my finances in ways that I knew I had become irresponsible over the last several years.",
        "I'm finally seeing an end in sight.",
        "Now, while paying off his credit card debt is an admirable thing for Reed, it is not increasing consumer spending in a way that necessarily helps on a macro level.",
        "That's true, but hopefully in six months or a year, Reed will have paid down enough of his debt that he could go out and buy that HDTV he wants or maybe even buy some things made in America.",

        "Oh, absolutely, Rebecca, and I think that's what Paul Krugman was pointing out.",
        "Consumers overspent.",
        "They went far too high into debt.",
        "Consumers a few years ago borrowed - you know, the consumer debt levels were 130 percent of their annual income, and that was a record level.",
        "So you know, many hardworking Americans, like Reed, realize I was over my head in debt.",
        "I have to pay down some of my debt.",
        "And if people can - if Americans continue paying down their debt, not just for the next two months but for the next two years or six years, that will restrain consumer spending.",
        "And since consumer spending has represented 70 percent of the economy, restrained consumer spending will hurt economic growth long term.",
