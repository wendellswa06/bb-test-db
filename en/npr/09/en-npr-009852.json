        "It's a very, very big impact.",
        "Some economists say that the main force left in the economy in, you know, in the first decade of this century, which we never know what to call; the aughts or the naughties(ph) or the - in the first decade was the housing bubble.",
        "And that created, you know, several million construction jobs.",

        "And unemployment construction is well over 10 percent.",
        "And Jim makes a very good point.",
        "You know, foreclosures are the problem and will remain a big problem, apparently.",
        "Economists say there were 1.7 million foreclosures in 2008, slightly more than that last year, and they're expecting 2.4 million this year.",
        "So it keeps increasing.",
        "And the Obama administration has a program -supposedly has a program to reduce the number of foreclosures, but the verdict, generally, is that it's - it really does far too little and isn't really reducing foreclosures very effectively.",
        "So, well, bad news hurt the therapist's business in Santa Rosa and the bad news is helping Jim's business in Florida.",

        "We have an email.",
        "This is a separate point from Sheila(ph) who says: most of my friends lucky enough to have a job are physically and emotionally stressed since they've acquired new responsibilities from laid-off co-workers in addition to their own work without any increase in pay.",
        "What experts refer to as increased productivity is in fact squeezing workers to the point of exhaustion.",
        "I'm worried that when the economy picks up, these companies won't see any financial advantage to rehiring new workers.",
        "That's an excellent point.",
        "I - in my book, \"\"The Big Squeeze,\"\" I write, at length, about that phenomenon - where companies will downsize, layoff thousands of people and those who remain, who, in ways, are lucky because they still have their jobs, they feel much more stressed, they're worried that they're going to be in the next round of layoffs.",
        "They have to take the responsibilities of those who are laid-off.",
        "They worry that - well, there might be another round of layoffs, so I better work real hard to make sure that the next person zapped is not me, it's the person sitting next to me.",
        "So it's a very difficult situation."
