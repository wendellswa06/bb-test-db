        "So I'm just wondering to what end that line of thinking has any merit?",
        "I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Well, it has no - it certainly has no merit whatsoever if you mean by line of thinking that somehow other Jews aren't entitled to this success.",

        "And - but I wouldn't go so far as to say they're victim of their success because, netting everything out, success is better.",
        "It's important to remember also that going back to the Renaissance, banking was one of the few industries, again, that Jews were allowed to participate in, partly because of Christian laws against loans and that sort of thing.",
