        "It's kind of like counting the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin.",
        "My wife is Jewish, so I understand the concerns.",
        "But what typical people think when they hear Goldman Sachs is crook, not Jewish, just the same as when they hear Citibank or any of the rest of the Wall Street crooks that stole all that money and destroyed our economy.",
        "The very idea of that, you know, Goldman Sachs somehow represents Jewry in any way is just, you know, silly.",
        "And it does trivialize when there are real instances of anti-Semitism out there.",
        "All right, Lee, thanks very much for the call.",
        "You do write, Michael Kinsley, though, about the perception of the Jews cringing, in fact, that they hear words - some words differently than maybe the rest of us do.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "I think that caller made a very good point.",
        "There has not been an outbreak of anti-Semitism or anything closed to it.",
        "But people worry.",
        "And given the history over the centuries and even some history in the United States, it's not utterly crazy to worry.",
        "I do think - I said that Mr. Foxman goes too far when he suggests that there is anti-Semitism, and that it is in any way to blame for this.",
        "You write that sometimes the stereotype about Jews and money takes a harsher form.",
        "Jews are greedy.",
        "They lie, cheat and steal for money.",
        "They have undue influence with the government, which they cultivate and exploit ruthlessly, and so on.",
        "In recent weeks, many have said this sort of thing about Goldman Sachs, but with no reference to Jews.",
        "Well, there - that's - that was one of the questions I tried to analyze.",
        "And I said - as I say, this piece did not take any position.",
        "It was to help people think it through.",
        "And the question is: Can a statement be anti-Semitic, even if it doesn't specifically refer to Jews?",
        "And I think it can, although you should be extremely slow to reach that conclusion.",
        "But if the statement, you know, draws on classic, classic themes of anti-Semitism, and if it refers to Goldman Sachs in some sneering way, I think you can - it can cross the line.",

        "How important is a good beginning?",
        "A good beginning is very important.",
        "Typically, the Black Friday weekend accounts from anywhere around 10 to 15 percent of holiday sales and retailers get a sense what the consumer is looking for, how deep the price reductions have to be, and certainly from what we're seeing so far, they're marking down maybe one item but still the rest of the store is pretty much at very good and planned prices, so it should be a healthy holiday season.",
        "But how do this year's results compare to pre-recession levels?",
        "What we're seeing so far is the results this holiday season are not similar to pre-recession but they're certainly better than what they were.",
        "We're moving in the right direction.",
        "We're seeing an upward visibility to price points in terms of consumers being accepting of a little bit of a higher price point.",
        "And what we're seeing is the fact that the deals that we're seeing today, yes, they're a little bit sharper than what they were pre-recession, but the traffic is there.",
        "So I'd say we're seeing just as much traffic but the markdowns are little bit deeper than what they would have been before the recession.",
        "Miss Telsey, do you see a number of retailers that seem to be particularly noteworthy this year, seem to have the right strategy, right time, well done?",
        "I think there is.",
        "I think for the first time we have the season where discretionary items, there's newness in the assortment, retailers are giving customers what they want, and the prices aren't so low for some of them.",
        "Think of Apple - the iPads and the iPhones, very popular, lots of traffic, not a cheap item and it's selling through well.",
        "Take a look at what Macy's is doing.",
        "Macy's has localized assortment in different regions of the country and it's drawing in traffic.",
        "At the same time, Miss Telsey, are you seeing what might amount to permanent changes that retailers are making as we see the persistence of a tough economy?",
        "Yes.",
        "Retails have made significant changes.",
        "The expenses that they've cut back over the past 18 months, a chunk of those expenses are not coming back.",
        "They're watching their holiday seasonal help very carefully.",
        "There definitely is a pickup in holiday season hiring this year, which is encouraging, but those payroll hours are carefully watched.",
        "Inventory levels, another key item that is a change from how they've managed their businesses in the past.",
        "They're ordering what they need, not as much what they want, in order to give consumers just enough but then flow in new goods.",
        "The goal is to be in stock but not to have too much inventory leading to markdowns.",
        "And I think the ultimate question that a lot of consumers are going to have, certainly, is - is there a direct relationship between hiring for this Christmas shopping season and perhaps an increase in the number of hires as we get into 2011?",
        "Typically the rule of thumb has been for the holiday hiring that a retailer does, around 25 to 30 percent of those holiday seasonal sales help could be considered for permanent help.",
        "And certainly if we get a good holiday season, could we see that number go higher?",
        "That would be encouraging."
