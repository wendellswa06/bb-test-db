        "The bill is expected to pass, in part that's because the drug industry isn't lobbying Democrats all that hard to vote no. They have bigger bills coming up later in the year and they don't want to cash in all their chits on the bill they see largely as a political statement.",

        "It's really, really innovative things like this multi-touch touch screen, so you don't just use one finger at a time.",
        "Sometimes you can use two fingers to zoom in and out of your photos and whip across your tracks on the iPod side of things.",
        "And there's just a lot going on in here to make the art of phone calling just really, really, slick.",
        "This seems to be something that Apple has done with a lot of different hardware, where they take something that everyone else has been kind of trying to do and they kind of find this thing that just blows everybody else away.",
        "Obviously, the iPod comes to mind.",
