        "Inside each flask is yeast that feeds off a solution of sugar water.",
        "And as they grow, they produce more of themselves, and they produce the compound that we've engineered them to make.",
        "That compound is a hydrocarbon fuel with the same molecular structure found in petroleum-based fuel.",
        "Renninger says their fermented sugar-based biodiesel may be a better option than corn-based ethanol.",
        "When you make ethanol, you have to distill the ethanol.",
        "That's very energy intensive.",
        "When you're making a hydrocarbon, the separation is simplified.",
        "It's like oil and water.",
        "The separation is very easy, which means your impact on global greenhouse gas emissions is actually reduced.",
        "And, Renninger adds, unlike other alternative fuels currently being developed, their biodiesel can power engines already in use, and it can be transported using existing infrastructure.",
        "But right now, there's not a whole lot of their biodiesel.",
        "Renninger says to date, they've increased their yield by 10 million fold, but when you're working in a relatively small lab with one cell at a time, that doesn't add up to much.",
        "We're making on the order of liters to gallons to tens of gallons per batch.",
        "That's about to change, Amyris Biotechnologies recently announced it will partner with a Brazilian company to start commercial production of sugarcane-based biodiesel.",
        "Their goal over the next two years is to be able to produce fuel at $55 to $60 a barrel, a price that will likely look good to consumers.",

        "They may be the alternatives that are there now, but they're probably not the best.",
        "There are a lot of drawbacks to these types of sources of ethanol.",
        "Corn-based, of course, competes with the food supply.",
        "You need prime agricultural land.",
        "And while ethanol has positives in replacing oil, it also has a very low energy value compared to gasoline.",
        "And part of this causes the economics, or the greenhouse gas advantage, to be very minimal for corn ethanol.",
        "So, you know, you'd want to look towards something like cellulosic as a much better ethanol product down the line.",
        "Is that switchgrass?",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, what else is out there?",

        "One of the most valuable energy forms is electricity.",
        "If you could imagine that we electrify our transportation system - which we're starting to now, we're on the path to do that - then you could actually use electricity generation not only for powering homes and businesses, but also for powering transportation.",
        "We're experimenting with hybrid cars around the world.",
        "Very soon we'll see plug-in hybrid electrics, which will extend the range to maybe 40 miles on a charge.",
        "And you should be able to plug these into your wall socket in your garage.",
        "And then beyond that, we may be seeing the full electric vehicle.",
        "So this really is a major transformation that's just beginning right now.",
        "One of the reasons it's so attractive is because you not only reduce your dependence on oil, which is a big problem, but you also give yourself the opportunity to attack the greenhouse gas issue if you start looking at the front end, how we generate electricity and can replace that with renewables or nuclear energy, instead of coal.",
        "So we'd have to figure out how to produce that electricity cleanly.",
        "That's right.",
        "People talk about alternative energy, and I think they generally mean renewables when they say that.",
        "But you have to keep nuclear energy in that mix as well, because it's frankly our only proven major electricity producer, outside of coal."

        "One is, we're overdependent on oil as an energy source.",
        "And second, we are toying with changing our climate dramatically by the production of greenhouse gases.",
        "Now if you fix the greenhouse gas problem, you're going to end up fixing the oil problem because oil is a major source of greenhouse gases, about a third of them.",

        "So assuming you want to do both, one of the things that we need to do in the interim is figure out how to manage carbon.",

        "I kind of feel that way about the surge.",
        "That is - if it needs a Middle East expert to explain to you why it's working, then it's not working.",
        "Because to me, the measure of the surge working is not whether, you know, the number of people, you know, turning up dead in Diyala province is down by 30 percent.",
        "All that tells you, Neal, is that where you put more American troops, you get more security.",
        "Well, we knew that from before.",

        "Because is there an Iraqi state with an Iraqi army to hand over those places where large number of American troops can establish security to an Iraqi army that would report to a unified Iraqi government?",
