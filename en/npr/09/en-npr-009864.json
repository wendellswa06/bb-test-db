        "You certainly feel that as you listen to the debate, not only listen to the Democratic debates, but also, I think, more relevantly to the Republican debate.",
        "This is a no great insight, but I think the people you have to watch are the Republicans and when, as we enter the presidential season, do they march down Pennsylvania Avenue and tell the president it's enough.",
        "I think the game of the president, the game - the strategy of the president is to - his hope is to stabilize Iraq enough that there's virtually no casualties and you can begin a drawdown of troops.",
        "So he'll say, look, I'm drawing them down.",
        "But basically keeping a force there in the hope, may be vain at this stage that somehow, a political process will emerge there to stitch a united Iraq together.",
        "That seems to be the president's strategy.",
        "You know, whether…",
        "And a pretty diminished goal.",
        "And a lot of people would say…",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "…it's a pipe dream, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think it's - I think the chances of it are very low.",
        "And, as you say, and sadly, it's a diminished goal.",
        "And, you know, when you look around the region, you look at Gaza, what's happened there, you look at Lebanon, what's happened there, you really see the need there for consensual, decent, progressive government.",
        "And another e-mail question.",
        "This one from Mark(ph) in Columbus, Ohio.",
        "Could the recent product recalls of Chinese goods lead to a rethinking of our trade policies?",
        "What if American workers made toys for American children made to American standards or is this no longer possible?",
        "Hey, Mr. Friedman.",
        "Very nice to hear your voice.",
        "And the hope that Iraq, not in some ridiculous domino theory, but just in the heart of that world, might have provided a model, a social contract in a region that has only known top-down monologues of dictators, kings and colonial powers, that you might actually have produced a horizontal dialogue where actually the constituent communities of an Arab country reach a social contract so they don't have to be ruled by an iron fist.",
        "It's very sad.",
        "Most of all, you know, we will have failed, but they will have lost and, I think, the real opportunity.",
        "One more question from me…"

        "But, that is, you did propose, recently in a column, a diminished goal yourself.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There is one part of Iraq, you suggested, where these goals might still be achievable.",
        "And that's Kurdistan.",
        "And what we see in Kurdistan, we've seen the opening of an American university there.",
        "We see what I like to call decent progressive modernizing government.",
        "To call Kurdistan, you know, a Jeffersonian democracy, it's not, it's still dominated by two major clans, the Barzanis and Talabanis.",
        "But you really have a reasonably free press there.",
        "You have a very vibrant capitalist economy, and most of all, you have decency, which is why so many Iraqis of every ethnic group are flocking there.",
        "And it seems to me that, Lord knows, if we can't get the whole Iraq, if we can at least implant, you know, there a decent model - you know, I'm really a big believer that one good example is worth a thousand theories, and that you get a decent model there, that may be, sometime in the future, people will say, you know, I'd like a heck of a lot more than that than I would some crazy lunatic state down here.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's get callers on the line.",

        "Let's go instead now to - this is Clay(ph).",

        "Shoot.",
        "And I've heard you talk about this before.",
        "And it's about partition.",
        "It strikes me that the only solution there in Iraq is to partition it not just on the Sunnis, the Shiites and the Kurds, but maybe even among the Kuwaitis, the Iranians, the Syrians, the Turks, and maybe, just maybe, put Palestinian homeland there and maybe compensate everybody financially to make it so.",
        "You mean sort of like redraw the whole map of the Middle East, which is…",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "You know, one of the problems I have with - you know, this whole question of partition, which Joe Biden and Les Gelb have been proposing, the one problem with it, Clay, is that no Iraqis have been proposing it yet, you know?",
        "And so it becomes very hard for us to impose externally.",
        "But I do think what we learned from Bosnia is if you get an internal movement in that direction and maybe the ethnic cleansing, that sadly has gone on there, and just the nature of the fighting in communities, in effect partitioning themselves, that, you know, within six months or a year, that that may be the natural solution.",
        "We may not call it partition.",
        "We may call it extreme federalism, but it's certainly a possibility.",
        "It's very hard, though, for us to impose it."

        "To come to Syria - you know, in a country like Syria, it's a- I know fairly well the populations are really mixed up, I mean, in the best sense of the word.",
        "You know, there - Damascus is a city of, you know, of predominantly Sunnis, but there's a big Christian community, there's a big Alawite community.",
        "So, it's very hard to do from the outside.",
        "It has to happen from the ground up, not from the top down.",
        "It does make a degree of sense in the sense that those borders were originally drawn by colonial powers with very little regard as to who actually lived there and then that's why you got the current split up between Syria, Iran, Iraq and Turkey, and various other things.",
        "On the other hand, I remember back in the old days of the OAU in Africa there where the - they used to say, the only thing worse than those colonial borders that separated all of us - the only thing worse than those would be to try to redraw them.",
        "Yeah, and that's - they do take on a logic of their own.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Anyway, Clay, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Whether it's imposed or comes from the ground up, do you see any other solution?",
        "Thank you.",
        "(Chanting) We want Driggers.",
        "We want Driggers.",
        "It's a very good question.",
        "I lean in your direction, Clay.",
        "The thing I'm asking myself is, what would be self-sustaining?",
        "For, you know - Neal raised the point the American public's out of patience.",
        "We're not going to stay there forever.",
        "And the surge is only a means to creating a framework that would be - the question you have to ask about the surge or anything else is, is what you're creating self-sustaining?",
        "And it's pretty clear, Clay, from everything that's happened over the last five years in Iraq - almost - that the only self-sustaining Iraq is one that is roughly or loosely divided between the three communities.",

        "Right.",
        "But there is a deadline coming up here in Washington come September.",
        "We keep seeing the Bush administration apparently trying to downplay that, too.",
        "Right.",
        "We anticipate the message, look, it's too early to tell, really.",
        "Yeah, I mean, basically, you know, what's happened, I think, you know, is that the president has lost all credibility with the American people on this issue, as has the vice president, who you know, basically said that the insurgency had run its course a year ago.",
        "And so, as a result of that, they've outsourced the decision of whether or not the surge is working to the firm of Petraeus and Crocker.",
        "General Petraeus, our military commander on the ground and Ryan Crocker, our ambassador.",
        "Well, that puts them, really, in an impossible situation.",
        "No doubt, with the surge, you can point to improvements in some areas and lack of improvement in others, but I come back to the key metric.",
        "The key metric is, you know, the way I look at it, you know, is ask yourself this question: What would convince you?",
        "I start there.",
        "I just look in the mirror and say, what would convince you that it's working?",
        "Well, what would convince me is if I saw Iraqis coming together - Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis - asking us to stay and committing themselves to a real deadline to produce a real government."
