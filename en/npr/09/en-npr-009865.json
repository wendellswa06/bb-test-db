        "So, what does that mean, Neal?",

        "And so your ability now to write your own life story is going to be much diminished.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Writing about globalization, Eric, is that, if you have - if you actually read the \"\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\"\" and \"\"The World is Flat,\"\" what you'll notice is, I say there are upsides to globalization and downsides to globalization.",
        "And I go through them quite extensively.",

        "shill, spokesman - well, the fact is, I have to tell you, Eric, you know, I kind of get a little excited, you know, when I see hundreds of thousands -actually, tens of millions of people in India and China coming out of poverty, in larger numbers faster than ever before in the history of the world.",
        "So, I have to think that's a real upside.",
        "I also think there are real downsides.",

        "And so it seemed to me that it wasn't crazy after 9/11 to see if we could partner with people there to change the context.",
        "One of the things that - to change the context in which these young people are going to grow up not to be a context of anger, of humiliation, and unemployment, that doesn't seem like totally crazy to me.",
        "Yes, I knew it was going to be really hard.",
        "But, you know, thinking about a whole chunk of civilization that's growing up under oppressive backward regimes, one expression of which was what exploded on 9/11, but what explodes there every day in suicide bombings - that's not normal.",
        "So, thinking about how we could collaborate with that part of the world to create a different context seemed really important to me then, still seems important to me now.",
