        "In this case, made in very forceful terms.",
        "Andrew McBride is a former federal prosecutor who has argued cases before Judge Brinkema.",
        "He says the prosecutors are even more challenged, because nothing has changed in the one day since Judge Brinkema handed down her ruling.",
        "Asking a judge to reconsider his or her own ruling, based on the same facts, and come out differently, is a difficult thing.",
        "Judge Brinkema ordered prosecutors to remove all mention of aviation security from the trial.",
        "It was a significant blow to the prosecutors who have already told the jury, in their opening statement, that they would be presenting a lot of evidence and witnesses about just that.",
        "The prosecution's case is based on the idea that if Zacarias Moussaoui hadn't lied when he was arrested three weeks before September 11th, the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration would have been able to prevent the attacks.",
        "Prosecutors said the FAA would have tightened security, banned small knives from airplanes, and put up better watch lists.",
        "Defense attorneys countered that Moussaoui didn't know anything about the plot.",
        "Without the aviation security information, the prosecution would have to prove that the FBI alone could have foiled the conspiracy in the three weeks that Moussaoui was in custody before the attacks.",
        "McBride said the government situation is not good.",
        "President Obama said that a president with a last name of Roosevelt or Lincoln would have been better able to heal the political divide than he has been.",
        "Was that a significant admission of failure on the president's part?"
