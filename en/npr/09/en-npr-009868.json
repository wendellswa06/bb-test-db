        "In reality, this one-of-a-kind ship had a huge claw that would descend and pluck the sub from its watery grave.",
        "By choosing someone who was so well-known, so publicized, it was a great cover story because no one could believe it was a cover story.",
        "It took six years of construction and testing before the Hughes Glomar Explorer set off from Long Beach, Calif., in June 1974.",
        "Sherman Wetmore, now 82, was an engineer on the ship.",
        "He says a Soviet vessel, later replaced by a second one, shadowed the Americans as they anchored above the Soviet sub.",
        "There was even a helicopter circling and taking photos.",
        "They watched everything we did, and the cover story was still holding.",
        "And down deep, the giant claw was holding the Soviet sub.",
        "It was slowly raised more than a mile over several days but still had 2 miles to go.",
        "Then suddenly, the U.S.",
        "vessel shook.",
        "If you've ever been in a little earthquake in California, it felt like that, oh, probably 10 seconds.",
        "You knew it was something serious.",
        "The Soviet sub had broken apart, and most of it headed back to the bottom.",
        "The CIA had to settle for about 40 feet of a sub that was more than 300 feet long and less intelligence than hoped for.",
        "Remarkably, there's no evidence those Soviet ships figured out what they were seeing.",
        "Wetmore says shortly before the sub was brought to the surface, the Soviets...",
        "They whistled three times, which is a symbol of see you later or farewell.",
        "And they left.",
        "The operation leaked out six months later in U.S.",
        "media reports.",
        "The CIA still didn't want to confirm the operation, and, well, it could no longer deny it.",
        "Hence, we can neither confirm nor deny.",
        "Again, Norman Polmar...",
        "The CIA over a six-year period did a phenomenal job of building a salvage capability to pick up a submarine from 16,000 feet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with the Soviet navy watching them, and the Soviets had no idea what was going on."

        "Well, exactly.",
        "Unfortunately, it's been the lack a policy by either the U.S., which was distracted by Iraq for three years, pulling out all their special forces, pulling out its intelligence assets on the Afghan side of the border.",
        "And during that period, President Musharraf in Pakistan are not doing anything really to tame the border.",
        "And what we've seen subsequently is of course al-Qaida, the Taliban, and several other militant groups, have had two or three years after 9-11 to set up camps, to consolidate, to win over the local population, to train new recruits, who are being sent into Afghanistan and also carry out bombings in Pakistan."
