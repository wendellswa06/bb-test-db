        "You know, it's interesting, I was actually attending a dinner at the Bay Area Muslim American lawyers' annual dinner.",
        "So it was a whole bunch of Muslim American attorneys sitting in a room, and a lot of them were, you know, Pakistani-Americans or children of Pakistani immigrants.",
        "And, of course, because I'm a child of the 21st century, I was attached to my Twitter on my smartphone.",
        "And I found out about it on the tweets.",
        "And then, of course, I became glued.",
        "And what happened in that room?",
        "What was the response?",
        "The response was, you know, once the speaker had finished speaking and all of us, you know, gave him an applause, there was - the word spread and there was a sense of, if you will, of relief, a kind of a catharsis, which was shared by, I think, most Americans.",
        "At the same time, this was a somewhat savvy crowd of attorneys and civil rights attorneys, and there were a realization of OK, you got Osama bin Laden, but now what, or so what, in the sense that the war on extremism and the war in ignorance still continues.",
        "And also, there was this minority prayer.",
        "I always say the minority prayer that we didn't really know he was found in Pakistan at that time, it was in breaking news.",
        "And the minority prayer goes something like this: Anytime there's sensationalist news or there's a suspect, like Faisal Shahzad, the New York - the failed New York Times bomber - before we find out, you know, the identity of the suspect, we - every minority group prays to God that it's not one of us.",
        "And then lo and behold, we found out it was in - found in Pakistan, in Abbottabad, 800 yards away from an elite military training camp.",
        "And all of a sudden, we said, oh, God: Pakistan, of course.",
        "Pakistan, of course.",
        "And so, as a multi-hyphenated identity of a Pakistani-American-Muslim, I'm like, OK, this is going to be interesting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You misspoke there you didnt mean the New York's Times' bomber, the New York Times Square bomber.",
        "New York Times Square bomber, of course, yes.",

        "And it was interesting, you wrote a piece for the Huffington Post, and you called it the \"\"Post-Osama Muslim American,\"\" where you describe that post-9/11 moment when you suddenly became one of them, as you put it.",
        "Is this another defining moment like that, do you think?",
        "I don't necessarily think it's as defining.",
        "I think it's a continuation of this lumping effect that's - happens specifically post, you know, the \"\"post\"\", quote, unquote, \"\"9/11.\"\" As I said, there has been a permanent fork in the timeline of the Muslim American narrative, I would say the global narrative of a pre-9/11 and a post-9/11.",
        "And Pakistan, specifically, came into play with a 7/7/2005 London subway bombing in England.",
        "Well, the Taliban have been, were left alone after 9-11.",
        "They were supported by Pakistan before 9-11.",
        "It was very difficult for President Musharraf immediately after 9-11, when they were routed from Afghanistan, to start picking them up or crushing them in Pakistan.",
        "And subsequently what has happened is there were elections in Pakistan in 2002 which brought to power in Balukistan fundamentalist Islamic parties, who in fact were the initial supporters of the Taliban.",
        "So, you have a situation in Balukistan Province now where you have political parties running the government, that are extremely sympathetic and supportive of the Taliban.",
        "In terms of Osama bin Laden, many American officials will say this is a man who has been cut off, largely, from his supporters, able to only smuggle out an occasional audio tape, a man clearly on the run, no longer in operational control.",
        "How important is it, at this point, do you think, to get Osama bin Laden?",
        "I think it's incredibly important.",
        "He is, as long as he stays alive, he provides enormous inspiration to his followers.",
        "He's able to, the fact that he's alive allows his followers to recruit new members around the world, carry out new bombings.",
        "We saw recently what happened in London, with the bombings in London, how these young boys, several of them who'd never been to Afghanistan or Pakistan, were just inspired by his writings and by his speeches.",
        "So, I think it is very important.",
        "It's symbolically very important also for the sake of Pakistan and Afghanistan, to put this to rest.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line, and this is Jack.",
        "Jack is calling us from Brecksville, Ohio.",
        "Hello.",
        "I'd like to ask whether there's a chance that the Taliban will take over in Pakistan?",
        "And didn't they come close in the last parliamentary elections there?",
        "Well, if not the Taliban, forces allied with them.",
        "Ahmed Rashid?",
        "No.",
        "I mean, you know, the Taliban are not that strong in Pakistan.",
        "But they have fundamentalist allies in the tribal Pashtun areas which border Afghanistan.",
        "But it is in relation to the rest of Pakistan, this is a small area.They do not have political support across the rest of the country.",
        "Their support is largely relegated to one ethnic group, the Pashtuns, amongst four or five other major ethnic groups in the country.",
        "Jack, thank you."

        "All these kinds of issues do tend to add fuel to the fundamentalist fire.",

        "I mean, this is the, Pakistan is very keen for international intervention for the Americans to play a more upfront role in mediating the dispute within the (unintelligible) Kashmir, but the Indians are very against it.",
        "And the Indians will certainly be very critical if Bush attempts to try any kind of mediation.",

        "It is what I expected.",
        "And this is because, at this point in his term, it's, in many ways, more about the large narrative - the meta-narrative - than it is about the small details of policy because this was Obama as party leader going into an election.",

        "So he gave us four big questions that he thought the nation had to answer.",
        "So he sets up the questions, and then he tells us implicitly how to answer them.",
        "We are not the people who believe in the politics of fear.",
        "And the vision therefore implied is much closer to the one offered by the Democratic Party than the Republican Party.",
        "What he really did was offer us a vision of national identity, right?",
        "And the end of the speech was sort of signature Obama eloquence on who we should be as a people.",
        "With these four questions he said the country needs to answer in the speech, were there some echoes there with President Roosevelt and the four freedoms he brought up - freedom of speech, freedom to worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear.",
