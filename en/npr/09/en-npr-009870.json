        "It's not a neck-and-neck race, but there is some margin there.",
        "What has to happen numerically is that there are 646 seats in the House of Commons, and whoever gets 324 of those seats gets to form the next government, and there would have to be quite a reversal of fortunes to get the Conservatives into power.",

        "And this is important, because it would affect the parliamentary majority of whichever party's in power.",
        "Labor has had a majority of 167 seats, and that has given Blair a lot of power to push through his policies and has been a defining feature of his term in office.",
        "This time that majority is expected to be cut, perhaps to between the range of 60 to 120.",
        "And if it is in the lower end of that range, it's possible that Blair's final term--and he said this will be his final term--could be shorter than expected, and he could stand down sooner than the end of the term.",
        "And is the British public, then, showing any enthusiasm for this election?",
        "Well, the word `apathy' has come up a lot in the media, but at the same time, polls show that people--it's not that people aren't interested in politics, they just feel that this has been a lackluster campaign and that the race just isn't close enough for their vote to make a big difference.",
        "And that's basically because the media has been saying for such a long time that Labor will win this third term.",
