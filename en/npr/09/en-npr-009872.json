        "But party leaders can't stand him because he's a maverick who likes to run his own ship and because six years ago he upset their plans to give the Senate nomination to Arlen Specter, the moderate Republican whoâd switched parties to run as a Democrat.",
        "Sestak says he tried last year to mend fences and get party support, but after a conversation with a senator Sestak won't name, he says it was clear the national party wanted too much control.",
        "So when he called me again and at the end of a discussion said, Sestak, whenever I tell you anything, the only answer is to be yes, I said, Senator, I don't mean to push back, but I'm sorry; it just can't work that way.",
        "The national party looked for other candidates and settled on Katie McGinty, a former state environmental official who ran unsuccessfully for governor two years ago.",

        "She's endorsed by a host of prominent Democrats and labor leaders.",
