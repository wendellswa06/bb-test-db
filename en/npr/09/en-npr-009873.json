        "Let's take call from Tom(ph) in Sioux City, Iowa.",
        "Tom, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You're on the air, Tom.",
        "One of the things that we see most commonly - and we're in a profession of a lot of Type A personalities - is they all want to rush in and help, and I think it may be helpful to listeners to understand that as noble as that might be, if you're not going within an organized system like these search and rescue units are, that you can actually compound the problem.",
        "The difficulty is that when you go into an area as hard hit as Haiti, you carry with you an envelop of need in that you need food, clothing, shelter, water that the populace down there doesn't even have.",
        "So if you place a demand on their infrastructure which is already nonexistent, you become part of the problem rather than a part of the solution.",
        "Well, Tom, let me ask you this.",
        "We're hearing about all of these injuries they - frankly, the time when the search and rescue teams are still pulling live injured people out of the wreckage is starting to grow short, so there is some urgency to needing medical attention down there.",
        "And as Gerald Martone says, some of these injuries are going to start to get infected.",
        "If you want to keep away, you know, the type A volunteers who might get in the way and take scarce resources away from the survivors, how can they help?",
        "The best way they can help - well, it's actually multiple levels.",
        "The best way to help for people who don't have staff (technical difficulties) to actually respond through an organized system is to backfill.",
        "To, you know, if I may able to deploy down there do an organized system, having a couple of other docs who will come in and help to fill my shifts in the trauma center.",
        "To have people at home so that if something happens to my house while I'm down there working, there's somebody who could help my wife get the basement emptied out of water.",
        "(Unintelligible) in northwest Iowa that's a problem this time of year.",
        "So people who...",
        "Maybe shovel the driveway.",
        "Shovel the driveway, yeah.",
        "That actually - yes.",
        "There's a tremendous need to support the folks who go down there.",
        "The rough ratio is six to one.",
        "It takes about six support personnel back home for one person to deploy in the field.",
        "And we learned this from military.",
        "This is why you don't send a Dear John letter to somebody under fire because they put their head up and not pay attention to what's going on.",
        "The third way, though, and one of the most helpful ways - this sounds a little crass(ph) - but contributing money, giving the means to move a water purification unit, giving the means to purchase the oil to move a ship down there that has on it the supplies.",
        "That's a little something that anyone can do and go into a good organization.",
        "I noticed some up on your Web site.",
        "Go to a good verified organization, give in to a charity that will get in there and do the work.",
        "That's a wonderful thing that people can do."

        "And, Gerald Martone, would you add anything to Tom in terms of things people can do if they're feeling an urgent need to help?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think Tom gave some very good advice that, first of all, it's very frustrating to be on the outside of a situation like this and not be part of it - very hard to watch.",
        "And there's even a name for that syndrome called peripheral syndrome where people who are not involved in rescue operations feel very much marginalized and on the outside.",
        "And it's a terrible feeling.",
        "And the urge, particularly people with a medical or emergency background, is to fly down there, is to go there immediately.",
        "As Tom mentioned, that's often not helpful to not have the support of an organization.",
        "You then become another person that needs to be taken care of.",
        "So there's the immediate need now with people still being pulled out of the rubble and all of these crush injuries.",
        "You mentioned a potential for infection coming up.",
        "There is also, often in the aftermath of disasters, when sanitary conditions aren't great, you know, widespread disease.",
        "How do you work to prevent that?",
        "That's one of the biggest concerns is infectious disease.",
        "There's a lot of myths about that.",
        "The first thing we're worried about, of course, is drinkable water, is water that's not contaminated.",
        "One of the things in earthquake causes is ground rupture.",
        "Oftentimes, even here in the United States, water pipes are laid in the same ditch as sewage pipes.",
        "They're laid side by side.",
        "When there's a rupture in the ground, both pipes break so there's contamination between sewage into drinking water."

        "There's more than 50 diseases carried by water so securing water sources is vital.",
        "You mentioned there were some myths.",
        "Let's take a second to debunk some of those.",
        "Well, the first myth that you often see in a disaster like this is dead bodies are infectious, that they're dangerous.",
        "And there's an unnecessary rush to get rid of dead bodies, and here in Port-au-Prince, we've already seen examples where mass graves are used.",
        "Bulldozers made very large holes in the ground and bodies were dumped in.",
        "This is done because of a concern that they're going to become infective.",

        "So it's tragic when that's done.",
        "It is not considered in a professional aid work a best practice of handling the dead.",
        "So that's one myth that we're seeing.",
        "We are almost out of time, but as someone who has had a lot of experience with emergency response, what would you say are, likely, the biggest challenges facing medical workers in Haiti?",
        "More often it is other questions on Weber's mind as he takes in all these images.",
        "The biggest thing we have to face now is realizing that this moment of search and rescue is just about over and that we'll be facing a daunting colossal task of recovery, of rehabilitation and, finally, development of a country that's been very poor and neglected for many years.",
