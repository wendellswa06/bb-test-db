        "No, it just shows us that Donald Trump is Donald Trump.",
        "And every few days, there's another thing where he shows that he's Donald Trump, and he's still Donald Trump.",
        "To the extent it shows us something, it's something we've learned a long ago, which is, A, he doesn't have an ounce of humility.",
        "Humility is the willingness to say, I made a mistake.",
        "I can't remember a time he said that.",
        "And second, his whole staff is jumpy around him.",
        "They don't have a normal relationship where they can counsel him; they just react to him.",
        "And so when this happens, they have to all get in line and pretend that a mistake wasn't a mistake.",
        "I mean, in this case, it was potentially the residents of an entire state unnecessarily alarmed and trying to figure out what to do.",
        "That's one point.",
        "The other that I'd love for you to speak to, E.J., is - this is a sideshow.",
        "It's - we're talking about it, and that means we're not talking about a ton of the other important things that happened this week.",
        "Is that the president's intention all along?",
        "Well, I think we're talking about it, A, for the first reason you mentioned, which is we count on presidents in crises to pass along actual, real, truthful information to people.",
        "And so to get all the people in Alabama riled up when they don't have to be and to underplay, perhaps, in the minds of others where this storm is going, that really matters.",
        "I think, secondly, we keep wondering how far is he going to push this habit of his, of both lying or playing with facts or ignoring science?",
        "And as David suggested, never, ever being able to win a mistake - admit a mistake.",
        "He could easily have said, look - there was one point when it looked like the trajectory might go there.",
        "Obviously, it's not going there now.",
        "That's why I said it.",
        "It would have been so simple.",
        "And the fact that he can't do that speaks to such deep flaws there that I don't think it's at all surprising, besides the fact that it's kind of funny to look at that weird marking on the map.",
        "I think it is - it does speak to a very deep weakness.",
        "Sticking with hurricanes, I want to turn you to the climate town hall, which was on CNN this week.",
        "This was...",
        "Nice transition.",
        "Yes, there we go.",
        "The hurricane-themed week in politics - back to school and hurricanes.",
        "So this climate town hall, we had 10 of the leading Democratic candidates participating, seven full hours talking about climate change.",
        "Quick take from each of you - what did you hear, and can the party keep this on the front burner, as it were, as this general election plays out?",
        "I think the voters in the primaries and caucuses in the Democratic Party want it on the front burner, which means candidates will keep it on the front burner.",
        "I think you saw two things here.",
        "On the one hand, a broad consensus in the party that this is - that first of all, climate change is caused by human beings, that it's a crisis, that we have to do something about it.",
        "And there were a whole series of things on which they agreed.",
        "There were some fissures over nuclear power - whether that should be brought in, the role of natural gas and fracking.",
        "I think it'll be interesting to see if the party can - chooses - if the candidates choose to say, look - we want to stand as a party to say, climate change is really serious - let's do something about it - or if they focus on these areas of difference.",
        "And that's going to - we're going to see a bit of that in the debate this Thursday to see to what extent are the candidates really going to go at each other, as they did particularly in the second July debate, which I think was kind of damaging on the whole to the party.",
        "Yeah.",
        "David, speaking of pivots, E.J.",
        "has just pivoted us, deftly, to talking about next week and the Democratic debate.",
        "Is the key question for voters watching still going to be, who can beat Donald Trump?"
