        "Trade agreements, in the end, are very much about the details.",

        "Looking at it from the outside, do you feel you understand how close they are?",
        "Well, if we listen to what the president is saying - and the Chinese confirmed this - there has been substantial progress being made in the talks.",
        "They are talking about setting a high-level summit at Mar-a-Lago for the two to finalize an agreement.",
        "And so rhetorically, there are signs that there is interest in both sides in a deal being made.",
        "The challenge for Ambassador Lighthizer today before Congress is whether or not this deal is going to be the comprehensive deal addressing all of these underlying challenges that we, the United States, have been facing with China for a decade, whether they can do that in this next deal.",
        "U.S.",
        "officials have said on this program, our goal is to fundamentally get China to change the way they do business.",
        "This is not a matter of tweaking one trade practice or another.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And Ambassador Lighthizer has been very consistent on this point.",
        "He has said, we are going to be more aggressive than anyone in the past to confront China on its trade practices, its unfair trade practices, that undermine U.S.",
        "interests and distort the global trading system.",
        "And he said we're going to do that by using all the tools at our disposal, whether they're tariffs, WTO litigation or banding together with like-minded countries to pressure China to change.",
        "The highest profile of those, of course, is the tariffs on products coming from China, which President Trump has imposed and which he has threatened to impose further, but, as has been widely noted here, it's actually U.S.",
        "consumers who pay the tariffs.",
        "It's U.S.",
        "companies who pay the tariffs, in terms of higher prices.",

        "Well, I think consistently across the board, the U.S.",
        "business community did not support application of tariffs as the proper remedy to the situation.",
        "The situation being that China distorts global trade rules and is undermining American companies in China.",
        "However, now that we're mid-process, the U.S.",
        "business community is saying, let's stay tough on China, let's not give away the leverage that we have gained by getting the Chinese to the negotiating table through application of these tariffs.",
        "Let's not let up until we have a real deal in place.",
        "Not a half deal that only involves purchase agreements, but one that actually in a verifiable way will bring China to change some of the underlying issues that harm American interests.",
        "And that's what Ambassador Lighthizer is going to be hearing about from Capitol Hill this morning.",
        "I think he's preaching to the choir in many ways because he, too, wants a comprehensive deal.",
        "The question is, to your original point, do we have enough leverage to bring the Chinese to make substantial changes?",
        "I think President Trump continuously talking about a deal in the future maybe undermines us a little bit in trying to get and gain and maintain that leverage."
