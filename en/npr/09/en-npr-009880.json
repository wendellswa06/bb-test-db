        "So OK, first, the Texas law that was struck down - it had forced half of that state's clinics that perform abortions to close, and we've reported on how that's left many women waiting for weeks just to get an appointment or, you know, having to travel hundreds of miles to get to a clinic.",

        "Well, directly, not necessarily.",
        "I mean we've had, you know, more than 250 abortion restrictions in the past five years - an unprecedented wave, everything from a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, waiting periods up to three days in some states, forcing doctors to do an ultrasound of a fetus and show it to the woman.",
        "In the past year, a few states have passed bans on the most common type of abortion procedure in the second trimester - all kinds of laws.",
        "There's no direct impact on these, and abortion opponents today are saying, we are still going to advocate for these restrictions and others in state legislatures and in courts.",
        "But abortion rights groups really see this ruling today as giving them a huge new edge in this state-by-state battle.",
        "So why do they think they have this new edge?",
        "Because this is the first time that the court has spelled out what it meant - it - when it had its last big abortion ruling back in 1992, it said, OK, you can restrict abortion but not if it poses an undue burden.",
        "And really, this whole battle since then has been to try and figure out what poses an undue burden.",
        "And today the justices said that the courts must weigh the burden a law imposes along with whatever benefits it claims to have.",
        "And it specifically said this is the court's role.",
        "Also this ruling cites a lot of evidence about how these Texas laws do not improve women's health and safety, and this really strikes at the heart of the argument that abortion opponents have been making to push all sorts of restrictions.",
        "So abortion rights groups say this ruling supports their view that these are sham laws, as they call them, and their real aim is to close clinics.",
        "They are very confident that this is going to mark a dramatic shift and start to roll back this wave of abortion restrictions."
