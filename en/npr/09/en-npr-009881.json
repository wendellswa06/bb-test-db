        "Sure, Madeleine.",
        "Good to talk.",
        "That's All Things Considered's Robert Siegel, and I'm sure you'll be hearing more of him later today on All Things Considered.",
        "And our last headline takes us to your neighborhood.",
        "Last week, the Federal Reserve broke a relative silence on subprime and predatory lending.",
        "Up until now, the reserve has resisted stiff regulation.",
        "But on Thursday, it held a hearing on possible reforms.",
        "That was good timing.",
        "The latest foreclosure numbers also came out last week.",
        "Nearly one in five subprime loans was either delinquent by more than a month or already in foreclosure.",
        "For more, we talked to Bill Spriggs.",
        "He's a professor and chair of economics at Howard University.",
        "Spriggs says it's high time the Federal Reserve got involved because when it comes to keeping lenders honest, the buck stops with the fed.",
        "They have a number of regulatory functions when it comes to banks.",
        "And fairness, a major piece of civil rights legislation is their responsibility and that has to do with making sure that everyone has fair acess to credit.",
        "It is too often that civil rights organizations forget that.",
        "And when you see the Federal Reserve being grilled by the Senate, when they confirm members of the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve, rarely do you see people ask questions about what about credit fairness?",
        "What about making sure that everybody has access to credit to buy homes, to start businesses?",
        "Those questions are never asked of members of the Board of Governors.",
        "But that access to credit is access to the American dream because without access to credit, you can't participate in our economy.",
        "Let's talk a little bit about redlining and how does - tell us briefly what redlining is.",
        "And what have you learned about how redlining is working in the era of the subprime mortgage?",
        "Well, redlining refers to a term that came about when the federal government decided it was going to truly make America a middle class nation.",
        "And in '40s and '50s, the federal government got into making sure that home mortgages would be available.",
        "They quickly seized upon patterns of discrimination that existed within the housing market.",
        "They took the side of realtors who had already been practicing discrimination and setting up segregated neighborhoods.",
        "What they determined was if the neighborhood was all white, then that was a good area to loan money.",
        "And if the area was mixed or had a high share of blacks, then it was not.",
        "So they literally drew a red line around certain neighborhoods.",
        "And we use the term redlining since then to talk about either residential segregation or to talk about banks that tended to follow the pattern of loaning money to white neighborhoods and then redlining or leaving out credit availability to minority neighborhoods.",
        "It is against the law and the Federal Reserve is supposed to enforce that law.",
        "Each year, in many communities data, which comes from the Home Mortgage Data Set, which is abbreviated as HMDA, points out that it is more difficult for blacks to get access to home credit.",
        "And recently because we have data on the interest rates that blacks pay, we find out that blacks tend to also pay higher interest rates.",
        "The Fed has seen this data, the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston studied it extensively and found that there were disparities that could not be explained in any reasonable way.",
        "Yet the Federal Reserve is very lax in enforcing this provision of the law that they have the responsibility to enforce that would protect credit discrimination."
