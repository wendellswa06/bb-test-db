        "So people are paying a lot more money over the course of a mortgage.",
        "The question now though, since the Federal Reserve is starting to look into this, what is it actually going to do, you think?",
        "Well, the problem, as I see it at the moment, is that the Fed is concentrated on tightening the way in which people get access to credit from anyone and they're making it more difficult for home buyers in the conventional market with the idea that we're going to make it more difficult for people to get loans and we will avoid the high rate of foreclosures that we see in the news all the time in the last couple of months.",
        "But if the Fed looked more carefully, what they would see is that people who got the subprime loans - only a small share were first time homebuyers.",
        "The Mortgage Bankers Association says it's about 15 percent.",
        "The Center for Responsible Lending says it's something like nine percent.",
        "These aren't people who weren't homeowners, who didn't have a track record and the data also revealed that roughly 80 percent of these folks are making on-time payments.",
        "Even though they are paying horrendous interest rates and are at a huge disadvantage because these loans have triggers in them that in many cases will make their interest rates go even higher.",
        "The Fed is talking about making it harder for people to get credit, but what they really should be doing is saying if 80 percent of these folks are paying on time under really bad circumstances, where were the banks and those responsible for making the loans at the conventional rate?",
        "Was there some discrimination?",
        "And if there wasn't discrimination, given that they've proven that they can make payments on a regular basis, they should be looking towards banks, converting those loans from the subprime market to the conventional market to refinance those loans where it's possible.",
        "We've been talking about the big picture and government involvement, but if you are a homeowner who has one of these expensive forms of loan, is there anything you can do if you're making your payments and is there any way that you can basically get out of overpaying according - in relationship to other homeowners?",
        "Well, one of the things is that some people because they would've been making regular payments need to get a new credit score and it is possible that their credit score is - will be much higher.",
        "It's also possible because some subprime lenders don't report to the credit rating agencies that people may find that their credit scores haven't changed at all.",
        "But to the extent that they have changed, they should be seeking conventional mortgages, and because this has been in the news, hopefully, this will make them aware.",
        "They will then seek out some conventional loans where possible.",
        "A problem many people have is that some of these loans are predatory in the sense that they have huge pre-payment penalties.",
        "In order to get out of mortgage, you have to actually pay off the old mortgage.",
        "Well, since we've been talking about the lending industry and how much money some people might be paying for their homes, you have also been working with the Community Service Society of New York, and you've been meeting -talking about the semantics of poverty, what exactly does that mean and what are you trying to bring to light?",
        "Well, we want to reach people where they are in their understanding of things.",
        "So people have an understanding about poverty and they have an understanding about poor people.",
        "A lot of it comes from having 30 years drummed into their heads by folks who have not been very nice to poor people, who has characterized the poor as shiftless, lazy or doing something that have put them into poverty.",
        "So it's realizing the stories that are in people's heads before you even get to talk about solutions and understanding how do I get you to understand my point when you come with a lot of preconceived notions about who's poor, why are they poor, and beliefs about whether the government can even help them."

        "So is your goal with all of these to change how people think about poverty?",

        "What are you - what's your goal with the end-result of this?",
        "Well, hopefully, it's to get policies in place that really would make a difference in the lives of people with low income.",

        "And so, when you approach them about the real world problems that are faced by children in low-income households, with that preconceived notion in mind, even though they would agree with the program, even though they would agree that we have to do better with our schools, we have to do better with our after-school programs, we have to do better with the nutrition of our children, we have to do better with the health of our children.",
        "They would get turned off if they think you're getting money to help out those people.",
        "And so it's really how do I talk about it so that I'm on the same page you are on because most Americans, honestly, believe that all children should have a chance in this country and that all children should have the opportunity to a good education and a healthy life.",
