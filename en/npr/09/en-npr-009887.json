        "Compounding that, the trend is even greater today.",
        "We're sending an ever higher proportion of kids to college, digging ever deeper into the barrel, very low achievers in high school.",
        "At the very same time as American employers are off-shoring ever more jobs, part-timing ever more jobs, using many more automated systems instead of people.",
        "So you've got ever more college graduates - even if you do graduate, and as I said, most of these kids from the bottom 40 percent of their high school class don't graduate - at the very same time as there will be fewer white-collar jobs.",
        "I looked at the very latest statistics that just came out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
        "The really fastest-growing jobs are those in the service sector, those very low-paying jobs that one could do as a high-school dropout.",
        "In an op-ed riposte, Lawrence Schall, the president of Oglethorpe University, agrees with you that not all students who head off to college are fully prepared, but he writes, quote, \"\"I would challenge his assumption, however, that all of those who are struggling did not perform well in high school.",
        "I've seen many high-achieving students arrive and fail to take advantage of what we offer.",
        "Yet I've also witnessed countless numbers of lower-achieving students blossom when they get to college.",
        "I absolutely agree there are many kids who are fully qualified to go to college who still drop out, do very badly, in part because - do you know that 45 percent of the college freshman nationwide was surveyed by the UCLA Higher Education Survey found themselves dissatisfied with the instruction?",
        "So, yes, even if you are fully qualified, lots and lots of students are dropping out, finding the courses irrelevant, the professors indifferent, the faculty tremendously caring more about their research.",
        "So, certainly, there are many fully-qualified kids who are also not profiting, which is so sad.",
        "And of course, you can talk about some percentage of the low-achieving kids who are the late bloomers, and we remember about them, but in the end, for every one of those, according to the statistics, that are really broadly nationwide, the vast majority those kids who are graduating in the bottom half of their high-school class are devastated.",
        "Not only do they not get jobs but they learn - the amount of value added is frightening, how little they gain for the time and the opportunity cost, what they could be learning had they been in something where they're more likely to succeed.",
        "That is perhaps a community college, or a short-term, community-college career program, or an apprenticeship program, working at the elbow of a master entrepreneur, even joining the military.",
        "The opportunity costs of those kids who were bad in high school, going on to four-year college dropping out, having the non-stop assault to their self-esteem, a mountain of debt and little learning, is a true catastrophe.",
        "And again, some educators would respond that, look, college isn't a trade school, or just a trade school.",
        "It's about learning how to think.",
        "Exactly, and that is the saddest thing of all, because there's a Grand Canyon of difference between what is touted in the view books and brochures and websites of colleges and the reality.",
        "A Pew study in 2006 found that 50 percent of seniors - now, these are not the ones who dropped out, these are the ones who made it to senior status - scored below proficient in understanding arguments in a newspaper or being able to compare credit-card offers.",
        "This is even more startling to me.",
        "A full 20 percent of these four-year grads, these bachelor-attempting, four-year-college-senior students scored at what they call the \"\"basic level\"\" in math, which means they could not estimate if their car had enough gas to get to the gas station.",
        "This is after, you know, four or five or six years, a 100,000 or more.",
        "This is a national travesty."

        "Oh, they're going to be a so-called tradesman.",

        "And one of the things, I would not have anticipated I believed, but now believe deeply is that status is often the enemy of contentment, the notion that turning a wrench is less-than-honorable work.",
        "I really think we need to honor all workers, and that person who does fix my car reliably and at a fair price and quickly deserves as much respect as many of our very, very well-educated people who arguably do a little bit less for the world than that mechanic does.",
        "Yet it's hard to try to stifle kids' ambitions, and perhaps, more to the point, parents' ambitions.",
        "I think the most honorable path that we can take is simply giving people options.",

        "If we don't disclose that and we don't disclose the career options and we don't disclose the dropout rate and we don't disclose what the total four-year, or five-year or six-year cost is, we are committing educational malpractice every day.",
