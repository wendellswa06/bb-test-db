        "That's as a result of the so-called Johnson Amendment in 1954.",
        "Then-Senator Lyndon Johnson was mad that a conservative group was endorsing his opponent, so he got that amendment saying that you couldn't have tax exempt status if you endorsed a candidate.",
        "And President Trump vowed to overturn that in that religious freedom order, but he couldn't do that 'cause it's a law.",

        "So States did have religious tests.",

        "But in practice, the courts have over and over again, Steve, allowed for such things as under God in the Pledge of Allegiance and in God we trust on the currency, congressional chaplains paid by the public and prayers at the beginning of congressional sessions.",
