        "Let's tackle the sides 'cause I find that this is usually where you have more leftovers, like people basically steal all your turkey, take all the good stuff and you're just left with, I don't know what, a ton of brussel sprouts.",
        "What do you do with this stuff?",
        "Well, for raw brussel sprouts, actually, if you shred those up really finely, they make a really wonderful addition to salads.",
        "It's kind of like raw kale, you know.",
        "It's a very nice flavor and great texture.",

        "And butternut squash, carrots, those kinds of roasted vegetables, if you just puree them and then add some chicken broth, you have a beautiful butternut squash soup right there and you don't have to do very much to it in terms of seasoning.",
