        "He first met her in London in 1958, when she was already living in exile.",
        "Together they won a Grammy for best folk recording in 1966.",
        "I asked Mr. Belafonte how he helped her gain entry to the U.S.",

        "I suggested to her that there might be some things that I could offer and some platforms I could extend to her that might help her develop her base in America and in Europe.",
        "And she accepted that offer, and for the next seven years we worked together almost - well, with great consistency.",
        "The first three years she worked on my platform, in my concerts, and we went in several places around the world together.",
        "And we both had a chance to make history."

        "The very first night she walked out on stage with me, at the end of the night she just stood in the wings and wept, because she had never quite experienced the audiences the way in which she experienced the one that we sang together on.",
        "All the audiences thereafter were fairly young because it was a tour of the universities of America that I was doing at the time.",

        "It's one of those things where in certain ways, the conversation we've had today on the show has closed a loop because we were just talking about the influence of music on political participation among the hip-hop generation.",
        "And this is a very different situation, but also a woman who used her music in order to shape politics.",
        "What kind of risks do you think that she took in order to be the woman that she was, and to say the kind of things she said throughout her life?",
        "I imagine they must have been insurmountable, to spend 31 years in exile just for wanting to practice your art, your music.",
        "To want to be yourself, as she said many times.",
        "You know, she didn't consider herself to be a political singer, she was just going about her life.",
        "And I think for me and many people like me, she shows us that life is political, that art is political.",
        "I know that for TransAfrica Forum, this merger, this love, this marriage between activism and art fuels much of our work.",
        "And as someone who grew up in the anti-Apartheid struggles, I remember as a child listening to her and then hearing her and seeing her play a role in \"\"Sarafina,\"\" not realizing who she had been.",
        "Then as I grew up, realizing what she had given to me as someone who grew up in the United States the ability to live life on your own terms, to honor your culture through music and expression and to be yourself.",
        "there have been different moments where Africa and America have connected around civil rights, around international rights.",
        "I'm thinking of, you know, everything from the way that there was a dialogue with South Africa between South Africans and Americans working in the civil rights movement to, of course, the protest that ended - in America that helped provide a grounds for ending Apartheid, or at least the U.S.",
        "participation economically in supporting South Africa's Apartheid.",
        "Do you think that we're entering another period where we may see both culturally in terms of music, and also politically more of a connection between Africa and America?",
        "Well I certainly hope so.",
        "I mean, if you think about it, as you talked about today on your show, more people - more Africans have come to the United States in the last 20 years then in the entire middle passage.",

        "It's not all the military's fault.",
        "It's never easy to retrofit an existing hospital.",

        "They're different, from the way you make an appointment to see a doctor to what kind of therapy to give a soldier or Marine with traumatic brain injury.",
        "Mateczun thinks, in the end, a shared professional background, will trump the color of their uniforms.",
        "The fact is that everybody comes out of a medical background, and that the training for doctors and nurses and technicians in America is very much the same.",
