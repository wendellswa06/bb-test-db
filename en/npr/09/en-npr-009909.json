        "Seeing the ways in which speaking your indigenous language is beautiful, is powerful and can be understood by the masses, I think is a really important point that was made.",
        "I think also, just the strength of someone who could survive beautifully despite Apartheid, despite being oppressed, despite being in exile.",
        "I think those things will live on.",
        "And as well, just the ability that you can link cultures with art.",
        "You can link people, not with just their commonalities, but with their differences through their love of art.",
        "And for me, I mean, she really is the mother of our struggle.",
        "And she will be severely missed and mourned, but also, will give birth to another generation of sons and daughters who will follow in her footsteps.",

        "That was led by former FBI director, then special counsel, Robert Mueller.",
        "It was the subject of breathless anticipation by some and fear and fury by others until it was finally released in redacted form in April.",
        "Mueller had been scheduled to testify this week before members of the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, although that hearing has been pushed back.",
        "In preparation for that hearing, though, a lot of people have been trying to get more people to focus on what's actually in the report instead of what political players are saying about it.",
        "To that end, the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., hosted an 11-hour relay of public figures reading the report out loud.",

        "- when you wake up in the morning.",
        "So what did you think?",
        "I thought it was a fantastic idea.",
        "You know, the Mueller report was something that I had read about and was curious about but frankly probably would not have sat down and read from beginning to end.",
        "And here was somebody who is saying, we want you to - we're going to pay you to read this thing and turn it into a story that people will really want to read.",
        "I just said yes right away.",
        "Had you read it before you got the assignment?",
        "No, and it came pretty quickly after the report came out.",

        "But it sounded like a worthwhile challenge.",
        "I was curious about the report.",
        "It was the kind of thing that I actually used to do when I was a newspaper reporter.",
        "I was sometimes called upon to pull together, you know, wire copy and reporting from a lot of different sources and compile a compelling narrative.",
        "And so it sounded like something I could do and that might be kind of fun and interesting.",
        "One of the challenges for a lot of people is that it is, well, first of all, there's the prose itself, which is very lawyerly because it's all written by lawyers.",
        "But it's also filled with redactions, a lot of redactions, which is a challenge even for, you know, some of the people who have some sort of legal training reading the report.",
        "How did you deal with that?",
        "Well, if something was redacted, obviously, I didn't know it, and so I couldn't really write it.",
        "There were only a couple of instances where that happened.",
        "For the most part, you know, there was a lot of very dramatic material sort of buried in the report.",
        "And I think for a reporter, I mean, what a fantasy it is to have subpoena powers where you can get the chief of staff at the White House to sit down and honestly answer your questions or or, you know, the White House counsel or people who are currently serving.",
        "And here, you know, the FBI had subpoenaed all these people, and they told their stories.",
        "And, you know, while the report itself is not a very dramatic or interesting thing for most people to read, it contains a lot of really solid and fascinating material.",
        "Well what stood out to you?",
        "The venality of Donald Trump, someone who has a very fluid relationship with the truth and who seemed to have no sense of his larger responsibility as president of the United States.",

        "I think of a grandmother who had taken on the care of her grandchildren, who was just sure that there was no hope and no way that her obviously bright high school junior was going to have any chance of going to college.",
        "And when she saw the outcome, that there really was a federal Pell Grant, that he would be eligible for work study, which is included in the stimulus bill, you could watch the visible relief on her face, followed by joy and excitement that her grandchild might have a different future than she and even her children had experience.",
        "We know that the fastest way to eliminate poverty in America is to have just one member of the family go to college.",
