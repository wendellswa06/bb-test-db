        "Even more recently, practices that wouldn't even have been categorized as violence in previous decades, like bullying, have now been targeted for elimination.",
        "A few years ago, bullying was just childhood, boys will be boys.",
        "Now we've brought it in under the umbrella of violence and sought to minimize it for the first time in history.",
        "Yet we always hear: the 20th century, the most violent, the bloodiest century in human history.",
        "Well, people who make that claim never cite numbers from any century other than the 20th, and as Joshua Goldstein has pointed out, the 17th century with its wars of religion, the 14th century with its Mongol invasions, many other centuries have atrocities that can hold their head high when compared against the 20th century.",
        "The annihilation of native peoples of the Americas and Australia and Africa, the Islamic and Atlantic slave trades racked up horrific death tolls.",
        "We're talking with Steven Pinker and Joshua Goldstein.",
        "We're talking about the reduction in violence, measurable over millennia, according to them and certainly over the last 110 years.",
        "Really?",
        "Let's turn to Bruce(ph), and Bruce is on the line with us from Gainesville.",
        "Hi, I've got a question about all of the blood slaughter that's been going on in Africa over the last decade.",
        "I hear about the industrialized nations, the high-tech nations like Europe, all over Europe, the United States, but I don't hear anything about Africa.",
        "And I know there's been a lot of bloodshed there.",
        "Do you want to comment about that, please?",
        "Joshua Goldstein, there's slaughter in places like Rwanda, obviously the ongoing war in Congo.",
        "Elections only seem to engender fears of more violence.",
        "Well, there are fears of more violence in Congo, but the amount of violence is way down.",
        "I mean, 10, 12 years ago, there were six foreign armies in Congo.",
        "It was considered Africa's first world war.",
        "And since the U.N.",
        "got there a decade ago, the war has become much more localized.",
        "Now, there are still atrocities going on in some of these eastern provinces, and I don't want to say that's okay, but it's much smaller scale.",
        "And across the continent, there's been a big reduction of war in the last decade.",
        "Places that - you see, war is more newsworthy.",
        "It's - we think about it.",
        "It gets our attention.",
        "But in places like Sierra Leone, Liberia, and you mentioned Rwanda, where there was a terrible genocide 15 years ago, we forget about them once they are at peace, whereas the ones that are still at war, that we're afraid will go back to war, we remember those.",
        "And that's why we never acknowledge that we're actually making some progress, even though obviously the work isn't finished."

        "Bruce?",
        "I guess he's left us.",
        "Which raises the question: If these are all advances, why are we doing better?",
        "And Steven Pinker, you advance several causes, one of them, and this goes back through history, is the evolution of the state.",
        "Yes, probably Hobbes got it right when he said that a leviathan, a third party with a monopoly on the use of - legitimate use of force in a territory, might be among the biggest violence reduction techniques ever invented.",
        "When you outsources your revenge to a third party, you're less likely to keep acting on the belief that you're always on the side of the angels and the other guy is always treacherous and evil, and your violence is always justified retaliation, the other guy's violence is always naked, unprovoked aggression.",
        "When you have both sides thinking that, you can get endless cycles of revenge and vendetta and blood feud.",
        "When you've got the state and the judicial system meting out the punishments, you can cap the damage after one round.",
        "Now, in the international arena, of course, we don't have a global leviathan, a world government, but Joshua Goldstein points out how the international peacekeepers, which are a kind of soft, rough equivalent, the closest that the world has to an international police force, have, contrary to impressions, been effective.",
        "Effective, Joshua Goldstein?",
        "Yes, way more effective than people credit.",
        "I think there are three big reasons for the decline of war in the international system, one of which is this shift of norms that Steven Pinker has referred to.",
        "Things like dueling or human sacrifice just aren't cool anymore.",
        "The second is the rise of prosperity and interdependence so that you don't get rich by conquering territory anymore, you get rich by trade, and war doesn't work for that.",
        "But the third, which I focus on primarily, is the rise of the United Nations and peacekeeping, which has given the international community a way to manage and reduce conflicts, not to bring about world peace in one big gulp but to go into war zones where formerly ceasefires would break down more than half of the time.",
        "But now most of them stick.",
        "Ninety percent stick because peacekeepers are able to provide that security.",
        "Now, this has been a very - as we all know, a challenging job for the United Nations and one that hasn't always been successful.",
        "But over the last decades, the U.N.",
        "has gotten better at peacekeeping, has gotten more effective at peacekeeping, and it's really cheap."

        "So the average American household pays $700 every month for our military and veterans' benefits, but $2 a month for peacekeeping, so $2 versus $700, and it gets us things that our military can't get us, not to say it can do everything the military does, but $2.",
        "So we could be beefing this up a little bit, and it's quite cost-effective.",
        "The old rule of thumb used to be peacekeepers were good at keeping the peace when both sides wanted the peace kept.",
        "What are they doing better now to make more of those situations, as you say, keep the peace more often than not?",
        "Well, they've adapted in several ways, and one is that they're more robust now.",
        "So they go in with military force that if there's a spoiler trying to bring down a whole peace agreement and throw a society back into war, maybe so that some militia can get diamonds or coal, tin or something, the peacekeepers are willing to use force to protect civilians and to make sure that the agreement sticks.",
        "I mean, they're in Democratic Congo with attack helicopters now, which is not our idea of traditional peacekeepers being neutral and never getting involved in conflict.",
        "Perhaps the recent situation in the Ivory Coast, Cote d'Ivoire, might be an example where they intervened and, well, brought about change and made a very bad situation much better.",
        "That was an excellent example because the elections there had been - they had driven out the incumbent president, but he was holding on to power.",
        "He was beginning to slaughter civilians, and that could have gone right back to another decade of civil war.",
        "And that was a terrible war there.",

        "I hate to sound so cheery on such a sad subject, but I'm a cultural anthropologist of Japan, and I teach a course on the anthropology of violence.",
        "And one of the questions that I have is whether perhaps the nature of violence in the 20th century and 21st century might be considered qualitatively different for two reasons.",
        "One is the use of mass media.",
        "In other words, we may be more aware of more violence, but perhaps, you know, as both authors are saying, this is actually a time when we have less violence compared to other centuries.",
        "On the other hand, I wanted to ask the question about the use of high technology, especially when we look at something like the Holocaust, that the Nazis were very effective in killing six million Jews in the space of a very short amount of time precisely because of the nature of technology.",
        "Could they address the issues of maybe the quantitative and qualitative nature of violence in the 20th century and how you would compare that to previous centuries?",
        "Steven Pinker, why don't you start on quality of violence.",
        "I think the technology has not been a major factor.",
        "We've seen in Rwanda that you can rack up hundreds of thousands of deaths in a genocide using nothing more high-tech than a machete.",
        "And even during the Holocaust, the majority of Jews did not die in the gas chambers but at the hands of the Einsatzgruppen, just men in trucks with guns who lined people up and then shot them in the back of the neck.",
        "Certainly we have horrific images of nuclear explosions at the end of the Second World War, but there too the number of deaths were a tiny fraction of those that died in the Second World War.",
        "And on the whole, I think the motive to kill people is a more powerful determinant of how many people get killed than the means at their disposal.",
        "And Joshua Goldstein, what about the awareness of violence promulgated by - it seems you can't throw a punch at an Occupy rally without getting captured on a cell phone camera."

        "Well, that's right.",
        "I agree with Linda that the media has changed our perception of war.",
        "And as we're getting more and more coverage of the world, little clashes, skirmishes in the remote parts of the world from us now appear on our televisions, if not our cell phones, and so we're more aware of them, and it seems like the world's getting more and more violent.",
        "Well, these things and much worse used to happen, and we were just completely unaware of them.",

        "Joshua Goldstein, is that a factor?",
        "Well, I think it is a factor to some extent, and there are multiple causes here.",
        "The reason it didn't make my top three list is that the recent peace is also extending to countries that are not democracies and notably China.",
        "China has not had a military battle in 25 years, and that's a remarkable record for a country after centuries of war, civil war and revolution.",
        "And China is not a democracy.",
        "So I can't see that democracy is the full story here.",
        "There's something deeper at work here.",
        "Now, China is a country that's depending on trade for wealth and where the leaders take their legitimacy from delivering prosperity, and that prosperity is based on trading with the other countries of the world.",
        "So war is not a viable path for them to stay in power or to build up their country.",
        "And Steven Pinker, commerce is indeed one of the factors that you cite.",
        "Yes, well, a basic principle of evolutionary biology is that organisms cooperate when they can deliver mutual benefits, reciprocal altruism.",
        "And so mechanisms that make it easier and more profitable to trade make other people more valuable alive than dead.",
        "And as Joshua Goldstein pointed out, China has become peaceful as a capitalist country but not as a democratic country, and it's very unlikely, even though much has been written about the rivalry between the U.S.",
        "and China, but it's unlikely that they'll fight out this rivalry on the battlefield."
