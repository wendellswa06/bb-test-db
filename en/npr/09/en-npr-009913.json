        "The target moves around, and the point is to get where the target is.",
        "Yeah, gentlemen, you made some great points, but I'd like to point out that according to the Lancet, the British medical journal, over a million Iraqi children were killed due to U.S.-backed sanctions back in the '90s.",
        "And that's not even counting the current, you know, shock-and-awe type of war that's gone on since, you know, 2003.",
        "And that's over twice as many people killed as American service people were killed in World War II, which was supposedly much more violent than it is today.",
        "And of course we have thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at Russia and China and who knows who else.",
        "So the statistics could change dramatically in just a matter of minutes, you know, literally, you know, 20, 30 minutes.",
        "So anyway, I think Americans, you know, they just yawned when we heard the statistics about the children dying in Iraq and earlier in the '80s about the, you know, hundreds of thousands killed by, you know, death squads, you know, backed by the CIA and so on.",
        "And we go to Vietnam and Korea.",
        "You know, we bombed every city in Korea to the ground, even towns and villages completely obliterated.",
        "And there's been no change in American looking at this war-like policy at all, even under Obama.",
        "He's just continued, you know, Bush's policies, you know, supporting the military industrial congressional complex, which pretty much has, you know, bought our government the same way the Wall Street bankers have.",
        "Tom, you've raised a couple of points there.",
        "One, Joshua Goldstein, your statistics are based on the deaths directly attributable to war.",
        "Would they have included, as Tom mentioned, the numbers of Iraqis who died as the indirect result of economic international sanctions on Iraq back in the 1990s up to 2003?"

        "No, that's not included.",
        "What I'm looking at is deaths of civilians and military directly from war or violence.",
        "And that's easier to measure than the idea of indirect deaths that, you know, because of the Gulf War, then we had sanctions, and then these children went hungry, and you can try to figure out how many people died.",
        "Look, a lot of people have died as an indirect result of war.",
        "There's no doubt about it.",
        "But these tend to move together.",
        "If there's a big war, and a lot of people are dying from bullets and bombs, those populations are also being displaced and malnourished, and cholera epidemics begin and so forth.",
        "So these two measures, the direct and indirect, it's not that people killed indirectly are less important, but they tend to move together, and the direct deaths is a better way to measure change through time.",

        "That means we're on the right track.",
        "It's like if you had cancer, and that would be terrible, but if you went to your doctor and found that the treatments were shrinking the tumors, you'd say we're on the right track, let's stay on this track.",
        "And in this case we're doing the right things to shrink and manage conflict worldwide, and although there's still terrible wars going on, we should stay on this track and do more of the things that are working, such as U.N.",

        "He's right, the United States is involved in more wars than ever.",
        "Yes, but it's completely misleading to say that nothing has changed since Korea.",
        "If you simply say wars exist now, wars existed then, well, that's true.",
        "But if you look at how many people get killed in the war, there's just no comparison.",
        "You plot the numbers on a graph, and they absolutely plummet.",
        "Just, if you take just American civilians - soldiers alone, we're comparing, say, 58,000 in Vietnam to something more like 5,500 in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.",
        "That's a factor of 10, and that's two wars over almost a decade.",
        "The same story is true if you look at the number of, say, Koreans killed and Vietnamese killed compared to the number of Iraqis and Afghanis killed.",
        "You really have to look at the numbers, and if you go by the headlines, if you go by anecdotes from memory, you're going to get a very misleading impression about how dangerous the world is.",

        "It - all of us belong to multiple tribes.",
        "We may belong to a particular religion and a particular state and a particular occupational guild, in a university or a club or a corporation and a country and an alliance, and nothing forces the concept of a tribe to coincide, say, within an ethnic group or an actual tribe.",
        "And I think the prevalence of media have given rise to virtual tribes, such as, perhaps, the entire global community, ideally, and make it harder to demonize people who may not happen to look like us or speak our language."
