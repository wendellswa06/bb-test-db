        "...those go with just being a woman in the military.",
        "And so you - what you aspire to as a military officer is simply to do your best.",
        "And you want to be a good leader, and you want to take care of your soldiers, and you always want to do a good job.",
        "And when those things happen quite often, then the Army or the military will recognize you with a promotion.",
        "So I would have to say that simply being a woman in the military is, perhaps, the most significant part of it.",
        "And as I said in my remarks and my promotion, and there are less than 7 percent of the general officer force in the Army are women.",

        "The reason why I'm asking, my partner is the Marine Corps, and if - and has come out since \"\"don't ask, don't tell\"\" has been repealed.",
        "But I do know that the Marine Corps does not honor gay marriages.",
        "So, you know, apparently, if we were to get married, we would not - I would not receive any military benefits.",
        "Just wondering there - and if there is anything going to be done about that?",
        "Just the way that the current law is written, that is correct, that my marriage, your marriage is not recognized, and that's the point of law.",
        "And as a military officer, I certainly respect that that is currently the law.",
        "In terms of should anything be done with that, you know, I just would ask you to search for the words that the secretary of defense has said on this topic.",
        "The military, in my current - in the last couple of days and leading into this, they have been absolutely so supportive of me and of Tracey.",
        "The entire experience has been absolutely positive.",
        "So while I can't comment on what may lie in the future, all I know is that the current environment since repeal has been extremely supportive in my case.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for your call, John.",

        "What will you be doing?",
        "Well, while I'm a Reserve general officer, the current job that I have is on active duty.",
        "It's a full-time job, and I'm the director for Army Reserve Human Capital.",
        "And in that capacity, what I do is I link strategic policy - such as what's developed at the Pentagon - and I link that to operational execution in the Army Reserve Command.",
        "And what I try to do is to make sure that our personnel statistics and our personnel are ready to support the Army and the nation for all of - anything that they're called upon to do.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take another call.",

        "I mean, that is - it has to be a part of your identity, I would think.",
        "And I think that's something that many younger people in the military would look up to you for.",

        "So everybody filters.",
        "They're looking up through their own life experiences.",
        "So there will be some folks who will look up to me for being gay - and not so much because I'm gay, because that's not really significant, so much as that I upheld my personal integrity in a way that is comfortable for me.",
        "And some people will look up to me because I'm senior parachutist, and they think that's cool.",
