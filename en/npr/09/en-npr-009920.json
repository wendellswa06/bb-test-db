        "Now, that's not mentioned in the new Ron Howard film about the president's series of legendary interviews with the British broadcaster David Frost.",
        "That film, \"\"Frost/Nixon,\"\" is up for five awards at the Golden Globes next weekend.",
        "Now, if you've seen the movie, you'll no doubt have been charmed or maybe annoyed by one of the main characters, James Reston, Jr., played by actor Sam Rockwell.",
        "A year before Frost interviewed Nixon, he hired Reston as his researcher to help him prep for the big encounter.",

        "He's played by actor Michael Sheen.",
        "Frost didn't have a reputation for doing hard-hitting interviews, and you were a little reluctant to work with him.",

        "Jim Reston, Jr., what did you want these interviews to accomplish?",
        "Mr.",
        "RESTON, JR.: Well, there's one thing that they had to accomplish and that is that the criminality of Richard Nixon had to be put on display and proven.",
        "The real question was whether this fellow, David Frost, could really pull that off, whether he would do the research that was needed for that historic responsibility to be met.",
        "Now in the film you're portrayed as almost a kind of a self-righteous, indignant, young man.",
        "You'd written some books about Richard Nixon, and it was almost as if you had a personal stake in seeing him, as you say, \"\"put on trial.\"\" Is that how you felt at the time?",
        "Was it personal?",
        "Mr.",

        "Had there been no passion in this, had there been no deep commitment, had it been a straightforward journalistic neutral interview, then that trial, that interrogation could never have taken place.",
        "Normally when you go into an interview - and I've done many of them myself - it's not like an interrogation.",
        "It doesn't have a goal at the end.",
        "It doesn't have a strategy to move all the way through to a set goal.",
        "And that's what I formulated for David Frost.",
        "We had to take Nixon chapter and verse through the entire Watergate scandal.",
        "Each of his defenses along the way, one after another after another, had to be knocked down.",
        "The movie re-enacts only certain moments of the interviews between Frost and Nixon, and there's this climactic moment when Nixon gets pretty close to apologizing to the American public.",
        "He says, \"\"I let the American people down and I'm going to have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.\"\" Thirty years later, it almost seems like of course he would say that.",
        "But at that time, that must have been unbelievable to hear Richard Nixon say those words.",
        "And you were there.",
        "You were watching it.",
        "Mr.",
        "RESTON, JR.: You have to understand that apology is not in the American tradition.",
        "Politicians don't normally apologize, or they don't apologize with sincerity and authenticity.",
        "That's the historian's question that remains over this whole episode as to whether that apology was sincere or whether it was fake.",
        "Now this film, and the play, of course, that preceded it by Peter Morgan are based in part by your own personal account of what happened in preparing for the Frost/Nixon interviews.",
        "You've been somewhat critical of this film.",
        "What do you think is missing from it?",
        "Mr.",
        "RESTON, JR.: I'm really not critical of the film as entertainment or as political entertainment.",
        "I think it works brilliantly.",
        "But there is beyond that, the question of when films are made about real events, about what is the relationship between art and history?",
        "And because, you know, I lived through the actual thing, of course I hold on to all kinds of dramatic moments that didn't make it into the final cut of the film."

        "I think in - Frank Langella has played it darkly.",
        "But it's sad.",
