        "In the past, efforts by Pakistan's military to rout Taliban fighters from the area have been, at best, half-hearted.",
        "Now, that's changed.",
        "Three months ago, the Pakistani military began a ferocious assault in the Bajaur region, which is considered a key transit route for militants moving into Afghanistan.",
        "Hasan-Askari Rizvi, a political analyst, says the operation has had an impact.",
        "This has pushed the militant element, they have been killed.",
        "And for the first time they have realized that Pakistan military and the paramilitary forces can cause damage to them.",

        "Rahimullah Yousafzai, a security analyst in the frontier city of Peshawar, says the Pakistani army was forced to escalate its operations in Bajaur.",
        "Because, you know, the supply lines for the troops in Bajaur were cut off, all the border posts in Bajaur on the border with Afghanistan were taken over, were captured by Taliban.",
        "Yousafzai says the Pakistani army followed the principle of counterinsurgency - isolate the militants from the rest of the population.",
        "But in the case of Bajaur, the army literally pushed out the general public and then began to pulverize the Bajaur area with aerial assaults from gun ships and fighter jets.",
        "That's true, you know, because whole villages have been flattened, which I think is a wrong policy.",
        "You don't have to destroy the whole village because everybody has been displaced.",
        "And I see some bitterness in - among these people.",
        "More than 300,000 people have been displaced by the fighting - moving to the major towns and cities, more often than not, setting up in refugee camps.",
        "Yousafzai says there is concern the Taliban will start recruiting at the overcrowded camps.",

        "Sure, they'd like more, but then they'd have to defend it.",
        "And that studies of human hunter-gatherer tribes shows that they, too, make fine calculations to balance resources and defense, but that in our culture, we define territory rather differently.",

        "We humans, because of our culture, tend to trace our roots.",
        "And so, while my legal territory is - that would be the equivalent of what the crows own - is two-tenths of an acre, I have an identity that expands into the territory of Maine.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And ditto for the entire nation.",
        "I have a cultural connection to the entire block of land that we've arbitrarily declared to be our group territory.",
        "And so - and it kind of expands outward, and my holdover gets weaker and weaker obviously, but yeah it - it's a sprawling and odd territory and humans even carry some territory with them, most notably and obviously, in our cars, where we get very aggressive if someone tries to invade.",
        "And some argue that, in fact this human sense of territoriality is the source of a lot of our problems.",
