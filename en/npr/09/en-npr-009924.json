        "Yes, hi.",
        "Thanks for having my call.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "The book sounds very interesting.",
        "My question is on plumage.",
        "In most species - (unintelligible) if you notice this, that in most species, plumage seems to be had by the male - the extravagant plumage - you know, sexual selection.",
        "Whereas in the human, it's the woman that wears the make-up and the high heels and all the things that, you know, aren't necessarily easy but serve a purpose in the plumage area.",
        "What do you think, Hannah?",
        "Well, two points.",
        "One is that our version is very much culturally influenced, and birds don't have to fuss with culture so much.",
        "We've decided in our culture that the females shall be the pretty ones, but this is not universally true in the human animal.",
        "In some cultures, the sexes really dress quite similarly.",
        "And now we're seeing a shift, in fact, to - within our culture wherein the males are actually spending a little more time putting on the pretty plumage.",
        "So, we're in the middle of a shift of that cultural sort of display that the humans do for mating.",
        "The other point, though, is that the human fur pattern is probably somewhat related to the plumage of birds, in that it's really kind of a strange little place to have all your fur concentrated on top of your head.",
        "Humans have very little of it on the rest of their bodies, but then the male has this big blotch of it on the top of the head and little clumps of it all over the face.",
        "There's really not a great explanation for this, especially because in some subgroups of humans there's very little facial hair on the male.",
        "The best explanation is that the females prefer certain fur patterns in their males.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And that human populations have been spread apart long enough that the males have actually evolved different fur patterns in different populations.",
        "And let me anticipate - by the way, Kevin, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Let me anticipate a zillion emails.",
        "Fur?",
        "Fur?",
        "Isn't it hair?",
        "Fur and hair and porcupine quills - they're all the same thing.",
        "I know, I'm going to get a lot of hate mail over the fur or hair question because I know that poodle owners in particular are passionate about the subject of hair and fur.",
        "Nonetheless, it's all the same stuff, and humans have it just the way chimpanzees do.",
        "You don't call chimpanzees - you know, you don't refer to the stuff on their backs as hair, and you wouldn't give them a hairdo; it's fur, and you'd give them a furdo."

        "Yes, hi.",
        "I can't wait to read this book.",
        "I've actually noticed some corrective issues that are very similar to animals.",
        "And one of them is the herd mentality, in particularly when it comes to places of worship and things like that.",
        "I'm personally - I'm a bit of agnostic, so when I look at a group of people at a place of worship, it's really interesting to me to notice how the behavior seems to resemble a herd.",
        "And Peter, we thank you for not mentioning that in the context of the news media but, Hannah Holmes, this would be - come under behavior, no?",
        "Yes and the animal that we're talking about is an extremely social animal, like the crows again, or like chimpanzees or dolphins or wolves.",
        "There are very special rules that apply to social species, and one of the rules is you have to down-regulate the aggression that all animals naturally have.",
        "Every individual human deep down inside wants to kill everybody else and have everything for herself.",
        "But because we're a social animal, we have to down-regulate that by bonding with our fellow humans.",
        "We do this in a billion different ways, but certainly getting together for religious service is one.",
        "The human, very commonly and throughout the species, anywhere you find them, humans sing together.",
        "It's another social bonding exercise that sort of makes you feel closer and a little less like killing your fellow human.",
        "A little less, depending on the quality (Laughing) of their singing.",

        "I was pumping gas at one of our convenience stores - it's been months ago and that's not important - but I sat there and listened to various different music with these young adult males come in with their - we have pickup trucks here, and they were playing their various kind of ethnic music, and they were all full-tilt amplified.",
        "And I was just pondering, and I have come to believe that that's a kind of a combination of mating and marking ritual.",
        "I think the use of auditory - you know, you can't escape it.",
        "It's like marking my territory as well as a kind of a ritually - I'm here, I'm, you know, to contend with.",
        "I'd be a great mate.",
        "That's my theory."

        "It's used very aggressively to denote that a space is being claimed.",
        "But also, it's quite common, in the human male especially, to draw attention to himself through whatever means is necessary.",
        "There was a study recently that a male human is more likely to jaywalk - in other words, cross traffic in a hazardous manner on foot - if females are watching.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, there's really no end to the number of behaviors the human male will undertake in order to get the attention of females, and certainly broadcasting music is a pretty easy one to do.",

        "Very well, thanks.",
        "So, I want - this call is motivated by the earlier caller who mentioned the herd mentality.",
        "And I recalled a show on CSPAN book TV where the author of a book - I can't remember the title - cited a study where they examined deer and the process that the deer used to select a watering hole that they would go to.",
        "And the assumption was that the deer would follow the - a process of an alpha male making the choice, but as it turned out, the - as the time got closer and the decision had to be made between the three watering holes that had different distance and time of day, et cetera, and predators along the way - that the decision was finally made based upon the - when the 50th - above 50 percent of the noses that were turned in the herd pointed to a particular water hole - at 50.1 percent, the herd suddenly got up and left.",
        "And they used that same analysis on birds and other species.",

        "I...",
        "Are human - are other animals, like humans, democratic, Hannah?",
        "Well, that's a very tough term.",
        "Again, it comes back to the animal's social biology, and the deer isn't a social animal the way a human is, because herd animals are a little bit special.",
        "And that goes for flocks of birds, too.",
        "They operate by different rules.",
        "They really do not care much about each other.",
        "They don't have a lot of empathy and the kind of stuff that makes humans a little bit special.",
        "They stick together because, if you're one in 100, your odds of being eaten are one in 100, as opposed to, if you're a solitary deer when your odds of being eaten, if there's a predator around, are pretty much one in one.",
        "Humans are a bit different, or we bury our behavior a bit deeper than the flocking and herding animals, who really only band together to - under the hope that someone else will be eaten first.",
        "(Laughing) Exactly.",
        "All right.",
        "Van - Vaji, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "This is an email from Jack in Berkeley, California.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "People often bemoan the violence of our times, but let me tell you, if you go back to - you don't have to go back far - a few hundred years in Europe, and just look at the - whatever they're called - like the - essentially the actuarial tables, the birth and death records - oh, man, were people murderous.",
        "And that was a fairly quiet time, compared to what we see in some hunter-gatherer societies, where there, you know, aren't courts and policemen and laws and really obvious ways of keeping people in line.",
        "The human animal is extremely aggressive when its territoriality and its access to resources are threatened.",
        "I've read so many accounts of a human straying out of territory, in a hunter gatherer sort of situation, and being greeted in the neighboring territory by, you know, a spear through the gut.",
