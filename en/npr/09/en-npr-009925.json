        "I was curious to know your take on, I guess, the killing for sport - on how that is incorporated or how is that reflected in other animals, although I don't really consider us animals, but anyway, I'll take my comments off the air.",
        "All right, Jerry.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I'm presuming that he's talking about, you know, bull fighting...",
        "(Laughing) Yeah.",
        "Although people do tend to eat the deer, and I would classify that as foraging.",
        "But in terms of killing for sport, or even killing deer to eat - this brings up what I find really fascinating about the human.",
        "It really looks an awful lot like a domesticated animal in many ways.",
        "The human is fairly comparable to a big fat house cat who gets a good meal of fancy feast in the morning and then waddles out the door and kills a robin, not because it's hungry, not because it even has room to eat the robin, but because the instinct remains.",
        "The animal has been domesticated to a point, but the instinct remains to forage and to respond to certain cues.",
        "So, people still hunt deer, even though there are McDonald's on every corner, perhaps in part because we retain an instinct to forage for food.",
        "This from Scott by email - add the ability of the animal to both imagine the future and delude itself that its conclusions might be reasonable.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "On the other hand, you can't get any better than the human for imagining the future.",
        "This is a - well, it's just an unbelievably extraordinary ability that this animal has evolved.",
        "The closest relative to the human is, of course, the chimpanzee or the orangutan.",
        "And can these animals - I don't know, they hunt down a bush baby and chew it to pieces, rip it limb from limb and swallow it.",
        "Do we imagine for a second that when they catch the last one, they go, oh, crap, that was the last one.",
        "I kind of wish we hadn't done that.",
        "I don't think so.",
        "It's a singular ability of the human, not only to see the pattern of its behavior in the past, but to forecast that pattern into the future to say, do we want it?",
        "Do we not?",
        "And to collectively say, let's change our behavior to get a different outcome in the future.",
        "And we do that in a way that actually engages that sense of morality and altruism that evolved to help us get along with each other.",
        "We actually apply those precious abilities to other species.",
        "Yet, you also raise interesting question about our relationship with our predators.",
        "By eliminating so many of our predators, which we would think, as a species, this is a good thing.",
        "Nobody wants to die of a disease or fall under the fangs of a saber-toothed tiger.",
        "Nevertheless, by eliminating them, we have changed the ecosystem in unpredictable ways.",
        "One of the most beautiful examples of what happens when you wipe out giant animals is when people pushed elephants off the African savannah - for whatever reason - pushed them off a part of savannah.",
        "The acacia trees marched in at lightning speed and no longer savannah, so no longer grazing areas, no longer grazing animals - zebras, gazelles, wildebeests, all those things."

        "The big animals make a big impact on their ecosystem, and the humans came into new areas as we migrated around the globe in the last 50,000 years.",
        "Each place we arrived, we wiped out the big dangerous ones because we wanted the place to ourselves, and we wanted the prey animals that those large predators were eating.",
        "And in every case, it has radically altered the entire balance of nature there.",
        "There's a new balance now, but it's quite different.",
        "The example you use is wolves, which we drove away from many areas.",
        "They were prime predators on deer.",
        "The deer population - well, held down for a while because some of those people didn't go to McDonald's, they hunted deer (Laughing) for a long time.",
        "But nevertheless, the explosion of the deer population has also exploded the population of the deer tick, and that has created the danger of Lyme disease as a widespread thing, a disease that has affected many people much worse than all of those wolves ever would've.",
        "Right.",
        "And that gets back to the broader question of who are the predators on the human animal?",
        "They use - we used to think of them as the sort of big beastie ones with the giant teeth.",
        "Now, we've wiped out or controlled most of those, and we're starting to realize that really the terrors of the human race are now the itty bitty things that you can only see under a microscope.",
        "We only really figured out how to see them within the last few decades and how they work.",
        "So, now we're under siege by zillions of species of microscopic organisms, and we live so close together, now that we're not in little bands spread across a landscape, that these little micro-predators are beating in the snot out of us.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I was wondering if there are any other animals in the animal kingdom, besides humans, that self-inflict pain on themselves, and it's socially acceptable.",
        "And it's actually done over and over again.",
        "I'm talking about of course - I'm sure the host has never done this, but drinking until you vomit, smoking - I mean it's proven that it causes cancer, yet people still do it, and it's socially acceptable in social situations.",
        "Hannah?",
        "This comes back to the question of optimal foraging, back to the dietary thing.",
        "Optimal foraging describes the balance between leaving the safety of your shelter to find food and exposing yourself to the eagles and the saber-toothed tigers who are going to bite you as you try to find food.",
        "The human used to have to pay a price for searching for food.",
        "We used to expose ourselves to large predators, not to mention lightning and broken limbs.",
        "The hazards that accompany hunting for food are now gone for most humans.",
        "And so, we forage with zero limits.",
        "We forage like crazy.",
        "The same biology in the brain that causes us to go forward and find food, which is mainly a dopamine reaction in the brain, also drives us to consume high-calorie stuff, like alcohol, fat, sugar, even salt.",
        "Our brains are programmed to drive us toward those things, and if there are no obstacles, we will go.",
        "Unfortunately, those things are so freely available now and there's so little cost that we've sort of run past the ability of our brain to manage our behavior.",
        "So, the dopamine system actually takes over and turns you into a sugar freak, a fat freak, an alcoholic freak, a nicotine freak - all of these things don't occur in huge amounts in nature, but they occur in vast quantities in civilization.",
        "Don, thanks very much.",

        "Isn't it wonderful?",
        "You start to look at the birds, and you get a hint that all is not as it seems.",
        "Birds, we now know, are just rampant cheaters, and about 80 percent of bird species just cheat like crazy.",
        "If you look in the nest and test the DNA of the eggs, you're going to find at least two fathers per nest.",
        "Cheating is a really great biological strategy, because it's wonderful to find a great mate and mix your DNA with that one and have an offspring, but it's even more wonderful the next time around to find a different great mate, and you might come up with an offspring that can handle a more diverse environment.",
        "You want a mixture of offspring with a mixture of abilities, so you want to mix up your DNA with more than one mate.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "On top of that, we overlay a cultural desire to stay mated for life and to mate with only one other human.",

        "There has been one survey of human cultures to determine how broad is the adoption of monogamy.",
        "And the result was that most cultures condone multiple mates at the same time.",
