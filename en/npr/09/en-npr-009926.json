        "Stone hiked into the backcountry to search for the pups.",
        "We would stop every few hundred yards or so and do kind of a muffled howl, a lower howl, and then a little bit louder, in hopes that the pups would respond back to us: especially if they were hiding at that point and still alive.",
        "Years ago, a wolf biologist taught Stone how to howl.",
        "(Soundbite of Suzanne Stone doing wolf howl)",
        "She kept hiking and howling until dark, but the wolf pups didn't respond.",
        "Stone represents Defenders of Wildlife, in Idaho.",
        "She understands that some wolves that eat livestock may have to be killed.",
        "But Stone says leaving the pups on their own was a new low for government wildlife managers.",
        "This was a, you know, miserable way that these animals ended up being handled.",
        "The wolves are still a federally protected species, but because they're thriving in Idaho, the federal government put the state in charge of them in January.",
        "Stone worries that the move is eroding protections for wolves.",
        "It's a signal to us that there's something slipping here and that we need to make sure that wolf conservation is maintained at the same standards that we've had in the past, even though the state is now responsible for managing wolves.",
        "Mr. STEVE NETTO(ph) (Idaho State Conservation Official): We recommend as humane a treatment of these animals as unfortunately mistakes happen."

        "Wildlife experts say, without the parents alive to lead the trappers to the pups, it's almost impossible to find them.",
        "Netto says it's important to remember, that wolves have been reproducing so well in Idaho, that there are 600 of them in the state.",
