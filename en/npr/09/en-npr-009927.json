        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: The day is coming when the terrorists and extremists who threaten the Israeli and Palestinian people will be marginalized and eventually defeated.",
        "And when that day comes, future generations will look -look to the work we began here at Annapolis.",
        "They will give thanks to the leaders who gathered on the banks of the Chesapeake for their vision, their wisdom and courage to choose a future of freedom and peace.",
        "That's President Bush, opening the Annapolis peace conference.",
        "NPR's Michele Keleman is there.",
        "She joins us now.",
        "And Michele, what is the president hoping to achieve today?",
        "Well, this was really just to launch a peace process.",
        "And to give you a sense of how difficult even that has been, the two sides were working right up to the last minute on a joint statement that President Bush read out.",
        "And it was really just a working plan for what's known as the final status talks.",
        "Some are hoping that there would be more of a document that would tackle the thorniest issues facing the Israelis and Palestinians, but instead it was this sort of broad commitment to try to reach a peace deal, as you said, by 2008.",
        "There will be steering committees that will meet regularly.",
        "And Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas will also be meeting regularly.",
        "This is what they announced today.",
        "So aside from setting up a schedule for further talks, did the president weigh in on any of the core issues?",
        "Not really.",
        "In fact, you know, one of the key issues is, for instance, where the borders of a Palestinian state would be.",
        "And the president said borders of a Palestinian state are important, but the nature of a Palestinian state is just as important.",
        "So he again talked about the need for the Palestinians to dismantle what he called the infrastructure of terror.",
        "You know, these are part of the - what's called the roadmap obligations.",
        "These are confidence-building measures that the two sides are supposed to take.",
        "He did lay out some of the expectations for Israel as well - as well, he said, and these are the things we've heard before; that Israel, for instance, has to end settlement expansion in the West Bank.",
        "And what about Israel and the Palestinian leaders?",
        "Did they say anything more specific?",
        "Well, it's interesting that the two men have somewhat of a good rapport.",
        "They were smiling for the camera, shaking hands between their speeches.",
        "Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, was much more specific about what he wants to see.",
        "He said this needs to be the start of comprehensive and deep negotiations on Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, water, security.",
        "These are the so-called final status, the core issues that need to be resolved.",
        "He also talked about the need for the removal of roadblocks, release of Palestinian prisoners.",
        "He was definitely much more specific and talked about that this is really the international community on the line, that this is really one last big hope to show that a future Palestine is coming, as he said, that it would be - as President Bush had said - that would be borne out of the negotiating table, not out of terror.",
        "That's another aspect of this whole conference, is to show that the moderates should be boosted in the Middle East."

        "He talked about Palestinian terrorism, that Hamas is in control of Gaza.",
        "But he also said that the time has come for a negotiated settlement, and he said the time has come to end the boycott and alienation toward the state of Israel.",

        "Two years later, the House and Senate voted unanimously to support the proposal, but they didn't fund it.",
        "But the support represents vindication for women like Sarah Jo Pender, a 38-year-old convicted of double murder in 2002.",

        "Let's remember - nine months ago, during the summer, the chairman, the really propulsive force behind the success of Fox News, Roger Ailes, was ousted - with a huge payday but nonetheless ousted - after a series of explosive allegations of sexual harassment against him, all of which he denies.",
        "You know, the Murdoch family that controls the parent company, 21st Century Fox - Rupert Murdoch oversees Fox News directly now.",
        "They said it's a new day, a new climate.",
        "They'll take concerns of female employees very seriously, a bunch of changes in store.",
        "And yet, Bill O'Reilly, as this fresh attention from The New York Times and other places showed, is being allowed to continue despite the fact there had been multiple accusations of sexual harassment against him by former colleagues and in fact that they were so serious that they totaled these payments out in the many millions of dollars.",

        "And in fact, the women at the network say they don't - that they're not convinced of it.",
        "One of O'Reilly's defenses is - hey, they haven't taken advantage of the call-in hotline to make complaints; none of the women who have accused me did that.",
        "They say, why would we be convinced that that would be taken seriously when the network's human relations executives, top lawyers and even president, in the past, haven't taken our complaints seriously?",
        "And if I'm not mistaken, the company has also repeated that line about nobody called the hotline, which implies that none of these claims were really that serious.",
        "Now, the thing that's made headlines the last couple of days, though, is advertisers pulling out of the show.",
        "Does that really hurt the network?",
        "Well, it's certainly something the network can relatively easily weather in the short term if the numbers don't keep growing.",
        "That is - most of the advertisers are shifting their commercials to other parts of the day.",
        "They may have to be given extra spots, extra commercials to make up for the premium that they paid to get into Bill O'Reilly's show in the first place in most cases.",
        "But that's weatherable.",
        "O'Reilly certainly has had scandals in the past.",
        "And in fact, you know, his first sexual harassment claim against him that got public was more than a dozen years ago, and he certainly survived that after making a major payout.",
        "OK.",
        "So that's the short term.",
        "But can Rupert Murdoch, who's been overseeing Fox News, ride this out in the long term?",
        "Well, the real question, in some ways, lies in the hands of federal prosecutors.",
        "There's an inquiry right now taking place into whether payments to women who made sexual allegations against Roger Ailes and perhaps Bill O'Reilly too, somehow that those payments were masked from investors.",
