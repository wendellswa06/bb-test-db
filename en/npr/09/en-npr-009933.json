        "The research was very much focused on trying to understand how to change people's attitudes, with the assumption that behavior change would just follow.",

        "Wood and Neal say that if you want, for example, to increase the number of people who donate blood, a public campaign can work well.",

        "But in fact, we are very integrated with it.",

        "Once we realized that we had this deafness gene, we began thinking about how we might be able to restore function in these patients with genetic hearing loss.",
