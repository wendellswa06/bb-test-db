        "And so he did and was convicted and sentenced to five years and sent off to the Florida state penitentiary.",
        "And there he wrote a, handwritten in pencil on the prison stationary, it's got the rules up at the top of correspondence from the prison, he wrote a five-page petition to the United States Supreme Court saying I have a right to a lawyer."

        "But he was assigned to represent Mr. Gideon.",

        "Gideon went back to Panama City.",
        "He was tried again, but this time he had a lawyer, Fred Turner.",
        "And at the end of that trial, he was found not guilty.",
        "So right from the outset, we see what a difference a lawyer can make to a poor person accused for a crime.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so what are the key parts of that decision, and why is it so important?",
        "Well, the most important part of it is that it says that any person who is facing any kind of serious crime, and then the court extended it later to say any child who might be committed to a juvenile institution and then any person who's facing any loss of freedom at all, even in a so-called petty case because loss of freedom is serious business, that in all of those a person is entitled to a lawyer to represent them so they don't stand alone at the bar of justice.",
        "And now, in reality, 50 years later, most of the time that means if somebody is indigent that they would be defended by a public defender.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Well, they would be assigned a lawyer, not necessarily a public defender.",
        "A number of jurisdictions - Florida right after Gideon set up public defender offices in each of its judicial circuits.",
        "But a number of other states resisted and basically just ignored Gideon.",
        "And maybe lawyers were just appointed.",
        "For a long time if you were a member of the bar in places like Alabama or Georgia, you just got a criminal case every so often, and you did it for free because part of the privilege of practicing law carried with it the obligation to represent poor people.",
        "Alabama, Michigan, Texas, even California.",
        "It leaves it up to each county.",
        "So you may have a public defender, that is a fulltime lawyer employed by an office that specializes in these cases, but it may also be just a lawyer who's appointed and paid a very small amount, either by the case or by the hour, and even today we still have low-bid contracts.",
        "A number of counties in California bid out the defense of people to whoever submits the lowest bid, which of course means you spend as little time on each case as possible and handle the highest volume possible.",
