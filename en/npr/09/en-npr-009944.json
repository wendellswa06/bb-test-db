        "And most states or counties, many states have left this up to their counties or parishes, have no incentive to provide lawyers to the people that they're trying to convict and fine and imprison and execute.",
        "In fact, a very mediocre or poor system of providing representation for poor people makes it easier to convict them.",
        "And so there just has been incredible underfunding, and what that has meant is huge caseloads for either the public defenders or the private lawyers who get assigned these ed thhe private lawywersprivddefense systems, quote, exist to",
        "And you've pointed out in your writing the incredible imbalance in that prosecutors' offices tend to be very well-funded.",
        "Very well-funded, and of course they have all the law enforcement agencies, state and federal.",
        "They have the crime labs.",
        "The federal government, not only do the states pretty generously fund their prosecutors and their attorneys general, but the federal government, the Department of Justice, gives huge grants to law enforcement and to prosecution.",
        "On the other side of the ledger, the states are very stingy with regard to funding indigent defense.",

        "If the prosecution - and this is the case in almost - most cases, the only investigation is done by law enforcement and by the prosecution.",
        "There is none done on the defense side because the defense may not have an investigator, or it may have one investigator, like in Missouri, for 1,500 cases.",
        "So the prosecutor has all the information, all the ability to charge, and now really has pretty much the ability to influence the sentence because of the sentencing laws that we have now with mandatory minimums and repeat offenders and sentencing guidelines, make it possible for prosecutors to sort of manipulate the process.",
        "So they can relegate the defense lawyer to just being a messenger in some cases, just conveying the plea offer.",

        "Not long after that, a judge takes the bench, and they all plead guilty.",
        "They're sentenced, and that's the total legal representation, that's the total time before a judge that these people have.",
        "Now of course that doesn't happen in every case, and it doesn't happen everywhere, but it happens an awful lot of the time.",
        "And by the same token, the people who are released on bond will come into court.",
        "They'll meet their lawyer for the first time.",
        "They'll have one of these quick conversations, plead guilty, be sentenced, and that's all the legal representation they're ever going to have.",

        "The lawyer knows nothing about the client.",
        "The lawyer knows absolutely nothing about the charges.",
        "So they really can't engage the prosecutor in any kind of negotiations, and they can't give the client professional, informed advice about what to do, whether to go to trial or whether to take the plea.",

        "And when he called the lawyer, they answered the phone Kelly's Keg, which was a bar across the street from the courthouse.",
        "Now Wilson already had a lot of misgivings about this lawyer because he practiced out of his home, where there was a Budweiser beer sign on the wall.",
        "And so the next time he got to court, he said to the judge, you know, I'm from Detroit.",
        "I'm facing the death penalty.",
        "I don't have a friend in this town.",
        "I need a real lawyer.",
        "And the judge said, well, Mr. Wilson, you can have any lawyer you want, but this is your court-appointed lawyer.",
        "This is your court-appointed lawyer.",
        "And every time they come to court, Mr. Wilson would try to fire the lawyer and get a better lawyer, and every time the judge would say no. And of course you can imagine the relationship between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hagedorn, the lawyer, was deteriorating as this went on."

        "Ninety-seven percent of federal cases are in - 97 percent of convictions are obtained by plea bargain.",
