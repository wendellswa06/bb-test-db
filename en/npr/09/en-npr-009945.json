        "We're going to bring in a guest now who's very relevant to your case.",
        "You might want to listen to this.",
        "And thanks so much for calling in.",
        "Thank you, and this has been very encouraging.",
        "I appreciate it.",
        "OK, great, bye-bye, thank you.",

        "Thanks so much for being with us, Doug.",
        "So I understand that the public defender system in Colorado is different from what goes on in a lot of the rest of the country.",
        "Explain that.",
        "How so?",
        "Well, I certainly hope we are.",
        "We've been around since 1970.",
        "We were created by the state legislature as a result of the Gideon decision.",
        "So we've got 43 years under our belt, and we are a state system.",
        "We're a system that is funded by the state legislature, and that's a lot different than most jurisdictions.",
        "So I have 21 offices, trial offices across the state and an appellate division.",
        "We're up to about 413 lawyers now statewide.",
        "And it sets both a consistent representation standard across the state because I do all the hiring and firing at the state office, and we set standards that we expect people to meet.",
        "We set our - we have a great training program.",
        "We set our training standards here.",
        "And I just think it's a different creature when you are a state system than the court-appointed system or the low-bid system or the county system because of the consistency and the camaraderie that we have throughout the system.",
        "We've got 400 lawyers that rely on each other every day.",
        "Yeah, let me ask you about your hiring and your training because I think one of the real stereotypes regarding public defenders in general, you know, maybe perhaps because of the way they sometimes are portrayed in the media or on television, is that they're not always the best lawyers, they don't go into it for idealistic reasons but just because they can't find a job elsewhere.",
        "Number one, is that true, those stereotypes?",
        "I'm certain it's true in some places.",
        "It's not true here.",
        "I mean the state - here's what I look for (unintelligible) we hired 50 lawyers last year.",
        "We had 800 resumes for those 50 positions.",
        "What I care about when I'm hiring someone is, first, what have you done with poor people?",
        "What have you done with our client base?",
        "Why do you want to work with our folks?",
        "Because we try to be a very client-centered system.",
        "They are the people that need our help.",
        "That's who we need to focus on.",
        "It's not about the lawyer, and it's not about getting a job.",
        "It's not about getting pay.",
        "The second thing is clinical work in law schools, and have you worked with a public defender system, whether it's ours or somewhere else.",
        "So those are the starting points.",
        "If you don't meet those minimum qualifications, I don't talk to you about a job."

        "I did - I'm a private lawyer who did court-appointed cases.",
        "I think you called it a low pay position.",
        "Well, it was low pay, but I did happen to like it.",
        "And what I want to say is in Boston and surrounding counties, some of the best public defenders - best criminal defense attorneys in the state were public defenders or members of the private bar who took court-appointed cases.",
        "And I know there's a discrepancy, but I just want to say that sometimes it's excellent because it was in Boston.",
        "And just by coincidence, I was listening to the story, the shows this morning, you talked about Colorado.",
        "I had a roommate for a couple of years in Colorado who got, I think, railroaded by his public defender, and I was astounded at what happened or didn't happen in his case in Colorado.",
        "So it may not be consistent.",
        "But Boston area was excellent.",
        "All right.",
        "Stephen?",
        "Well, I would just say this: I know from firsthand observation that there's no question that in Massachusetts the lawyers provided to represent poor people accused of a crime are quite good.",
        "Both lawyers that are appointed from private practice, which most of the cases are, as well as the public defenders in that state.",

        "I was prosecuted in federal court.",
        "My family spent many thousands of dollars on my defense.",
        "My co-defendants with court-appointed lawyers received exactly the same treatment with sentences in line with the one I received.",
        "The evolved efficiency of the public defender plea system saves the courts and defendants untold amounts of time and money.",
        "My experience has been that nearly 100 percent of the defendants get exactly what they deserve, including me.",
        "I wonder if you can respond to that, Douglas Wilson?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think, you know, Steve talked earlier about the tremendous power that the prosecutors have and certainly in the federal system - in the state system as well.",
        "I mean we basically lost our right to have jury trials by our peers because of the minimum mandatory sentences and the charges that get stacked.",
        "I've rarely seen a case anymore that isn't overcharged.",
        "So while somebody may be guilty of something, they're usually not guilty of everything that's been thrown at them.",
        "And we as defense lawyers are pushed into this position oftentimes of entering pleas in order to avoid the more serious consequences."

        "The prosecution for whatever reason appealed the case, and the court of appeals held that the lawyer had to take the case.",
        "Any other lawyer would have an ethical obligation not to take a case which he or she could not handle competently, but public defenders often have cases just piled on them.",
        "And one of the critical things here is the independence of the public defender.",
