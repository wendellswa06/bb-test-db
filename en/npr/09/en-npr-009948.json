        "Well, the tool we used was a CT scanner.",
        "And CT scans demonstrated the calcium that are in arteries.",
        "And the calcium is part of the disease process that causes heart attacks and stroke.",
        "So it's a clue.",

        "What is amazing is sometimes the arteries were there.",
        "So these bodies are 3,000 years old or older, and we can still make out parts of the body - the aorta.",
        "We could see the calcium inside the aorta, inside the wall of the vessel.",
        "Now, some other times, the soft tissue, the arteries, had dissolved away and what was left was the calcium."
