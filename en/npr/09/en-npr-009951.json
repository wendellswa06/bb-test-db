        "Very well.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I was against the auto bailouts for the reason that people always talked about capitalism failing and not actually working due to the recent recession.",
        "But the way I look at it is, that if you're always giving bailouts to industries or to certain companies, you're not really giving capitalism the chance that it needs to be true capitalism and work.",
        "Because whenever somebody is running a company and they make bad decisions, bad choices, that means they have the chance to lose everything because of bad choices they made.",
        "Whereas the companies being frugal, being smart about their choices, not taking too big of a risk, will - may end up actually, you know, reaping all the benefits and that helps everybody around them.",
        "And so, it just seems like we always go these bailouts, you know, from the airline industry - 10, 20 years ago - to this.",
        "It seems like there's getting bigger, and worse and worse.",
        "And I think part of the cause is the fact that we're not truly giving capitalism a chance.",
        "This is the moral hazard argument, Dan.",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, people when think of capitalism, they tend to pin on capitalism the idea that you can only have successes, we can only have profits.",
        "And that when there are losses and when there are bankruptcies, well capitalism has failed.",
        "Well, losses and bankruptcy are just as much a part of capitalism as the upside.",
        "But that can be cold and cruel, too.",
        "It can be cold and cruel and we have social safety nets.",
        "This was a particularly severe recession that we went through.",
        "And this industry was - has a lot of overcapacity.",
        "So it's taking - we would do for a reckoning.",
        "And quite frankly, before get too triumphalistic about GM's recent successes - and, you know, I'm sort of equivocal about how GM does by itself.",
        "I'd like the auto industry to succeed, but the jury is still out.",
        "If fuel prices stay where they are, GM is going to have to figure out how to compete in the small car market.",
        "In 2010, it had about 8.4 percent of that market.",
        "This year, it has the Chevy Cruze, which it's selling with a lot of sales rebates, a lot of premonition.",
        "Whether the Cruze is the answer, we don't know.",
        "The Chevy Volt, which they've talked about quite a lot, is $41,000.",
        "It's not exactly an economy car.",
        "There are lot of concerns about how it's going to perform during the cold months.",
        "And right now, the biggest purchaser of Chevy Volts is GE.",
        "Jeff Immelt, President Obama's right-hand man on the - his manufacturing and economy committee, has agreed to buy 50,000 Chevy Volts.",
        "Well, it gives the impression that we do have industrial policy going on and that people hands are on the lever and that there are some sort of a cabal deciding, you know, how the economy is going to function going forward.",
        "So, the sooner the government divest of GM, I think the better we'll all be.",
        "But it's going to be difficult for that happen and make the taxpayers whole at the same time.",
        "The stock price needs to be at $53 a share.",
        "The 500 million shares that the government still holds need to be sold at an average price of $53.",
        "Right now, the stock price is $31.",
        "And what's suppressing the stock price is the market's knowledge that the biggest shareholder, the government, wants to dump these shares.",
        "So that's going to be with us for a while."

        "And if you could say it in 30 seconds, which is all we've got.",
        "I can.",
        "On the winners and losers issue and the moral hazard, let's not forget that, you know, the neighborhood was on fire when these decisions were made.",
        "And leaders in governments choose winners and losers all the time, especially during times of calamity.",
        "And the administration, I think, having covered it and read insider accounts, decided that they could get their arms around saving GM and Chrysler.",
        "And in doing so, we're able to save, you know, upwards to two million jobs that would have, sort of, gone to the wind - maybe come back, maybe not.",
        "And we're going to have to stop you there.",

        "He scraped together a living writing freelance obituaries for the Boston Globe but drifted along, working sporadically on a novel, until he spotted a job opening that offered steady pay and health coverage: librarian at a prison in Boston.",
        "When he started to work inside, Steinberg discovered that the prison library is a community center, when one prisoner plans the cooking show he'll host when he gets out, to be called \"\"Thug Sizzle\"\"; a fragile prostitute connects with Sylvia Plath; and a lot of other people share their ambitions, heartbreak and a good deal of humor.",
        "Later in the program, NPR's Jason Beaubien on the cost of almost four years of Mexico's war with the drug cartels.",
        "But first, if you've spent time in a prison, either as an inmate or on staff, we want to hear how you used the library there."

        "And these were called kites.",
        "Yeah, that was the term that people used, kite as in the kite, the kind of kite you fly in the sky.",

        "Sometimes they are directed to specific individuals, but sometimes, as you suggest, just messages in a bottle.",
        "That's right.",
