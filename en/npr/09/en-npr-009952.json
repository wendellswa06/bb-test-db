        "Yeah, it certainly did, Neal.",
        "You quoted the chairman of the London County Council.",
        "Another thing he said in a speech once was: I'm always haunted by the awfulness of London.",
        "I guess civic leaders weren't obliged to be boosters back then to the same extent.",
        "But conditions in London in the 1880s were wretched.",
        "It was urbanizing very rapidly, gaining about a million people a decade.",
        "And those people were fleeing a depressed countryside, and they were finding where they were living were hovels, basically, without - with even fewer of the modern conveniences that you might find in some third world cities today.",
        "You also, in your piece, compared London then to a city that's undergone much the same kind of explosive growth as Steve was describing about Karachi and in much the same time frame, Seoul, South Korea.",
        "Yeah, I did.",
        "I was trying to get at the - as you said at the beginning, urbanization is a fact.",
        "There doesn't seem to be any indication that we can stop it.",
        "It's going to continue growing basically because economic development doesn't seem to be possible without it, at least as far as we can tell.",
        "So the question becomes: What are we doing with these growing cities?",
        "And so I wanted to look, to compare what had happened in the developed world of Europe and North America with an example of what's been going on in Asia.",
        "And I picked Seoul basically because on the whole, they seem to have managed it pretty well.",
        "Yet you also describe driving into the city, and you see an almost endless array of soulless - forgive the pun - concrete housing blocks, towers, one after another after another, distinguishable only by the number painted on the side.",
        "That's right, yes.",
        "It's not - that is, to a Westerner driving in, the first impression is not pretty of Seoul.",
        "And I think to many Seoulites themselves, I talked to quite a few who were not enamored with their built environment.",
        "But it all - if you look at it historically, what those blocks took the place of, I mean, in 1960 there were a few million people living in Seoul, a great many of them in shantytowns.",
        "So the development has just been astonishing.",
        "They've gone from a country that made $100 per capita in GDP in five decades to one that is, you know, ranks up there with European countries as one of the wealthiest in the world.",
        "So the price has been not the prettiest kind of development, but materially, they are a lot better off.",
        "And my job, part of my job description was to search and destroy these little notes, which were it was a constant flow of notes.",
        "Also, there's something about this prison, this particular place, facility, where I was - there were men and women in the facility, completely separate from each other.",
        "They never saw each other, never came face to face.",
        "But they at some point would use the library, at some point during the day."

        "So, you know, you're hearing nicknames, and so people change their nicknames sometimes.",

        "That was the word that was used often, yeah.",

        "Oh, Coolidge is a you know, this is a man who could have been attorney general in another world.",
        "Yeah, he was a great legal mind, and he actually you know, we were never sure whether he actually was conversant in the law, or he just talked about it a lot.",

        "Wow, was he helpful.",
        "So he, you know, he basically decided he was going to help me with everything, and eventually, as I found out from other inmates, whether or not that was true - you never know what to believe in there - he was using this to somehow get people's numbers or ID numbers.",
        "There was some kind of con I never quite figured out, and I had to scrap the whole thing.",

        "It made the prisoners human, actually, ironically, as funny as that sounds.",
