        "Bye-bye.",
        "Which were the most popular books in your library?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "The most popular book we didn't have, we didn't offer, I should say, is Robert Greene's \"\"The 48 Laws of Power.\"\" That book was requested probably daily and probably more than once a day.",
        "It's for those who don't know, it's a model I didn't know, actually, until I worked there.",
        "It's I think it came out a few years ago.",
        "It's basically an update of Machiavelli's laws or Machiavelli's \"\"The Prince,\"\" and it's, you know, sort of a self-help book but with a very rough edge, you know, how to manipulate in the world.",
        "That was probably the most requested book.",
        "As I said, we didn't offer it.",
        "Terry McMillan, James Patterson, Dan Brown.",
        "Those books did not stay on the shelf.",
        "We had to keep them behind the shelf, behind our counter, because they were so popular.",
        "So those would be the page-turner, escape books.",
        "Sure.",
        "So, you know, in some ways it was just, you know, reflective of the outside world: same culture, same reading culture.",
        "What they called street books, generally books that - from publishers like Triple Crown Publications, these upstart publishers that put out pulp fiction, urban romances, you know, African-American romances that are extremely popular all over America now - they too were popular in the prison, much requested.",
        "And were the men's tastes in books different from the women's?",
        "Yeah, that's an interesting question.",
        "There are so many differences between men and women in prison, generally.",
        "I mean, on a daily basis I would see both and both populations, and it was like a remarkable culture clash.",
        "And certainly with reading tastes I saw that as well.",
        "The women, I think, like in the outside world, were probably better readers, more consistent readers.",
        "There were different crazes, and I think this also points to the difference in culture, because the women sort of read as groups and not necessarily in an organized fashion, but it would still be like a popular craze."
