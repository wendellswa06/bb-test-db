        "And I also think that it's, you know, there's something very valuable, which - I mention this in the story, but there's something really valuable about having silence, especially in a prison, which is such a loud place.",

        "And these recordings would be given to their children.",
        "It's a fantastic program, and it was obviously, like, you know, invaluable to these children, but also for these young parents who were in jail.",

        "And, you know, childhood for anyone is, you know, a complicated time, but a lot of people in prison did not really have a childhood, had a very troubled one.",
        "So, you know, it brought back all kinds of things.",
        "And I often would see someone standing there with some kind of kids' book, and I knew what the story was, yeah.",

        "And I guess why I'm calling is, you know, I want people to know that some people, when they go to prison, they do make the best of their time.",
        "And I tell you, the world that opened to me I would have never found out here on the streets because I had no money to go to college, you know.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I was - I mean, it was almost beautiful to watch, but it was actually just amazing to see.",
        "And people in buildings pretty far from each other doing this kind of dance in the window.",
