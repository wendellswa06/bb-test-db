        "I was in the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, and I utilized the law library.",
        "All the time I was there and before I actually got into the prison system, due to little city facilities that I was in, and it allowed me to come out from a 40-year sentence and end up getting a five-year sentence.",
        "I had to represent myself, but I end up getting the 40 years off me and having to do five years.",
        "Congratulations.",
        "That's no small achievement.",
        "It's people like this guy that helps you out in the law library and get you familiarized with the different legal books and terminology and writings that really helps out a lot for those who want to utilize it.",

        "Censorship always is a professional concern.",

        "We're taught as librarians never to censor and allow freedom of information always.",
        "But is this a problem in prison?",
        "Oh, it certainly is.",
        "I mean, it's an ongoing debate.",
        "And as I've done research while I worked there, and also in writing this book, yeah, it's one of those debates that goes right back to the beginning of reading in prison, especially reading secular books in prison, which goes back to the 19th century.",
        "There's no easy answer for it, because what is a prison library after all?",
        "Is it like a public library?",
        "You know, does that have that same kind of responsibility?",
        "Is it about exercising rights?",

        "One thing that I discuss in my book is that there are also some things that people don't consider that wouldn't necessarily think about in terms of banning books.",
        "Usually, it's like - when it comes to banning books, it's violence.",
        "You know, we don't want to give someone who's violent a violent book.",
        "Therefore, you know, so it will be a blueprint for some kind of crime.",
        "These are on going things.",
        "There's actually something going on in Connecticut right now, where people think that a certain horrible murder was influenced by his reading of - potential reading of \"\"In Cold Blood\"\" by Truman Capote.",
        "So usually it's a violent thing.",
        "But there are other, less obvious problems, although this is a form of violence.",
        "One thing I described in my book is there's a certain inmate who was a big reader of Sylvia Plath, and, like I mentioned before, this was one of the crazes that happened in the prison library.",
        "There was a Sylvia Plath craze among the women .",
        "And, you know, as a librarian, you're excited when people are excited about books, especially great books, especially a great poet like Sylvia Plath, right?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "But, of course, you know, a lot of Sylvia Plath readers are part of the suicide cult of Sylvia Plath.",
        "And, once again, people in a public library have a right to take out whatever they want.",
        "But here you're dealing with a vulnerable population.",
        "What is your responsibility to them?",
        "Are you a teacher or a librarian in a neutral way?",

        "They can be tremendous centers of idea and innovation, but they can also become centers of conflict and of nightmares, and that is true in some rapidly growing cities, as well as the progress we're describing.",
        "Yeah, if I can just interject, in London it was the same thing in the 19th century.",
        "The death rate was so high, if it had not been for people migrating in from the countryside, London would not have been growing at all.",
        "And this is just pollution, horrible living conditions, long hours...",
        "No modern sanitation, no vaccines and so on.",
        "And that is one big difference today is that the - it is happening, urbanization is happening faster, even faster today than it did in 19th-century Europe, and it's happening at a much higher population number because they've gotten these improvements in health and sanitation."

        "That's right.",
