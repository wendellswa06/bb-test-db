        "We'll continue talking with NPR's Steve Inskeep, author of \"\"Instant City: Life and Death in Karachi\"\"; and Robert Kunzig, senior environment editor for National Geographic whose piece \"\"The City Solution: Why Cities are the Best Cure for Our Planet's Growing Pains\"\" appears in the December issue of the National Geographic magazine.",

        "Yes, my name is Joe Oppenheimer(ph), and I wondered - you asked us do our cities work for us.",
        "And I was wondering whether we might better phrase that: Who do the cities work for?",
        "Because they certainly don't work equally for what we might want to call the wealthy or the powerful and the less powerful and the poor.",
        "And I think that might give you more leverage over how to judge whether a city is functioning or not.",
        "Hard to find a place where that contrast is more vivid than Karachi, Steve.",
        "Yeah, that's an excellent question that you raise because you get to a question that a lot of people are asking.",
        "They will identify themselves by groups, and it may very well be rich and poor and something like income and equality that's been so discussed in the United States in recent months is dramatically on display in a city in the developing world because public services may be so inadequate that the people who can afford their own services live a dramatically better life than those people who cannot."

        "There are other kinds of divides that politicians often will take advantage of, between different races of people, between different ethnicities of people, people from different villages.",
        "There are a lot of - you could even call them tribal conflicts that show themselves in a city.",
        "And the way that a city is built can dramatically affect the way different kinds of people are able to live in it.",
        "Let me give you one historic example from the United States, from New York City.",
        "Robert Caro's great book \"\"The Power Broker\"\" talks about the development of New York and gives the example of Jones Beach State Park, which is in the New York metropolitan area.",
        "There's an expressway, a highway that was built to go there, and they deliberately, deliberately did the overpasses on that highway too low for a bus to travel to be sure that poor black people from Harlem could not ride the bus to the state park, that only people who could afford cars in the 1950s and '60s could get to that state park.",
        "That's a particularly egregious example, but we can go around the world and find ways that cities are built now - whether you're talking about gated communities, which are very common around the world - you can find many ways that cities are built to ensure the comfort of the privileged and not to do so much for everybody else.",
        "And people then in that city will begin asking questions about why it is so.",
        "Yet - it's a good point, yet Robert Kunzig, people flock to cities because there is opportunity there.",
        "It is not simply the middle class and the wealthy who move to these places.",
        "It is people who move to those places, poor, impoverished people, in hopes of making it to the middle class.",
        "It is a dream that is unfulfilled for many, but for some it's real.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I mean, there's no - in general no army that's forcing people to flee into cities.",
        "In fact, generally the problem has been it's the reverse, is that people are so afraid of the growth of cities, including the leaders of the city itself, that they try to keep people away.",
        "But I think you're absolutely right, that the cities do not work as well for poor people as for rich people.",
        "That's a problem that permeates the economy.",
        "But the - what a city can do is provide some - provide greater opportunity for even the poorest when it's working right.",
        "I interviewed people in Karachi who had moved from the far northwest of Pakistan, the war-torn border area where the United States is involved, and met this young man named Friti(ph), who was in his early 20s, give or take, and had come to Karachi to get a better education than was available in the countryside and ended up running a wholesale business, textile business in the city with money that was sent by the elders from his village.",
        "And then more people came down from the village to work there, and they were making only three or four or five dollars a day, but it was a much better living than they could have found in that war-torn area, the Swat Valley in northwestern Pakistan.",
        "Here's an email from Emily(ph) in Minneapolis: What works?",

        "Thank you, yes.",
        "I was recently in Delhi for six months, and it's I guess somewhat similar to Karachi.",
        "But I found the public transportation, the metro around Delhi, was really easy to use for a person from America.",
        "I mean, there's a hustle and bustle there that's unmatched and as well as - one thing that, you know, most people would take away from India is how dirty it is.",

        "I mean, that's my take on Delhi.",
        "I mean, it's a wonderful city, and it's very cheap to get around.",
        "That's an interesting word you used at the end, cheap, and he's talking about transportation.",
        "And Robert Kunzig, that's been the key to the - one of the reasons the cities work so well, when you have populations densely packed, the costs of transportation are remarkably reduced.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, cities exist because businesses locate there, and businesses locate there because they can cut their costs.",
        "And one of the chief ways they cut their costs is just by reducing the distances between people.",
        "Their people can get to work.",

        "So she's trying to outline the stakes there.",
        "And those cities that are densely populated and have good transportation systems, then you don't need to drive.",
        "In fact, your article suggests that New York, the most densely populated city in this country, has the - individuals have the lowest carbon footprint of almost anybody in the country.",
        "Yeah, that's right, and it's not rocket science.",
        "They - I lived in New York for a long time, and I occupied a lot fewer square feet than I would occupy if I were living in the country or than I did when I lived in France.",
        "And I - getting to work was a lot easier by public transportation.",
        "So both of those things mean that on - per capita, you use a lot less energy when you're living in a dense city with a good transportation net.",
        "And as these cities - well, they're growing whether we like it or not - but this may not be a bad thing, that density as people try to attract people back to downtown areas, to the center city, as it were, that density could turn out to be, as we look toward sustainability, a very good thing.",
        "It could indeed, and I think that's one of the hopeful trends, maybe one of the few hopeful things about the fact that we're all getting old in this country, is that we seem to be..."

        "And you're not going to force people to live in a smaller home.",
        "You're not going to force people to give up their cars necessarily, that's a great challenge, but the - I guess the benefit of a large city, a densely packed city, is it encourages people to want to live that way, to make that tradeoff.",

        "Let's see if we can go next to Pear(ph), and Pear's with us from Portland.",
        "Yeah, well, in Portland we had this urban growth boundary for quite a while now, and then four years ago the city commissioned a peak oil task force to make recommendations about what to do as the price of oil goes up.",
        "And one of the things is that as the price of oil does go higher, there will be less mechanized farming.",
        "You will need more people growing food.",
        "Now, maybe we can do part of that in the cities, but I think if the oil gets expensive enough, there may be a reversal: People may be migrating out to the countryside just to find a piece of land.",
        "Interesting, the growth boundary, what does the growth boundary consist of?",
        "Well, it's a - every few years they say that if you drive out to the suburbs from downtown, you will see there will be subdivisions, and then there will be a line.",
        "You can just see this line, almost like a fence, and beyond that is open farmland.",
        "We have some of the best farmland in the world in the Willamette Valley, and so the subdivisions go up to a certain point, and then it's farmland."
