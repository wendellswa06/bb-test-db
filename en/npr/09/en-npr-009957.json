        "We know what happened - and one of the reasons people come is because there is the opportunity for education and better health care.",
        "We know that women who get educated tend to have fewer children.",
        "And I wondered if you could talk about the relationship of megacities to family size and birth rate.",

        "Robert Kunzig, do you know?",
        "Yeah.",

        "I think it is.",
        "It's hard to - in all these things that hard to tease out, chicken and egg, but they do seem to go together.",
        "In other words, people and cities, as a general rule, have fewer children.",
        "And the urbanization of a country goes hand and hand with the industrial development of a country, with the increase in the education level and with the drop in fertility.",
        "So if you're worried about population growth, as so many people are, urbanization is something you should applaud as a way of limiting it.",
        "Steve?",
        "Prime Minister May has been coming back and talking about - that, basically, if we don't do this deal that I have, which is very unpopular, there's going to be no deal and a big threat to the United Kingdom's economy.",
        "Let's hear a little bit of what she had to say.",
        "(SILENCE)",
        "But make no mistake that even though some of those trends may be at work, we're still going to pack a few more billion people on to the planet.",

        "Pakistan, which is rapidly urbanizing, the median age is about 18.",

        "They move there because there's perhaps more opportunity.",
        "But also, they're moving there, in Oregon at least, because they're being forced to by the rising prices in the rural areas.",
        "I'm on the rural planning commission.",
        "We have rules now in my county - and I think this true of most Oregon - where you can't build one house on your farm unless you have over 80 acres.",
        "You can't - the minimum lot size for anywhere else is two acres right now.",
        "But we've been getting letters from our rural land - or excuse me - the LCD, the Land Development Commission of Oregon saying, we want to raise the minimum lot size in rural areas outside of the urban growth boundary to 20 acres.",
        "There's other factors that are being pushed to drive the price up, too, but I won't go into all of them.",
        "But the fact is this is getting to where it cost more and more money to live outside the city.",
        "So there is this pressure to move people into town.",

        "I think I mentioned earlier the author of \"\"Triumph of the City.\"\" He is someone who will argue.",
        "And we can argue about it, that a lot of land use restrictions that seem to be environmentally friendly, in his opinion, may not be and cost a lot of money.",
        "And rules particularly that say that you can only have one house per acre, or one house per two acres, the thing you said about having an extra house is only allowed if you only have 80 acres is pretty spectacular.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "But those kinds of rules, he would argue, make it harder to have a cluster of population, and raise the cost for everyone and make it much harder for people who are not well-off to live in a particular area.",

        "And so, you know, that's - you may not - you may try planning and it may not work out, but sometimes planning of at least affordable housing for people who might be moving into the cities for work might help cities, you know, avoid situations like slums.",
