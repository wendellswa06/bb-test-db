        "What would you say his imprint has been at the Fed?",

        "He was the head of one of the important parts of the staff for - I'm forgetting now - a dozen or 14 years, probably the most important Fed staffer during that period.",
        "And then promoted to the board and then promoted to vice chairman, where he was sitting when the roof caved in.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so he was Ben Bernanke's right hand man at the Fed during probably the most difficult time the Fed has ever had in its history."
