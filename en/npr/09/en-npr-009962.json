        "Well, it's a very interesting subject, and oddly enough, there have been several books released at the same time about this this year.",
        "Simon Schema came out with a book about this, for example.",

        "But as you look forward, there's a huge set of problems coming up that go under the rubric of the Fed's so-called exit strategy, which means basically this: the Fed got itself involved in a whole lot of things that now show on its balance sheet that it normally wouldn't have or be involved in.",
        "And it needs to exit gingerly, not exiting too fast so that the economy starts imploding again, but not exiting too slowly so that we wind up getting inflation.",
        "And that's, in terms of monetary policy, job number one for the next several years, I think.",
        "You're talking about unwinding some of the emergency measures that helped during the financial crisis.",
        "That is correct.",
        "Well, as you look forward, with these vacancies that President Obama will fill now and put his imprint even more solidly on the Fed, do you think the Fed becomes even more aggressive trying to stimulate growth, keeping interest rates low, or does it become more hawkish?",
        "Does it worry more about inflation and maybe raise interest rates?",
        "I think of it a little bit between what you just said, Melissa, in the following sense.",
        "The Federal Open Market Committee, called FOMC, that makes the interest rate decisions, there were more hawks than doves on it.",
        "So, I think the job of the doves, so to speak, in the next year to two years is going to be to holding back the hawks that want to move too aggressively.",
        "My supposition is that President Obama, like virtually every president, doesn't want the Fed to scrunch down on growth too much - this doesn't matter whether you're a Democrat or a Republican - and will therefore appoint to the Fed people on the relatively dovish side.",
        "And by dovish, you mean keep interest rates low.",
        "Keep interest rates low for longer.",
        "Everybody realizes that interest rates are extraordinary low and they need to go up.",
        "The question is how fast and how far.",
        "I don't think there's anybody with any knowledge of monetary policy at all that thinks we're just going to keep the current super low interest rates forever."

        "Same can be said for the garage where the people that work within the sport, some jumped to Jeremy's defense but the vast majority, behind closed doors, they would say they thought he was guilty or they just didn't want him on the racetrack.",
        "You know, NASCAR is like the circus.",

        "One is that depending on how it's structured, if recipients are suddenly getting a plan they have their reimbursement rates going like this, but health care costs are still going up like that, then over time the way we're saving money is essentially by capping what they're getting relative to their costs.",
        "Now, I just want to point out - and this brings me to the second problem.",
        "When we made a very modest proposal as part of our package - our health care reform package - to eliminate the subsidies going to insurance companies for Medicare Advantage, we were attacked across the board by many on your aisle for slashing Medicare.",

        "No, but here's my point.",
        "If the main question is going to be what do we do about Medicare costs, any proposal that Paul makes will be painted factually from the perspective of those who disagree with it as cutting benefits over the long-term.",
        "Paul, I don't think you disagree with that, that there is a political vulnerability to doing anything that tinkers with Medicare.",
        "And that's probably the biggest savings that are obtained through Paul's plan.",
        "And I raise that not because we shouldn't have a serious discussion about it.",
        "I raise that because we're not going to be able to do anything about any of these entitlements if what we do is characterize whatever proposals are put out there as, well, you know, that's - the other party is being irresponsible, the other party is trying to hurt our senior citizens, that the other party is doing X, Y, Z.",
        "That's why I say if we're going to frame these debates in ways that allow us to solve them, then we can't start off by figuring out A, who's to blame, B, how can we make the American people afraid of the other side.",
        "And unfortunately, that's how our politics works right now and that's how a lot of our discussion works.",
        "That's how we start off.",
        "Every time somebody speaks in Congress, the first thing they do, they stand up and all the talking points I think Frank Luntz up here, sitting in the front.",
