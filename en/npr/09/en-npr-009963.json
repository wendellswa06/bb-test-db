        "You now want to freeze spending at this elevated level beginning next year.",
        "This means that total spending in your budget would grow at three hundredths of one percent less than otherwise.",
        "I would simply submit that we could do more and start now.",
        "You've also said that you want to take a scalpel to the budget and go through it line by line.",
        "We want to give you that scalpel.",
        "I have a proposal with my home-state senator, Russ Feingold, a bipartisan proposal, to create a constitutional version of the line-item veto.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "Problem is we can't even get a vote on the proposal.",
        "So my question is, why not start freezing spending now?",
        "And would you support a line-item veto and helping us get a vote on it in the House?",

        "Now, look, I talked to Peter Orszag right before I came here, because I suspect I'd be hearing this - I'd be hearing this argument.",
        "The fact of the matter is, is that most of the increases in this year's budget, this past year's budget, were not as a consequence of policies that we initiated, but instead were built-in as a consequence of the automatic stabilizers that kick in because of this enormous recession.",
        "So the increase in the budget for this past year was actually predicted before I was even sworn into office and had initiated any policies.",
        "Whoever was in there, Paul - and I don't think you'll dispute that...",
        "No.",
        "Whoever was in there would have seen those same increases because of, on the one hand, huge drops in revenue, but at the same time, people were hurting and needed help.",
        "And a lot of these things happen automatically.",
        "Now, the reason that I'm not proposing the discretionary freeze take in to effect this year - we prepared a budget for 2010, it's now going forward - is, again, I am just listening to the consensus among people who know the economy best.",
        "And what they will say is that if you either increase taxes or significantly lowered spending when the economy remains somewhat fragile, that that would have a destimulative effect and potentially you'd see a lot of folks losing business, more folks potentially losing jobs.",
        "That would be a mistake when the economy has not fully taken off.",
        "That's why I've proposed to do it for the next fiscal year.",
        "So, that's point number two.",
        "With respect to the line-item veto, I actually - I think there's not a president out there that wouldn't love to have it.",
        "And, you know, I think that this is an area where we can have a serious conversation.",
        "I know it is a bipartisan proposal by you and Russ Feingold.",
        "I don't like being held up with big bills that have stuff in them that are wasteful but I've got to sign because it's a defense authorization bill and I've got to make sure that our troops are getting the funding that they need.",
        "I will tell you, I would love for Congress itself to show discipline on both sides of the aisle.",
        "I think one thing that, you know, you have to acknowledge, Paul, because you study this stuff and take it pretty seriously, that the earmarks problem is not unique to one party, and you end up getting a lot of pushback when you start going after specific projects of any one of you in your districts, because wasteful spending is usually spent somehow outside of your district.",
        "Have you noticed that?",
        "The spending in your district tends to seem pretty sensible.",
        "So I would love to see more restraint within Congress.",
        "I'd like to work on the earmarks reforms that I mentioned in terms of putting earmarks online, because I think sunshine is the best disinfectant.",
        "But I am willing to have a serious conversation on the line-item veto issue.",
        "President Obama at last Friday's meeting of the Republican congressional caucus in Baltimore.",
        "That exchange with Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan.",
        "saving Haiti's children.",
        "Tune in for that on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "But now, the climate change summit we've all been hearing about kicks off on Monday in Copenhagen, which gives you just a few days to read up on the science, policy and practical effect of climate change."

        "For understanding the science, there's a brand new book - I'm not even sure it's out yet -called \"\"Storms of My Grandchildren.\"\" Why that one?",
        "Why that one?",
        "That's written by James Hansen, who is one of the most famous climate scientists.",
        "The science of the book is a little tough sledding, but he actually is sort of helpful in the book.",
        "He actually says, I know this is going to be a little complicated.",
        "If you want, you can skip on to page 51 and I'll pick up (unintelligible)�",
        "Oh, really?",
        "That's handy.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So he sort of acknowledges that even, you know, that not everyone's going to be able to get through the book, but - in terms of the science.",
        "But it is a - it's a very scary view of climate change.",
        "He is one of the scientists who most is - who's most concerned about climate change and actually thinks that the status quo, that the scientific consensus isn't scary enough.",
        "His book raises the possibility that Earth could turn into Venus, essentially, which is so hot that the oceans boiled away on Venus.",
        "And he says if we don't - if we're not careful, that could happen on Earth.",
        "And he's got some fairly radical ideas about what to do about it, a lot of things critical about how we're acting now.",
        "And he also says, really, the solution is to start building massively and rapidly a whole bunch of nuclear reactors as fast as we possibly can to get rid of the coal-fired power plants that are now contributing so much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.",
        "So it's not a middle-of-the-road kind of book, but it's a book that sort of lays things out in the view of a person who's been thinking about this for a long time, and who is most scared than your average scientist."

        "And so at the end of the war, they shipped thousands of ex-slaves off to other British colonies, essentially to escape their own masters.",
