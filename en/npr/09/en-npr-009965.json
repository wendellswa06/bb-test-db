        "First, the tripling of the size of AmeriCorps, the creation of an education core would create more opportunities for our Citizen Schools, as well as for Teach For America, Jumpstart, Experience Corps, City or in others, to hire more recent college graduates, in our case, who can begin their careers in education.",
        "Second, there's an important volunteer mobilization part of this bill, both the Senate bill and the House bill, which would allow organizations like ours to mobilize thousands and thousands, millions, ultimately, across the country of volunteers who might work a couple hours a week as tutors, as mentors.",

        "But the reality is climate change is a complicated issue, as all of these books help us understand a little bit better.",

        "We need to do something about it.",
        "But he doesn't, you know, but he doesn't to pretend to be a scientific expert.",
