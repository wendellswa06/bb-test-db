        "The best read that I've come across regarding climate change is - that's - is easy for lay people, non-scientists, to grasp is �Field Notes From A Catastrophe� by New York Times reporter Elizabeth Kolbert.",
        "I think she's actually a New Yorker reporter.",
        "Another interesting book that I've read is �Climate Change Begins at Home,� and the U.S.",
        "Climate Change Research Program offers many of its publications for free at its online site.",
        "Yeah, there's a lot of information online.",
        "And I agree, Elizabeth Kolbert's book was - which came out several years ago, was, I think, even before Al Gore's movie, but essentially contemporaneously, was a - I think got a lot of attention, particularly as it first appeared in The New Yorker, the various segments of this.",
        "I think it made people really sit up and take notice.",
        "And I think that it's a - it certainly belongs on a bookshelf of people who are trying to collect, you know, sort of the historical important books about climate change.",

        "Yes, it is.",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "Yes, it says, are we alone?",
        "And the article was on pages 26 to 29, and the title of it is �The Carbon Bathtub.� But what's impressive about the article, I think, is it has a pictorial diagram along with texts.",
        "And the pictorial diagram describes exactly what the impact of all this carbon is on the earth.",
        "I think it's an excellent article.",

        "Leah, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hi.",
        "Actually, it's really weird because what changed - well, what really made me open my eyes was a PBS �Frontline� piece called The Persuaders, which was actually not about climate change, it was about advertising.",
        "But one of the things that it pointed out was that the phrase climate change, that even journalists were using global warming and politicians were using global warming until Frank Wonts(ph), who was an adviser to the Republican Party, suggested that they switch to climate change.",
        "And that the change to climate change as a phrase, which became so popular, actually created some of the momentum for the argument against it.",
        "And to me, that made me have to go look and look through a lot of the stories behind the global warming phenomenon.",
        "And actually, that's when I started reading the Al Gore book and some of the other books that have been mentioned today.",
        "But it was really finding about advertising that changed everything for me."

        "The reality is there could be very severe droughts in some parts of the planet.",

        "And he essentially says that it's been hijacked by people with an agenda and that it's been exaggerated and that there is no scientific consensus and that the whole idea that there's a scientific consensus is propaganda in order to get a certain set of policies to occur.",
