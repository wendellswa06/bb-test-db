        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "He's a more conservative candidate now.",
        "What makes him attractive to a lot of the conservative base is the fact that he stands where the conservative base stands on a lot of the social issues.",

        "Mitt Romney, of course, I think had a sort of a Chicago moment; ran against a fairly unattractive female candidate in the state of Massachusetts, a heavily Democratic state, and won.",
        "I say a Chicago moment because that something like sort of the Barack Obama moment going all the way back to Carol Moseley Braun.",
        "I think part of the problem he's going to have is coming out of a state where he tried to craft a very conservative record.",
        "He's running I think as a conservative.",
        "He sees sort of daylight in this - the field that's developing that doesn't have sort of a dedicated conservative.",
        "And he's going to have to sort of craft that in order to get through the primaries.",
        "Rounding out the Republican field, obviously John McCain, who's run before.",

        "Joe, so tell me who is the new Ronald Reagan of the Republican Party?",
        "Well, clearly, Romney is the one that wants to lay claim to Ronald Reagan's conservative base.",
        "But you have to consider the fact that John McCain has been around for a long time.",
        "He's a true American hero.",
        "He has already been through the process once.",
        "He was very credible in the 2000 presidential sweepstakes and will be so again.",
        "I think John McCain is the man to beat going forward.",
        "Ron?",
        "Waiting in the wings I think is Newt Gingrich.",

        "On the Democratic side, I mean I guess that the latest news is John Edwards, the vice-presidential candidate in 2004, has never stop running and he announced his candidacy last week or a week before in New Orleans.",

        "So if he runs on that, he's going to probably pick up a base that's sort of the centrist Democrats have been running from for some time now.",
        "Joe, we keep talking about people like John Edwards and others who are -there's no shortage of others who are running - Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa; Wesley Clark will probably run again; Dennis Kucinich, the congressman from Ohio.",
        "But what I keep hearing over and over again is that it's a two-person field, it's Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and there's no room for anybody else.",
        "Do you buy that at all?",
        "I actually do.",
        "I think you have to look at the numbers because of course there's all the hype and excitement.",
        "John Edwards picked what normally would have been a great week to make an announcement and sadly it was a difficult week, James Brown passed away on Christmas Day, the day after President Ford passed away, and of course Saddam Hussein was hanged at the end of the week.",

        "I'll say, Ron Walters, we keep talking about the Obama-mania.",
        "Is it real?",
        "Does he run?",
        "Yeah, I think his timing is impeccable because he - if he announces this week, which he kind of said the he might, or maybe next week, he hits it at a stride when the Democratic Party is on the rise.",
        "But the caution here is that one has to parse on the one hand sort of the entertainment value of this guy, the curiosity factor, from those people who are supporting him politically and who will vote for him.",
        "Joe, is Barack Obama the next Mick Jagger or the next superstar?",
        "A few years ago, knockoff versions of this so-called Mighty Mug started popping up all over the world.",
