        "It almost sounds like the British parliament, listening to that tape.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The original chupacabras was a biped.",
        "You know, I thought it could have been a monkey or something.",
        "But when it moved to, the legend moved to Mexico and Texas, then it became a quadruped.",
        "So it's walking on four legs.",
        "And the other things that go along with that, they're hairless and scaly and have big fangs and, you know, spikes on their back - these kinds of things are often symptomatic of sarcoptic mange in these dogs and coyotes.",
        "Yeah, well, I guess it would be scary to see a coyote with those features coming at you.",
        "Tell us a little bit more about mange.",
        "What is that all about?",
        "Well, mange is caused by a variety of different kinds of mites.",
        "These are really tiny little critters that are related to spiders.",
        "They have eight legs.",
        "But these are specialist parasites that live in the skin of their hosts.",
        "There's a lot of different species that belong to this group.",
        "They affect mammals.",
        "There's another group of mites that can do similar things in birds.",
        "And basically they're parasites.",
        "They're living their whole life on the host animal and they're getting all of their nutrition from it, and it's the reaction of the host's immune system to the presence of these parasites that actually is what's causing the symptoms.",
        "I see.",
        "Is there anything similar that humans get?",
        "Well, it turns out, actually, that humans have a disease called scabies, and the mite that causes human scabies is in fact the same one that is causing the mange condition in the dogs and coyotes."

        "That's work that I did some years ago, showing that the evolutionary history of this group of mites, it's been with primates, which is, you know, us and our ape and monkey relatives, and that the monkeys both in Africa and Asia and then also in South America have closely related species to the mite that's on humans, and we can't really distinguish the mite that's on humans from those that occur on the domestic animals, and subsequently they appear to have moved from domestic animals onto wild populations as well.",
        "And with human scabies, a normal case of scabies is, oh, a mite population of about 20 or 20 mites or so, and it's self-limited.",
        "Your immune system will ultimately kill them off, and then you'll be immune for the rest of your life.",
        "When it's in a non-human that they haven't had a long evolutionary time to -what we say - co-adapt to each other, then the populations get really big.",
        "There can be thousands or millions of mites and cause an enormous amount of damage.",
        "It's an interesting concept, I think, that the human immune system is not only fighting off microbes, but it's fighting off, you know, macroscopic things like mites.",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Okay, so first of all, do we - how come we don't have chupacabras here in New York City?",
        "Well, I've not really seen an example of this or evidence of it in the Eastern coyotes here that we, you know, we have here in Michigan.",
        "They tend to be more in the ones in the South and the Southwest.",
        "We do have the sarcoptic mange, though, and I was a graduate student at Cornell University in New York, and at the time I was there, there was a major what we call epizootic or a big outbreak of sarcoptic mange in the fox population in New York.",
        "And it essentially virtually wiped them all out because in these wild host species, the condition is very typically fatal.",
        "Okay, let's take a call now and go to Jim in Pinedale, Wyoming.",
        "Jim, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",

        "Sure.",
        "Hey, the photos I've seen of these chupacabras in Texas, the dead ones that have been found, look exactly like photos of the larger size Mexican hairless dogs of Mexico.",
        "And not only are they hairless, but they also have the same dental pattern, which is they're missing teeth.",
        "Wow.",
        "So these chupacabras of Texas are nothing more than stray or feral native dogs of Mexico, the Mexican hairless.",
        "Oh, interesting point.",
        "And some of those dogs are fairly large, they're 30 or 40 pounds.",
        "Okay, well, Jim, that's an interesting theory.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "Well, it's certainly a possibility that that could account for some of these things.",
        "I mean, I've seen a lot of photographs myself, and the ones that I've seen mostly are showing coyotes with the mange condition.",
        "And the most severe cases that I've seen, typically, there's still some hair left on the back of the animal, which would kind of tie in with that, you know, original legend of, you know, spines on the back and otherwise being hairless and scaly.",
        "And the mange condition does cause the skin to thicken up and, you know, look kind of scaly, and it causes the skin on the face to kind of pull away from the teeth so the teeth become much more prominent and very fang-like in appearance."

        "I mean, it's conceivable one could put some sort of treatment in baits or whatever, but generally the condition has to kind of move through a population.",
        "Anybody who survives is going to typically be immune to it, and then it won't be there for a while, until you build up a suitable susceptible population again.",

        "As the president's senior domestic policy adviser, my job is to advise him on all domestic policy that's non-economic.",
        "So it deals with housing, labor, education, Justice Department issues, veterans' issues.",
        "It really crosses the gamut of issues that really affect the lives of your listeners and Americans every day.",
        "And the Katrina disaster really brought that home.",
        "As we were looking at issues of how do we deal with providing housing, how do we work--getting the kids who were evacuated back into school; how do we help get people back into jobs?",
        "So these are issues that we advise the president on every day.",
        "And it's a real privilege to do so from this position in the White House.",
        "Claude, you sit in an interesting position.",
        "You obviously have access to the president and his ear.",
        "I'm curious what you and others have been telling him in relation to what seems to be now an eroding base, and it was never that large, frankly, and that's the support of African-Americans, many of whom look at those policies, those areas you just talked about, and feel they're being left behind."

        "Well, I think the important thing that I tell the president and what we try to advise him is that while there's evidence that people are suggesting that the president's support is eroding, we believe that we're making great strides to benefit African-Americans.",
        "And in the end, the facts will be supported and will be the reason why I think African-Americans and history will prove that this president has served our community well.",
        "For example, education opportunities.",
        "Under the president's No Child Left Behind initiative, the national report card came out about a month ago and it shows that the community that has benefited most from raising the standards and no longer accepting the soft, you know, bigotry of low expectations are African-Americans.",
        "Our kids closed the gap by 13 points in reading and math, and that's significant.",
        "Home ownership is up in our community.",
        "These are issues that--under this president's watch we've made a commitment and we're following through to achieve that commitment, that more African-Americans will own their homes.",
        "Businesses--African-Americans more than white Americans are likely to want to start their own businesses, and that's been part of the policies of this administration.",
        "So while I think there's been some damage in terms of the media coverage and how they try to portray the president, the policies that he promotes, whether it be education, health care, home ownership, helping people make right choices to get out of poverty, focusing on our youth, and, you know, the safety-net issues, this president's record is a strong one that we'll continue to remind him of and the American people of.",
        "That being said, Mr. Allen, there are, as you know, tremendous problems as relates to unemployment, particularly among African-American men across this country.",
        "There is still what is believed to be, perceived to be, tenuous at best support of affirmative action from this administration.",
        "There are concerns that some of the social gains, particularly those that fall under the auspices of the Justice Department, are being turned away by this administration.",
        "What do you say to those critics?",
        "Well, actually, that's not the case.",
        "In fact, if you look at--for example, while there have been challenges in terms of accessing jobs, our economy is growing and African-Americans are benefiting from that.",
        "So, for example, we know that, again, by getting a good education, by not lowering the standards that says because of the color of your skin or because of where you live or because you may have a developmental disability, we're going to lower the standards for you.",
        "We're not doing that.",
        "That, therefore, puts African- Americans in a position to compete for and to get better jobs.",
        "In terms of affirmative action, this administration has defended and will continue to defend the rights of all Americans, particularly African-Americans, to participate fully in society.",
        "And as an example of that is, again, Katrina.",
        "Certainly the response to Katrina was slow in terms of those who were getting access to do the recovery work.",
        "Under this president, he gets a report every week that points out the level at which small and disadvantaged businesses, minority-owned businesses, are getting access to those development dollars.",
        "And we're making sure that happens.",
        "The president asked for that, he gets it very week.",
        "He is keeping an eye on it to make sure that we're being fair in how we're doing that.",
        "And so I think just the issues you raised, the criminal justice system--we're seeing in the criminal justice area the crime rates are going down in our communities.",
        "There's less crime being committed in them and there are less of us being the victims, therefore the perpetrators there as well.",
        "Mr.",
        "Allen, many people said Hurricane Katrina unveiled the face of poverty in America, but I can take you to New York, my hometown of Detroit, I can take you down south to Florida, out west to areas of Los Angeles, almost anywhere we go--Cleveland--and you can find poverty, particularly amongst African-Americans, that is, particularly in today's day and age with this kind of wealth the country has, at best deplorable, abject by many standards.",
        "How can we really say that this kind of poverty was hidden or even regional?",

        "And all of this as, like you said, a whole bunch of an - important bills are on the House schedule.",
        "There's providing money for the I-35 bridge span collapse in Minnesota, there's authorizing that FISA court that approves spy wire taps, a bill to fund the entire Department of Defense for the next year, and also a massive energy bill to make new efficient standards for electricity and buildings."
