        "In the Oval Office this morning, the same room where President Bush accepted Porter Goss's resignation less than three days earlier, the president praised General Hayden as supremely qualified to take over the CIA.",

        "He has been both a provider and a consumer of intelligence.",

        "Hayden, dressed in his blue Air Force uniform, stood next to the president while Mr. Bush reminded the Senate it had unanimously confirmed the general for his current post just one year ago.",
        "The president called for a speedy confirmation process for the CIA job as well and in his own brief remarks Hayden also looked to Capitol Hill.",

        "Negroponte held a news conference to discuss Hayden's selection today.",
        "He was asked about concerns that it's not a good idea to have a general as CIA director.",
        "I would respond they should look at the qualifications and I think they can also be assured that Mike Hayden is a very, very independent minded person, blunt spoken, and who I don't think will have any difficulty whatsoever staking out positions that are independent and responsive to the needs of our civilian intelligence community.",
        "Negroponte also addressed General Hayden's connection to the domestic eavesdropping program under which the NSA wiretaps Americans without obtaining a warrant, either before or after the fact.",
        "The administration calls it a terrorist surveillance program, maintaining that it's legal to bypass the special court set up in the 1970s to monitor such activity by intelligence services.",
        "So I think we, it'd be fair to say that we expect quite a bit of questioning about this issue, but I believe that General Hayden will be very, very well-equipped and very well-prepared to answer any questions that might arise.",
        "The fight over the domestic spying program is likely to be the biggest issue in Hayden's confirmation, but it may be one the administration is looking forward to, even though the president's public approval ratings are at their lowest level ever, 31% in the Gallup Poll released today.",
        "The White House would welcome the opportunity to shift the national discussion to steps it has taken in the name of catching terrorists.",

        "And this president has been committed to finding solutions that address the root causes of that, namely, the lack of good education, the lack of training for 21st-century jobs, and not having--in our communities, for example, having banks at which you can go to and have money invested, whether it's from your week-to-week paycheck or something else, but that you have these resources right there where you live.",
        "And so you're right.",
        "This has been a problem persistent.",
        "The president made a commitment that we would not rebuild that region without taking into consideration the past history of the region, but also recognizing that we have an opportunity to do it differently.",

        "The economy has created more than 1.9 millions jobs over the past 12 months.",
        "Again, many of those--many of our people are getting those jobs.",

        "No. Not enough of our people are getting those jobs, partly because we need to have the skills, we need to have the tools to do that.",

        "I mean, he meets here.",
        "He's met with African-American leaders, and that's not always publicized.",

        "Well, I'm not quite sure when you say others who've attempted to talk to the president have been denied.",
        "I'm not aware of that.",

        "I work very closely with, again, our faith community leaders.",
        "Why?",
        "Because the president has set a very high standard that we be open to and working with all Americans because regardless of whether they supported him in the 2004 election in large numbers or large degree, he still represents them as their president.",
        "Here's two examples of where I believe this president has made a difference in elevating issues that particularly impact our community.",
        "One of them, again, is the education issue.",
        "As I mentioned, the president's policies have benefited African-Americans disproportionately, which means we've closed the gap more with our white counterparts.",
        "Secondly, an area that has had significant impact on our community is HIV-AIDS.",
        "This president has raised and elevated the issue that is plaguing our community, a health issue that many don't want to talk about.",
        "And the president's calling for this government to commit resources that are going to go after that problem that's tearing our families apart.",

        "Matt Fiedler is with the Brookings Institution.",

        "If you are an employer with, say, 150 employees - so you're buying large, group market coverage; you're entirely in Pennsylvania - you can choose Mississippi's definition of essential health benefits for the purposes of the lifetime limit provision.",
        "For people buying plans from the exchanges, they're likely limited to what their state is willing to cover, says Fiedler.",
        "If a benefit were no longer a central health benefit, you would probably not have plans that offered that type of coverage without an annual or lifetime limit.",
        "So it's just - people would just have no place to go.",
        "And that effectively guts protections for pre-existing conditions.",
