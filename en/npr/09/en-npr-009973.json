        "(Soundbite of movie Silent Hill)",
        "(In Film) This is my daughter, Sharon.",
        "She sleep walks and you have to be careful, but if you see her, please tell her to wait for me.",
        "Not much a surprise, Silent Hill has decided to stay silent.",
        "The film was not made available to the critics for advance screening, a sure sign the studio fears negative reviews.",
        "But I'm sure the massive advance publicity will help the box office chances of this horror film based on a video game.",
        "I was surprised, I must say that, and I don't surprise easily.",
        "I was surprised because 6 million has become almost a noun more than a number.",
        "And Auschwitz has become a shorthand for so many things that I was surprised by this number and a bit depressed by it as well.",
        "You famously wrote a book about Holocaust denial - actually, a number of books.",
        "What, in your view, is the danger of this lack of knowledge?",
        "Danger of lack of knowledge is I think history is important.",
        "History shapes people's view of the present.",
        "I'm not saying that history always repeats itself or history's always the same.",
        "But if you don't know what came before, it's very hard to make wise decisions for the future.",
        "You know, as you pointed out in your introduction, so many Americans think that Hitler came to power by violent force - he didn't.",
        "As you pointed out, he was elected.",
        "And then there began a slow and steady drumbeat of attacks first on the press, then on the courts, then on institutions, slow takeover of institutions.",
        "The Nazis didn't come into office on January 30, 1933, and decide on a genocide the next day.",
        "They slowly broke down a democracy.",
        "They destroyed it.",
        "And I think that is incredibly important.",
        "It doesn't mean that every time a democracy is threatened, you're going to end up with genocide.",
        "But first, you've got to threaten the democratic institutions to get there.",
        "And if you don't know the history, if you have no sense of the history, then you can be blind to what's going on right in front of your nose.",
        "Well, here again is where I'm going to ask you to venture an opinion.",
        "I mean, the Anti-Defamation League reported a large increase - a 57 percent increase - in anti-Semitic incidents just last year.",
        "Do you think that this increase is related to this lack of knowledge or is it something else?",
        "I think you're absolutely right.",
        "I think the two are connected.",
        "First of all, a lack of awareness of the past desensitizes you to what a comment, what a derogatory remark can mean or what it's part of.",
        "And this is whether you're talking about anti-Semitism, whether you're talking about racism, whether you're talking about homophobia.",
        "So I think that the lack of knowledge is part of it.",
        "But I think we're now seeing something else.",
        "Hatred and the ability to express hateful opinions has become much more accepted in the past two, three years in the United States.",
        "Haters have become emboldened, and what they say has become amplified.",
        "We're seeing white supremacy, white nationalism, which brings with it of course not just racism but also anti-Semitism becoming a much more accepted force in this country.",
        "And I don't just mean Charlottesville, there have been lots of other things that cause concern."

        "(Laughter) Very similar to James Bond just with video games.",

        "OK.",
        "So \"\"Kings Of Glory.\"\" What is the concept of \"\"Kings Of Glory?",
        "It's basically a mobile version of \"\"League Of Legends\"\" or \"\"Dota.\"\" And this breaks it down into, like, a 15-minute game, whereas the PC versions take up to an hour or even an hour and a half.",
        "You pick a team of five and then the other team picks a team of five, and then you fight against each other with magical spells and you try and defeat the enemy's base."

        "Oh, this is huge.",
        "Hundreds of millions of people are on there, so they have an opportunity to advertise to that market.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So through the WeChat app, it turned it from a game into more of a social aspect as it has the nearby feature within the game.",
        "So you can see who's playing around you, like...",
        "You could play some stranger who just happens to be 50 feet away from you at the time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the game is simple enough that it's the only mobile game that I would ever consider trying to play with my mom as well.",
