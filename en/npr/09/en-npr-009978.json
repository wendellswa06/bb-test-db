        "Well, let me address the first point, that FEMA has provided benefits to some folks.",
        "And, indeed, they have, and good for them, and that is what their mandate is.",
        "With regard to whether this is unprecedented, just in 2004, FEMA, along with a number of other agencies, ran a computer simulation hurricane scenario called Hurricane Pam.",
        "And in connection with that scenario, they predicted exactly the type of consequences that now these folks down here are living through and living with every single day.",
        "So to say that it was unprecedented or unforeseen I think is really a stretch.",
        "They, in fact, knew what could happen, and they certainly had plenty of advanced warning that this hurricane was heading right down the pike right at New Orleans, right at the Gulf Coast."
