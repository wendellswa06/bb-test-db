        "Yesterday, he took to the op-ed pages of his newspaper, not to argue the finer points of the stimulus plan or the war in Iraq, but to defend the city of snow wimps.",

        "It's really been the House that has, you know, has passed this, has imposed this since 1998.",
        "And I don't think anyone expects the Senate to suddenly take a different course, especially, and this is what's key in both chambers especially now that Democrats are in control - that really what happened last November in the elections seems to have been a crucial point here.",
        "Supporters have embraced this either because they believe in the medical efficacy of needle exchange programs and they say there's a lot of research to support them, or because they believe that city should have its own say-so on how it uses its money.",
        "So it's been this intersection between what here is called home brew and also the medical points.",
        "And what was the justification given for preventing D.C.",
        "from using tax dollars on needle exchange?",
        "Well, and I will quote from one of the Republicans, who spoke - who tried, again last week, who offered an amendment.",

        "On the other side, there are studies in a lot of very noteworthy organizations, from the American Medical Association to Federal Centers for Disease Control who say it's an effective way to not only lower or keep needles off the street and prevent the transmission - I should say prevent added transmission of HIV/AIDS - but as a way to reach out to folks who were using drugs and perhaps get them into treatment, get them into care.",
        "Then, has that been borne out in other cities that if you have a way to reach I.V.",
        "drug users, you can then, sort of, keep track of them and get them into other programs?",

        "There is a general - there's a lot of awareness among drug injectors about the need for not reusing and not sharing needles, but there are still obstacles to them accessing services.",
        "So we try to bring them using the most effective model, which is to take them to where we can find them and we come with the needles.",

        "So what will this mean for your program, Prevention Works, if this lift on the tax dollars goes through?",
        "Well, this will free out a lot of unrestricted dollars so we can have - and provide more support for the needle exchange program, so we can strengthen both the needle exchange program and also the scope of services we're able to offer people who come to us.",
        "So we can talk about maybe have getting another van and operating in more sites, increasing the outreaching education we do.",

        "The people who are saying that there's science that demonstrates that syringe exchange causes harm or increase of drug use are the same people who don't believe in evolution.",
        "So it's a very clear - the science is very clear, but the social science is very complicated.",
        "And dealing with drugs reaches to the real problem, which is as governments take over funding of syringe exchange, we got all the government conflicts about drug use and drug users and the war on drugs.",
