        "Well, you do point out that when flakes are forecast in this area, there is generally a panic run on the supermarkets for toilet paper and bottled water.",
        "There is, and it is often insane - clinically insane.",
        "I mean, I literally have seen cars abandoned by the side of I-66 in two inches of snow, and I've seen these amazing runs on supermarkets and everything.",
        "It's - you know, including people buying toilet paper for reasons that we don't even want to envision.",

        "You can't tell what you're going to get, and there might be some ice as well.",
        "In Chicago, you've got nothing but snow.",
        "If it's snowing on the north side, it's going to be snowing on the south side, (Laughing) you know, because Chicago's the dividing line between north and farther north.",

        "It's at the intersection of very flat water and even flatter land.",

        "No, that's true, that's true.",
