        "So I went digging and found this number.",
        "About 18,000 American teenagers got Botox last year.",
        "All right, so that number is relatively staggering.",
        "But did you find out anything about why they're doing it?",
        "I mean, Botox does have some medical applications, right?",
        "Right.",
        "Most of the procedures were probably for medical purposes.",
        "We know that Botox injections can be used for things like facial muscle spasms, strabismus, which is cross-eyes, or even to treat chronic migraines.",
        "But there were still 1,149 Botox procedures that were performed on American children last year for purely cosmetic reasons.",
        "So do we know if this is something that's been happening a lot?",
        "Is this part of a trend?",
        "Well, I wanted to find out so spoke to Chris Simmons, a statistical researcher at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",
        "And he said that they're seeing a growth in the popularity of nonsurgical, cosmetic procedures among very young Americans.",
        "On average, they take just 30 minutes and cost less than $400.",
        "So that also means that they're accessible to lower-income individuals having cosmetic procedures.",
        "And that's a trend too.",
        "Households with incomes less than $25,000 a year account for 30 percent of cosmetic surgery patients overall.",
        "Wow.",
        "That said, Botox is nowhere near the most common cosmetic choice among American children.",
        "There were over 13,000 ear surgery procedures performed last year on Americans under the age of 18.",

        "I mean growing up for me, what really signified adulthood was being able to cut the purse strings - be on your own, pay your own rent.",
