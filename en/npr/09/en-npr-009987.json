        "Well, it's difficult because, actually, there's very little information about the reasons that children themselves give about why they're having these procedures done.",
        "But there is survey data that comes from surgeons themselves about the reasons that children tell them that they're going under the knife.",
        "So the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery survey their surgeons.",
        "And last year, two thirds of them said that they thought the children and teenagers they were operating on were getting plastic surgery as a result of bullying.",
        "And there's also survey responses about why surgeons say adults are going under the knife as well.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Well, this is where the numbers get pretty weird, for me anyway.",
        "So a third of surgeons say they've seen an increase in the number of husbands and wives who both get plastic surgery.",
        "And after husbands and wives, the familial relationship that surgeons are seeing more of is mothers and daughters.",
        "So explain that to me.",
        "I mean, does that mean that people who are in close, intimate, familial relationships start to change the expectations about what they should look like, and they copy each other?",
        "Or what's happening?",
        "Again, it's really hard to say because it's dependent on the wording of those questions in the survey.",
        "But what we do know is that, actually, celebrity culture isn't quite playing the role that you might think it does.",
        "So earlier this year, another report found that the social media selfie culture was encouraging more people to seek out plastic surgery.",
        "And there's also a really big trend of surgery ahead of weddings, particularly Botox and also nose jobs, which kind of reinforces this idea that, actually, people don't necessarily want to look like an entirely different person, but they want to look like a better version of themselves.",
        "And what's quite interesting as well is the way that people seek out surgery.",
        "So a quarter of patients just ask their physicians for advice about how to improve the way they look.",
        "Another half kind of point to an area that their not happy with and ask for advice.",
        "And the rest just ask for specific procedures by name.",
        "So what does all this mean, Mona?",
        "I mean, are we living in a world where this is just the expectation in the future, that we all get some kind of cosmetic plastic surgery?",
        "Quite possibly.",
        "Six million cosmetic procedures were performed last year.",
        "So Zellweger is clearly part of a much bigger, American industry of Botox, lip fillers and fat transfers that's worth $2.5 billion."

        "Testing all Americans age 13 to 64 would cost health insurance companies hundreds of millions of dollars.",

        "Sheehy doubts that universal testing will help identify the 25 percent of people who are unknowingly infected.",
        "It only really works if people are seeing a healthcare provider.",
