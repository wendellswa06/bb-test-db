        "So on one side, it is a problem of funding, that even in the best of economic times, museums don't have the funds that they need.",
        "Another issue is this Catch 22 that museums are in, because to make it easy for the public to view art, they also make it easy for thieves to steal art.",
        "And visitors do want an intimate experience with art.",
        "That's what - why we go to museums.",
        "And so, as an example, we see a thief had stolen - or a group of thieves had stolen Munch's \"\"The Scream\"\" out of the Munch Museum in Oslo.",
        "And afterwards, they left behind a note that said thanks for the poor security.",
        "The museum then revamped its security.",
        "They put in metal detectors, they put in bulletproof glass.",
        "But then people complained.",
        "They said that the glass prevented them from really appreciating the masterworks, that they couldn't see the brush strokes because of the thick protective glass.",
        "And so museums are in this hard spot in trying to make art easy to see and to appreciate and then making sure that it's protected.",
        "Leslie, thanks very much for the call.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Sometimes they do come back in stings.",
        "But often, they come back in a way that's just simply surprising.",
        "A law enforcement will do a raid on a drug dealer's house and will find the artwork stashed behind a dishwasher.",
        "Sometimes thieves don't realize that auction houses and major art dealers do check their works through international databases before they sell them to make sure that they are legitimate, that they aren't stolen works.",
        "So we have seen instances of oblivious thieves just walking into an auction house and saying what's this work valued at?",
        "Will you sell it for me?",
        "And it turns out to be a stolen work of art.",
        "And then, of course, when they come back to get the estimate, theyre picked up and slapped in the pokey.",
        "Good afternoon, gentlemen.",
        "Im wondering if isnt there a good possibility that a lot of these robberies are of contract type of agreement, you know, somebody who says, I want this X paint, and theyd go out and contract a thief to pull the heist?"

        "Its we just hadnt seen any evidence of it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Do you think that these robbers are more for a form of possession for power bartering rather than personal possession?",

        "It wielded it went through the art underworld, popped up a few times until the FBI recovered it in a sting.",
        "Whats important to keep in mind in terms of the Paris heist as well as the Gardner heist is that while most stolen art tends not to be returned, works that are high profile, works that are well known are more likely to come back because they have such a high profile, because theyre so hard to sell that we see a much greater likelihood of those works eventually coming back.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "So in the Gardner heist, which happened in 1990, two men breaking into the museum, stealing one Vermeer, three Rembrandts, five Degas worth as much as $500 million, the statute of limitations for the breaking and entering for that crime have expired.",
        "But after the Gardner heist occurred, Congress passed a law called the Art Theft Law that makes it a federal offense to steal or traffic in any artwork thats worth more than $100,000.",
        "So conceivably, you could be prosecuted for holding the Gardner heist Gardner paintings today.",
        "The law enforcement in Boston has made it very clear that they are, at this point, just looking for these artworks to come back.",
        "Theyre not looking for a prosecution.",
