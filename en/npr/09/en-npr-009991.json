        "When you were talking about the idea of merit pay and how to go about ascertaining what teachers are - you know, like, what standards to apply in order to, you know, like, get that merit pay or performance pay, I would like to put forth the idea that national board certification is one of the best standards that I've ever come across.",
        "Yeah, so I realize many of these are sort of wedge questions I think hoping to pit Republicans against Republicans, but tax credits have been a portion of every Republican - nearly every Republican health care plan for more than a decade.",

        "To the extent that they can address these issues themselves - and we're always excited when Senate Republicans do their job, not ours - I'm convinced that repealing the awful taxes and subsidies mandates of Obamacare and beginning to restore state control in the free market are exactly the recipes to more affordable health care.",

        "Essentially, what it means is the search for novel compounds or novel processes that might have a useful commercial application.",

        "And that's not necessarily what they're doing--not initially, anyway.",
        "So what are they doing?",
        "Well, the scientists are taking samples--say, samples of seawater, mud or soil--and through a series of processes, they analyze what organisms are there, what the organisms do, what they contain, whether there's a process or a compound that can be further screened to see if there is something novel they can use, perhaps in the production of drugs or perhaps they have industrial applications.",
        "But what's the advantage of going into the oceans, the deep oceans or the shallow oceans, to look for this?",
        "I mean, wouldn't it be easier to collect things on earth, on dry land?",
        "And is there any indication that--you know, are there any countries that are sticking at that possibility or people sort of think that might work?",

        "And even though Gates wasn't directly involved, he appeared to have been a lot more aware of what was going on then he led on to.",
        "In fact, that led him to withdraw his nomination at that time.",
        "And when he came back four years later as the nominee for the same post, he admitted that he could have handled his role in Iran-Contra better.",
        "But at that second hearing there were also colleagues of his at the CIA who came forward and accused him of trying to shape intelligence findings to suit his superiors.",
        "And now that's the same kind of charges we've heard more recently of intelligence being politicized by the current Bush administration.",
        "Are there any other, I guess we inevitably have to refer to them as red flags, that you think people might actually seize on during these confirmation hearings?",
        "Well, there might be some questions about a 22-year-old memo that Gates wrote that surfaced just last week in which he advocated carrying out air strikes against Nicaragua, and this even after Congress had banned spending money for such activities.",
        "Now what year was this?",

        "Now, Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who'll be the Armed Services Committee's next chairman, says he does intend to ask Gates whether he has any further thoughts on his lack of memory regarding Iran-contra.",
        "But Levin says he's mainly interested in giving Gates what he calls a fair and fresh look.",
        "And Rhode Island's Jack Reed, who's another leading Democrat on the armed services panel, praised Gates this week for what he said was a different attitude from Rumsfeld's."
