        "Are there political hazards, potentially, for the Democrats in these hearings too?",
        "Well, I think certainly if Gates does not turn out to be the kind of defense secretary that they wanted - you know, when Rumsfeld went before the Senate panel five years ago now, he had what everyone called was a love-fest for his confirmation hearing.",

        "The outgoing majority leader, Senator Frist, says he wants the Senate to confirm Mr. Gates by the end of next week.",
        "Is that likely?",
        "I think it's very likely, and if it doesn't happen for any reason, the next Senate that's sworn in would be able to consider his nomination with the hearing that's being held next week.",

        "The Pentagon wanted to move the 31 B-1B bombers now based in South Dakota to Texas.",
        "The Defense Department said the closure would save almost $2 billion, but commissioners questioned those savings, saying moving the bombers would cost some $20 million and result in all of the long-range attack bombers being based at one facility.",

        "The decision to keep Ellsworth open, combined with votes earlier in the week to spare two major facilities in New England, raises questions about political influence on the BRAC Commission.",
        "Lawmakers from the affected states had lobbied heavily in favor of their facilities, but Pat Towell of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments doubts that politics played much of a role in influencing the commission's votes.",

        "Right.",
        "But the difference is, when the soldier comes home now and finds society disengaged and not paying attention, it's a bit more painful, I think, because he's cautious he's going back in 12 months.",
        "And he's going back into a war that he now knows that the majority of the American people don't like, don't support, and want to get out of.",
        "Yet he's going back into this cauldron, an extremely difficult environment where there is nowhere - area where you're safe, where the climate is horrific, where the main killer of American troops is roadside bombs, basically an invisible enemy that may be in any dead animal or any garbage pile or box along the side of the roads, the entire environment threatening.",
        "And he's going to go back with the knowledge, the certain knowledge that if he is a frontline troop, he is going to lose some of his closest friends in the world.",
        "So, on the one hand, this kind of gnawing sense that we're stuck in a war out there, they're busting their hearts for, they're bleeding and sweating for, yet, America doesn't seem to be really engaged in the war.",

        "We really, you know, fought well.",

        "It took us four years to get to the right strategy and the problem is that it maybe too little too late.",
        "At the same time, the purpose of this counteroffensive, as popularly called the surge - the purpose of it is not just to improve security in Baghdad, its stated purpose, its stated strategic goal, was to create a political breathing space, an opening in which Iraqi political leaders could achieve reconciliation.",
