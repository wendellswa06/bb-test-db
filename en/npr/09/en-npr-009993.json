        "I mean - so, I think that they're capable of doing it, it's just, you just have to keep training them.",

        "Yes.",

        "I have a question now before I have time for a comment.",

        "And I think that many of the higher level generals and people in the Defense Department that knew better didn't speak out soon enough and loudly enough.",

        "Here we are, four years later, with our 60,000 troops.",
        "It was a unrealistic approach.",

        "A war we went to on false premises.",
        "The first all-volunteer force war of a sustained ground war overseas.",

        "I was struck that during World War II, 17 division commanders were relieved.",
        "Four corps commanders were relieved.",
        "In this war, not a single general has been relieved.",
        "Except maybe with an asterisk for Janis Karpinski, the Abu Ghraib commander.",

        "Well, I think he also brings up not only is it different from many other wars, it's substantially different from the firs Gulf War, which seemed counterintuitive.",
        "I mean, couldn't we have learned something?",
        "Well, the first Gulf War also - I almost hesitate to call it a war.",
        "It was a four-day ground campaign.",
        "You know, it was a blip.",
        "And I think probably 100 years from now, it'll be remembered not as a separate war, but as the beginning of a 25-year American war in Iraq, which begun with that ground campaign, and then we had 12 or so years of this no-fly zone stuff with, sort of, operations on the periphery, some special operations inside Iraq and CIA inside Iraq.",
        "And now, we're stuck in Iraq.",
