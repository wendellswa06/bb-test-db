        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Tom Ricks, what do you think of Nelson's criticizing the dissolution of the Baathist?",
        "I agree with it, but I think it's part of the larger problem.",
        "I have a chapter about this in \"\"Fiasco\"\" called \"\"How to Create Insurgency.\"\" And Ambassador Bremer did three things back in '03 that helped to create the insurgency.",
        "He had deBaathification, basically anybody who'd held a position of authority in Iraq was told they were banned from participating in the future of the society.",
        "Second, he dissolved Iraqi military.",
        "After we had leafleted(ph) at the Iraqi military for months saying, don't fight us, we'll take care of you.",
        "And then he implemented free market policies and they shut down inefficient government on factories.",
        "So a Fallujah brick factory is shut down, and suddenly you have a bunch of young men out there looking for work and you have people saying, I'll pay you to plant bombs.",
        "And so, Bremer basically solved three problems facing the insurgency as it emerged.",
        "Any group of rebels has three basic problems, recruiting, arming and financing.",
        "And through American mistakes, Bremer's and the US military's, we solved those three problems for the insurgency.",
        "Let's hear from Tom(ph) in San Francisco.",
        "Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hello.",
        "Well, it's right, and that there was a Sunni leadership out there.",
        "But there were a lot of Shiite officers and you had many, many Shiites in the enlisted ranks - that is to say privates, corporals and sergeants and so on.",
        "You didn't need to massively dissolve the entire army.",
        "And you - even you've probably shouldn't have kicked out the Sunnis because, suddenly these guys were out of work and they knew how to operate weapons.",
        "And that wound up killing American troops.",
        "So a little bit of sophistication might have said let's keep these guys on the payroll.",
        "Ease them out in the long term, but don't give them an excuse to take up arms against us.",
        "Okay.",
        "Now, my comment is I served with Petraeus in the 101st during the invasion, which if there was a happy time that was it.",
        "I mean, we were actually being waved at as we run overhead in helicopters and some goodwill was there.",
        "Now, the thing that's not brought up about him is what a remarkable cynical person he is.",
        "I mean, he was both the distinguished and honored graduate at Ranger school.",
        "I'm a Ranger myself.",
        "And you're competing with 20-year-old Marines, the best the corps has to send.",
        "And that kind of determination is just remarkable.",
        "I agree with you.",
        "Petraeus is kind of a force of nature.",
        "He's famous, for example, his one-armed push-up contest against privates.",
        "You know, challenging a guy half his age, let's do one-arm push-ups.",
        "And basically Petraeus' determination is he'll d one more that the other guy will no matter how many the other guy does.",
        "And also remember, Petraeus, in addition to being this - having this real will, is also quite bright.",
        "He has a PhD from Princeton in international relations.",
        "So he really is a unique leader.",
        "My worry is just, I wish we'd done in 2004 what we finally did in 2007."

        "But as usual in Germany, she will have to find allies to form a coalition government.",

        "We wanted to hear more about all of this, so I'm joined now in studio by Simon Schuetz.",
        "He's a political reporter with Germany's newspaper Bild.",

        "Hi, Michel.",

        "So why do Germans like her so much?",
        "Even after 12 years, they would like her to return as chancellor for another term.",
        "Well, I think it is because elections are to a certain degree about stability and trust.",
        "And Merkel, within her three terms that she had already, has had a lot of crisis going on domestically and internationally.",
        "And she has steered Germany successfully through these times of crisis.",

        "The economy is growing.",
        "Employment rate is on an all-time high.",
        "So what can you attack her for?",
        "That was one of the biggest problems her main challenger, Martin Schulz from the Social Democrats, had.",
        "But at the same time, the third term has been the most challenging for her so far because, you know, during the migration crisis, her popularity has dropped tremendously.",
        "Merkel, when she announced that she was running again, she said, well, this will be the hardest campaign I ever had.",
        "Because she knew that she would be attacked from the far right, from the extreme right, on this topic.",
        "So talk to me, if you would, about this party, the AfD or Alternative For Germany.",
        "Tell me a little bit about their platform.",
        "Well, you have to know that originally, when they started in 2013, they were not what they are now.",
        "They were more a party that was against the euro.",
        "They were saying Germany has to step out of the eurozone.",
        "But then during the migration crisis, they found a new topic.",

        "And I think now for the first time, if you believe the polls, they will enter the Parliament.",
        "And if Merkel will form an other government with the Social Democrats, another coalition, they will even be leading the opposition, the AfD.",
        "Well, Simon, before we let you go, does tomorrow's election have any impact on U.S.-German relations?",
        "Well, if Trump looks at Germany, there are two topics that are really important to him.",
        "One is the defense spending and the other one is the trade surplus that Germany is having.",
        "And for him, I think it's better when Merkel is re-elected because she at least agreed on increasing the defense spending, whereas her opponent, Martin Schulz, always said, no way, I am not going to increase defense spending.",

        "The international community has already done that, and there is a convention on biological diversity which gives governments assistance with how they should manage their own resources, gives them directions.",
        "And when a government signs on to this convention, it then can apply the rules within it.",
        "So governments maintain control over the plant and the animal, all of the genetic resources of their own country, and they remain able to control what their citizens do and what foreigners do with those resources.",
        "But there are no specific laws in place now to manage those resources in Antarctica or in the deep sea."

        "All of these organisms have made very special adaptations in order to live in extreme environments.",
