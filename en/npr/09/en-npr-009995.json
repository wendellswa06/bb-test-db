        "Right.",
        "But is there--I mean, people tend to think, well, you know, the oceans don't belong to anybody, and if you find something, it should be shared by all.",
        "I guess that just isn't the kind of response that's going to spur companies to take the risk of developing products if they find something useful.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "There are two sides to the question: common heritage, which is what you've just described, and reward for effort.",
        "If I'm a fisherman and I have the money to run a distant water fishing operation and I go out into the high seas--let's assume it's not regulated by a regional organization--I go and I catch fish and I come back and I sell those fish on the open market, and I am rewarded for the effort and the investment that I made.",
        "So fish are traditionally open-access resources.",
        "You could also argue that the other biological resources in the ocean should be the same, that you should be rewarded for the effort of capturing them or whatever you're doing with them.",
        "The other side of the coin is that this world doesn't have an equal distribution of capacity.",
        "So we need to think about all mankind benefitting from how we use these resources.",
        "Is there a model for that kind of sharing that's worked in another context that you think might be applied to the oceans?",
        "Yes.",
        "And in fact, the model comes from the deep seabed.",
        "There is an overarching piece of international law for the sea, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the seabed resources to be regulated--or, sorry, the use of those resources is to be regulated by a special part of that piece of international law so that all mankind benefits from the mining of the minerals in the deep seabed.",
        "So you could look at that as a model for how to manage the living resources in the water above the seabed in a very similar way and redistributing the wealth that comes from mining those resources.",
        "There's a number of schools of thought about whether it will work and how it will work.",
        "I must say that the law has been very slow in developing in regard to these open-access resources.",
        "But I think we're safe for a while because the technology is not developing very quickly, either.",
        "It's very expensive to develop any of these resources from the deep sea or from extreme environments like Antarctica.",
        "And...",
        "Dr.",
        "Jabour, I asked you an open-ended question, but unfortunately we don't have a lot of time for you to answer it.",
        "So I'm going to have to stop you there.",
        "But thank you very much for joining us and explaining some of this.",
        "It was my pleasure.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Dr.",
        "Julia Jabour is the deputy program leader for the policy in the Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Tasmania.",
        "When we come back, more on exploring the deep oceans.",
        "Stay with us."

        "There are a lot of people who are deeply disappointed.",
        "And of course, London, the southeast - it's like the economic powerhouse of the country, and the political capital voted strongly to remain.",

        "So I think it is a day of surprise, of shock.",

        "Yeah, and that's something we'll be watching.",
        "And I wonder, I mean, economically could be a crisis is - is Britain in a political crisis right now with with David Cameron stepping down as prime minister?",
        "Well, people have thought about this, of course, in advance.",
        "Clearly the prime minister had made his own contingency plans.",
