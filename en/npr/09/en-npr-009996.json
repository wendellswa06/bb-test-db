        "Hillary Clinton has said she would support a blanket hike of the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour and would consider as much as 15 an hour if it worked like the hike in New York, where an increase is phased in over several years and wages for workers in the city, where cost of living is highest - are higher than wages in parts of the state where it's not as expensive to live.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "Is there a sense there among people you talk to that that's realistic?",

        "Lee Monument about that.",

        "The administration in that school district decided that this was the way to solve the problem.",
        "They had been unable to reach an agreement with the teachers union, and one of the options open to them under a federal grant that they were applying for was to fire everybody."

        "Well, we were delighted at the incredible engagement teacher had with reform.",
        "We found that teachers, when you asked teachers what they think they'll tell you, and we heard from 40,000 of them.",
        "We heard from teachers at elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, from every state, from charter schools, from public schools.",
        "Any you name it, we heard from them, and they told us that they were interested in a lot of the things that we're talking about as a nation in terms of reform.",
        "For example, there's a great deal of support among teachers for common standards, and standards are, of course, the things that we teach.",
        "Teachers tell us that they understand the value of having common standards across all 50 states as one way of raising achievement.",
        "You also asked them about the best way to measure student achievement, and what did they say to that?",
        "Well, they felt that standardized tests were only one way of looking at student achievement.",
        "They felt that they needed multiple measures.",
        "They were interested in formative assessments, which are assessments that are done in class by teachers, and they wanted this kind of more nuanced data so that they could really look at how to differentiate instruction.",
        "Again, in the context of this story from Rhode Island, and again, this happened your survey took place well before that happened but I wonder, did you ask teachers what they thought about these proposals whereby teachers could be fired for underperformance?"

        "We did not ask teachers that, but we did ask them what their views were on impacting teacher retention.",
        "So specially, we asked them about different factors in terms of retaining good teachers, and it's a little bit of a flip on your question, Neal, but it was interesting because teachers put higher salaries in the middle of things that they were looking for in terms of retaining good teachers in the classroom.",
        "They certainly do care about being paid, but the things that they were looking for in terms of retention of good teachers were number one was supportive leadership, and number two was more time to collaborate with other teachers.",
        "That was interesting.",
        "That part of the survey said we're with children all day - K-through-12 teachers we're talking about - it would be nice to talk with some adults from time to time.",
        "Well, you know, when we look at our data as a country, and we compare it to other nations around the world, sometimes we're not very happy with what we see.",
        "We don't always look like we're not usually ranked at the very top in reading and science and math, but a lot of the countries where we see the high rankings, they do put an emphasis on giving teachers time to collaborate and having teachers have time to work together as teams to raise achievement in the schools.",

        "Well, you know, this is not an uncommon complaint, and actually, we should remember that we're talking about all these issues in the context of this budget recession that we're facing.",

        "You hear this all the time.",
        "Well, we used to have planning time, and now it's gone, and I have to teach another class.",
        "And many teachers feel like they just don't have time to get better.",

        "Larry, I know you've had a chance to read the survey.",

        "How does what this these findings of this survey, how does that square up with what the president's agenda is?",
        "Well, you know, it says that the president really agrees with teachers on a lot of issues, the idea that Margery just referred to, which is they don't want to be judged just by the standardized tests that come at the end of the year.",
        "It's something that you hear all the time from teachers and which was echoed in this survey.",
        "And the truth is, most of the standardized tests that are given out for state performance data, the results come back much too late to help the students who just took those tests.",
        "They are often given in March, April or May.",
        "Results come back at the end of the summer, and by then some teachers have moved on, and certainly their students have often moved on."

        "The other thing that we heard in conversations with teachers was a sense that they want a system for compensation that values collaboration and devalues competition among teachers.",
        "They feel that it's really important to have a high-performing team across the school and that performance pay needs to acknowledge the reality of what's going on in the building.",
