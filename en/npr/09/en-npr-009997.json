        "Okay.",
        "So the most difficult thing that I find is having to teach people in one class that have a huge range of knowledge, like for example, a ninth-grade math class where you have some students that are, like, at a fourth-grade level, and then some students are actually at the ninth-grade level.",
        "And I think that if we truly want to help teachers, we need to have an exam to get from one level to another or an - actual education-based courses rather than an age-based courses so that we're teaching to, you know, a common population.",
        "So you're not trying to teach seven different grades of mathematics all at the same time, yeah.",
        "Right, or that we're not teaching to the lowest common denominator, and therefore the students in the upper, you know, one-third of the class learn nothing.",
        "Margery Mayer, did this concern come up in your survey?",
        "Well, we know from our survey, and we also know from NAEP, which is our Nation's Report Card, that we have a wide range of achievement levels in our schools, and it absolutely did come up.",
        "We found that about three-fourths of our teachers are differentiating instruction on a regular basis in the classroom, and one of things that they told us they needed was materials and assessments that really help them do that."

        "I think this is one of the biggest challenges in our schools, and one of the interesting things that we found was this need to differentiate in the range of abilities.",

        "Larry, I know you've been talking to teachers too.",
        "Yes, well, you know, it's interesting.",
        "In the survey, I noted that teachers felt even more strongly about this, if I got this right, Margery, when you move up into junior high and high school, that they felt and statistically, according to the Nation's Report Card that Margery referred to, that is where you see the biggest falloffs, the biggest increase in the achievement gap, that there's more and more of a differentiation, and it's harder for teachers at that level to differentiate because they're supposed to be preparing these kids for college, and there's much more of a standard bar that you can set.",
        "You can't just drop your expectations in order to pull a student along.",

        "Another thing I'd like to put forth, too, instead of perhaps monetary compensation for teachers would be if you do have a teacher that is, you know, like, an exemplary teacher, maybe not offer more money, but offer some time for that teacher to go into classrooms of other teachers that are perhaps, you know, struggling and work with them - not have the classroom work and not have the paper load, but have, you know, more of a mentoring, you know, function, instead of perhaps monetary compensation."
