        "Here's another email question, this from Ms. Deacon(ph) in California, who says she's a teacher.",
        "Another hurdle in teaching is the revolving door of educational theories that mandate their own textbooks, a process driven by textbook companies.",
        "It makes it difficult to teach when the materials and methods change every two to three years.",
        "Is that a question for me?",
        "I think it is.",
        "Well, I think it's one of the things you addressed.",
        "Yeah, it is one of the things we addressed.",
        "Well, first of all, I should just say that Scholastic, we are not a textbook company.",
        "I think that, in general, textbooks are written to reflect what the states are asking for in their standards.",
        "So one of the things I think we can look forward to if we do agree on a common set of standards is a common set of content that can be delivered through textbooks, through digital media, through open source, and there'll just be a much more universal way of getting to this content.",
        "And hopefully, the content will settle down a little bit around these standards.",
        "Larry?",
        "Well, I think I'm definitely sympathetic as a reporter to the frustration that many teachers feel with the, you know, variety of fads and fashions that they have to go through.",

        "Well, exactly.",
        "But sometimes you feel like we're basically just closing our eyes and reaching into the box and trying something that maybe we actually tried five years ago, but we gave it a new name.",
        "And to be cynical, if you look through the president's budget, he has a lot of new programs in there that are basically new names for old programs.",
        "Sometimes you do feel like maybe if we just settled down, kept doing the same thing for 10 years, not only would it be simpler for teachers to deal with, but we would have more of a baseline to compare with so that we weren't always saying, well, we can't really draw any conclusions from this program because now it's under a different name with a different goal.",

        "I'm a teacher myself, and one of the biggest issues I find is we do not have enough special-education teachers in my building and a lot of other buildings that I see, and it really limits our time working with our other students in our classroom when we have to put so much focus on those special-needs students.",
        "Larry?",
        "This is something that came up at the hearing today, where Secretary of Education Duncan was testifying, and several members of Congress, many of them Republicans, expressed their ongoing frustration that the federal government has never supplied the 40 percent of special-education funding that they were supposed to and that the states and localities are still picking up a lot of that money.",
        "The new Obama budget doesn't include much of an increase at all for special education.",
        "So I think we're going to continue to see this as a source of friction and frustration in schools.",
        "So Republicans see it as an unfunded mandate."

        "Let me ask about - both of you have said your experience with teachers is they feel that their voices are not heard enough in this debate.",
        "Larry, the teachers' unions are enormous players in this debate.",
        "And, certainly, they have access to the highest levels of government.",
        "Funny you should say that.",
        "I said that to some of the teachers too.",
        "And they said, well, you know, the teachers' union are one thing, but what I'm really concerned about is being heard in my school.",
        "And the happy teachers I talked to are the ones who feel that they can go to the principal, make changes, advocate for changes, advocate for resources and get heard on the local level.",
        "I feel - and I don't know if Margery's survey backs this up - that teachers are much more concerned about that than they are about the debate that's going on in Washington.",
        "In the end, all of these things, all of these policies, when they do filter down to the local level, are negotiated in local union contracts.",
        "The head of the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association does not negotiate working terms for individual locals.",
        "Margery, is that what they mean by by concerns about leadership, which do come up a lot in your surveys?",
        "I think it is what they mean.",
        "I think teachers do want to be heard.",
        "And the reason that the Gates Foundation and Scholastic did this study is because we really did want to give teachers the opportunity to express their voice.",
        "There's a lot of indication in our study that teachers do want to be part of a team, they do want to be heard.",
        "I mean, they rank number one among all factors, supporting retention of effective teachers with supportive leadership.",
        "And you've got interpret that, partly, as leadership that listens and watches their back.",
        "And that would be - if teachers were more part of the discussion, if their voices were heard more, would that be the biggest change, do you think?",
        "I think that would be - I do think in a lot of schools, in a lot of districts, teachers are heard.",
        "It's not that they're not heard at all.",
        "I think that our goal in doing the report was to say we are not going to be able to deliver on true reform unless teachers are bought in and executing on that reform.",
        "And they need a seat at the table.",
        "So that's really the goal here.",
        "Give them a seat at the table.",
        "Let's listen to them.",
        "Let's use their wisdom and that's what we try to do in our study."

        "And, Larry - this will be unfair to ask of Margery - but how might that answer be different if you had a survey of school administrators?",
        "Well, I think it would definitely be very different.",

        "I mean, teachers want to do their thing, and so there's a tension between accountability and meeting standards, which most teachers got it, why we need to have some standardized tests, but also wanting the freedom to do what they think is the right thing with their kids.",
