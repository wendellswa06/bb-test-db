        "What is needed at our school site, what is our vision, and then what do I need to do to support my teachers to get moving in that direction for the kids?",
        "Again, I think professional development - we came in the teachers with one, some of us two years of training, and we're handed the biggest job in the world with students who are performing at, you know, well below grade level, well above grade level.",
        "There has to be that additional support for the teachers, to train them - ongoing training on how to do their jobs and strong leadership, saying this is where we're going with this.",
        "And Larry Abramson, I think you mentioned a diverse group of people who have different opinions.",
        "More training, better leadership.",

        "Even teachers who's had over 20 years of experience, almost 80 percent of them said that they want an ongoing professional development.",
        "So there were a few myths we felt we're debunked by this report.",
        "One of them was the idea that teachers arent anxious for professional development.",

        "So I think even if Merkel might not get along personally that well with him, she is a true believer in the transatlantic partnership.",

        "And then once the pass was turned through the treachery of Ephialtes, then about 700, maybe 800, stayed.",

        "We do.",
        "When we concentrate on the 300 Spartans - although we should remember there was about 16 or 17 states who probably had contingents in that war that fought - but Sparta symbolized Greek courage.",
        "And it's not our take on that fight but the Greeks themselves, mainly through Herodotus' account, that this was a small culture that was free, where free men had a concept of citizenry.",
        "They were fighting for freedom and they were being imposed by an imperial sort of autocratic society that had to whip their soldiers against men who freely chose to fight.",
