        "So out of the 1,500 or 1,600 who stayed for that final last stand, at least 1,100 of them were probably not Spartans.",
        "But there's some controversy over whether Thebans were forced to stay.",
        "And the Thespians were from a tiny town.",
        "And in comparative terms they suffered much more than the Spartans because their town was overrun.",
        "They were wiped out at Thermopylae and it took literally a century for that little town to recover.",

        "Joseph with us from Spokane in Washington.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, I guess the thing that stands out the most for me - and I have not seen the movie yet but I know the story - is that the Persians were depicted as rather ugly monster-like creatures while the Spartans were depicted as glistening model-like, you know, warriors.",
        "And I was just wondering what your take was on that?",
        "It kind of almost appears that it was more of a (unintelligible) in propaganda than anything, given our time.",
        "One big difference between the Greeks and the Persians - at least in this movie - is the Greeks have much better dentists, Victor.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well there's some Medes and the Immortals who are pretty well built.",
        "I think what we could say is that the Spartans seem much more familiar to an American audience because they're buff.",
        "They look like sort of Schwarzenegger in his prime."

        "They're no more - they're just as buff and they're just as muscular.",
        "But they seem more foreign to us.",
        "And that may be an overreaction a little bit on the part of the filmmakers or part of the stylization we talked about.",
        "But it's also reflected in Herodotus' own view.",
        "If you think that that portrayal's ethnocentric, you ought to go back to Herodotus and say why does he say that the Persians had to whip their men and the Spartans fought freely?",
        "Or why did they have all of this motley mongrel assorted group of different subject peoples who were fighting, whereas the Greeks came on their own free will and were uniform?",
        "Well isn't this the origin of the phrase, history's written by the winners?",
        "I think so.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We don't have a Persian account of this.",
        "And that explains a lot.",

        "And here's an e-mail from Frank.",
        "I enjoyed the movie.",
        "But a black Persian ruler?",
        "Come on.",
        "They could have stuck with the real history a little bit more.",
        "Well we don't know - I don't know that you would say that the actor - I think he was from South Brazil - who played Xerxes was black.",
        "But there were a lot of people from Ethiopia and Africa and Egypt that were in the Persian Empire.",
        "So they're - I don't think it's historically inaccurate to say that some people from the Persian realms in Africa couldn't have attained high positions.",
        "But mostly people looked in the Persian army as present day Iranians or people from the Middle East.",
        "Let's talk with Brian, Brian with us from Louisville in Kentucky."

        "It wouldn't - you don't have to invent things.",
        "You have plenty of ancient material to use at your disposal.",
        "I think in some sense Brian was talking about the more modern context.",
        "As I think John Wayne remade The Alamo during the Vietnam War era, this movie was movie was made in the era in which we now are.",
        "I think absolutely.",
        "And I think that the movie does not take the stance that you could take, that there were tens of thousands of subject Persian Medes, Babylonians, Lydians who didn't really want to fight and were forced to and their death was great tragedy.",
        "You could do that as well.",
        "But this was just a particular take that reflects, I think, the world view of the Greeks at the time."
