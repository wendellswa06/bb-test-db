        "But the House looked very, very dicey.",
        "Sentiment there was running heavily against authorizing the president.",
        "So this gives Mr. Obama a little more time, gives members of Congress a little bit of a reprieve from a vote they didn't want to take.",
        "And at the very least, no matter how this works out, even if it doesn't provide a diplomatic solution to the conflict, it gives the president more time to convince the American people, who have been telling pollsters they are about 2 to 1 against military strikes against Syria."
