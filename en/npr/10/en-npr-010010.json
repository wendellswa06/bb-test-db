        "I'm wondering if this has put a damper on this at all?",
        "Well, senior organizers of London 2012 are insisting that this will only be a good thing for the city, and some detractors have been pointing out, of course, that county taxes--That's our local taxes--they will rise, of course.",
        "And later this week, there is going to be the launch of an Olympic lottery.",
        "We have a national lottery in this country which goes towards building museums, etc., etc., and there will be a specific Olympic lottery.",

        "Al-Qaeda in Europe were blamed for that.",
        "Police do believe that al-Qaeda or Islamic cells are operating in London, but, so far, thankfully, we haven't had any major incidents.",
        "So obviously they're going to be taking the security of the Olympics extremely seriously.",
        "They've already been planning in their anti-terror operations, and certainly I'm sure those will be stepped up.",
        "But, of course, it is a concern, even though it wasn't talked a great deal about in Britain, but behind the scenes, the organizers are very aware of that.",
