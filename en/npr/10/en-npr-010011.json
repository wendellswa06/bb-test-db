        "We go first to a sentencing hearing, which continues today for Army Staff Sgt.",
        "Robert Bales.",
        "He's the soldier who attacked two, small Afghan villages last year.",
        "The massacre killed 16 men, women and children.",
        "Bales pleaded guilty in June, so he is guaranteed a life sentence.",
        "The only question is whether he'll have a chance at parole.",
        "As NPR's Martin Kaste reports, today Bales' lawyers will make the case for leniency.",
        "It's a tall order, leniency for Robert Bales, especially after what the jury heard on Tuesday and yesterday.",
        "First, the prosecutors laid out the attack in excruciating detail: his middle-of-the-night foray into the sleeping villages; his close-range shooting of children, despite their cries for mercy.",
        "Then survivors took the stand; the Army flew in nine of them.",
        "Yesterday, it was the turn of two men who'd been away from the village at the time of the massacre.",
        "They told the court what it was like to come home and find their families' partially burned bodies stacked up like cordwood.",
        "Forty-one-year-old Khamal Adin recalled seeing the corpse of an infant with a shoe print on her face.",
        "Then his cousin, Haji Muhammed Wazir, took the stand.",
        "He lost his mother, his wife, his brother, and six of his seven children.",
        "Through an interpreter, Wazir said that even now, more than a year later, it feels to him as if the massacre is still happening.",
        "Calling Colby (unintelligible)",
        "We're reporting throughout the program on the primaries held in several states yesterday.",
        "And one of the themes was the strong showing of several candidates backed by the Tea Party.",
        "In Delaware, one of those candidates, Christine O'Donnell, won the Republican Senate primary nomination.",
        "She defeated Mike Castle, a nine-term congressman who had the support of the Republican establishment.",
        "And in New York, Carl Paladino, a blunt-talking multimillionaire with Tea Party backing, beat a former congressman, Rick Lazio, for the Republican gubernatorial nomination.",
        "All of which make this a good time to take a closer look at the Tea Party movement.",
        "Tomorrow, two Tea Party members debate what the movement stands for.",

        "Who is the Tea Party?",
        "Is there a short answer?",
        "No, there's no short answer and that's one reason this phenomenon is so baffling to journalists like me.",
        "We keep looking for the leader of the Tea Party.",
        "It's a fantastically decentralized movement.",
        "It consists of basically anyone out there who calls themselves a Tea Partier, and it's pretty hard to generalize.",
        "Do you have any idea how big it is?",
        "Well, they claim, depending on how you read the polls, you know, 17 million Americans, but that can be anyone who's ever answered a question saying they're sympathetic to the Tea Party.",
        "We know that the largest of the Tea Party national groups, which is called the Tea Party Patriots, has almost 3,000 local organizations that are registered on their website.",
        "And if you figure that's anywhere from, you know, 20 to 100 people per organization, you can do the math.",
        "We're talking about at a minimum, tens of thousands of activists.",
        "What do you know about the Tea Partier?",
        "Who is that person?",
        "Tea Partiers are white, bright, and right, on average.",
        "The minority presence is relatively small.",
        "I don't think that's because they're racist.",
        "I don't think they are.",
        "I think it's because they're conservative and conservatives tend to attract more white voters than minority voters.",
        "They are bright, they're well-educated.",
        "Finally, they are many of them debranded Republicans.",
        "That is to say, they look and talk and sound like Republicans.",
        "They often vote like Republicans, but many of them think of themselves as independents.",
        "That's one reason they're so unafraid to vote for Republican candidates in primaries who might lose to Democrats.",
        "They say it's not about party, and in their minds it really isn't.",
        "Perhaps the most impressive thing about the Tea Party is that it seemed to appear suddenly, that it's very modern in that it uses the Internet and apps and free conference calling, as you point out in an article in the National Journal, to do some very, very up-to-date political organizing.",
        "You know, this movement could not have started as recently as, say, 10 years ago, before social networking, before free conference calls.",
        "I just finished doing a deep dive for National Journal on the Tea Party Patriots.",
        "They're not the group you hear the most about, because they're not out there trying to swing elections and dropping money into political races."

        "And they just do things.",
        "It's like a hive or a network.",
        "They call it open source structure.",
        "So if you hear people say that Tea Partiers are troglodytes, think again.",
        "But ultimately, do you think that not having a head means that it'll be difficult for them to be of service to their issues?",
        "It poses very big challenges.",
        "For instance, who defines you?",
        "Tea Partiers don't want anyone else speaking for them.",

        "Or how do you cut a deal?",
        "If you're actually trying to influence the passage of legislation to reform things in Washington, you need a seat at the table, you need to make bargains.",
        "That's how the system works.",
        "With the Tea Party, there's no one to bargain with because there's no one in charge.",
        "And Tea Partiers will tell you, well, we're trying to do something different here.",
        "We reject that whole model of the world where people do deals in back rooms.",
        "Can they define what something different is?",
        "Yes, that was what turned out to me to be most interesting and to be hardest to get my mind around.",
        "The most important thing that they will tell you they're trying to do is a cultural movement, not a political movement.",
        "They're tiring to reeducate the whole country, change the way Americans think about their relationship to government.",
        "Move us back to a more self-reliant, independent sort of watch dog against government mentality.",
        "They will tell you if you just try to change an election result, you have to come back every two years and do it again.",
        "If you can change the hearts and minds of the people, make them more skeptical of big government, then you do that forever.",
        "You know, you can kind of see this happening two ways.",
        "You could sort of say that this is a very energized version of the conservative side of the Republican Party, or you can see it that this could be something that could just fractionate the Republican Party, tear it into fiscal Republicans and social Republicans, and whatever there is left of old mainline Republicans."
