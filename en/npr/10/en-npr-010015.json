        "This caught the attention of a man named Matt Carstens.",
        "So it got pretty specific where they were targeting, and that kind of hit close to home for me with a farming operation that I'm from here in Iowa.",
        "Carstens was also selling fertilizer at the time for a company called United Suppliers.",
        "He got so interested he flew to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group that was working with Walmart on ways to reduce the climate impact of the food it sells."
