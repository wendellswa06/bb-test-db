        "The endocrine disruption issue has evoked some of the most visceral and ugly attacks among scientists of any scientific issue recently.",
        "Ropeik says a recent experience in Europe shows how these attacks often ignore the science underlying regulatory decisions.",
        "The European Food Safety Administration did what the FDA did: reviewed all the science and said at the doses we get it, BPA is probably not the risk that some people fear.",
        "At which point, the endocrine disruption movement said: Oh, my God, they're all corrupt.",
        "They're all taking corporate money.",

        "The First Circuit Court of Appeals, in Boston, ruled the 1996 law unconstitutional because it denies giving gay couples the same rights afforded to heterosexual couples.",

        "Herbert Burtis waited more than a half-century before marrying his partner, John Ferris, in 2004, the year that Massachusetts recognized same-sex marriage.",

        "Burtis, along with several couples, sued, arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act - or DOMA - is unconstitutional because it creates two classes of married couples - heterosexual couples, who get federal benefits; and gay couples, who don't.",
        "A federal judge agreed with them in 2010 and now, the federal appeals court has as well.",
        "Burtis says he no longer feels like a second-class citizen."

        "First, it targets a group that has been historically disadvantaged.",
        "And while the ruling did not say homosexuality is protected in the same way as race or even gender, it did say gay men and lesbians cannot be discriminated against in this way.",
        "Second, it said the federal law intrudes on a state's ability to define marriage.",
        "What this means, says Janson Wu, a staff attorney at Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, is that if the ruling stands, married gay couples will have the same federal benefits and responsibilities as other couples.",
        "Leave to take care of your sick spouse; federal health-insurance benefits; Social Security survivor benefits; the ability to file your taxes jointly - bread-and-butter issues that make a big difference in real people's lives.",

        "He says the legislatures in the states and Congress are the ones to decide what a legal marriage looks like.",
        "Marriage is a particularly important social institution, and so any watershed change in its definition should come through the legislative process - and not the courts.",
        "Showengert says that generally, courts give deferential treatment to the laws of Congress, and the First Circuit failed to do that.",
        "And I think that was a significant legal error, and one that we anticipate the Supreme Court will remedy.",
        "And we believe the decision will be overturned.",
