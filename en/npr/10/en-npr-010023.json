        "Well, if you can't understand Spanish, or at least Argentinean Spanish, NPR's Bob Mondello is currently in Buenos Aires, so we asked him to explain how Pepsi became Pecsi.",
        "It's basically if you can't beat them join them.",
        "Pepsi has decided that because people in Buenos Aires have been ordering Pecsis at refreshment stands for decades, there's no real point in fighting them.",
        "On some billboards, under the word Pecsi, are Spanish words that mean freedom of expression or freedom of pronunciation.",
        "That's a freedom that folks in Buenos Aires take seriously.",

        "There's also the fact that Spanish is a consistent language in terms of pronunciation.",
        "So, folks here, having learned that the words like and strike is silent, e at the end, mostly assume that the famous shoe company is called Nike, perfectly logical.",

        "NPR interviewed Lawrence Small in 1999 just before he became secretary.",
        "I think there are a lot of very, very smart people at the Smithsonian, but I don't think that the Smithsonian has a monopoly on intelligence, thoughtfulness or knowledge.",
        "Lawrence Small is well-traveled and urbane.",
        "He loves art and flamenco guitar.",
        "He was also the first secretary of the Smithsonian who was not a scholar.",
        "Before taking a massive pay cut to lead the institution, Small had a successful career as a corporate executive at Citicorp/Citibank and Fannie Mae.",
        "Small came to an organization that had seen its share of controversy, like that which erupted over the World War II Enola Gay exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum that drew fire from Congress for being anti-American.",
