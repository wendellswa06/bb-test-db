        "He pledged to cut government spending, and during his recent budget address, he said his $820 million cut to education is aimed squarely at teacher pay and benefits.",
        "Is it fair to have any public employees getting four to five percent salary increases every year, even when inflation is at zero percent, paid for by citizens who are struggling to survive?",
        "Is it fair to have New Jersey taxpayers foot the bill for 100 percent of the health insurance costs of teachers and their families, from the day they are hired until the day they die?",
        "But even in districts where teachers have agreed to freeze their salaries, like Montclair, New Jersey, some 81 teachers will be laid off, classes will be more crowded, and anything in the curriculum that isn't required by law may be dropped.",
        "Barbara Elder Weller, principal of Rand Elementary School, says these cuts will hurt low-income kids the most, since studies show they begin school behind their middle-class counterparts.",
        "We really customize and tailor instruction to meet the needs of every single learner in the class.",
        "And it's enormously harder to do that when you have fewer resources, fewer support people and more children in the class.",
        "Rand stands to lose six teachers and two support staff or 13 percent of its workforce.",
        "Weller is particularly upset about losing her full-time social worker, who helps kids who are dealing with problems at home and in school.",
        "Lost will be a mentoring program, like this group of fifth graders who struggle with classroom behavior and meet each week with teens from the high school.",
        "Alright, so we're going to do a little activity today.",
        "It's going to be a situation in middle school and I want you to tell me how you would handle this situation."

        "And why has he been doing this?",
        "I think there are two institutional reasons.",
        "One is, he believes that we're in an unusually complicated time in the economy and that people are confused, and that the policies will be more effective and he'll have more political support for them if he can just explain them to people, the way he used to teach freshman economics at Princeton University.",
        "But the other reason is that the Fed has been under a lot of criticism for not being open about what it's doing, for allowing bonuses to be paid at AIG.",
        "And he knows that once the winds start blowing against the institution, that you're on the defensive, and so this is kind of a PR offensive to make the Fed look a little more responsible, a little more open, and a little more reasonable - to the people and the politicians.",
        "But you wonder if the Fed has become less independent from politicians, which it has traditionally been, because of this current financial crisis.",

        "It's a very delicate balance here.",
        "As a society, we have decided that we need the Federal Reserve to be independent when it comes to setting interest rates and controlling the supply of money to resist inflation, because the conventional wisdom now is that in a democracy, politicians are too prone to let inflation get out of hand.",
        "So we want an independent central bank to handle that.",

        "Well, Mr. Bernanke will not admit it, and he won't be explicit about it, but of course the more he looks like a calm, steady hand, a man of the people who is doing the best he can to save the nation's economy from disaster, the more popular he is, and the more likely President Obama will decide to reappoint him when his term is up in the end of January.",
