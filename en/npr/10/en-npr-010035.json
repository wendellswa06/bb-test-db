        "And from an economic prospective, it's pretty easy to prove that people really ought to be buying insurance.",
        "Because insurance is a magical transformation device that allows us to shift money from times when we don't need it very much, to times when we do need it very much.",

        "Sharon, your alma matter, Spellman, one of the wealthiest historically black colleges, had to eliminate 35 staff jobs and is projecting a $4.8 million deficit.",

        "That's a great question, Tony.",
        "I would argue that all of those parties have a role to play.",
        "The fact of the matter is that if we look at the economics, many HBCUs are simply more expensive than the community college.",
        "For example, here in St. Louis, Harris-Stowe is about a $164 per credit hour and St. Louis Community College is $83 per credit hour.",
        "And so, a lot of students are having to make a decision about whether or not having a unique black experience at the collegiate level is worth the money.",
        "Also, we find that a lot of universities are too dependent on tuition dollars to cover their operating budgets, and development departments, I would argue, need to think more creatively about bringing in different revenue streams so that they can make that experience affordable.",
        "You know, that's an interesting point, Shaun, that he makes, because going to an HBCU, certainly to a Spelman or to a Morehouse - and I imagine to a Howard as well - they're not shaped by any stretch of the imagination.",

        "Like at Clark Atlanta this semester, hundreds of students, almost 400 students surprisingly didn't come back for the spring semester, and the school was just shocked.",
        "And so they had to totally rework the schedule.",
        "And it's kind of the thing that people say when America gets a cold, black folk get a flu, and that really affects black colleges in a major way.",
        "And so I'm thinking a few black colleges may close during this recession or may come together with traditional or predominantly white universities.",
        "They're considering that here in Georgia and Savannah, but it's tough.",
        "It's definitely having a major impact on the schools."
