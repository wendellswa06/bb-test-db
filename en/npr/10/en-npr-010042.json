        "But she says the spots, 10 in all, were designed to promote other services offered by 13 of the organization's affiliates in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.",
        "(CEO, Planned Parenthood, Western Pennsylvania): We talk about cervical and breast cancer screening, sexuality education, prevention of sexually transmitted infection, abstinence education.",
        "There is no mention of abortion services, but nonetheless, the underwriting was pulled off the air.",

        "He says there is a clear distinction between the station's finances and the workings of its newsroom and programming, and always has been.",
        "We routinely present stories and information of controversy and concern that are contrary to the interests of the Catholic Church, contrary to the interests of the university itself.",
        "And we have never had any editorial interference in any programming decision we've made here at DUQ.",
        "Planned Parenthood's underwriting campaign continues to run on four other public radio stations in the region.",
        "And while Evert says she would like WDUQ to reconsider and accept the organization's donation as well as its message, Duquesne University says that won't happen."
