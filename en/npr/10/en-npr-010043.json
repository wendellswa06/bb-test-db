        "Patrick Smith is a pilot.",
        "We caught up to him at home in Summerville, Massachusetts in between flights to Brazil.",
        "He also writes the column, \"\"Ask the Pilot,\"\" on Salon.com.",
        "Patrick Smith, we've just heard some criticisms that the FAA is too cozy with airlines.",
        "As a working pilot, do you think that's the case?",
        "To some extent, but I also feel that it has to be that way.",
        "Air safety is not banking and despite the appearance of a really blatant conflict of interest, the dynamics of commercial aviation are very unique and in my opinion require a very close working relationship between the airlines and their regulators.",
        "I think a more confrontational relationship would almost be certain to increase and not decrease the number of scandals and violations.",
        "And I say that as a pilot, someone who works in an operational environment at an airline.",
        "Yeah, so as a pilot, what part of the responsibility for safety is yours?",
        "Well, the safety checks really begin offstage, as it were, in the briefing room or in the crew lounge when you're looking at the paperwork and you're checking the weather and you're checking the flight plan and looking for any deferred maintenance items that are affecting this flight.",
        "Things that should be fixed but not yet, we can still fly?",
        "Correct."

        "So I gather it's pretty much a usual thing to fly a plane that's got a maintenance problem.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, airplanes are extremely complex machines and it can't be expected that they're always going to be running at the 100 percent reliability.",
        "There are certain components that will sometimes be inoperative.",
        "And it's perfectly acceptable to fly with a component deferred as it's called.",
        "There's a book on every airplane, a huge volume that very carefully stipulates which items can be deferred and under exactly which flight conditions and for how long.",
        "You know, it's awfully hard as an airline passenger to know what to think about all of this.",
        "I mean, here's your…",
        "Well…",
        "…big chance, here's your big chance.",
        "Tell us, Patrick Smith, how should we feel?",
        "It's very tempting to misinterpret these recent events as a sign of some kind of major systemic breakdown or a disaster that was narrowly averted.",
        "I'll agree that for an airline to take hundreds of planes out of service and cancel thousands of flights is radical and it seems to imply this state of imminent danger.",
        "But that's really not what we're seeing.",
        "The airplanes were not in an unsafe condition.",
        "They were taken out of service entirely as a preventive measure.",
        "I think we need to stand back for a second and look at the big picture, which is that the system as it stands is astonishingly safe.",
        "We're right now amidst the safest ever stretch since really the dawn of the jet age.",
        "I mean, the last large scale accident involving a major U.S.",
        "airline was the crash of American Flight 587 in 2001, and that was about 43 million flights ago.",
        "One of the things that worries me is that when there is a crash, a serious crash - and there will be - I hope that people take the time out to acknowledge that to some extent, you know, that is the inevitable and meanwhile we are just coming off of this safest ever stretch in the history of modern aviation.",
        "Let's look forward, Sarah, in terms of U.S.",
        "policy.",
        "Barack Obama has talked about sending maybe 15,000 more U.S.",
        "troops to Afghanistan on top of the about 30,000 U.S.",
        "troops who are there now.",

        "I think more troops are definitely needed.",
        "And you know, this shouldn't really be seen as some massive militarization of the situation in Afghanistan because the number of troops on the ground is just pitifully low compared to any major post-conflict, nation-building situation that the United States has been involved in, lower even than Haiti in the 1990s.",
        "Now, I do think that more troops alone won't do the job.",
        "There have to be some changes in the way that they approach their job.",
        "In other words, rather than seeing their objective as kind of hunt-and-kill bad guys, they have to understand that primarily they need to be protecting the population.",
        "And that means a certain amount of redeployment of troops toward population centers rather than sending them way out in the middle of nowhere to supposedly interdict ratlines and things like that where they're both vulnerable and not very useful in protecting the population.",
        "And I also think there are some civilian approaches that really need to be stepped up.",
        "One of those is mentoring civilian officials.",
        "The international community has been very successful in mentoring the Afghan army.",
        "And it seems interesting to me that it never occurred to anyone that, well, Afghans might need mentoring to become professional and effective soldiers or officers, but what about mentoring to become effective and responsive mayors or district commissioners or, you know, heads of public health departments and things like that?",
        "And I mean that on the provincial as well as the national level.",
        "And what about negotiating with the Taliban themselves?",
        "I mean, the Afghan government is talking to elements from the Taliban that it considers to be reconcilable.",
        "Barack Obama is said to be open to supporting those discussions.",
        "Is that a good idea?",
        "I think this is a really bad policy for President-elect Obama to get involved with.",
        "And the reason for that is I don't think that negotiating with the Taliban addresses the problem.",
        "In other words, I don't see any difficulties in eventually interacting with people who once were considered enemies.",
        "That's what maturity in politics is all about.",
        "But the point is that the Taliban do not represent the Afghan people.",
        "They are not an indigenous kind of uprising.",
        "You know, what we're looking at is not a people that rejects democracy or isn't ready for democracy, but rather a people that is actually unsatisfied with the amount of democracy that we have brought them, and actually feels that we have obstructed the flourishing of democracy in a lot of ways.",
        "And they've been, really, I think, occasionally siding with the Taliban - because not many do - but those who do, it's really a protest vote.",
        "And I just don't see how bringing the Taliban to the table addresses the fundamental problem.",
        "At the same time, the commander of U.S.",
        "and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General David McKiernan, has said, look, the solution is going to be political, not military.",
        "He said, we're not going to run out of bad guys there that want to do bad things in Afghanistan.",
        "Don't you need to engage them?",
        "I think the solution is political also, but I think it's a different political solution, which is to say you pressure those people who are currently holding power at all levels in Afghanistan on behalf of the Afghan people to be more responsive to those people.",
        "And then you will see all of these, quote, unquote, \"\"reconcilable Taliban\"\" will come over anyway because they will then have a government that they can bear to live under.",
