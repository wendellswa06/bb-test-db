        "In all, military officials say, there are between 60 and 70 a day, the majority spread across four predominantly Sunni provinces.",
        "US and Iraqi forces have captured or killed tens of thousands of insurgents and suspects in the last two years, yet the many branches of the insurgency seem to remain resilient, adaptable and formidable.",

        "He now sits on the Defense Policy Board, a Pentagon advisory group.",

        "The military fight in Iraq, he says, remains largely a fight for human intelligence.",
        "It's trying to understand who they are, how they're organize, how the cells are organized, the networks themselves, their relationship to each other, the financial linkage in those cells, the logistical support to those cells, the regional relationships and tribal relationships that these cells have.",
        "That is all very complicated, and to be quite frank about it, we do not understand all of that.",
        "US officials still believe the majority of the insurgents are Sunnis and former Baathists from Saddam's special security forces, but several US military officials and analysts interviewed believe that these trained paramilitary forces have been joined in significant numbers over the last year by disaffected Sunnis who were on the fence but now strongly oppose any US presence.",
        "Not under central authority, certainly not with any discernable political motive except to cause chaos and eventually drive the US out of their country.",
        "Military analyst and retired Army Colonel Bob Killebrew says that simple yet vague political platform has been enough to replenish the foot soldiers of the insurgency.",
        "The political agenda is to drive the United States out, to deny the emergence of another Iraq that's dominated by Shia and Kurds and to arrive at some kind of undefined state in the future of where the Sunnis, who were so important under Saddam Hussein, can regain some kind of autonomy.",
        "Then there is the small but extremely potent force of foreign jihadists.",
        "Pentagon sources believe they account for less than 10 percent of the insurgency, but the foreign fighters are believed to be behind some of the largest and deadliest suicide bomb attacks.",
        "Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld doesn't see the insurgents having coherent political or nationalist goals.",
        "The Defense chief says it's senseless violence, effective only in fueling chaos.",
        "I think it would be a mistake to suggest that this insurgency has the support of the people or that it's popular.",
        "I mean, there's no Ho Chi Minh.",
        "There's no Mao Tse-tung.",

        "But do those carrying out the suicide attacks see it as mindless carnage?",
        "There have been more than 500 car bombings alone, the military says, since the US turned political sovereignty over to an interim Iraqi government just over a year ago.",
        "What is motivating these suicide bombers, a seemingly endless stream of young people willing to walk or drive high explosives into crowds of civilians or soldiers?",

        "The president often calls Iraq the central front in the war on terrorism, but new studies of radical jihadists captured on route to Iraq showed that the US invasion made Iraq a central front.",
        "A Saudi Arabian researcher interviewed 300 Saudi nationals caught coming into Iraq.",
        "He found that the vast majority was motivated by imams and Internet activists calling for the expulsion of American infidel occupiers from Arab soil.",
        "The researcher found that these young middle- and upper middle-class Saudis were radicalized by the US invasion.",
        "The majority had not been involved at all in terrorism before they left for Iraq.",
        "Professor and researcher Richard Dekmejian thinks both Sunni insurgents and radical foreign Islamists are united in their belief that the US wants long-term control of Iraq, a perception, he says that fuels the insurgency.",
        "Now this is their perception: that we want to establish in Iraq a basis to project American power to control the oil and so on and so forth.",
        "The question is how to change that perception for us to get out of this mess.",
        "Others say changing that perception would do little to stop suicide terrorism in Iraq.",
        "University of Michigan professor and terrorism expert Scott Atran has also interviewed captured jihadists and would-be bombers.",
        "He says suicide terrorist in Iraq are motivated by more than a struggle over foreign occupation.",
        "The US could pull out of Iraq tomorrow, he says, and the suicide bombers would continue to strike targets from Baghdad to London and beyond, motivated by a broad sense of humiliation of the Muslim world, he says, something senior al-Qaeda leaders like Ayman Al-Zawahiri often rail against.",
        "Guys like Zawahiri constantly go over the fact that globalization degrades Muslims, and tourism as much as military occupation are part and parcel of that humiliation, and that has to be fought.",
        "Meantime, a referendum on Iraq's as yet unfinished constitution is scheduled for mid-October, and a nationwide vote for a more permanent government is planned for December.",
        "By then, says analyst Anthony Cordesman, the world should be able to access two vital things: if Iraq's US-trained security forces are viable.",
        "And the other is whether the Iraqi political process can move forward and will be inclusive and resist civil war.",
        "If it does, we probably will succeed.",
        "If we fail in either of both of those areas, then it's almost impossible to see how we can make Iraq work.",

        "The president invited reporters into the Rose Garden to stand and listen as he sent a new warning to Democrats.",
        "He said he is not satisfied with the war funding bill that passed narrowly in the House and Senate, and if a final piece of legislation looks anything like either of those bills he says he won't sign it.",

        "I'll veto it, and then Congress can get down to business of funding our troops without strings and without delay.",
        "Any delay, the president argued, will mean tough times for the military in general.",
        "They'll have to cut equipment and training programs, he says, meaning some Guard and Reserve forces might not be ready to go to Iraq.",
        "Now, Democrats had said he is being alarmist, and a non-partisan congressional study concluded that the Army has money to pay for operations in Iraq well into the summer."
