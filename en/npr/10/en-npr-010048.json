        "You know, we're overwhelmed by people who are more interested in scoring political points on television, rhetorical points or - and have agendas that are rooted in, you know, a view of the world, but they're unwilling to see the other guy's point of view and to put themselves in the other person's shoes and to recognize this is a big, diverse, sprawling country with lots of different perspectives and lots of different needs, and the only way we ever more forward is together."
