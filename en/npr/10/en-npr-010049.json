        "And, you know, I don't think this is the time to apportion blame so much as I - it's really time to sort of figure out okay, where do we go from here.",
        "And the most important thing right now in the next few days is to calm ourselves, to stay steady and to not panic.",

        "Yeah, I was going to say that it looked like - as you were saying, John Boehner looked very willing to accept a deal three times as many spending cuts as there was for revenue enhancement, and yet he had to be pulled away because his caucus pulled him away from it.",
        "Well, yeah, but in fairness, you know, Boehner was facing a situation where, you know, as he was negotiating with President Obama, they thought they were very close to a deal.",
        "And then the Gang of Six came out with its recommendations, which the president immediately embraced.",
        "But the problem was the Gang of Six had a lot higher taxes in it than did the Boehner agreement with the president.",

        "I praised them a lot.",
        "But it may have been that their timing - we may learn over time, if we really get the inside story, that it may well have been we were very close to a deal that slipped away from us."

        "You've been hearing these reports that they might have five or six more days beyond August 2nd.",
        "Partly because I think if they do get into a serious negotiation over the backup plan, I think the White House may be more open than anybody thinks to an extension of some sort, maybe even a couple of weeks, to allow those negotiations to be completed and go through the parliamentary rigmarole that you have to go through to get a bill.",
        "The - neither plan, the Boehner plan nor the Reid plan contains any new revenues in it.",
