        "I do, men tend to get bigger tattoos, but more women get tattooed than men, I think.",
        "Actually it's about even, but women tend to get tattoos in places where the rest of us won't see them.",
        "Another solution for anyone else who might still be afraid of the stigma, there's tattoo ink now that you can't see, except under a black light."

        "After being home for a year, about a third of all soldiers and Marines who had been in Iraq used mental health services of one kind of another.",
        "Thirty-five percent got help for some problem like not sleeping, being angry or anxious.",
        "And that's just those who went to military clinics.",
        "Hogue's numbers don't count visit to chaplains, or those who quickly left the military and then went to VA clinics.",
        "Hogue says the numbers show soldiers know to ask for help and where to get it.",
        "And he says getting help early can stop a small problem from turning into a big one, like post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "That's a sometimes disabling psychiatric condition that can result from being exposed to danger.",
        "A lot of soldiers who come back from a war zone are jumpy, revved up and don't sleep well.",
        "Those are normal reactions after combat, and if you address those as normal reactions and treat them early, then our goal is to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder and depression down the road.",
        "Of all the soldiers and marines who did seek help, 12 percent got diagnosed with a serious mental health problem, PTSD, anxiety or depression.",
        "That number turns out to be lower than some experts had expected.",
        "Hogue thinks it's because troops do get treated early.",
        "But he says it might be that military mental health providers simply don't want to give someone a more stigmatizing diagnosis like PTSD.",
        "Tom Berger says that means the actual number could be higher.",
        "The job of the military, of course, is war.",
        "It's not mental health.",

        "He's the head of the PTSD and Substance Abuse Committee for Vietnam Veterans of America.",
        "Berger says the military's done a lot to add mental healthcare.",
        "That's a lesson learned from the advocacy of Berger and others who served in Vietnam.",
        "But he worries that there's still a lot of stigma that prevents troops from seeking help, and that conditions like PTSD may not show up for months or even years later."
