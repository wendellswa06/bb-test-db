        "So she's a great movie critic but her timidity holds her back greatly in life.",
        "And then, through this device within the book, the ghost of Dorothy Parker literally comes to life and hitches a ride onto her life, and becomes mentor to this woman so she can help her develop her voice and overcome her timidity.",
        "So in addition to becoming mentor, in some ways she also becomes her tormentor.",
        "Can you explain how Violet, Violet Epps, discovers Dorothy Parker's ghost?",

        "And she needs to find more strength than she has to really give this guy the boot.",
        "So she arranges to meet him in the Algonquin Hotel so she can sort of pull strength from the hallowed walls where Dorothy Parker and the other famous wits of the 1920s traded barbs.",
        "But once she's there in that room, she sort of gets more than she bargained for.",
        "And there's a guestbook that all these ancient writers have signed.",
        "And Dorothy Parker's spirit lingers in this ancient guestbook and she winds up first taking over Violet's body, and then going back into the guestbook which Violet absconds with.",
        "So when she gets home with the guestbook she's able to open it up and there is Dorothy Parker in corporeal form right in her living room."
