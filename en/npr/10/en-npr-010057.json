        "And when you say most, what do you mean?",

        "Oh, well over 90 percent.",
        "People don't backpack or try to sneak those drugs across the border between the ports of entry because, one, they could be caught by the Border Patrol.",
        "Number two, they don't really trust those people to do that.",
        "So it's much better for them to have somebody that is taking the drugs through a port of entry where they're met on the other side of the port here in the United States, and those drugs are immediately taken.",
        "So you're saying, basically, virtually all of it comes through legal ports of entry.",
        "The two characters - Dorothy Parker's ghost and Violet Epps - there's a dependency that is created between the two of them in this dynamic.",
        "Can you talk a little bit about that?",
        "How does Violet need Dorothy and how does Dorothy end up needing Violet?",
        "When I construct any novel, there are sort of two threads that I deal with.",
        "One is the character's outer journey that's really the story and what happens.",
        "And the other is the character's inner journey and that's the arc that they have throughout the book.",
        "So it was very important to me to create an arc for Violet, and that was overcoming her timidity and finding her voice and the person she really was inside.",
        "Because, we should say, Dorothy Parker does this whole Cyrano De Bergerac thing and...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "...at some point actually tells her what to say and Violet recites it accordingly.",
        "That's quite true.",
        "But I also wanted Dorothy Parker to have an arc.",
        "So I dealt with the actual - a lot of the actual real pain Dorothy Parker had.",
        "Even though the book is quite fictionalized, Dorothy Parker did have a lot of pain in her life, so I put that into the book.",
        "And I dealt with her sort of fear of crossing over into the light and joining the afterlife where she was supposed to be.",
        "So I created Dorothy Parker as somebody who is sort of stuck between this life and the afterlife.",
        "So in addition to Violet having something to learn from her, Dorothy Parker had much to learn from Violet as well."

        "You said a big part of who she was and how people remember her is part of this group, this literary group that gathered at the Algonquin Hotel.",
        "Right.",
        "In your research or your writing for this, did you learn anything about the kinds of conversations that were taking place there with those folks?",
        "It seemed like such great fun, right?",
        "I mean, they were George S.",
        "Kaufman and Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood and Franklin Pierce Adams, and sometimes Harpo Marx made an appearance, and Alexander Woollcott who was a famous critic.",

        "You know, she called it The Vicious Circle.",
        "Why?",
        "She didn't really count many of them in the end as her friends.",
        "I mean, they may be one or two.",
        "But look, I mean, toward the end she was a very sad, bitter alcoholic.",
        "And she didn't really have many positive things to say about her old friends.",
        "Did your perception of Dorothy Parker change at all through the writing of the book?",
        "I mean, she clearly was a hero to you in some way.",
        "She was always hero.",
        "Like I said, I admired her wit.",
        "I admired her talent.",
        "I admired her writing.",
        "But came to admire her even more because I'll tell you something, going into this book - and I know it's always a challenge to write a book.",
        "I've never written a book that was an easy book to write.",
        "But this one, I thought I had a little bit of a leg up because here I had a wonderful character already ready-made.",

        "I didn't have to invent a voice.",

        "All I had to do was re-read her essays and her letters and capture her voice and I'd be able to - she'd speak right through me.",
        "I could put her in my fictional scenes and I would hear her.",
        "Only once I, you know, sat down in front of that computer screen and actually had to capture the voice of Dorothy Parker, I had completely renewed respect, not just for her wit, which was so brilliant, but also her precision with language and her economy of words.",
        "It was so precise that I had to really just take a laser tool to edit the book and capture Dorothy Parker's voice to make it as precise as it really was.",

        "It was really meaningful and satisfying.",

        "The challenge of that trip back for me now that I know that there is space for me to be Ethiopian, in part, because my realization as I came back is that the number of people who have affected - who are on the margins in the way I had thought myself to be - sort of an outsider to the culture.",
        "There's actually very many of us now.",
        "And I think that we are able to redefine what it means to be Ethiopian because of the number of immigrants and the number of Ethiopians born here who feel a tie to Ethiopia has sort of redefined what it means.",

        "Are you concerned at all that sort of the legacy of outspokenness that is part of your family history could create problems for you even now and for your family there now?",
        "It's a very repressive government and there are many who suffer under it, both my - in my family and others.",
        "And I think that the obligation to speak out very much rest on people - on my shoulders and others who are in a country where it is possible to do that without risk of immediate repercussion.",
        "My father was among those tried in absentia for the violence that came out of the 2005 elections.",
        "Yes, so yes, it is a repressive government.",
        "It has a human rights record that has been detailed by Amnesty International and others and it's something that I think Ethiopians and the diaspora have an obligation and many do speak out against.",
