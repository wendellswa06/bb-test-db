        "Well, I wrote in the dedication that the book is dedicated to them and their cousins, my sibling's children, who I think - I write that I hope that they will be able to decide for themselves what relationship that they will have in - with Ethiopia.",
        "And I think it's hard to look forward and see what the world will be like after the continuing sort of pressures of globalization and the continuing movement of people.",
        "Perhaps my children will be completely New Yorkers, and that would be fine with me, if that's what they choose or are able to choose.",
        "Maybe Ethiopia will choose them; maybe other parts of their heritage will choose them.",
        "I think it would be a lost for Ethiopia if they felt no connection whatsoever, but I do think that's something that they will have to decide for themselves.",
        "Here's my final question for you.",
        "You know, you can look at things that happened in your life from a lot of different perspectives, and my question for you is as you look at your life and how you are uprooted from your homeland in Ethiopian and dropped, literally, into the United States and now you have the opportunity to go back and reconnect.",
        "As you look at that experience, do you feel a sense that perhaps you were robbed of the opportunity to grow up in Ethiopia or do you see it now perhaps as an opportunity that was provided you to have a completely different life.",
        "It's hard to pick one or the other.",
        "I think that for so many years, I felt the lost.",
        "I felt the lost of community that I write about in there.",
        "I felt uprooted.",
        "I don't - the best word I can use to describe it.",
        "So many decisions that we had to make, so many judgments were made without the framework that I could see that my classmates had, those who were better rooted in the States.",
        "At the same time, I am quite aware that my life having come here at 11 is so dramatically different from the lives that are lead by the majority",
        "I think I write in the book that I don't regret leaving Ethiopia.",
        "I can't even regret the circumstances under which we left Ethiopia because I know that the years after 1976 when we left, which were 1977 and 1978 - the red terror - those were the years in which there were literally bodies on the streets.",
        "And I missed those years, and I grew up here.",
        "We had the opportunity to regain our footing, as I said, and I'm quite aware of all the good fortune I've had in terms of education and other things that have come my way.",
        "So I'm quite grateful for having been able to grow up here and have all the things that I have.",
        "I know what I lost but I think the trip also made me realized that a lot of that I did carry with me.",
        "The - sort of the values, the family affection, the love, all of the things that help sort of regain the footing here weren't completely lost to me.",
        "So it would be okay if I were to say to you now: Welcome home?",
        "I will take both countries as home and I would thank you for the welcome.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Rebecca, thank you for coming on.",
        "I appreciated the conversation."
