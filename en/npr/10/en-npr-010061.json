        "Well, the takeaway was that Senator Barack Obama gets what his presidency means to people of color, and it seems like that would be an obvious thing.",
        "But remember, a while back, just in the early part of the primaries, there were pools out saying that they weren't sure of what people of color would do in terms of voting for him.",
        "But he used the word \"\"we\"\" quite a bit in this speech, and he talked about his place within the legacy of civil rights.",
        "But he also talked about his domestic policy issues in the context of that, and in the context of bringing African-Americans and their political agenda to the table with everyone else's.",
        "Now, in a speech last year to the NAACP, Obama said there is more work to do when there are more black men in prison than in college.",
        "And last night he focused on personal responsibility.",
        "Let's take a listen.",
        "I know there are some who have been saying I've been too tough talking about responsibility.",
        "NAACP, I'm here to report, I'm not going to stop talking about it.",
        "Because as much as I'm out there fighting, to make sure government is doing its job, and the marketplace is doing its job, and we are passing laws to bring more investment, and more education, and more infrastructure into our communities and putting our young people back to work.",
        "No matter how much money we invest in our communities, how many 10-point plans we propose, how many government programs we launch, non of it will make a difference, at least not enough of a difference, if we also, at the same time, don't seize more responsibility in our own lives.",

        "Walmart says it's already made the change in about 1,000 stores, and it has been happening since 2016, this replacement with, quote, \"\"customer hosts.\"\" And the frustrating part has been that none of the workers I've talked to have actually seen any kind of document explaining the policy or its rollout or how it might be disproportionately affecting workers with disabilities.",
        "I spoke to the family of two workers who were affected by this last year.",
        "They're actually cousins, Joe and John Wirth.",
