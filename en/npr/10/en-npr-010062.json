        "He did, but he raised it sort of in the context of domestic policy.",
        "So there was conversation about things like the Earned Income Tax Credit or school and education and policies there.",
        "But there wasn't a sort of specific agenda that the government should be doing to provide for African-Americans.",
        "I think this speech was more about bringing in this African-American audience into the fold and into the conversation he's trying to, I guess, have with the rest of America.",
        "Now, Senator McCain decided not to attend the convention last year before the GOP pack was narrowed.",
        "Why do you think now, as the presumptive nominee, he sees things very differently and he seems, at least - or he's stated he's enthusiastic about coming?",
        "Well, you know, it's all about location, location, location.",
        "And this year's 99th annual convention is in the key battleground state of Ohio.",
        "And the thing about Ohio is while the conversation during the Democratic primary race was about working white voters in that state, it is a state that has a significant African-American population.",
        "And perhaps the McCain campaign finds that this is the year that it makes sense to bypass this sort of event, in considering how close this race could be come fall.",

        "And on the other hand, I've been saying very strongly, since before the invasion of Iraq, that the United States does not belong as an occupying power in that part of the world.",
        "And that doesn't apply to - directly to the situation in Libya, but it does apply to how we articulate our foreign policy and measure our national interest, as compared, by the way, to the situation that we find ourselves in in East Asia.",
        "Well, let's get to that and to the op-ed you wrote for The Wall Street Journal.",
        "And just as a reminder, we're talking about the South China Sea, two island groups, the Spratlys and the Paracels.",
        "There are overlapping claims to those islands, which - those waters carry an enormous percentage of the world's maritime traffic.",

        "Mr. Rabi wrote that Dr. Caporale `may have faith in science to someday learn the answers, but the evidence of similar genetics or similar features of different species is proof of intelligent design rather than natural selection by chance.'",

        "at all when there are so much to be done, and a lot has been made about his appearance on the Jay Leno show and whether or not it's the first time a sitting president has ever made an appearance on a late-night show.",
        "It reminded me of Bill Clinton going on Arsenio, but I think Clinton was, if memory serves, a candidate at the time.",
        "Right.",
        "Marcus, how big a deal is this, his going on that show?",

        "And as we just heard, I think, the importance that it will play is one of, I think, character and one of stature and one of calm.",
        "It's the image that the president gave off of not being scared, of not being at his wit's end, of not being in a panic that I think will actually be the lasting import of his appearance on Leno.",
        "I think it actually - there was some conservative and some Republican commentary beforehand saying that Barack Obama was diminishing the presidency.",
        "In fact, I think seeing the president out and not fearful actually is a good thing for Americans.",
        "I think we're in a very anxious-filled time - anxiety-filled time, and I think he actually modeled the right behavior for us, and I think that was an incredibly useful thing.",
        "I - when I heard the criticism, I thought about back to Jimmy Carter, back who, you know, would not leave the White House during Iran-Contra, wouldn't campaign on his re-election bid because he was trying to get those hostages out - excuse me, the hostage, Iran hostage crisis, trying to get hostages out of Iran, he didn't want to be out, you know, do anything else.",
        "He wanted to show that he was serious about that problem.",
        "As President Obama said - and he has criticized Carter for that, for being held prisoner of the crisis.",

        "Well, let me bring Jerome in to get his opinion.",

        "He could talk about it in a relaxed sort of way.",

        "It's kind of ironic when I look back at my Senate campaign because the last debate that I had in the '06 campaign, my opponent and I were allowed to ask each other one direct question, and I asked him what he thought we should do in the Senkaku Islands.",
        "And I think a lot of people thought that maybe was a low blow.",

        "They are off the - between Taiwan and Okinawa.",
