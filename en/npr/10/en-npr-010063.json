        "And, Senator Webb, you mentioned the gathering storm.",
        "There's a possibility - nobody is interested in a war in that region, I don't think.",
        "But the actions of the Chinese, the semi-official daily - the People's Daily - when Secretary Clinton brought this up most recently - told her to, quote, \"\"Shut up.",
        "I think that the thing that we all should be concerned about, you know, in spite of the fact that our attention becomes so continually diverted to the Arab world and to the issues in Iraq and Afghanistan, is that the power structure in East Asia over time, over the past more than 100 years, has been very volatile when one of those three countries - Japan, China or Russia - becomes so dominant that it becomes more aggressive in the region.",
        "And one of the things that we are seeing recently is that the Chinese have used a different formula in the South China Sea.",
        "And just in the past couple of months, for instance, rather than simply asserting that they have sovereignty claims in the Paracels, which is also claimed by Vietnam, they have created a new government structure, and they have put a military garrison in the Paracels.",
        "And this new structure that they have created, this new prefecture, as it were, that reports directly to the central government is in their view responsible for the South China Sea Islands all the way down almost to the Strait of Malacca.",
        "That's about two million square kilometers.",
        "This is a major step.",
        "It's different than simply the arguments over sovereignty that we've seen before.",
        "And that's why I wrote in The Wall Street Journal that this is a moment where the United States is going to have to step up and show some leadership.",
        "We need to, you know, to address this in a different way than we have in the past.",
        "What we've said in the past is essentially we take no position on sovereignty claims - and we don't, by the way.",
        "But this is different than a sovereignty claim.",
        "This is an actual creation of a government structure and an assertion that that is a part of China.",
        "We have to find a way to address this directly.",
        "I have to ask you, as the chairman of the relevant subcommittee, you have a strong voice in this issue, which, as you say, is going to be very important in the years to come.",
        "You've chosen to retire at the end of this term.",
        "Given the importance you put on this, wouldn't you have a stronger voice if you continue in the Senate?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Well, my own personal career - my professional career, I have spent almost exactly half my time in public service and half of my time doing other things, particularly writing.",
        "It's just the, you know, the unwitting cycle that my career has taken.",
        "And I have been writing and speaking about this issue for a very long time, and I know that I will continue to do so.",
        "I wrote a piece for The Wall Street Journal in '01 - 11 years ago, talking about how this incrementalism was affecting the ability of the United States to maintain this presence that allowed the region to grow, and the governmental systems to adapt and modernize, basically.",
        "And we've had an enormous positive impact in this region, and we need to continue to do that.",
        "But since I've been in the Senate, we are focused on this.",
        "The first hearing I held as the chairman on the subcommittee was on sovereignty issues in this area.",
        "And as I said, we passed the Senate resolution last year.",
        "I'm holding a hearing next week to bring a State Department witness in and have a discussion about how the United States should proceed forward on this.",
        "And when I leave the Senate, I'll still be talking about it and participating in the issues, I hope.",
        "Senator Webb, we'll follow the hearings and your subsequent career with interest.",
        "Thanks very much for your time today.",

        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "It's the TALK OF THE NATION broadcasting today from NPR West in Culver City, California.",
        "According to the Pew Research Center for the People in the Press, we Americans are marginally in favor of federal government surveillance of our telephone calls and our emails in the interest of curbing or preventing terrorism.",
        "But that said, the Pew survey also shows that we don't trust our federal government much further than we could toss the Washington Monument.",
        "About the government's assertions that only metadata is being collected - that is to say, only telephone numbers and email addresses - as a nation, we suspect that's hooey.",
        "Seventy percent of us think the data is being collected for purposes other than policing terrorists.",
        "Sixty-three percent think the government is actually collecting the content of the calls and emails.",
        "And about half of those who thing so believe the feds are already reading their emails or listening to their telephone calls.",
        "If that is true, we have to give up now and forever on any notions that the government might be smaller.",
        "Even armed with algorithms, it would take a lot of people to monitor all our communicating.",
        "But still, by a narrow margin, 50 to 44 percent, we think that maybe we better let the feds continue with this information harvest.",
        "As much as I enjoy the apparently conflicting ideas we chose to believe at the same time, as recorded in the Pew study, I think this is a fairly typical example of that great American virtue common sense.",
        "While we feel ourselves to be in danger and are willing to be surveyed to help keep danger at bay, we also know that anything can be done will be done.",
        "If all that data is sitting somewhere, someone will look at it, and then someone will think of something to do with all that information.",
        "That's just common sense.",
        "Another interesting thing in this data, though, is bipartisan agreement.",
        "About the same number of Democrats and Republicans - roughly four in 10 - now think anti-terror policies have gone too far in eroding civil liberties.",
        "That is not a majority but it's broad agreement.",
        "Independents and voters who identify with the Tea Party feel even more strongly that civil liberties are endangered.",

        "While it's important in this moment - and for those of us who are, you know, Beltway junkies - I don't think it's important in the long run.",
        "I think that as part of the long run it's a fact not - you were talking about $165 million in bonuses.",

        "We're already up to trillions of dollars in bailout, so we have to do to save this economy.",
        "I think the real danger from AIG is the fact that public outrage may sap popular support for the next round of bailouts, for the next American companies that need it, and there will be next companies that will need it.",
        "And if we don't bail those out, if we can't help those companies because public outrage is so great over this AIG nonsense, then that means we're going to hurt ourselves, the American - public American consumer.",
        "The American taxpayer will be hurt in the end because if the economy doesn't rebound, then we're all going to pay a much, much heavier price than $165 million to - to some people who did not deserve it.",
        "Well, you're right.",
        "But Tim Geithner, Jerome, seems to really be the one with the biggest target on his back at the moment.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, people are really down on him for not stopping these bonuses from going forward.",
        "And I know here in Detroit, for example, there are a lot of people who are upset about the bonuses.",

        "And here these people are getting millions and millions and millions of dollars in bonuses after they've, you know, run the company into the ground.",
        "So, I think Marcus is right.",
        "I think it's going to be very interesting to see how the political capital gets outweighed by the fear of what's going on in Main Street.",
        "Now, I mentioned that there was a parallel track, one blaming people for what happened, the other trying to figure out a way to fix it.",
        "I'd like to ask both of you to just hold on for a few moments; we're going to take a break.",
        "And when we come back on the other side of that break, I want to examine just what Congress is intending to do to try to recoup some of that money, and what your opinions are about how likely that is to work.",

        "All right guys, we were talking about AIG, and the president has vowed to quote, fix the system and culture that made this possible.",
        "Here's my question for you, Marcus.",
        "One of the reasons that we got into this situation, at least if you believe what Tim Geithner said, is that they had to put this language in there because of the existing binding contracts that AIG had.",
        "So now they're trying to - Congress - to do an end run around that and tax the money so heavily that the net effect is nobody gets the money.",
        "But if they can do it this way, on the back end, why couldn't they have done it this way on the front end?",
        "Well, you know, I'm not sure it's going to work, and that's the - there's discussion whether or not this is even constitutional, to single out one group of taxpayers in this way.",
        "I don't know if they could've done that on the front end.",
        "I don't know if you can abrogate those contracts, which is what we've been told, is what Secretary of Treasury Geithner said, or initially that he had been told by lawyers of the Treasury, that that was his understanding before the president said, well, let's go back and take a second look and see if we can do that.",
        "You know, it's very interesting.",
        "Jerome mentioned, of course, you know, the Big Three in Detroit and the fact is they're currently, you know, renegotiating contracts with the United Auto Workers.",
        "Those are contracts that existed and, you know, worked but they're going to be changed.",
        "So, I really do worry, though, about, you know, if we abrogated the contracts, will these financial companies say, well, OK, if you're going to determine our compensation, our taxes on bonuses - and many of these folk are actually, get most of their income through their bonuses - then the companies are going to say, well, we're not going to participate in the government program.",

        "Well, you know, Jerome, it's an interesting point because not only are they trying to negotiate a new deal on top of the deal that was already struck, they're trying to negotiate it in public.",
        "Anyone that's been a part of any sort of labor negotiations or contract negotiations can tell you doing so in public really is not the best place or the best way, is it?",
        "No, not at all, because everyone has little secrets and whatnot in the negotiations that they want to keep that way.",

        "Let's move on to another topic.",
        "For the last few years, we have been hearing the hype about the death of printed newspapers.",
        "And now that hype is quickly becoming reality - the Seattle Post-Intelligencer shutting its print division, the Rocky Mountain News is gone, the Christian Science Monitor only offered online, the Detroit News, the Detroit Free Press cutting home delivery to three days a week, even NPR has announced that it will no longer subscribe to any newspapers.",
        "Jerome, is this the beginning of the end for newspapers as we have known them?",
        "Briefly, I say yes.",
        "I mean, you know, we were stunned here in Detroit when we heard that the News and the Free Press, you know, these papers that Detroiters rely on day in and day out, they're going to cut back to three days of delivery a week, and that this is going to be a new model.",
        "The question I have and a lot of people have, you know, besides saying, all right, I'm going to miss having that textile in my hand every day is, you know, how are these papers going to make money?",
        "The Web model is not there to make money in the same way that it was for an actual newspaper.",
        "So I think there are real questions about, are papers going to be able to stay financially viable with this new model?",
        "Well, let's ask Marcus Mabry.",
        "You're the international business editor for the New York Times.",
        "What about that?",
        "No, Jerome raises exactly, exactly the crucial question.",
        "As hard as it is for those of us in the business who are, you know, losing jobs or seeing colleagues lose jobs, who are seeing colleagues have to go out there and you have to find some other work at the time in which it's obviously - as we've been discussing, this is not the economy which you want to be looking for a job.",
        "In addition to that kind of emotional - you know, painful side of it, there is the business reality, which is if we all were to stop making our newspapers, which does incur a certain cost to make a printed newspaper, and if we all went only online today, we would not be able to support the kind of newsroom that we have in the New York Times, and international correspondents around the world and with investigative reporters who can try to keep people honest in Washington.",
        "That model would not be able to be supported because we make much less money from the ads that we do online than we do from the ads in the printed paper.",
        "Even today, that remains the case, even though there are circulation challenges throughout the industry for the printed paper.",
        "So it really - we have not found the business model that's going to work that's all online.",
        "And if we were to try to do that right now, you'd basically see the end of American journalism if we all try to migrate online only.",
        "We wouldn't be able to support what we do as journalists, and I think that would be a huge loss for democracy.",
        "So we're going to have to - you know, hopefully there will be a business model.",
        "Hopefully, those of us who remain will be able to find a business model where we can actually make money online and then, you know, that would save journalism as we know it.",
        "We'll, let's end the conversation with this, gentlemen.",
        "We have only a couple of moment left, and as you know, this is our final broadcast, and both of you have been a major part of our conversations on Reporters Roundtable here at News & Notes.",
        "Without - I don't want this to sound self-serving for us because we're leaving, and we have our own personal feelings about that, but I do want to ask you both as journalists, you first, Jerome, really briefly, where will the voices be heard without shows like ours and others that do what we try to do?",
        "I think there needs to be new shows that will continue that voice.",

        "He got let go a little while ago, and he had the next-generation radio project training young journalists, young minority journalists to come and be the next generation.",
