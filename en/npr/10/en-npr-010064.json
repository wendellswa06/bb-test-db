        "Well, my hope - one hope as we go into the sunset is that - as we've been discussing, the digital medium will provide a new way, and perhaps on the bright side of it a more democratic way, a less expensive way to have more voices out there, a plethora and a pluralization of voices because we need to be everywhere, as we've always said, people of color, our voices need to be everywhere.",
