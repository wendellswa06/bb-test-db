        "I was wondering when one group would leave and another group would come, would they, like, incorporate what was previously drawn and sort of add to it or they just do away and say our style is better, so we're just going to draw something over your art?",
        "In the beginning with the very ornate art that is so impressive, I mean, the figures can be 12 feet tall and reach 18 feet off the ceiling.",
        "They're monumental, and they're impressive.",
        "And rarely did anybody who came after that do anything to damage them.",

        "It won't have damaged the older painting, but it will have used it as a framing mechanism.",
        "But the later style - also, there is a great deal of scraping off of paint pigment from a lot of these.",

        "In fact, private equity firms have been very shy about investing in utility companies in the past because they've largely had to cope with being highly regulated.",

        "And when I thought about the decision, the question of whether I should accept the offer from the University of South Carolina, it quickly became - it was very difficult for a few minutes, and then it wasn't difficult at all because it was about going home to my 83-year-old father and my about to be 80-year-old mother and to my family of brothers and their families there.",

        "Oh, yes.",

        "At 55, I'm quite aware of who I am and what I bring with me.",
