        "attorney told me that investigators decide on a step like this.",
        "To do so, they would want to have very persuasive evidence to present it to a judge because judges are wary of doing something like this.",
        "It's also something that - within the Justice Department and the FBI, this is going to have to be signed off on at a very high level.",
        "Most likely, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, would be involved in this.",
        "The FBI director, Christopher Wray, might know.",
        "And then, also, since this is going to this southern district of New York, you would have the U.S.",
        "attorney there, man by the name of Geoffrey Berman who would be involved as well.",
        "Who was tapped by President Trump.",
        "Worth noting, these are all Trump appointees - Wray, Rosenstein and Berman.",
        "Now, while it's rare to get something like this, what it suggests is that, one, investigators had reason to believe that Cohen possessed possible evidence of a crime and, two, that they were likely concerned about possible destruction of evidence."
