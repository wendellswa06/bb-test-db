        "It's bright and cheerful, dynamic.",

        "And it means fun, fierce and frivolous African art.",
        "So anything that has joy and hope at the center of it coming from Africa I consider AFROBUBBLEGUM.",
        "And it was incredibly important that I tell stories of joy, stories of love, stories of resilience and absolute radiance.",
        "I like the term radical hope.",
        "And those kind of stories are incredibly important to tell not only because we need to see images of ourselves so that we know we are worthy of hopeful existences, but so that other people can start to see us as that.",
        "And if Africa is actually the cradle of humanity, then we need to be able to be sensitive about Africa and the depiction of Africans because it speaks to so much of where our lineage came from not only as people of color and people in the diaspora, but in a genetics sort of a way, you know?",
        "We want to think that we are born of love and joy.",
        "And our existence as a whole has been joyful and loving and kind.",
        "And the only way to do that is if we see images of ourselves in joy and in love."
