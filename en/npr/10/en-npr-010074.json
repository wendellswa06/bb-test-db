        "If you track that sentiment backwards, I think, it leads you to couple of conclusions.",
        "one is that the current system we have of insurance underwriting, for at least - for small group policies, individual and family policies - is morally indefensible.",
        "It's a Catch 22.",
        "In insurance underwriting, if you come before an insurance company and you've got a very sick family member, let say, with a chronic disease; they least want to insure you the more likely you're to be sick - that is to file the claim.",
        "So it works absolutely against what we think health care ought to be about, which is, it should be there when you need it.",
        "So there's a Catch 22 built into the heart of our current system of health care.",
        "Len Nichols, give us a little bit of the history of health care - we didn't always have it, did we?",
        "Well, no and what's fascinating is to think about, in particular, the history of health insurance.",
        "Originally, around the time of the turn of the century and a little bit later, most private insurer - well, all private insurers, eschewed health insurance.",
        "They were afraid they could never distinguish between the sick and the healthy.",
        "And therefore, they were afraid that only the sick would buy.",
        "So, they refused to sell it.",
        "The Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations were created out of desperation about the time of The Great Depression, when hospitals figured out regular people�",
        "In fact, the first observation that sort of triggered their inspiration, was when school teachers couldn't afford normal delivery - couldn't afford to pay for a baby being born out of their normal accumulated savings.",
        "They realized we had to do something about the cost of health care.",
        "So they had the idea of pulling together, across the entire community - again a very communitarian original impulse - have everyone, or at least most people, buy into it and charge them all the same rate; and then they would be covered for their health needs in the hospital.",
        "Initially, physicians opposed that they have thought it was socialism as usual.",
        "But then they figured out wait, hospitals are being paid and we're not.",
        "So, the doctors formed their own, the hospitals made Blue Cross.",
        "The doctors made Blue Shield.",
        "They put them together.",
        "They were always organized as a non-profit, chartered by the individual states - that's why they were originally 50, and in fact more, few states have more than one.",
        "And that's what health insurance was until the commercials figured out, hey, those Blue Cross guys have figured how to make money.",
        "They figured out how to at least break even on this stuff.",
        "We can go in there and sell to the healthy and discriminate against the sick, charge the healthy a little bit less than the average priced Blue Cross is charging, and we'll make out like bandits.",
        "And that's really when the insurance market became, I would say, beginning down the road of being dysfunctional.",

        "I'm in the investment business and frankly I like insurance companies as a business.",
        "So what I was going to comment on, or point out, is that if the object of a profit-making business - which all these companies are - is to pick off the 50 percent of the population that only spends five percent of the health care dollars - and you can make out like a bandit.",
        "That's basically why they don't like universal coverage, but the whole idea of insurance is that you form a big pool and then you can sort things out.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so what's concerned me in this argument, lately, is that Medicare, which is a right if you're 65 years old in this country and a citizen - they're actually paying the advantage plans of premium of eight to 12 percent over what the Medicare premium that the people pay in.",
        "All right.",
