        "And I think now there's been much more of that.",
        "And to me the main reason is because health care has come to cost so much, we've seen that more and more people are being excluded from our system and more and more professionals within it understand our system is actually not sustainable so we don't really have a choice of maintaining the status quo.",
        "And that's why I think you see more and more people willing to come together, long enough to understand as Tom said they actually do have a common framework.",

        "Hi.",

        "It was wrong to have this subclass of people.",
        "And just - I think some parallels can be drawn between that and today's society where we really said with slavery: freedom is a fundamental right, it's a fundamental thing that everyone needs - seems like we're saying a lot of those similar things about health care.",
        "It's a fundamental necessity.",
        "It's a fundamental right.",

        "Tom?",
        "Well, in Len's wonderful essay, and I'm particularly proud of his essay in stewardship in this collection, he cites the Institute of Medicine's study that about 20,000 Americans die each year just because they don't have health insurance and then don't get the health care they need now.",
        "That means, since the last debate on health reform under the Clinton administration, about 300,000 Americans have died simply because we don't have a health insurance plan that works for everyone.",
        "That's unconscionable, I think.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's talk a little bit about, Tom, the value of responsibility.",
        "You put that as one of your values.",
        "When you're talking about the responsibility, you can also veer off into a discussion about how people are responsible for maintaining their health.",
        "Yes.",
        "Like smoking - things like that.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, people have to take responsibility for doing what's necessary to take care of their own health, just as they have to take responsibility and universal participation for - participating in some way in the financing of this system.",
        "So responsibility has many aspects in health care.",
        "But that's a core American value and it belongs to the conversation as well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "Len, is employer-based health care part of our value system?",
        "Well, you know, that's a great question.",
        "And I would say, in a way, it is an accident of history.",
        "As you probably know, we didn't have employer-based coverage until World War II.",
        "And during World War II, of course, in an attempt to try to suppress inflation, which is often a risk in wartime economies, we had wages frozen by the government.",
        "And when they froze wages at the same time with so many men and even women but certainly a lot of people fighting overseas, we had a shortage of labor, so firms were competing for workers.",
        "And they wanted to offer them something.",
        "They couldn't raise wages so they offered them health benefits, and that's really where employer-based coverage came from.",
        "Then the Congress decided to make it tax-free to do that as another inducement to give employers a tool for recruiting and that tax-free dimension of the employer-provided benefits solidified - became the glue that then became the cornerstone of the way we get coverage."

        "Seventy, 75 percent of our population was covered that way.",
        "But as health care became more expensive, as markets became more global and more firms were competing internationally with countries that have more efficient health care systems and rely less on employer financing, our ability to compete internationally, as you've seen lately, has gone down.",
        "Employers offer way less than they used to, and now we're below 60 percent of our population covered in an employer framework.",
        "And I'd say reform that we're talking about now in Congress will not end the employer system but it will replace it for small firms, which have the most health trouble in the insurance market, and give individuals who've never had a group offer a place to buy health insurance efficiently and fairly.",
        "And I would predict over time the large firms will move their workers in there, too, but it may very well take 20 years or more.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "If Thomas Jefferson wrote life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and in his writings equates happiness with the ability to be healthy - because you can't really be happy unless you're healthy, as we pointed out before - that would seem to be something that the founding fathers thought that should be universally, you know, guaranteed to people, as much as housing and food and education and things.",
        "That should be something that should be offered to people as part of their way of life.",
