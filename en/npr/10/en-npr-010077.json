        "You know, September 15th, this report from General David Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, was going to come out.",
        "And at that point, members of Congress who are sort of on the fence would begin to decide whether they were going to continue to support the troop surge or whether they're going to start talking about a pullout, a phase withdrawal.",
        "Now, that just isn't on the cards.",
        "And so this July report that's supposed to come out before Sunday is taken on a whole new importance.",
        "One of the problems with this report is that the full force of the surge really only came about around mid-June.",
        "So the report will only be able to measure progress - or rather lack of progress - based on the full surge strength, so really only about the past two, two and a half weeks.",
        "Now the White House has adamantly refused to announce a troop drawdown, or talk about it publicly.",
        "But where is Gates on this?",
        "What is his position privately on removing troops from Iraq, or at least a phase withdrawal?"
