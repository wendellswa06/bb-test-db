        "She's right.",
        "As far as I understand this technology, Clark Kent Ervin, it would not disclose anything contained in - if somebody had swallowed it, for example.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "That is right, certainly right.",
        "You know, I would note that there was a recent attempt to assassinate the interior minister in Saudi Arabia, Prince Nayef.",
        "And the weapon of choice was PET(ph), and it was actually spirited - hidden in the body cavity - the rectum, actually - of the would-be terrorist.",
        "And chances are, this technology would not notice that.",
        "On the other hand, as I said earlier, this technology - the whole-body image - should be used in conjunction with other technologies like explosive trace detectors, puffer machines that can be perfected, that would then detect the presence of explosive residue on persons.",
        "And if those two technologies were used in conjunction, it's likely that this kind of episode would have been avoided.",
        "So we need a number of technologies to pull it simultaneously.",
        "All right.",
        "Karen, thank you.",
        "Here's an email along the same lines from Leah(ph).",
        "And she says: The concerns of privacy are a primary concern, but why is no one discussing possible health effects of repeated scans and the types of radiation used to do them?",
        "I know one of these devices uses X-rays.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And experts have looked at that issue -of course, it's a legitimate question - and they've determined that the amount of radiation to which one is exposed is really minimal.",
        "It's much less than the normal amount of radiation that we're all exposed to just going about our daily lives.",
        "Here's one, an email that I suggest might not be entirely in earnest.",

        "And I can tell you, having flown into Belfast many times during the troubles as a reporter carrying a bag full of electronic - I was searched regularly and quite thoroughly, I would say.",

        "They've consistently remained at 40 or just below 40 over the last several months, and that's been the result of a number of factors.",
        "The speech is interesting because there's actually a divergence in terms of the tone vs. substance.",
        "In terms of the tone, the tone is a combative one, or at least the expected speech is one where the president would seem to be saying, `Stay the course,' but in reality, the substance of it seems to suggest that the president is responding to criticism that there needs to be an exit plan.",
        "And while he hasn't offered a lot new, there is the assumption, expectations--I talked to Republicans across Capitol Hill--that the president is looking for a way to begin a drawdown on the troops at some point next year.",
        "And so you're clearly not hearing that now.",
        "You're not going to hear the president say anything explicit in that way before the December 15th elections in Iraq, but there's clearly an expectation on the part of those Republicans running in 2006 that the president needs to at least offer an olive branch, if you will, or a sense that an end is somewhere in sight.",
        "George Curry, also very clear from this White House, without question: that you will not hear a timetable.",
        "It is clear that the White House is simply saying to not only the general public but constituents as well, `We are not going to give you a hard-line timetable.'",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I read that 35-page, quote, \"\"victory in Iraq pre-speech report,\"\" and I basically--you know, even the White House admits there's nothing new in it but it's the first time they've all compiled in one place that's unclassified.",
        "The administration has taken a calculated risk here.",
        "This is the risk.",
        "They are basically trying to sell the idea that the very highly suspect Iraqi military can suddenly protect the country, and just as recently as two months ago, we had the US commander in the Middle East tell a Senate committee that of 100 military battalions formed over the previous two years, only one is fully equipped and capable of operating independently.",
        "So this whole pressure from both conservatives and liberals to get out is saying, `OK.",
        "We'll turn them over to the Iraqis,' and they are not capable.",
        "Even Pentagon people say off the record that you're really looking at 2007 before you have a realistic force that can do that.",
        "Well, Callie, I should note that George was far more diligent than I.",
        "I only looked at the highlights of that 35-page report.",
        "George read the whole thing, but one of the things that stood out to me is that the Bush administration suggests in this report that the insurgents can only win if the US surrenders.",
        "And they also talked about making progress on the political front and it will become more clearly identified to those who are willing to support the new Iraqi government.",
        "And for those who do not support it, they must be either killed, captured, detained or prosecuted.",
        "One of the interesting points here is there are those who will see this and hear this and simply label it as `occupation language.'"
