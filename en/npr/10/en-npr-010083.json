        "So, Adam Kleimer and - in the book \"\"Swing Voters,\"\" and they say that they looked at the national election survey data.",

        "Certainly we saw in late 2003 when he was being heavily criticized in Democratic primaries in early 2004 by Howard Dean and later by John Kerry and others, while the president was quiet early on, instead of merely compromising, you know, there was a combative tone that you heard in early 2004 as he pushed back."

        "Let me turn our attention to a videotape that most people have seen over the course of the last week, and that is of young black men ransacking a convenience store, a party store, whatever you want to call it, depending on where you live in the country, dressed in suits and bow ties.",

        "It's not exploitive if, in fact, you're pitching the demand.",

        "I mean, the question is whether or not violence is a way to answer the question.",
        "Because there is a demand there, of course those liquor stores are there because they know they can make money.",
        "On the other hand, there are some forces in the community--obviously, these young men represent them--who are saying, `Listen, this is draining our community.",
        "Why always in our space must these stores be?",
        "And we know the damage that is being done to members of the community.",
        "So let's make a political stand.",
        "Now they're making a violent, overt one, but they are indeed.",
        "And by the way, the latest is that two of the young men who were seen on the tape have turned themselves in.",
        "So I don't know more details than that from the police.",
        "So we don't know if, in fact, they are members of the Nation of Islam or if they're young men who are just wearing the uniform, if you will, of the bow ties and the suits.",
        "But whatever they are, they've decided that this is not to be in their neighborhood, and so the question is whether or not violence is the way to do it.",
        "And I would say no and even the Nation leaders have said no, but at the same time...",
        "We should not--forgive me, Callie, but we should note that, while those two gentlemen have turned themselves in, we note that a couple of days after this occurrence, the store was torched and blazed.",
        "Please continue.",
        "So, I mean, that's what it comes down to.",
        "I think you lose your message if you're trying to make a political one by torching and blazing and by committing the kind of violence that was there.",
        "I think there's a way to make a political statement, and maybe they just decided that the way to do it was one in the extreme.",
        "I think we really need to withhold judgment about the Nation of Islam whether they're involved.",
        "They have simply said they're not.",
        "And I remember these same kind of speculations happened immediately at Oklahoma City with Timothy McVeigh.",

        "We have to go to the source and not the people who are there offering those services.",
        "You know, the one other thing, though, to add to this, Ed, is we've seen repeatedly over the course of American history that our democracy has been responsive, sometimes slowly, though, to such protest movements.",
        "And even in the last 18 to 24 months, whether it's been--we just talked about immigration--whether it's been some of the individual immigration protests on the border there in Arizona and other states which have led to more focus on the question of immigration, whether it's been more recently in the Terri Schiavo case, people saying that the current laws are inadequate and seeming to move on that that frequently when there's a sustained protest against what are thought of as inappropriate laws if there is some response.",
        "And so, you know, this may not become a sustained protest, but if it were to become one, I wouldn't be surprised to see a greater focus and other tools besides violence used in order to address, you know, what is at least part of a serious issue.",
        "Well, I think sustained protest is fine.",
        "I'm questioning the method of the protest.",
        "I mean, I'm all for advocacy and strong advocacy bringing attention to a problem, and I do think that there is a conversation to be had about this very issue in our communities.",
        "I just don't think that violence is going to bring to the side of the folks who are protesting supporters.",
        "But, George Curry, you and I have probably been involved in more years than we'd like to different roundtables, town hall meetings, etc., that have addressed, I should say, this issue and others.",
        "It seems as though this is an issue that is ongoing and, as you suggest, maybe from the source has not been able to find a way to eradicate the problem.",

        "And that's where the Nation of Islam has been effective, quite frankly, in some of these communities, is they have been able to uplift people, probably more than any other civil rights group out here, in terms of dealing with that.",
