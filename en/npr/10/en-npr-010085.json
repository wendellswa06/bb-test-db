        "They are voters who that election that they were involved in the primaries they supported as Bonnie did, say Hillary Clinton.",
        "Their candidate did not win and so until fairly late in the game, they tend to be undecided, in part, as a result of that.",
        "Again, you know you can't use the aggregate data to predict any one person.",
        "Where Bonnie will go, will have a lot to do with, you know, I guess what Joe Biden says tonight or in a week or whatever.",
        "But in general, they break very, very heavily towards whichever party they voted for in the primary.",
        "That tends to be the scenario of it - that there is a lot of lingering mistrust of the candidate who they did not support in the primary.",
        "But at the end of the day, the party affiliation tends to be stronger than the (unintelligible).",
        "Because frankly, if you were a Hillary Clinton supporter, Barack Obama is much closer to everything you apparently believe than John McCain is.",
        "I mean there's literally not issue where the two of them - where John McCain stacks up better at Hillary Clinton than Barack Obama does, but you still may not feel great about him given the biases you picked up and beliefs you picked up and you know sort of an anger you picked up during the primary.",
        "And remember the criticisms your candidate had against him.",
