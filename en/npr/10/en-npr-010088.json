        "The wrappers were different, Karl Fleming says, but the message to blacks was the same.",
        "`You know what?",
        "We're in control, boy.'",

        "One of the speakers was Stokely Carmichael.",
        "I had known him for years, covering all the civil rights stories down South.",
        "And we were friendly--cocky young guy that he was, so cocky that people said he looked like he was strutting when he was standing still.",
        "On that day, Carmichael remembered Fleming, too.",
        "Stokely was on some kind of little raised platform talking about this killing and saying that, `We had to have justice and we had to have revenge.",
        "And we're going to go down to City Hall and demand they turn those cops that shot Deadwyler over and put him on trial and find him guilty, else there was going to be hell to pay.",
        "And he said, `And not only that, there are these white reporters that come down here exploiting us.",
        "And he looked direct--he pointed directly at me.",
        "I was the only white guy there, standing kind of at the back of the crowd.",
        "Fleming was unsure whether Carmichael, famous for his ironic sense of humor, was indulging in a dark, private joke between them.",
        "I guarantee you, I didn't find it very funny, because he didn't know it--as much about South Central LA as I did, because I had been here the previous year in the Watts riots and I had felt that black rage and I knew what it felt like to be a white guy standing around in South Central Watts, which was a really not-good feeling.",
        "It certainly wasn't that day.",
        "The crowd's anger was rising as the sun was beginning to set.",
        "They marched to the 77th Street police station to protest and were turned away.",
        "Then they marched to this busy intersection at 84th and Manchester."
