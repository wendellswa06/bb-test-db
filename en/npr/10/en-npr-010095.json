        "Well, in the Kenyan context, it depends in part on who you're talking to.",
        "But I think, in many ways, tribe becomes probably the most salient political factor within politics today.",
        "Well, is it language?",
        "Is it culture?",
        "What is it?",
        "Well, I think it's a combination of a couple of things.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I mean, language is part of the culture.",
        "But ethnicity as being a political identity is something quite different, right?",
        "That's something that's embedded within the structures and institutions of the state and something that's so potently manipulated by political players within Kenyan society.",
        "As opposed to cultural identity or cultural ethnicity, that's something that tends to be much more fluid and identified with things like language and religious customs and things like that.",
        "I've read that - especially up until recent years - if you ask somebody from Kenya who are you, what are you, they would say I'm a Kenyan.",
        "More and more though, these days, they would tend to say I'm a Kikuyu or a Luo or whatever.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think that's also very significant because, you know, the question becomes where does national identity take precedent over ethnic identity?",
        "And it's not surprising to see ethnicity come into the fore particularly during times of political turmoil, or certainly election.",
        "And ethnicity is the card that's so often played by the ruling elite and - for their own end.",
        "And I think that what we see happening with both Kibaki as well as Odinga are each of them playing this ethnic card, not necessarily because they are the men of the people, not necessarily because somebody like Odinga is looking to really push some kind of democratic change, but because these are elite politicians looking to either retain - in the case of Kibaki., or assume power - in the case of Odinga.",
        "And I think, in that sense, we have to be thinking about ethnicity as one of those fear factors that are so easily preyed upon.",
        "We see it happening in other contexts and other elections.",
        "Race is always a big one in places like Africa, and particularly in Kenya right now - it's ethnicity.",
        "No, because I get to a point where I can't find the comedy.",
        "So if I can't find the joke, then I can't talk about it.",
