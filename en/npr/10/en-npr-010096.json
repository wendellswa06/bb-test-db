        "Well, certain identity cards still has ethnicity on it, number one.",
        "And number two, I think this is probably one of the most important points that we need to come back to.",
        "And that is the genesis of, as I pointed out before, political identity or political ethnicity.",
        "And that we trace back to the British colonial period.",
        "You know, many people will say, well, you know, I wrote this piece in the Inquirer and the Post that stumped to this.",
        "And they said, well, listen, people, obviously, thought of themselves as being Kikuyu or Luo long before the British arrived.",
        "And that's absolutely right.",
        "But they thought about it in cultural terms.",
        "But once culture is picked up and shaped as a kind of genuine tradition, as it was by the British, and then embedded within a legal code so that there are legal distinctions in terms of what ethnic group you belong to.",
        "There was a specific set of laws for each particular ethnic group called customary laws.",
        "And the point of all this was that Africans in Kenya were not supposed to have a kind of racial common future.",
        "There were supposed to have a different ethnic future based upon which ethnic group they belong to.",
        "It's vitally important to see it in that context.",
        "And also, that in Kenya, like in other places, the British used divide- and-rule tactics - rewarding one particular tribe, in particular, as a ruling cast almost, and elevating them others.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "And I think, again, when we think about what's playing out today, there were certainly an enormous fear during the colonial period of what was considered to be Kikuyu ascendancy.",
        "And that was feared both by the European colonist as well as the other ethnic groups within the colony.",
        "And the Kikuyu themselves lived - if you will - cheek in jowl with the European planter settlers who were the most impacted by the capitalist tea and coffee plantations, and they were seen as being some of the most progressive.",
        "And the European government did its best to invoke a divide-and-rule policy, in part based upon what I just laid out - through customary laws to preventing unified political association set, they prevented groups like the Kikuyu and the Luo from actually forming political associations prior to the end of colonial rule.",
        "And in fact, it was when there was an actual unification between the Kikuyu and Luo that we saw dramatic change in the late 1950s.",
        "This same kind of fear - the same kind of fear with Kikuyu ascendancy carries over into the present day.",
        "So my point being is that this is historically embedded over the last 100 years.",
        "And it's not something that's very easily undone.",
        "Let's get some listeners involved in this conversation.",

        "So the concern what is happening in Kenya is also a concern to some of us over here.",
        "But I just want to back where you get to saying that, you know, as Africans, we belong to different tribes or ethnicities or whatever you may call it.",
        "We've been put in artificial boundaries by the colonial powers during the partition of Africa.",
        "So we are kind of coexisting within countries but when you go within and you see a country as in Kenya, you see everybody as a Kenyan.",
        "But when you go within the country, people also want to identify themselves with their tribal or ethnic groups.",
        "And when it comes to election, people tend to vote on their tribal lines.",
        "So they see a candidate like Kibaki - no matter his record - as belonging to another tribe and not my tribe.",
        "So other person try to vote for somebody in their tribe.",
        "And unfortunately, when you have election like what is going on in Kenya, the international communities are not helping things.",
        "Observers are seeing that the election was a rig.",
        "They observe fraud in the elections.",
        "Yet, why is the United States calling for a unity government?",
        "If it is clear that the election was a rig, then the rightful winner must be declared or the election needs to be count void and fresh elections must be organized.",

        "Yes it is.",
        "And I think there are a couple of points that he raised which are quite salient.",
        "Number one, I think that if we're thinking on the international scene, the credibility if you will or, you know, the amount of moral authority that either the Americans or the British have - particular in Africa, but elsewhere throughout the world - based upon our own, whether it's our 2,000 elections here in the United States or whether I'm looking at, you know, the legacies of British colonial rule.",
        "I think there's the assumption that we're now the purveyors of democracy, when in fact when you talk to people on the ground - it certainly had been my experience in Kenya - they sort of raise their eyebrows and say what are the Americans and British doing here.",
        "I think that's number one.",
        "I think number two - and think of a very important point - when thinking about nationalism versus identity, what's important when thinking about this is these are really variants of the same thing.",
        "Nationalism and ethnicity - and this is one of my points that I made about, sort of, political identity - are both very much created things.",
        "They're created and constructed.",
        "And they're very difficult to do.",
        "And in the case of Kenya and Ghana, which used to be the gold coast within the British Empire, we don't see the British colonial authorities having any desire whatsoever based upon this divine-and-rule policy and based upon the firm belief that Africans live in tribes - that's something that they firmly believed in - to create a kind of national identity.",
        "They were very much inspired to create very numerous different ethnic groups, or if you want to call them tribes and all these various colonies.",
        "And this is one of the legacies, the very strong and potent lasting legacies of British colonial rule.",
        "And with…",
        "And you suggest that subsequent to decolonialization, rulers have also found it useful to perpetuate these divisions.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There's - I mean, if you think about - it's, again, important to be thinking about these postcolonial rulers throughout in Africa and, frankly, throughout much of the developing world as not necessarily as men of the people, but rather individuals who are looking at access to the state.",
        "Now, what's the best way to do that?",
        "The best way to garner votes is to play the ethnic card and they do that quite effectively.",
        "And we've seen that happen in Kenya over and over again.",
        "We've seen in happen in the country that the gentleman was just talking about, Ghana.",
