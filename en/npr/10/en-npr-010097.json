        "Well, I belong to a language group rather than a tribal group.",
        "And the difference is that the tribal group - although the term is not very popular among Kenyan intellectuals, a tribal group there's a presumption of having been descended from some shared ancestors in the past, a kind of bloodline.",
        "A language group may have different biological ancestry but speak the same language.",
        "So I'm what is called an Mswahili(ph), a native speaker of the Swahili language.",
        "So we contributed the national language to the country.",
        "But we are not categorized as a tribe but as a language group.",
        "And obviously, as you suggest, intellectuals prefer other descriptors including ethnic groups and language groups as well.",
        "In terms of everyday life in Kenya, what difference does it make?",
        "Well, it affects the circles people move around in, the areas of probable dating and marriage.",
        "And then in the case of groups that have different languages, there are complications when they get married and bringing up their children and which languages they should learn.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "The issue is not omnipresent in everyday life.",
        "But in politics, it is very often it looms large whether or not politicians activate it.",
        "So I disagree with people who think it's not real except the politicians are created.",
        "It is real that's why the politicians exploit it.",
        "They exploit sensibilities which are potent and fully resizable.",
        "Is there much fluidity between the groups?"

        "Here's an e-mail question we have from Calvin(ph).",
        "Can you explain the difference between tribe and ethnic group?",
        "Generally, when the kinds of conflicts now going on in Kenya occur in Europe these conflicts are called ethnic conflicts and the world tribe is reserved for Africa.",
        "That's very true.",
        "There is a tendency to concede clan in European experience like Scottish clan, but no longer readiness to accept tribe - the suitable vocabulary for European groups.",
        "And very often the way the groups behave may be very similar to what our called tribes within Africa.",
        "And because the - we can speak the English language and use the word tribe, it has acquired a lot of baggage through colonial period.",
        "But most Kenyans speak Swahili or Kiswahili.",
        "We use the word kabila(ph) and that makes no distinction between ethnicity and tribe.",

        "Well, I'm going to disagree with the Harvard professor by the definition of saying, you know, the - Kenya is - the identification of Kenyans is different tribal lines, which lately has become the case.",
        "But in the previous government which was led by Moi - he was a Kalenjin, but before he left office, he appointed a Kikuyu to lead the party, the party of Kano.",
        "And the Kalenjin and the other tribes afforded him of only out and put in another Kikuyu, who was - who is right now Kibaki.",
        "And even at the opposition right now, Raila Odinga, he has a coalition of many tribes, including Kalenjin.",
        "So when Kenyans fought that they really didn't fought based on tribal lines rather than change.",
        "And Kibaki, obviously, went back to office illegally or he rigged the - forced to get back in power."

        "Ali, Mazrui, it's my understanding there's a history in Kenya of political movements starting out as, you know, pan-tribal, if you will or multiethnic, and then devolving much more into uni-ethnic groups.",
        "Yes, that's true.",
        "For as long as we fight in colonialism, there was considerable solidarity across ethnic lines.",

        "A major problem is not simply that the British emphasized tribal identity.",
        "It's just the artificiality of the countries that were created by colonialism.",
        "There was no such country as Kenya before the British demarcated particular boundaries and enclosed particular groups.",
        "So the nature of the rivalry is partly the newness of the competition within political borders that's of imperial invention.",
        "And people are trying to make sense of these borders to create a sense of Kenya-ness when it didn't exist a hundred years ago.",
        "In reality, almost the only true African countries that have a long, long historical ancestry are Ethiopia and Egypt, because they're both been there from pre-biblical times.",
        "They are both to mentioned in the Bible at random.",
        "Almost all the other African countries are relative inventions of the colonial experience.",

        "In a recent op-ed, you wrote that the only two tribes in Kenya, indeed, across sub-Saharan in Africa are the haves and the have-nots.",
        "Would you explain?",
        "Yes.",
        "I have (unintelligible) on the concept of the tribe.",
        "It is definitely a colonial invention in the sense that when colonial invasion came to Africa, they often invaded one community with soldiers from another community.",
        "In other words, right from the beginning of colonial occupation, the imperial power, whichever it was, set about dividing - making sure there is no sense of oneness even though when they had created some of this new arrangements like Nigeria or Uganda, you know, or Kenya.",
        "But thereafter, they made sure that people operated as much as they could on ethnic lines.",
        "An example is Kenya itself.",
        "From 1920, whenever any person or if any people try to form a political party or a political movement across ethnicity, the colonial state always stop that.",
        "They wanted you to organize political parties as Kikuyus or Luos.",
        "And as late as, say, in the 1950s, about 10 years before it got independence, political parties across regions were banned.",
        "Sometimes, you could - in fact, the only political parties allowed for sometimes were not even parties across the whole region, but per district-based parties and so on."
