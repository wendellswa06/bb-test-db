        "And one time when he was 12 years old, my wife and I were sitting there and watching him play, and he'd never hit a homerun.",
        "He was a pitcher and he's a really good pitcher, but he'd never hit a homerun in all the time he's played.",
        "There's one time he hit a homerun and I'm standing there watching him, standing by the fence, and as he is rounding third and coming home, I was like, I said, way to go, hon, like that.",
        "Instead of way to go bud, or something like that.",
        "He turns around, looks at me as he's running.",

        "No.",
        "Not one.",
        "I was very bad.",
        "Well, I always used to say he was a heck of a pitcher, but he couldn't hit a side of barn with a baseball bat.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, thanks very much for the call, Don.",
        "And congratulations to your son, hon…",

        "…for the homerun.",
        "But the game - a lot of baseball, Alan, is about fathers and sons.",
        "One story in your book is about the father and son homerun duo of all time, perhaps.",
        "That's right.",
        "Ken Griffey, Jr. in 1991, I believe - this is now off the top of my head - was batting third behind the second place hitter, Ken Griffey, Sr. His father had been acquired by the Seattle Mariners not long before, and they were batting second and third consecutively.",
        "This is when Ken Griffey, Jr. was only about 21 years old.",
        "His father is about 41 or 42, and ended up going deep consecutively.",
        "Ken Griffey, Sr. hit a homerun, and then in the next at bat, Ken Griffey, Jr. hit a homerun.",
        "So they were not only the first father and son combination to play in the same game, they actually went back-to-back jack.",
        "It was really wild."

        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Junior said, mine got a lot quicker, and his father said only because you didn't go as far.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, apparently, Junior's just scraped the top of the fence, just got over.",
        "Meanwhile, Senior's just went like 450 feet.",

        "And that is one of his great memories is that there was this 12-year-old pitcher who could blow it by him at such an incredible speed even back then.",
        "And we're actually wondering how we might go about trying to find out if that truly was Roger Clemens.",
        "I have to tell you, it will be a lot more fun if you never did find out, because it will take the story away.",

        "Charles Schulz, the former \"\"Peanuts\"\" cartoonist who died about seven years ago, was actually a friend of mine.",
        "And I spent the day with him back in 1995.",
        "And we talked a lot about how he grew up playing baseball and his overriding love for the game.",
        "And that's why he used baseball as a device in his strips so much, because it allowed to let Charlie Brown experience failure.",
        "Of course, that's what Charlie Brown was about.",
        "It was about just terrible things happening to him all the time.",
        "It wasn't just Lucy pulling away the football, it was line drives disrobing him on the mound and what not.",

        "And that's why Charlie Brown ended up losing games 40 to nothing."
