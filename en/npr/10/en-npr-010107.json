        "What was the argument about?",

        "And she called my mother-in-law for help with carving the turkey.",
        "But by the time she got over here with the turkey, she had already carved part of it, which really ticked my mother-in-law off.",

        "So about the time I came back downstairs, my mom was leaving the house in tears.",
        "And then my husband told my mother-in-law to quit talking about it.",
        "And they ended up going out in the front yard and they made up, apparently, but…",
        "Have you guys not talked about this since then?",
        "We haven't talked about it at all.",

        "Amy Dickinson, I think you should answer.",
        "Okay, first of all, clean slate.",
        "OK?",
        "Just wipe it clean.",
        "Secondly, a little - with a group that large, actually, if you're having another large group this Christmas, some basic party management techniques can come in handy, in that you do some thoughtful sitting.",
        "You might want to seat them pretty far apart.",
        "Let them find each other and warm up to each other.",
        "But don't draw them together.",
        "Don't expect people to apologize in front of other people.",

        "I think especially with moms and mother-in-laws, you give them each a sort of important job.",
        "And you say, you know, mom, can you help me get all of the salads together this year.",
        "And then you ask your mother-in-law, I would love it if you would help me with dessert.",
        "Do you have a special dessert you'd like to make?",
        "You know, you just really give them specific jobs.",
        "Amy, could I just add one thing?",
        "In this case, I would say make sure that one of the job is not carving the turkey.",

        "You know.",

        "You know.",
        "The burden - I can tell you feel the burden is on you, but they have both behaved quite badly.",
        "Yes.",
        "So just assume that they will get it together and keep it together.",
        "And people love getting jobs.",
        "And especially if someone has like bad skin or they're self-conscious about something, those are the best people to give jobs to, because otherwise they're just going to sit on the couch and think about other problems.",
        "So the more - if you give them an important job, they'll stop thinking about themselves and their bad skin.",
        "You know another thing I love for men who sometimes feel out of place at holiday meals, big meals, deep-frying the turkey out in the driveway.",
        "This is something that men love to do.",

        "Are their eyes glazing over?",
        "Are their eyes not looking at you, are they're looking over at the dip?",
        "Are they looking over at the drinks?",

        "And parties, you know, let's face it, a lot of it is small talk.",
        "Well - let's give Chris some advice about small talk because this is a skill that some people have and others don't.",
        "So for those who feel uncomfortable with the whole idea of small talk, what do they do?",
        "How do they get small talk going?",
        "Well, I would say, if you're not comfortable at getting small talk going, the next party you're at, practice going, you know, being a part of a group of three of four people talking and be a listener.",
        "Try being a listener for five minutes without saying anything.",
        "A lot of people who are uncomfortable with small talk feel like they have to fill the gaps of silence with words and just keep going and going.",
        "Where if you sat back and like listened to what other people have to say, then it'll come to you at an appropriate point.",
        "You will know how to fit in and say what to say because you'll be responding to someone rather than initiating.",
        "And that might be just a different of approaching it."
