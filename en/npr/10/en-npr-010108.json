        "You know, I once lived in a group house where we had an argument - the group had a disagreement over whether we were going to have a costume party or not.",
        "And one person wanted to have the costume party and the rest of us didn't.",
        "And so that person's friends, sadly for them, came in costumes."

        "And they say sure, sure, sure we love them.",
        "They're really easy customers.",
        "So they all go in and he's going oh, wait a minute, before you start taking their orders you need to know when they motion to their mouth that means they're thirsty.",
        "If they motion to their hand that means they're hungry.",
        "So all of them come in and they're just motioning to their hands, motioning to their mouth and they're having a wonderful time.",

        "But oh, well, I'll just keep serving up this beer and these hamburgers.",
        "So he keeps doing it and then he looks over and he goes, oh my gosh, there's like 10 of them over there.",
        "What is the deal?",
        "What's going on?",
        "And there they are.",
        "They're just staring at the ceiling with their mouths open.",
        "And he's kind of getting worried, but then he really gets worried because half of them - 25 of them staring up at the ceiling mouth open.",
        "He goes over to the bus driver and he goes, I'm really panicked.",
        "I see these 25 people over here and their mouths are open.",
        "And the bus driver looks and he goes, oh, doggone it.",
        "They've started to sing.",
        "I'm never going to get them out of here."
