        "Now, and even though peace talks with the Taliban seem to be on the agenda there, the Taliban themselves are threatening to attack this gathering.",
        "In fact, I gather that they have obtained, or claimed to have obtained, a complete security plan.",
        "Yes.",
        "NATO and Afghan officials are saying that this is a stunt, that this plan is a forgery.",
        "But on Sunday, the Taliban's press office sent the entire press corps a two dozen page security plan for the Loya Jirga in Kabul.",
        "And we called some of the numbers, the phone numbers on the plan, and they were authentic, they did reach senior officials in the Afghan government.",
        "But there was a big question why they would have released that in advance instead of using it to stage a major attack, and so far there haven't been major incidents.",
        "There was a man carrying a bomb who was shot near the assembly on Monday, but the city has been in complete lockdown all week.",
        "The streets this morning were fairly empty.",
        "And Kabul, as you know, has had a hard couple of months with many attacks here and so there's a lot of tension in the city, and people are taking the Taliban's threat seriously when they said that they would kill anyone who attended the Jirga.",
        "And then some opposition leaders are boycotting this grand assembly.",
        "They say Karzai should have taken up these important matters, or should in the future with parliament.",
        "Tatum is voting for the first time, and he seems overwhelmed.",
        "This agreement comes after the two sides negotiated a tentative cease-fire last year with the help of Pope Francis.",
        "Journalist John Otis joins us now from Bogota, Colombia.",
        "Hello, there.",
        "Hi, Ari.",
        "How are you?",
        "Well, good.",
        "So what was in this agreement that was signed today?",
        "Well, basically, it means that the war's over.",
        "Both the Colombian government and the FARC guerrillas pledge that there's going to be no more combat operations.",
        "And the other big announcement was that the FARC guerrillas' 7,000 fighters will start gathering in about two dozen concentration zones around Columbia.",
        "And it's from these zones that they're going to begin handing in their weapons to United Nations personnel and then begin their transition to civilian life.",
        "It's amazing - we report so often on wars that don't end - to actually talk about a war that as of today has ended.",
        "Is it actually as of today?",
        "Or - when does this take effect?",
        "Well, they still need to sign a final peace treaty, but the thing is they've now done all the heavy lifting.",
        "And the final accord is expected to be signed sometime later this summer, and that's when the cease-fire will formally begin.",
        "But the reality is that on the ground, there's been almost no fighting in the past year because the FARC has declared this unilateral cease-fire.",
        "And the Colombian military stopped bombing rebel camps last year, as well, so it's been one of the most peaceful years in decades."

        "The disarmament process will also begin as soon as there's this final peace treaty.",
        "And once they sign, the guerillas will have six months to turn in their weapons.",
        "And then within this process, President Juan Manuel Santos wants to hold a referendum on all of this to let Colombians decide whether or not they approve of this peace deal.",
        "And that's expected to take place perhaps in October.",
        "Well, what are you seeing there in Colombia?",
        "Are people celebrating?",
        "Or does the fact that there hasn't been a lot of conflict lately mean this is going relatively unnoticed.",
        "No, it's definitely making big headlines.",
        "A lot of Colombians are calling today the last day of the war, and it's really been a long time coming.",
        "You know, you have to remember this war started way back when Lyndon Johnson was president in the U.S.",
        "Wow.",
        "And it's lasted through 11 Colombian presidents.",
        "So now that they're finally disarming, it is a day of celebration.",
        "In Bogota today, crowds were gathered around giant screen TVs, watching the signing ceremony, sort of like as if it were the NBA Finals or the World Cup.",
        "Amazing.",
        "Is there any criticism about what's in this deal?",
        "Well, there is, and that's why there's not total euphoria over this.",
        "There is a lot of criticism.",
        "And that's mainly because in wide sectors of Colombian society, they just don't like the FARC because the FARC, to fund its war, was involved in kidnapping people for ransom, extorting people.",
        "They carried out a lot of massacres.",
        "And another sore point is that FARC leaders accused of these war crimes are not going to go to jail.",
        "They're not going to have any hard time.",
        "Instead, they've set up a kind of transitional justice system where they'll serve a few years in a kind of loose confinement, perhaps out on farms out in the countryside.",
        "And that's widely seen as kind of a travesty of justice, even though that was the price for getting the guerrillas to disarm.",
        "And all of this is affecting Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos' popularity.",
        "A lot of people think he ought to win the Nobel Peace Prize for getting this peace accord, but his actual popularity - his job approval rating here in Colombia's quite low.",
        "That's reporter John Otis speaking with us from Bogota, Colombia, on the end of a war that has lasted more than half a century.",
        "Thank you very much."

        "Only a small percentage of the nation's college students attend for-profit schools, but those students are responsible for about half of all the student loan defaults in the U.S.",
        "Soon, those colleges will face a strict new regulation, and some education experts are using words like collapse and implosion to describe the state of the industry.",
        "We ask NPR's education blogger Anya Kamenetz to explain the new crackdown.",
        "This new Department of Education rule, gainful employment, it really is meant to impose a new level of rigor on these for-profit colleges.",
        "It says that colleges that leave students unable to pay back their loans after they leave are really not going to be able to continue to get a lot of federal government student aid money, which they're so dependent on.",
        "And, you know, hand-in-hand with the Department of Ed has been a lot of action from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
        "In a way, what's being measured here is how successful have these for-profits been in actually educating and getting jobs for things they promised their students.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So, you know, there's still hundreds of thousands of current and former for-profit college students who say that their degrees are of dubious value and they're not succeeding in the job market.",
        "And so what a rule like gainful employment is meant to do is impose a little bit of accountability to say, you know, if you can't pay back your loans and your degree is not really worth a lot in the job market, then the college shouldn't be allowed to keep operating.",
        "And you mention the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
        "How did it get involved?",
        "So the CFPB, befitting its mission, it's taken a real interest in student loans.",
        "So they sued Corinthian Colleges, which shut down last year, and they alleged that the Colleges were practicing predatory lending and illegal debt collection tactics.",
        "And they've also arranged for $480 million in private student loans from Corinthian students to be forgiven.",
        "Also now, students are organizing to get their federal loans forgiven, even get the money back that they've paid off.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Right.",
        "So one of the new factors in the current outlook for for-profit colleges is that there's a group of students organizing to say that they want their federal loans forgiven.",
        "This group called Strike Debt, out of the Occupy Wall Street movement, has signed on many, many students to say that they want the federal government to write off the loans that they've borrowed as a result of enrolling in Corinthian Colleges and alleging that these schools were fraudulent.",
        "Prince William, forgive me.",
        "Yes.",
