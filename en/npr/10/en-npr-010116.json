        "Now they've expanded their work to incorporate the global revival from Christians in Shanghai to Muslim televangelists in Cairo and the increasing importance of religion in politics, culture, conflict and in people's lives.",
        "John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge's new book is called \"\"God Is Back,\"\" and they're here to tell us the good news about why, for example, many Chinese equate Christianity with modernism and prosperity.",
        "Later in the program, the agony of so many high school seniors who find themselves on the waiting list of their top college.",
        "But first, \"\"God is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith is Changing the World.\"\" If you've seen evidence of this worldwide religious revival, or not, call and tell us your story, 800-989-8255, email talk@npr.org.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And to resolve any doubts as to the size of this phenomenon, you suggest that within a very few years China will not only be the largest Christian nation in the world, but maybe the largest Muslim nation, too.",
        "I think it's well on the way to becoming the world's largest Christian country.",
        "And I went there, and you visit these house churches.",
        "And what's happened in a strange way is the Chinese government inadvertently has come with this brilliant way of expanding Christianity inside a country, which is to force, by rules, to force people that when a meeting reaches 25 people, you're not allowed to go any bigger than that.",
        "Which actually forces each house church, once they get to 26, 27, they divide into two and they start again.",
        "And the numbers are not that clear, but it's up to around 100 million people already converted to Christianity.",
        "And that is more Christians, more people going to church every Sunday than there are members of the Communist Party in China.",
        "And that point that we mentioned just a moment ago, so many of them are, well, not necessarily the poor struggling...",
        "Very much not.",
        "I mean, there's a slight break.",
        "Out in the countryside you tend to get more Catholicism and slightly more, kind of, rural side to it.",
        "But in the cities, particularly the house church I went to, that had a stem cell scientist.",
        "It was run by a technologist from an American technology company I probably don't want to reveal.",

        "There is an interesting comparison or lesson that they draw from the sort of unbridled American capitalism - it needs to be tempered by Christianity.",
        "Very much so.",
        "And that actually causes a real problem for the Chinese regime, because on the one hand, they do see this perhaps as the glue which could bind their country together.",
        "Sometimes right from the very top you've heard people talk about it in that way.",
        "On the other hand, they're frightened by it.",
        "You talk to some in the regime and they point out that it was - they, well, rather, they think it was John Paul II who was almost singlehandedly responsible for the end of communism or the end of the Soviet Union.",
        "And they're worried about the effect on their own status.",
        "And Adrian Wooldridge, let me ask you about, well, among those afraid of it are Europeans who, of course, have had a very ugly history regarding religious wars.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The Europeans saw their culture and their civilization torn apart during the Thirty Years' War by a religious dispute.",
        "And they basically said, we need to get religion as far out of politics as possible.",
        "So they created this principle in the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 that they said that whoever was king would determine the religion of his people.",
        "So that was one thing that pushed religion out of politics.",
        "Then we saw the Enlightenment and people like Voltaire saying that religion is a disruptive force.",
        "It's something that leads to bloody riots and bloody wars.",
        "Again, he denounced religion in the name of reason.",
        "So what you saw in Europe was the progressive marginalization of religion and the progressive secularization of society.",
        "And you saw great European intellectuals such as Marx, such as Freud, such as Weber, such as Durkheim saying, yes, it's all right, because the more modern, the more sophisticated, the more advanced a country becomes, the less religious it will become.",
        "So the less we'll have these problems of religion -that wars of religion will just fratricide.",
        "And this, as it turns out, you suggest, is not a product of lack of religiosity, or lack of faith or lack of belief, but it's a product of a monopoly.",
        "I think that there's always a demand for the consolations of religion in the population in general.",
        "What happened in Europe was not a failure of demand, it was a failure of supply.",
        "Basically you had churches which had state monopolism, so people associated religion with the state power, which they didn't necessarily like.",
        "Also, the people who were providing this service didn't have any particular incentive to do it very well.",
        "There's a great statement by somebody about the Church of England.",
        "He was a skeptic, and he said, basically, I support the Church of England as a bulwark against the spread of religion.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I think that that's basically what's happened in Europe."
