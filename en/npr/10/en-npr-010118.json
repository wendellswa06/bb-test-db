        "And that's - this is what really troubles me.",
        "I mean, worse than having the Ten Commandments in wherever that was, in a city hall somewhere in the Midwest, I am really concerned.",
        "I'm really concerned.",
        "And even Barack Obama, who I was very strongly in favor of and actually volunteered for, even his religiosity, to a certain extent, troubles me.",
        "And that's another point, Adrian Wooldridge, that in this country it's very difficult to get elected to office, much less president of the United States, without wearing religion on your sleeve.",
        "Oh, I think anybody who wants to be president still has to do that.",
        "And I understand that a lot of Americans are very nervous about the power of the new right and very nervous about the fact that religion can become too involved in politics.",
        "We are very nervous about that, as well.",
        "In this book we try not to make value judgments, as much as possible.",
        "We're trying to describe something that's going on.",
        "But nevertheless, we understand that what's going on can have very good consequences.",
        "Religion inspires some of the most saintly and extraordinary acts of sacrifice one has ever seen, but we also have a whole section on wars of religion.",
        "It inspires things that are very worrying.",
        "We have a section on culture wars.",
        "It divides cultures around very non-negotiable issues.",
        "And one of the things that we've found in this book is that in order to solve these problems that are created by religion, you also need religion.",
        "If religion is part of the problem, it's also part of the solution.",
        "And we talk about two things.",
        "First of all, the importance of having religion involved in wars of conflict, religious leaders involved in trying to solve those wars.",
        "And secondly, the importance of the First Amendment in separating political power from religious power, church from state so that you can have a relatively - not a relatively - a neutral public square so that people aren't too disturbed.",
        "In fact, one of the things you argue in the book is that the Bush administration, rather than plumping for democracy as a solution to some of the political problems that arose in the Middle East, would've been much better off arguing for religious pluralism as a solution to its problems.",
        "I think they fixated on the question of democracy.",
        "They didn't understand that the Sunni-Shia division was a fundamental and important division.",
        "And they didn't understand the importance of involving the leaders of these different communities in the peace process.",
        "And that, in fact, the entire diplomatic apparatus, not just in the United States, but indeed, of Western Europe, is set up almost outside of secularism.",
        "Madeleine Albright is quoted.",
        "There's a wonderful quote from Madeleine Albright where she describes, I think it's a cabinet meeting or certainly one in the State Department at the end of the 20th century where she's - they're describing the Northern Ireland peace process.",
        "And somebody turns to her and says, isn't it incredible?",
        "We're still discussing a religious conflict at the end of the 20th century."

        "And problem with that was just a year or so before 9/11 and before this vast array of things.",
        "And there's one, I think it's a very good survey, I think, of all the main four foreign relations journals in America, which I think over a period of about 15 years, only had, I think, less than 10 articles which dealt with religion.",
        "Yet it's this problem bubbling away underneath.",
        "And Henry Kissinger's great thesis, you say, never mentions the word God.",
        "A wonderful book on diplomacy, 900 pages, and yet it doesn't mention religion, which I think now, to be fair to Kissinger, you go and talk to Kissinger, he now is very, very aware of that as a problem.",
        "But Adrian, the other problems with the Bush administration, people saying, coming to realize yes, religion is very important, but I think it was the head of the counterterrorism unit at the FBI then identified Iran as a Sunni nation.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "CQ magazine did a survey of leading intelligence experts, leading senators, leading congressmen to see what they knew about Islam, what they knew about Sunnis and Shias.",

        "Thank you so much for having me on the show, longtime listener, first-time caller.",
        "I'm a United States Marine.",
        "I've had the pleasure of traveling all over the world, whether it's southeast, southwest Asia, Africa.",
        "And the thing that I would say has changed the most is the ability to have individual conversations about faith, about religion.",
        "Fifteen years ago, if I walked into another country, you know, we're told, don't talk about Christianity, don't talk about, you know, your religion.",
        "And now, regardless of what country I've gone to, I found that we've been able to bring faith out of this individual isolated area and really bring it into a, hey, I don't have to be afraid that I'm - I have a faith and that I have a belief, and I'd like to know what you believe in and have a discussion about that."

        "It has become legitimized, hasn't it, Adrian - excuse me, John?",

        "And again, I think the Northern Ireland thing is a great example.",
        "That was a debate, that was a battle that went on for centuries.",
        "It only began to be solved once Blair and Major began to bring in the people from both sides.",
        "Once you had vicars and priests standing and condemning atrocities, whether it's from Catholics or Protestants, it was only then together it worked.",
        "And actually, it's a very obvious comparison between that and, say, what's happening in the Middle East where, no matter what either Israel or Palestinians do to each other, you very, very seldom see a rabbi and an imam beside each other saying, this is unacceptable.",
        "And it's actually very interesting because back here in United States, I found that people are a little bit more hesitant once in a while to have a conversation about faith.",
        "Yet, when I was in Africa and Kenya, you bring up, you know, Christianity or Muslim, and they've got every impulse to talk to you about what they believe.",
        "They want to know what you believe.",
        "And it's just amazing.",
        "And I think that as that increases here in the U.S., we'll see that it'll be brought more and more to the forefront, not as a - an adversary of politics, but as something that is simply a discussion about what we believe.",
        "The paradox is that America has the best system for solving it in some ways, the separation of church and state, but it also has this difficulty about trying to take it out into the outside world.",

        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Africa, you gave as another example, both of the explosive nature of the growth of Christianity, in that case, and Islam in different parts of Africa.",

        "Yes.",
        "The article is about the decline and fall of Christianity in the United States, of the notion of the United States as a specifically Christian country.",

        "I don't entirely agree with it, but I respect it.",

        "People who were pretty unreligious in the past are now more willing to describe themselves as atheists.",
        "But the polls also show that - an upsurge in the number of people who described themselves as born again, or conservative Christians, or Pentecostals.",
        "So you're seeing polarization; more atheists, but also more evangelicals or more enthusiastic Protestants, more enthusiastic Catholics.",
        "The other thing is that, although I do think that the religious right has lost a number of battles, I don't see religion disappearing from politics.",
        "I think what's happened is that religion for awhile was monopolized by one party, the Republicans, and by one narrow set of issues, abortion and gay marriage.",
