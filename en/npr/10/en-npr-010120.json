        "O'NEAL: That piece, well, it's inspired by a couple of Ravel pieces.",
        "He's one of my favorite classical pianists.",
        "And this piece, harmonically, is a lot of minor chords moving in all kinds of different intervals.",
        "And there's this common rhythmic pulse, so there's something about those sad type of chords moving in a happy way.",
        "So that's kind of the idea with that one.",
        "Interesting you mention Ravel.",
        "I was reading a New York Times review of your record, and it said it's somewhere between Ravel and Duke Ellington, which is pretty high praise.",
        "And in listening to it, it actually makes almost perfect sense.",
        "It kind of straddles this line between jazz and classical.",

        "It's almost hard to define.",
        "How would you describe this music?",
        "O'NEAL: Well, to tell you that, I'll go back to the inspiration.",
        "You know, when I was a kid and first started playing, I didn't know nothing about different styles of music, like most kids, but I did notice that there were these sounds I was hearing with these images I was seeing and they seemed like the perfect sounds."

        "You know, we're adults; we're able to make decisions for ourselves; we don't need to have a governmental big brother or nanny or older sister or nurse looking go over our shoulder telling us.",
        "And besides, the restaurant is one of the most competitive and sensitive industries that there is, extremely competitive among themselves and very sensitive to what diners want and what the public responds to.",
        "If this was something that diners were interested in, if this was something that the public wanted, restaurants would already be competing to do it.",
        "And the proof is that there are some restaurant chains, like the Subway sandwich chain, which does make a big deal about providing calorie information and nutrition information and advertises that they do it and, you know, runs a commercial showing guys with great big jeans that they no longer have to wear.",
        "The market can respond if there's an interest in it.",
        "But the scientific evidence, such as it is, suggests that people are very capable of overlooking or ignoring or denying this information.",

        "The state could argue that, similar to, like, motorcycle helmet laws, that it does have a serious interest here; that people who are obese get sicker, more often have to go the hospital, more often they do drain public resources, and so this would save the state the money down the road.",
        "That's, you know, a seductive argument to a lot of people, and I certainly understand it.",
        "But it's also - it sends us down on a very slippery slope.",

        "There's got to be a line between saying that anything that may have a negative health impact or anything that may be, you know, deleterious to somebody's well-being therefore gives power to the government to enforce it.",
        "And I would hate to see us start down that path when it comes to food, especially since the vast majority of the calories that people consume, they don't consume in chain restaurants.",
        "You know, there might be a handful of people relatively speaking who go out and eat everything at McDonald's or who go out and eat there once a day.",
        "But the vast majority of people get most of their calories at home.",
        "And if the government launches this war on obesity and is determined to make people stop getting fatter, and it's, you know - and they see that they're not having the impact that they want when they try to force the chain restaurants to do it, it's, you know, one small step to saying, well, you don't have to have 15 stores to qualify for this law; 10 will do.",
        "And when 10 doesn't work it, you know, they'll move it down to five.",
