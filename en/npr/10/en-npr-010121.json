        "Let's get some callers in on the conversation.",
        "Our guest is Jeff Jacoby, a columnist with the Boston Globe.",
        "We're talking about calorie counts, mandatory on the menu for many chain restaurants in Massachusetts and in California, other cities and states enforce that as well.",
        "If you've looked at a menu with a calorie count on it, has it made any difference on what you ordered?",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email is talk@npr.org.",
        "And Bill is on the line, Bill calling from Chicago.",
        "Yes, actually your guest just kind of touched on this a bit.",
        "I'm a believer in the good, old-fashioned, Aristotle moderation in all things.",
        "If I go and have a Cinnabon at my local mall and ingest 750 calories from that one cinnamon roll, well, maybe I'll skip eating something later on.",
        "I'm perfectly capable of making that decision, as are most grown adults.",
        "I'm one of these people who changed(ph) the belief that the government can, in some cases, make a more informed decision than I can as a consumer.",
        "If I'm choosing to spend my dollars, trust me to think that I've done the research to know where I'm spending my dollars.",
        "And I'll take my comments off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Bill, do you know that this is 750 calories?",
        "(Soundbite of silence)",
        "I think he hung up already.",
        "Anyway, in broad measure, Jeff Jacoby, he agrees with you.",
        "You know something?",
        "I - you can point to the fact that giving people information - you can assume that giving people information is something that's going to change the way they act, that they're going to take that information and they're going to make a difference in their lives.",
        "But to the extent that there is evidence, that there's been research, it certainly doesn't play out when - at least when it comes to fast food and to calories.",
        "The evidence shows that the more people eat out, the less likely they are to pay attention to this kind of information.",
        "And you know, I'm glad to hear that if Bill eats the high-calorie donut, you know, in the morning that he'll skip something later on in the day.",
        "That shows common sense [gap in audio] I think a lot of people have.",
        "At the same time, we know that Americans have been getting fatter over the past 30 years.",
        "Something else that's been happening over the past 30 years is that more and more nutritional and calorie information has been put in front of them.",
        "There have now been labeling requirements for at - since at least the 1970s.",
        "And you know, I won't say that there is a correlation, but it's suggestive, isn't it?",
        "It's interesting that as the amount of information about what goes into our food is put before us, the American waist line has been getting bigger and bigger and bigger.",
        "You know, it doesn't seem to be working so far.",
        "I don't see why having the state redouble its effort and shove the information even more obtrusively in front of us is going to make a difference.",
        "And our crack research staff has discovered that the Cinnabon - actually, this is the regular-sized Cinnabon - is 730 calories, so...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I wish I had a crack research staff like that."

        "As I heard the beginning of this program, I was just entering a drive-through of a fast-food restaurant I won't name.",
        "I knew exactly what I wanted; I was thinking about it all the way from my house through the drive-through on the way to work.",
        "As I pulled in, I saw the calorie count just as the gentleman was asking me for my order, and I absolutely froze.",
        "I couldn't get the words out of my mouth, reading the numbers and ordering what I wanted to get.",
        "I had to ask for more time twice.",
        "It took me about 10 minutes to finally do the math and decide on what I could eat and comfortably stomach.",
        "So, the calorie-count information, was it - turned out to be important to you?",

        "It would be fatuous to say that there's no possible way that it could have any impact at all.",
        "What I do say is that most people who aren't interested in that information aren't going to start becoming interested in the information because the government is going to order restaurants to undertake the expense of putting it in front of them.",
        "And I would rather err on the side of giving people enough freedom to make a decision for themselves and not have the nanny state deciding for them whether they should eat that Cinnabon or not than to err on the other side and say, well, we might manage to convince a few more people not to order at the fast-food restaurant, so let's go ahead and do it anyway.",
        "I - you know, my preference is always to err on the side of freedom.",
        "We have so many ways in which our liberties and our choices are restricted.",
