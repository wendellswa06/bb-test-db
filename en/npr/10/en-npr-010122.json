        "This time, Fried says, there was a clear difference.",
        "The neurons, the nerve cells, are responding slower, the responses are diminished, and they are smeared over longer periods of time.",
        "In other words, each cell took longer to produce the electrical bursts it uses to communicate with other cells and the signal was weaker.",
        "What's more, the brain cells tended to show this sluggish behavior just before a participant had a mental lapse while trying to classify an image.",
        "The finding appears in this week's edition of the journal Nature Medicine, and it's made Fried think differently about his own sleepless nights.",
