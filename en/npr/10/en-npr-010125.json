        "Good news, right?",
        "Not according to your reporters, who spent almost their entire time telling us all of the things that could go wrong with Ford and why the rising GDP doesn't mean the economy is back on track, lest a moment of sanguinity fill my car.",
        "And Mr. Reynolds concludes: P.S.",
        "Also covered during my drive: Why you should be afraid of Japan.",

        "What's going on?",
        "We tend to select the facts that are aligned with our pre-existing assumptions or our pre-existing beliefs.",
        "As a reporter you have to be aware of this phenomenon.",
        "You have to be aware of it in yourself.",
        "You have to be aware of it in the people around you, and you have to recognize that sometimes it's emotionally unpleasant to do what's required, which is to challenge your assumptions or to look for facts that are not aligned with what you already believe.",
        "So what you see here is - in the record that we went through, the 400 pages of the reporter's notes and all of the interviews we did - you feel, like, this wave is building up at Rolling Stone involving the reporter and her editors and everyone else at the magazine.",
        "And it's only rolling in one direction.",
        "And there were little moments along the way where somebody put their hand up and said, wait, maybe this isn't complete or maybe we should be stopping and checking this or that.",
        "But the wave was just too forceful and it was all going in one direction.",
        "Since your report came out, the publisher of Rolling Stone, Jann Wenner, told The New York Times that he considers the accuser a really expert fabulist - storyteller.",
        "Something sits at her doorstep, he says - something that's untruthful.",

        "We've gotten asked it a lot today.",
        "And we did not find evidence of the kind of dishonesty, lying to colleagues about your reporting or lying to your editor about where you've been and who you've interviewed, plagiarism - that sort of thing, which are, at least in my mind, grounds for almost automatic firing or very serious sanction.",
        "Instead, this was a collective failure of judgment and methodology that was also tied to the magazine's policies, and so deciding how to hold individuals accountable for that failure really belongs to Rolling Stone.",

        "There have been notices that have gone out to some 149 small- and medium-sized airport control towers.",
