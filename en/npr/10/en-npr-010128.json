        "Yeah.",
        "The biggest exception is with the meat inspectors.",
        "At the beginning of this process, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack was saying, we're going to have to furlough meat inspectors.",
        "And that meant because federal law requires an inspector be on site, that a lot of the meatpacking and processing plants would have to close for the time when there were no inspections.",
        "So what Congress did last month, when they actually passed the budget for the rest of the fiscal year, is they gave the ag department more money - they redirected some funds so that they wouldn't have to lay off those meat inspectors.",
        "And I guess it's a tribute to the power of the meat lobby that they were able to do that because virtually every other agency has been unable to get any exemptions."

        "We're hearing, for instance, from the cancer doctors.",
        "They say that because of the odd way that Medicare pays for cancer drugs, they may end up having to tell patients who are getting cancer care in outpatient settings that they will end up having to go back to the hospital to get their cancer care; which ironically, could end up costing the Medicare program more."
