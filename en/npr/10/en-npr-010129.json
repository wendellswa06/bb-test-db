        "His appointment was very controversial.",

        "There's another candidate, Mo Brooks, the congressman, and stiff competition from Judge Roy Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who I remember generated a bit of controversy at that court.",
        "Remind us what happened with Moore.",
        "Yeah.",
        "First we should say that this is a top-two primary.",
        "So in other words, this is not the end of the race.",
        "This is only the beginning.",
        "The top two today will move on to a runoff against each other.",
        "Provided that somebody doesn't get above 50 percent today, that runoff will take place in September.",
        "And Roy Moore has actually been leading in the polls.",
        "And Moore was the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court back in 2003.",
        "You might remember he was the same head of the Alabama Supreme Court who put those Ten Commandments out front of the Alabama Supreme Court and was let go from the court.",
        "But that has been sort of a badge of honor for him..."
