        "This morning, astronauts Michael Hopkins and Richard Mastracchio stepped outside the International Space Station.",

        "Really nice work, guys.",
        "We're about an hour and a half ahead.",
        "Let's take some steps beforehand.",
        "First, we want to do an ammonia inspection.",

        "DR.",
        "JONATHAN MCDOWELL: They got ahead of the schedule and did part of the next spacewalk.",
        "The only slight snag was when NASA asked lead spacewalker Richard Mastracchio whether they wanted to go on and do even more, he was sort of pretty clear that he wanted to come back inside now, thank you very much.",
        "And it seems like he may not have been feeling very well toward the end there.",
        "So - but that happens.",
        "That's a minor glitch.",
        "And I'm sure they'll be fine to go on and complete the repair in two days' time.",
        "Why was it the repairs to the coolant system on the International Space Station were so urgent?",
        "You know, you're out in space.",
        "You're running a lot of electricity for all the experiments for the life support.",
        "That generates heat and you've got to get rid of that heat somehow.",
        "And so they really want to get it back up where they can operate the station at full capacity.",
        "Is that as big of a job as it sounds?",
        "This pump module that they were replacing is the size of a refrigerator.",
        "It doesn't weigh anything in space, but it still has the same mass, so it's difficult to move around.",
        "And it's full of ammonia.",
        "And when you unhook the plumbing, little flakes of ammonia come out, and that's toxic, so you don't want to get it on your spacesuit.",
        "It is a pretty big job."

        "That's right.",
        "And it turns out we can physically measure the wavelength of the microwaves in this oven.",
        "Now, Robert, if you've ever microwaved a burrito - and I'm not saying you'd ever stoop this culinary level but if you did - you might have noticed that when you get it out of the oven, there are areas where the beans and cheese are boiling hot.",
        "And then there are areas that are still frozen solid.",
        "And that's because the microwave oven has these hot and cold patches.",
        "And it turns out, those hot patches are evenly spaced.",
        "They're half a wavelength apart.",
        "And so you can then start to solve your equation.",

        "They're not looking too tasty.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And we're going to set the power on low.",
        "And it really does have to be a low setting.",

        "So we find melty spots and also some hard spots that aren't melty among the microwaved Peeps.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You can sort of feel around.",
        "And, look, there's another part that's melted a bit.",
        "OK.",

        "And you're standing them up.",
        "And I'll put a ruler to measure the distance between them.",
        "And I'd say that they're about, well, 2.5 inches let's say between those two skewers.",
        "What does that tell us?",
        "Well, remember, the distance between the hot spots is half a wavelength.",
        "And so we've got our half a wavelength, 2.5 inches, double it.",
        "You've got the wavelength, 5 inches.",
        "And now remember our equation?",
        "(Laughter) No - wavelength.",
        "The speed is the wavelength of the microwave times the frequency of the microwave."

        "So 2,450 megahertz.",
        "That's right.",
        "That means that these microwaves are vibrating up and down 2.45 billion times every second.",
        "So we multiply that frequency times our wavelength and we get - let me just do this math here.",
