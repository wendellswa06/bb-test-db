        "You've done a lot of work looking at studies over the years showing how unconscious and subtle biases operate in the world.",
        "Talk about how that applies to this question.",
        "Who's more ethical, men or women?",
        "Well, I think if you ask most people, they would say women on average are more ethical than men.",
        "I know that I would certainly say that, Ari, from personal experience.",
        "And you can see this at work in many places.",
        "I was speaking with the organizational sociologist Mary-Hunter McDonnell at the Wharton school at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "She told me that many years ago as a law student in an ethics class, her professor often gave the students case studies about individual lawyers and their unethical behavior.",
        "There was one vivid example that stands out to me where he was talking about a particularly shameless attorney.",
        "And then he disclosed that that the attorney was a female, and the room just had this audible gasp because people hadn't been expecting that the attorney in the story was a woman.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's the key distinction here.",
        "The law does not allow the government to start monitoring without warrants, targets as it defines them, targets people inside the United States.",
        "But essentially, they can catch that traffic that's coming from other countries into the U.S.",
        "now, as long as that person overseas is the intended target of the surveillance not the individual inside of the United States.",
        "And who decides who's a legitimate target or not?",
        "Just the government?",
        "Well, the attorney general and the director of National Intelligence under this law have the authority to issue the - essentially the order to conduct this eavesdropping, and they have to attest in writing that, in fact, they've made a reasonable determination that this individual is overseas and that he or she will produce some useful foreign intelligence purpose or information out of that.",
        "So it's gone from being a, sort of, targeted mechanism to go after terrorists and more open up now to a broader definition of foreign intelligence value.",
        "And the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence and the attorney general, they make that decision.",
        "Now, this legislation made it very quickly through the House and Senate.",
        "What was the hurry?",
        "Well, the Republicans have been pushing for this.",
        "They're saying their issuing talking points this week, noting that they have been asking for a change to FISA for many months.",
        "I think what you saw in this - the past week, the sort of flurry of activity around this, is a couple of things: one, it's come to light that the judge and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that had been overseeing this program for the past several months apparently had made the decision that parts of it were illegal.",
        "And I think that there was some impetus for the administration to try and push this through."

        "Also, we're heading into the recess.",
        "And you can ask your other guests about this, I'm sure, but my read on this is that the Democrats were probably very loath to go into the August recess knowing that Republicans would have an ability to say, well, you're the majority party in Congress, why didn't you close this needed gap in the intelligence law, why did you let us go into recess without fixing it, et cetera.",
        "So I think there was some urgency to get it done.",
        "Also by, you know, essentially, modifying the law a bit - but not doing a dramatic full overhaul, which Republicans still want - I think that Democrats were able to, you know, give the Republicans something and then perhaps postpone the debate on a larger FISA overhaul, which will probably get taken out when they come back.",
        "Well, joining us now Scranton, Pennsylvania is Democratic Senator Bob Casey.",
        "And Senator Casey, very good of you to be with us today.",
        "Oh, thank you very much.",
        "Great to be with you.",
        "And you were one of those Democrats who voted in favor of this legislation.",
        "Did the impending recess have anything to do with it?",
        "No.",
        "The principal concern that I had, and I think every U.S.",
        "senators should had - should have no matter what party they're in is national security.",
        "And I wanted to make sure that we got something done albeit temporary, in this case six months, and albeit imperfect.",
        "But I think it's important that we move forward.",
        "I voted for both because I wanted to make sure that I did everything possible on the question of national security.",
        "Having said that, the Bush administration did their - played a lot of their usual political games.",
        "But even in the face of - the way they went about this by waiting to the last minute, by changing their opinion, the director of National Intelligence, Mr. McConnell, gave assurances to leaders in the Democratic Party, the House and the Senate, about what he wanted in the bill and they went forward and, I think, complied with that.",
        "And then he changed the rules and wanted more.",
        "So despite that political game played by the administration, I still think it was very important to get this done for this short period of time.",
        "And then bring to bear hearings and other reviews that can be done over time to make sure that any corrections that are made get done in the next couple of months.",
        "You said you voted for both.",
        "There was a Democratic version and…",
        "Right."

        "…the version the White House wanted, which eventually passed and you voted in favor of both of them.",
        "Right.",
        "A lot of your fellow Democrats has had some harsh things to say about this piece of legislation.",
        "The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said the measure does violence to the Constitution of the United States.",
        "Representative Jane Harman warned it would lead to potential unprecedented abuse of innocent Americans' privacy.",
        "Representative Rahm Emanuel said lawmakers are not going to leave Alberto Gonzales as the gatekeeper on American civil liberties.",
        "A lot of these concerns are echoing throughout the Democratic Party.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And I think that - I mean, when I comment on what others say, I speak for my self and not for others.",
        "But I think what's frustrated not only Democrats, but frustrated a lot of Americans is that the administration, in many ways, allows these things to play out in the worse possible context.",
        "The context of the end of a legislative period and then they try to change the provisions that they want at the last minute instead of working with the Congress over a period of time where members of the House and the Senate can reflect upon it, maybe have a hearing, maybe have information provided by constitutional and other experts, national security experts, but they didn't do that.",
        "So they forced everyone to make a decision under a short timeframe because, frankly, it would be hard to get people to come back and to spend more time on it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But I do think either way, even if this was delayed until September, I still think the time period within which to consider would be short and it should be short.",
        "So, that's the reason why we insisted and I think even some Republicans insisted on a short timeframe of six months so we can continue to look at this.",
        "And if there are abuses, they should be highlighted and they should be ferreted out.",
        "And those who are in charge of conducting activities that led to the abuses should be held accountable.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "I do have to say that I'm really glad you're having this conversation.",
        "This does, I believe, conflict with - on separate Houses of government just letting the attorney general have all that power.",
        "And I guess my question I haven't gotten answered yet is how long does it actually take for the FISA court to issue a warrant?",
        "Is it a day, is it a week, is it a month, is this (audio gap) it really that big of a problem?",
        "Is it really that big of a problem?",
        "I know - we had some problems with Fred's cell phone there.",
        "But, Senator Casey?",
        "Well, certainly, it can be expedited.",
        "And that I don't think that's necessarily the only challenge here.",
        "I think part of the problem is that there have been gaps in what our national security agencies and personnel have been able to examine because of - not just because of what might be happening with the court, but also in terms of technology, and I think that's one of the things that there's a real concern about.",
        "And there's a real concern, I think, over the next couple of months that there's a great deal of concern about what's out there.",
        "And I think that that's - and I'm not on the intelligence committee, so I don't have knowledge of that…"

        "Do you think cooler heads are going to prevail come the fall?",
        "No, I think the problem with this - the way this transpired is that it was done in a short period of time when people are, frankly, at the end of a session when we just - we had to battle the president on children's health insurance of all things.",
        "I mean we had to work night and day.",
        "I worked very hard on that, as did many Democrats and some Republicans.",
