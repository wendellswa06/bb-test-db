        "Yeah.",
        "And you voted against the FISA law, why?",
        "I did.",
        "Well, just for the sake of the listeners, the FISA law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was established by Congress in 1978, and they did so at that time to set up a legal framework to secure information.",
        "And it really arose out of the abuses of President Nixon, who, some of us remember, was the spying on American citizens.",
        "And so that's the origin of the law, and it has been updated and reformed some 50 times.",
        "And it's a very important one.",

        "If it does, I'll sign it.",

        "I just have a little comment on how I personally feel about this program.",
        "And the trick on this program - and especially the updating of the FISA laws and everything - is that, technologically, you can't assume that the terrorists won't know what they're doing.",
        "You can't assume that the people that were trying to eavesdrop on, the people that were trying to collect intelligence on won't know what they're doing.",
        "And there are far too many ways to get around a blanket law, like as a blanket eavesdropping program, that will completely befuddle this kind of program.",
        "Well, some did and some didn't.",
        "But those that went along with the president, of course, that vote has prevailed.",
        "I voted against it because it does not have a legal framework.",
        "And I think that's - you used the word warrantless.",
        "And I think that that's where the problem lies, not with any president having the best intelligence possible, because every president must have that.",

        "Hmm.",

        "So, yes, I think you can read it that way.",
        "I mean, no one has come out specifically - the White House doesn't say yes, you're right, okay, a judge found parts of this illegal.",
        "But I think that's certainly implicit in this and why there needs to then be a new law allowing the administration to do what it has been doing previously.",

        "Right.",
