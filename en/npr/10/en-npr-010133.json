        "But now, here you see in this act a sort of blanket immunity going forward in case they ever were to give that information over.",

        "Yeah.",
        "That's right.",

        "Much of what I think, most members know about the program has come from the briefings that they've gotten, limited briefings, and also from press accounts that have been covering this.",
        "So there's yet to be sort of a, you know, throw open the doors, can talk completely openly about what the operational aspects of this are.",

        "Well, you know, the administration has said all along, and the DNI has said this, too, that the changing nature of technology, the fact that now we have cell phones and e-mail and instant messaging and so many different ways for individuals to communicate, essentially makes FISA very outdated.",
        "And they need to have the ability to keep pace with that sort of rapid change.",
        "A sort of classic example is that, you know, let's say the NSA, the National Security Agency, is listening to a terror suspect in Pakistan who's using a cell phone.",
        "And a week later, he throws out that cell phone and he gets a new one and it has a new number and it has a new account et cetera, they, you know, would contend that they need to be able to keep pace with that because the technology is so disposable and so ubiquitous et cetera, and that they way that FISA was written is that it essentially makes it very difficult for them to do those kinds of very quick operations inside the U.S.",
        "So, I think, you know, the intelligence community would argue that you always have to try and stay a step ahead of the adversary.",
        "And the reason that they have been pushing for loosening, if you will, the restrictions on these laws, I think, has to be seen in light of their operational desire to try and keep up with a very rapid diffusion of this kind of technology and tactics that I'm sure are changing on the part of terrorists or their adversaries all the time.",
        "So, Chris, your point being that this is unnecessary because the terrorists are going to be one step ahead all the time?",
        "Well, the main trick on this is you have to look at things more like encryption, private telephone networks, especially with e-mails, things like PGP, all these different technologies that are - you know, the people that we're trying to catch are not the idiots.",
        "The stupid terrorists are the ones that are going to get caught at airplane security.",
        "They're the ones that are going to get caught going through the borders.",
        "You know, when you look back at 9/11 and al-Qaida, they're not the stupid terrorists.",
        "They're the ones that have tons of money.",
        "They're the ones that have the people that know what they're doing, the people that understand the technology.",

        "Today, the communications - most of them anyway - travel through fiber optic cables in the ground.",
        "And much of that infrastructure is, in the United States, it's almost entirely privately owned.",
        "So the NSA now and its agencies need a way to effectively go to those cables and latch on to them.",
        "But as you said, it's not just a matter of hooking on to a wire that runs to a house necessarily.",
        "You're talking about, you know, huge amounts of information, millions of phone calls, billions of e-mails just flowing through these pipes.",
        "And the NSA needs a way to get into that stream effectively and see what's going by and pull some of it out.",
        "And, you know, the name of the game in surveillance has completely changed in that sense."
