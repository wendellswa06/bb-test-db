        "So pooling money assigned to one client with money assigned to another client is one violation.",
        "Sleeping with a client would be another kind of violation.",

        "Here's McDonnell.",
        "Women had a 35 percent chance of being disbarred in any given case, and men had a 17 percent chance.",
        "So that suggests that females had a 106 percent higher likelihood of being disbarred than males.",
        "Shankar, this sounds really disheartening - that women are going to be punished more severely for the same offenses as men.",
        "I think that's right, Ari.",
        "And it really speaks to this larger implication that even though it can seem that a positive stereotype can only have positive effects, this isn't the case.",
        "Sometimes when you put a group on a pedestal and say women in general are likely to be more ethical than the men, it can produce unintended consequences."
