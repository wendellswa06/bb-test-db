        "And it's one for which we can't tell you it will or won't happen.",
        "But it surely is a possibility.",
        "He says when this virus spreads between people and reproduces, it copies its genetic code in a sloppy way, creating genetic changes with unpredictable effects.",
        "We may have had more Ebola virus transmission between people in the last four to six months than we've had in the last 500 to 1,000 years.",
        "So this virus is really undergoing major mutational changes in this hyper-evolutionary period.",
        "Osterholm says he doesn't know how likely it is that Ebola could start spreading through the air.",
        "But the fact that it's possible creates an urgent need to stop this outbreak.",
        "Because a respiratory-transmitted Ebola virus for the world would be an absolute catastrophic event.",
        "He points to laboratory evidence that suggests this kind of virus might be capable of passing through the air.",
        "For example, pigs infected with Ebola somehow gave it to monkeys housed in the same room without touching them.",
        "But another study found no evidence of transmission through the air from infected monkeys to other monkeys.",
        "Gary Kobinger worked on both of these animal studies.",
        "He's with the Public Health Agency of Canada.",
        "I asked him how likely it was that Ebola will mutate and start spreading more easily between people.",
        "You know, that would be very speculating on what can happen or cannot happen.",
        "But I can tell you this has not happened in the past in any of the outbreaks.",
        "In the 1990s, Las Vegas was one of those cities bursting at the seams.",
        "So the Bureau of Land Management auctioned off thousands of acres of federal land surrounding the city and the money poured in."

        "But Lavinia was my way into Virgil's world and his discourse about power and about war.",
        "Because what Virgil is talking about in those last six books, I think, partly is what makes a real hero and what is the moral cost even of heroic victory.",
        "And that seemed a really relevant question to me.",
        "Was there anything conscious that you were writing in which the war that grinds on and on and on here in this book, does it have any resonance for us, a culture having been at war for the last five years?",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "I think that's one reason why these last six books of the epic hit me so hard.",
        "He's talking about a war that you really can't stop fighting.",
        "Now, you read \"\"The Aeneid\"\" to prepare for this, and my understanding is that you yourself read it in Latin rather than using any of the translations that are available.",
        "Well, I was actually teaching myself Latin to read Virgil, which is what I always wanted to read in Latin.",
        "And so I finally - in my 70s, I though, you know, you better do it now or you won't have time.",
        "So, I sort of dug into the Latin again and got to where I could read Virgil very slowly.",
        "I mean, ten lines a day is good for me.",
        "But the fact is he is a very great poet, and he's the kind of poet who doesn't really translate very well.",

        "Oh, why did he do that?",

        "Why did he do that?",
        "He knew what he was doing, because this is what happens in a war, I think.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "This is an epic.",
        "What you had done is very much a meditation on war.",
        "Yeah, but I got the idea from Virgil, from his meditation on war too.",
        "It appears that \"\"The Aeneid\"\" was in part written as a sort of message to Augustus who was, you know, his patron, who had just become emperor and had just kind of - well, he ended the civil wars but at a very high cost in liberty and a few other things.",
        "And it seems to me that Virgil was very clearly saying is Augustus look out, count the cost of empire.",

        "Back in the early '70s, when the oil-producing countries hit us with an embargo, we talked about developing alternate energy.",
        "It wouldn't be economical at first, we understood that, but once the price of oil hit $50 a barrel, well, we'd be liquefying and gasifying coal, we'd be heating all our homes with solar energy.",

        "Not quite.",
        "Although, the ethanol part has taken an interesting turn or two.",
        "The reason that corn is trading at such a high price is that so much of it now is being used to create ethanol.",
        "By some estimates, ethanol plants in this country will consume close to half the corn grown in America within the next few years.",
        "That means that America's role as one of the world's major exporters of food will experience a commensurate drop.",

        "There are no tariffs on imported oil, that's why we buy and use so much of it.",
        "But there is a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on Brazilian ethanol, which is made from sugarcane and is much cheaper than American ethanol.",
        "Why the tariff?",
        "Again, political pressure from US corn and soybean producers to protect their profits.",
        "When you consider that China and India will make as many cars as the U.S.",

        "You don't need to be an expert on agribusiness.",
        "If there's a cheaper way of producing alternate energy without gobbling up one of the world's major food sources, shouldn't we be taking a closer, more determined look?"
