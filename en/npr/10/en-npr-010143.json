        "One of the stranger stories to come out of the post-Taliban Afghanistan is that of American Jack Idema.",
        "Now you may recall last September an Afghan court convicted Idema, a former Special Forces sergeant, and two other Americans, of running a vigilante prison.",
        "The three rounded up supposed Afghan terrorists and imprisoned them in a two-story house in Kabul.",
        "If that crime is bizarre, the trial proved Idema was flamboyant enough to live up to it.",
        "Journalist Peter Bergen recently visited Jack Idema and his cohorts at the Afghan prison they now call home.",
        "His article is about that encounter.",
        "The Shadow Warrior appears in the current edition of Rolling Stone magazine.",

        "Peter Bergen, welcome.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is an amazing story.",
        "This is a guy who's gone from running a private prison to, as I say, spending some time in a publicly funded prison.",
        "(Laughs) Yes.",
        "He's a guest of the state.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jack Idema is quite a character.",
        "He--a former US Special Forces sergeant who kind of appointed himself on a mission to hunt down terrorists in Afghanistan after 9/11, a New Yorker who was very affected by the 9/11 attacks.",
        "He's one of these people that people either love or hate; there's very little in between.",
        "And I think, however, that there's been sort of a miscarriage of justice in his case.",
        "The claims that he didn't have any connections to the US government or the Afghan government, based on my investigation, seems to be completely--you know, seems to be false.",
        "He did have some dealings with the US government.",
        "People in the Pentagon were generally aware of what he was doing.",
        "Afghan officials were also aware of what he was doing.",
        "You know, it's an incredible story, really, because how this guy even got into Special Forces, given what at least one trainer said about him along the way.",
        "When he tried to make his way into the military, he said, `This is a'--What?--`the worst recruit and the most immature guy I've ever seen,' and...",
        "Yes.",
        "He's a--you know, he's got a conviction on a fraud charge.",
        "He spent four years in federal prison.",
        "He's got multiple arrests for various things.",
        "So, you know, Jack has had a very checkered past and you couldn't--well, you couldn't make up what has happened to him now.",
        "Pul-e-Charkhi Prison, where he and his two colleagues are, Brent Bennett and Ed Caraballo, is--you wouldn't wish this on your worst enemies.",
        "I spent five days there; that was plenty.",
        "It's the equivalent of the Leavenworth of Afghanistan.",
        "It's--a lot of Taliban, members of al-Qaeda are in there.",
        "In fact, there was a prison riot in December where four of the al-Qaeda-linked prisoners tried to kill the American prisoners, and ended up killing four prison guards.",
        "So it's a dangerous place.",
        "It's an unpleasant place.",
        "They are serving some pretty hard time there."

        "And here's a guy who actually had retired.",
        "He was out of the service.",
        "And after 9/11 he decides he's got to go do something, so he puts on somebody's uniform and runs off to Afghanistan.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, he set up his own task force, Saber 7, he called it, and he outfitted them with kind of quasi-American military uniforms.",
        "He did seem to have some success in arresting people planning bombings in Kabul and planning to assassinate Afghan Cabinet officials.",
        "The big problem is he didn't have written authorization from the US government or from the Afghan government, although he operated with maybe--you know, there was sort of a nod-and-a-wink kind of thing.",

        "It's about Jack Idema, who ran his own prison for a while.",
        "Let's get into his relationship with the military.",
        "A wink and a nod; he's running around the country in some kind of quasi-military outfits, and he's conducting operations and they know about it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the larger picture here is, you know, there are now more American civilian contractors in Iraq than there are British troops; kind of an astonishing statement, if you think about it.",
        "Britain is our biggest ally in Iraq, yet there are more American civilian military contractors.",
        "So this is a new phenomenon.",
        "We're increasingly privatizing things that the armed forces would have done, whether that's interrogating al-Qaeda members or guarding senior figures like Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan.",
        "And, you know, Idema operated in this kind of shadow world between the civilian and the military.",
        "He was in contact with the Pentagon.",
        "He did have senior-level contacts in the Afghan government.",
        "He did not have a contract from either government to do what he was doing, and he kind of--sort of fell between the cracks.",
        "How do you start a prison in Kabul?",
        "I mean, I know it's a fairly lawless place, but...",
        "Over $4 billion.",
        "Jim Hughes is a deputy director with the BLM.",
        "In April, one county here in California banned toys from fast food meals, saying this kind of marketing for children is unhealthy.",
        "Last month, the Center for Science in the Public Interest said it would sue McDonald's unless it stopped using toys to promote its kids' meals.",
        "Of course, when it comes to politics, all eyes are focused now on New Hampshire.",
        "We'll be taking a closer look at the upcoming primary in New Hampshire on the program tomorrow.",
        "For now, a lot of people outside the state wonder how a place that ranks 42nd on the list of the most populous states wields so much power in election years.",
        "Part of the reason: the people, they vote and they care."
