        "Always good to be here, Brother Neal.",
        "Let's start with the title of your book, which--you really see this as evidence of a class divide in the black community: \"\"Is Bill Cosby Right?",
        "Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that Bill Cosby is a lens unto a larger landscape of social and political struggle and arguments in black communities that have been taking place for more than a century.",
        "I see his divisive comments as a reflection of the bitter, seething politics of disdain for poor people among the more monied and the more privileged of black people.",
        "And so the poor folk are subject to vicious forms of assault by people with power, with money, with visibility and the like.",
        "It is not to suggest that poor people cannot be criticized.",
        "I have no romantic investment in black poor people, having been one myself.",
        "The point is, to what degree do we use our bully pulpits to assault the vicious contexts of white supremacy, economic inequality, social injustice, black bourgeois capitulation and seduction by their own privilege, their own material wealth, vs. the best of our black leaders and intellectuals who have always remembered it's a `both-and'?",
        "Even as you speak about personal responsibility, you link that personal responsibility to its possibility of realization in a culture that either enables you to do better or puts its foot on your neck and keeps you from rising.",
        "Now this divide, you point out, is nothing new.",
        "It goes back to, well, the days right after slavery, for one thing.",
        "No doubt.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You had a notion of racial uplift, where the privileged, elite, what I call the Afristocracy, were being, you know, surveilled by the white people of the time.",
        "And the white folk of the time were putting pressure on the black elite, both directly and indirectly.",
        "The direct pressure was: `Prove to us that you are a people worthy of freedom.",
        "How hypocritical that was, since they had been enslaved for no other reason than their color.",
        "The more implicit one and explicit one, however, was about the relationship to poor people.",
        "The poor among you are somehow bringing the race down.",
        "The black middle class felt that `If we could just bring better behavior patterns to these poor black folk, the white folk would treat us better and we could prove to them that we were worthy of receiving the freedom that every other white person expects at birth.'",
        "So there's a tremendous tension politically going on there that leads the black people who are in upper echelons and elite of African-American culture to somehow point out the faults and failures of the poor.",
        "And what I think Cosby did was nothing more than the 21st update of that ancient tradition.",
        "And some of the issues, you point out, are exactly the same: how people dress, how people talk, how people behave.",
        "Exactly.",
        "How people dress--black people walking down the street shooting the agate, as they said--a black style of promenading down the avenue--the more black people dress well, the more white people resented them.",
        "The flashy styles of the working class and the working poor were an especial offense to the more elite and elegant styles that black people favored among their own echelons.",
        "So the point is that the way they dress was problematic, and then the way they spoke.",
        "Did they speak the king's English to the queen's taste, or are they speaking some kind of black linguistic derivation, some kind of, you know, terrible form of black discourse that does not comport well in the broader, whiter society?",
        "And finally, you know, how they talk and how they speak to one another and how they name their own children, I think, was a big problem a hundred years ago, certainly 75 years ago, and it's a huge problem now."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that's what Cosby said in part of his remarks--the names: Shaniqua, Taniqua, Mohammed, he said.",
        "We're talking with Michael Eric Dyson about his view that the black middle and upper classes have abandoned their responsibilities to the poor.",

        "So, two hillbillies keep the Gimp locked up in their basement in a footlocker.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "And he said, `Shaniqua, Taliqua and Mohammed and all that crap, and they're all in jail.",
        "Lest you believe that Mr. Cosby was engaging in etymological derivation of Annichi(ph) and Kai(ph), he was trying to, as the young people say, hate.",
        "He was assaulting people for how they named their children, what names they gave them.",
        "And I think that's none of my business.",
        "If your mother wants to name you Shaniqua, Taliqua or Mohammed, that's her business.",
        "The question is, do we perpetuate a legacy of bigotry that disallows us to appreciate the people behind the names?",
        "Nobody's going to ask Oprah Winfrey--and trust me, Oprah ain't no regular name.",
        "Nobody's going to ask Shaquille O'Neal; Shaquille ain't no regular name.",
        "Nobody's going to demand Condoleezza--`Excuse me, I ain't met another person named Condoleezza.",
        "It's a distinct and unique name.",
        "Where is it derived from?",
        "Her mother took it from her love of music.",
        "It was a musical signature.",
        "That's like naming your kid Basso Profundo.",
        "I ain't mad at what you name your kid; it's what you answer to and how you treat people.",
        "So we learn to love Condoleezza and Oprah and Shaquille, and as a result of that, we begin to accept the people behind the names.",
        "The bigotry of assuming that poor people should change their names, as opposed to challenging the society that assigns bigotry to them, is, I think, misled and ill-informed.",
        "Well, one of the things Mr. Cosby was arguing, though, is if you are going to challenge that society, it's fine to speak the language that you do among your group, but if you're going to challenge the dominant society, you'd better be able to speak its language.",
        "Well, I have no problem with that, but let me complexify it, to create a word.",
        "The reality is that I saw, maybe within the last year, white, elderly people on TV, with a commercial: `Where you at?",
        "`Oh, I'm just chillin' here with my peeps.",
        "Now white commercial culture has reaped extraordinary benefit from the reproduction of these black symptoms of language, their black style, the black vernacular.",
        "So it's all right to be appropriated for commercial culture for the purposes of corporate America, but the very black people who generate the language are getting dissed."

        "It's interesting to not, Eunice, that you have a name that, perhaps, according to the bigotry of people in the upper echelon and class, would not even recognize your intelligence, which is manifest here today.",
        "I think what's interesting is that, of course, we have personal responsibility, but personal responsibility is but one slice of the pie of responsibility.",
        "What about moral responsibility?",
        "What more about social responsibility?",
        "Personal responsibility is key.",
        "When you go to any church on any Sunday, any temple, any mosque, they are repeating what Cosby said, hopefully in more balanced and judicious fashion.",

        "We say that they are wrong.",
        "We say, `Stop doing it.",
        "We speak out against it.",
        "But at the same time, we judge those characteristics in relationship to a larger culture, when at the same time it's being hypocritical, because if the culture only jumps on black people for some of the same stuff that goes on in white culture, but they only point it out when it goes among black people--when you talk about licentiousness, my God, Paris Hilton has a porn tape out and her ratings are shooting through the ceiling.",
        "She is a very rich woman who comes from tremendous money, and yet she exhibits some of the same characteristics that Mr. Cosby attaches to poor people.",
        "Now let's be honest.",
        "Vulnerable, poor people are more subject to their own vices; that is that they will--their vices will count more negatively against them than rich people, because they don't have the money to cushion them.",
        "We can all acknowledge that.",
        "But let's not pretend that there's a moral superiority to rich people vs. those who are poor.",
