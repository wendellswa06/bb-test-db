        "Yes, ma'am.",
        "Well, I think Stacy's--first of all, thank you so very much for calling.",
        "But I think that my own response has not been `Oh, it's the white man, oh, it's the white man, oh, it's the white man.",
        "Because the best of black leadership has always had a twin focus.",
        "On the one hand, from Frederick Douglass to Booker T.",
        "Washington to Marcus Garvey, across ideological spectra, from Dorothy Height on one side and Mary McLeod Bethune to more conservative leaders--I've mentioned Mr. Booker T.",
        "Washington and others--the reality is that African-American leadership has always understood that you must emphasize personal behavior and responsibility while at the same time speaking about social injustice and structural barriers.",
        "The privilege that you have to call a radio station today in the freedom of your home in Detroit, which is my hometown, from where I hail, and be able to engage in a conversation in a multicultural America is the product of people who struggled against racist barriers.",
        "So the very privilege to lament the persistence of a rhetoric against white supremacy has benefited you, has been made possible, by the very folk that you now call into question.",
        "That's beautiful, but understand that paradox.",
        "Number two, I'm not trying to suggest that we got to blame the white--it's not either blame the white man or, on the other hand, talk about what black folk themselves ought to do.",
        "Because you said already you're tired of the marching, you're tired of the suing and you're tired of the `Pick yourself up by the bootstrap.",
        "The reality is that, when you speak about a poor person--let's give you one example.",
        "If a mother is working two jobs, she doesn't have flex time to be able to go pay attention to her kid at the PTA as much as she wants, or, when that child is sick, to be able to address that child, because they are part of what we now know as the working poor: people who work 40 and 50 hours a week and yet can barely, if ever, make it above the poverty level.",
        "So the ability to say, `Well, I don't want to just either blame the white man or talk about personal responsibility' misses that mother.",
        "That mother is caught in a punishing network of exportation of jobs, of downsizing, of outsourcing, of the fleeing of capital from our post-industrial urban centers, and, at the same time, the suspicion and bigotry of those who are different.",
        "So it's not a straw-man argument about the white man; that's ridiculous.",
        "That's old school.",
        "What is new school, the newfangled racism, appears when if your name is Shaniqua you can't even get called in for a job interview.",
        "So what I'm trying to lay out here is the way in which we need people of responsible leadership--yes, like myself; yes, like Mr. Cosby--to come up with much more enlightened, insightful analyses of the problems to begin with, and then hold the correct quarters of the culture responsible, both within black America, but especially outside.",
        "I'm not yet willing to give up on making the larger society responsible.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: By agreeing to raise the federal debt ceiling just hours before the deadline, members of Congress prevented an economic crisis.",
        "Yeah, like one does, yeah.",
        "And he's there willing slave.",
        "You must be proud.",
        "If Martin Luther King Jr. had approached it the way you suggest--`Well, how far are white folk gonna go?'--he would have never marched in the street.",
        "You would have never had a voting right in the South.",
        "We would have never had the Civil Rights Act passed and, subsequently, we would never have had the Fair Housing Act passed.",
        "If Martin Luther King Jr. had surrendered his responsibility by saying, `White resistance is so huge that we will never be able to secure black freedom,' we would have never had the privileges we have now.",
        "If you want freedom, it's going to cost you.",
        "It's going to cost you intellectually, it's going to cost you spiritually, it's going to cost you emotionally and it's going to cost your sideline, spectatorial ability.",
        "You are a leader as well, Stacy.",
        "You can't just indict those who lead by example and who are obviously doing so.",
        "You must take responsibility in your community, in your church, in your neighborhood, and, daresay, in your family, and make sure that things are different than what they have been in the past."

        "You write, `Perhaps the most damaging consequence of Cosby's war on the poor is that they're left less defended and much more vulnerable to rebuff, even by folk--policy analysts, public policy-makers, politicians--who might be sitting on the fence wondering what to do about the poor and who now get a huge cue from Cosby that it's just fine to leave them to sink or swim for themselves.'",
        "Yes.",

        "They're not familiar with the major characters.",
        "They don't know the dramatis personae who have populated the great drama and struggle for black justice.",
        "So now they get in on a conversation that's been going on for a long time among black folk, who are speaking shorthand, and they don't quite get it.",
        "So now public policy-makers who hear Mr. Cosby assaulting the poor and saying that they are responsible begin to change their mind.",
        "They say, `Well, we thought we had to help them because we had to indict our own social practices for their failure to be able to assist these people.",

        "To focus on the poor is to portray a class anxiety that is historically rooted in black communities about, `How will these white people look at us?'",

        "(Imitating Cosby) `The white man, he's got to be laughing.",
        "He's laughing at us.",
        "(In normal voice) Now Mr. Cosby says he doesn't care about what white people say, but obviously his own speech betrays the reality that he feels that white folk are looking at black people, and he is ashamed that white people will look at us and see what they see.",
        "Now when you talk about social morality vs. individual morality--look, you're born in a culture that teaches you good or bad things.",
        "Dr. Kenneth Clark died",

        "It's not an individual responsibility; they learned from a culture.",
        "They got a cue from a broader culture that they were not worth anything.",
        "So their individual self-esteem was shaped in a culture that gave them cues about how they were inferior as black people.",
        "So there's a more dynamic relationship, and we learn to value ourselves in a culture that teaches us to do so.",
        "But if it teaches us that we're ugly because we have dark skin, ugly because we have broad noses, we might treat our skin like Michael Jackson and bleach ourselves in an ocean of whiteness seeking the approval of a dominant culture.",
        "And yet we hate ourselves.",
        "So my point finally is that when we speak about the poor people, I'm saying, when you say they they spend a lot of money on hubcaps and bling-bling as opposed to doing the right thing, the consumer culture of black people is much more complex than the stereotype Mr. Cosby presented.",
        "I talk about in my book a study, a systematic, empirical, anthropological, ethnographic study, that says that young black consumers are much more complex.",
        "First of all, they're told from the day that they're born that they can't just waste their money.",
        "So they end up spending their money not only on things they want, but on things for the family because they realize they have to have a communal ethic at the heart of their consumption, so they must share what they get.",

        "I'm suggesting to you when you break down the numbers and you look behind the story, yes, it is necessary for us to hold each other accountable, including the poor, but if we stigmatize the poor and isolate them as if they are somehow morally alienated from the larger American society--rich folk got as many problems as poor folk.",

        "They spend money on stuff they want.",
        "They want bling-bling, too; it's just not as evident.",
        "So I'm saying, when we're willing to hold everybody accountable for their relative responsibility then we can speak about how the poor have to be pointed out.",
        "Until such time, to jump on the poor, especially for Mr. Cosby, is to, I think, perpetuate a stereotypical vision of poor black people that is not borne out by the facts or empirical investigation.",
