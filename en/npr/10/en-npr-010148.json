        "Kamal Kharrazi called it Iran's inalienable right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to develop such technology.",
        "And Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Al-Jafari has been sworn in at a ceremony in Baghdad, an important step toward a new Iraqi government.",
        "However, key posts reserved for representatives of Iraq's Sunni community have still not been filled.",
        "You can hear more on those stories later today on \"\"All Things Considered\"\" from NPR News.",

        "Also, guitarist Mike Doughty will join us to play songs from his new album and take your calls.",
        "Today, we're talking about issues of class and responsibility in the black community.",
        "Bill Cosby started a debate by calling poor blacks to account.",
        "Now cultural scholar Michael Eric Dyson says it's the black middle class that's abandoned its responsibilities.",
        "Professor Dyson is still with us from New York City to continue our conversation.",
        "And let's get an e-mail in from Craig in Tucson, Arizona.",
        "`My black son has an above-average IQ and attended classes for gifted children through junior high school.",
        "However, in the middle of junior high, he began to get flak from his peers about acting too white.",
        "With this peer pressure, his grades have sunk.",
        "My once straight-A son now in high school just received two D's and an F on his report card.",
        "This is an aspect of black culture--branding intelligence and achievement as white--this breeds poverty,' he said.",
        "`Sister Aretha Franklin once heralded our pride in being young, gifted and black.",
        "What happened?'",
        "A very good point.",
        "I actually addressed this is my book, generically, this notion of acting white.",
        "First of all, the notion of acting white got introduced into the culture in 1986 with a study by two anthropologists of one single school, I believe, in Washington, DC.",
        "Since that time, it has been replicated to the point that it has become something like the academic version of an urban legend.",
        "There have been many longitudinal studies since then, over space and time, that have tracked students--thousands of them, tens of thousands of them--who are black, and it has concluded that this notion of acting white is a very specific phenomenon usually shown in schools where white students outnumber black students, where they have access to AB courses--AP courses, advanced courses, where black students don't.",
        "And as a result of that, the resentment of the black student of being--getting closed out is that they have been assigned--that is, those white students--a kind of privilege that they are kept from.",
        "So this acting white phenomena is judged to be something that's terrible because white folk get something that black folk can never get.",
        "The point is that anti-intellectualism is an American disease.",
        "Richard Hofstadter wrote a book in 1963 that said when we made the choice of, you know, Eisenhower over Adlai Stevenson, that betrayed the essential unintelligence, or at least the anti-intellectualism, of the American populace.",
        "We look at it now.",
        "George Bush got major kudos in the last election and the first one for being anti-intellectual, despite going to Harvard and Yale.",
        "His elitism was muffled by and covered by this notion that he was an everyday guy with whom you could share a beer.",

        "The anti-intellectual attitudes that I confront as a professor are deep and pervasive in every culture.",
        "To single them out among black people I think is especially destructive, because now it signifies everybody else is smart and wants to go to school, but black folk aren't.",
        "I cite in the book studies that have been done both anthropologically and ethnographically and empirically that suggest that black students are just as interested in achievement as white students, that black parents more than white parents discuss the day's events with their children, that black students derive significant recognition from being called `smart' and that they want to go to college in equally impressive numbers as their white peers.",
        "This notion of acting white has taken on a life of its own.",
        "And though I'm sure that brother Craig in Arizona is right, that disease of not wanting to appear to be a chump or soft because you are intelligent and smart is, trust me, not something that can be segregated among black people.",
