        "So, Michel, it is a really interesting poll because it's been hard to collectively look at this group.",
        "It's a really diverse group of Americans.",
        "So they looked at nine different Asian ethnic groups, and that includes, you know, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, Chinese.",
        "And the big headline that they have is that Asian-Americans don't seem to like the Republican Party.",
        "You have a group that is the wealthiest, most highly-educated group in the country and a group that you would think would naturally align with the Republican Party, maybe because of fiscal issues or maybe more socially conservative on certain issues.",
        "But that was the big headline takeaway is that this group does not seem to be aligning with the Republican Party.",
        "And what I thought was most interesting is even among Vietnamese-Americans - this is a group that's historically voted more Republican than some of the other Asian ethnic groups - has a net unfavorable rating.",
        "And you're telling us that - that's startling in and of itself.",
        "But the other reason that this is so remarkable and is so attention getting is that you go back to exit polls in 1992 and a majority of Asians supported George H.W.",
        "Bush over Bill Clinton then.",
        "So what changed?",
        "That's right, Michel.",
        "And actually in the 1996 election as well the Republican presidential candidate also gathered a majority of Asian-American support.",
        "We started to see a shift in the year 2000.",
        "And ever since then it's been growing.",
        "President Obama did phenomenally well in 2012 with Asian-American voters, winning them by nearly 50 percentage points.",
        "As for what changed, I spoke with the director of the National Asian American Survey about this.",
        "His name is Karthick Ramakrishnan.",
        "And he told me that, you know, some of this shift has been happening over the long run because Democrats have been trying to court Asian-American voters.",
        "And in this election cycle, we're seeing it even heightened more because the Republican candidate is turning them off.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Hey, I've kept it from the children up until this moment.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Have you literally kept it from the children?",

        "One of the first things you notice about Libya's capital city are the hundreds of building cranes standing idle above unfinished apartment blocks.",
        "Before the crisis began in February, the Libyan government was in the midst of a building binge.",
        "It was fueled by the oil money that began flowing freely again after international economic sanctions were lifted in 2003.",
        "According to the World Bank, Libya was investing some $225 billion to improve its infrastructure, from oil field facilities to schools and hospitals.",
        "That program is one of things that Gadhafi's most fervent supporters point to when they say the leader has been good for Libya.",

        "Yes.",

        "He gestures at a sea of people filling the city's central Green Square, many of them holding pictures of the leader, or carrying a wide strip of green cloth they say is the longest national flag ever created.",
        "Magam says these people see Gadhafi as the source of all their benefits."

        "He says the aim is to build around half a million units over the next five years, and make them available to Libyans at low cost and with long-term payment plans.",
        "Dirk Vandewalle, a professor of government at Dartmouth, has been studying Libya's development.",
        "He says that, in many ways, Gadhafi's government was following the pattern of other oil-rich autocracies, such as those in the Persian Gulf, offering benefits in return for political silence.",
        "But Vandewalle says Gadhafi neglected the part of Libya that's now mostly in the hands of the rebels.",
        "The eastern part of the country has, I think, systematically suffered from underdevelopment.",
        "And the Gadhafi government, I think, did that to some extent deliberately because they distrusted the eastern part.",
        "But also, I think the business elite of Libya is overwhelmingly concentrated in Tripolitania.",
        "Tripolitania is the western part of Libya.",
        "And Vandewalle says Gadhafi created a massive patronage system that favored wealthy business people there in order to assure their support.",

        "He notes that Saif al-Islam, Gadhafi's son, once said the government's aim was to create a Dubai-like state in Libya.",
        "However, without understanding that in order to do that, you need to provide all kinds of mechanisms that Dubai, for example, provided -property rights, accountability, transparency, all the things that a modern economy needs.",
        "And that, of course, Gadhafi, in order to keep himself in power, simply was not willing to provide for Libya.",
        "Gadhafi supporters contend that eastern Libya did get a fair share of the country's oil bounty, especially for construction, but that corrupt local leaders stole much of the money.",
        "And they say those corrupt leaders are now among those promoting the rebellion against Gadhafi.",

        "So you definitely see younger Asian-Americans tilting more Democratic than their parents.",
        "But on the same token, you're also seeing Asian-Americans as a group identify more with the Democratic Party than you saw them identify, say, even four years ago.",

        "The thinking is maybe some of them are newer voters and that they could be somewhat malleable.",
        "And Karthick says some of this, you know, just could be due to the fact that the Asian-American community is thought to not identify with the Republican or the Democratic Party to the same degree.",
