        "Well, look; I think that they have sort of staggered around trying to eliminate the Affordable Care Act in the last two years.",
        "They have approached it with the most politically backward way.",
        "The first time they did it, which was they led with the one element that people truly loved about Obamacare from the very beginning.",
        "I'll tell you a quick story.",
        "The existing conditions.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'll tell you a very quick story.",
        "We, during 2009 and '10, were doing some research polling in focus groups for a major advocacy group that was trying to stop the rise of Obamacare.",
        "And the thing we discovered right off the bat - Republicans, Democrats, black, white, liberal, conservative, independent - every single demographic group desperately wanted pre-existing condition coverage.",
        "They'd all had a story about it.",
        "They'd all had a painful experience about it or knew someone who had.",
        "And so when the Trump administration tried to kill it the first time, they led with that.",
        "So they led with their chin on it and got knocked down pretty hard.",
        "You know, even their own Republicans in Congress were like, no, thank you.",
        "And I think you're going to end up with that taking front and center now.",
        "I think that, for all of its flaws, the Affordable Care Act has led to a lot of people becoming accustomed to, particularly, having the pre-existing coverage.",
        "And so I think there's a political difficulty ahead in terms of how do you get people who are up for re-election in 18 months to jump on that grenade?",
        "Well, how do they?",
        "I mean, clearly, there are those in the president's orbit who believe that this is the right political move, I mean, that this is perhaps what Trump's base wants.",
        "Is it?",
        "The irony of this is that Trump's base has about a fair amount of uptake on Obamacare-type programs.",
        "And I think that they're going to end up - you know, like all government programs, they are extraordinarily controversial at first.",
        "And whether they are good or bad for the economy, people who come to see them as a right or a benefit expect to keep that right or benefit.",
        "And so I think you're going to end up with that as the difficulty here.",
        "And look; there's an ideological component inside the Trump administration that, quite frankly, would really, really like to get rid of Obamacare as a promises-kept checklist item.",
        "But there is nothing, you know - there's no repeal-and-replace question here.",
        "This is just a pure elimination question.",
        "There's no serious health care plan coming down the pike right now in Congress on either side.",
        "Nothing that Democrats want would pass the Senate, but then the Senate wants to pass the House.",
        "So we're going to be, basically, throwing the health care markets into some enormous chaos.",

        "And he is slight of frame, but certainly big of heart.",
        "And he is averaging, just in the second half of this tournament, 27 and a half points.",
        "And that absolutely shocked Georgetown out of the NCAA Tournament last weekend with a scoring display, a shooting display that hasn't been seen in the NCAA Tournament in probably a couple of decades.",
        "He is, when you say slight of frame, this is a large person for a normal human being, right?",
        "He is five-eleven but in basketball terms, that is nothing.",
        "Exactly.",
        "He is just a wisp of a basketball player, and the funny thing is that he is so smallish that most of the big schools didn't recruit him despite the pedigree in his family of Dell Curry as his father who played for such a long time in the NBA.",
        "So many schools passed him by, and he is making all of those schools pay right now.",
        "Well, do you think that this guy is going on to a career in the pros?",
        "Is he going to follow his dad into the NBA?",
        "You know, his father was a much bigger player, much more physically imposing.",
        "I don't think that this is the type of kid who necessarily will get drafted, but given the show that he is putting on offensively in the NCAA Tournament and against the Georgetown team by the way which is noted for its defense.",
        "And in 68 consecutive NCAA tournament games had never allowed one player to score 30 or more points against them.",
        "Given that Stephen Curry has done that, I think that some NBA team certainly down the line is going to have to give him a look.",
        "And it very well maybe the team that his father works for, the Charlotte Bobcats, because he is in the front office and his job is, in part, is to scout young talent for the team.",
        "Well, he doesn't have to look far.",
        "No, right across the dinner table."
