        "It makes for a very interesting finding, especially for those who assume that organic is healthier.",

        "There are a lot of things when you do these comparisons that could confound the results.",
        "The soil types could be different, moisture or irrigation may vary from plot to plot, and the variety of tomatoes grown could change the picture.",

        "If limiting the supply of nitrogen to tomatoes could consistently lead to more flavonoids, then perhaps conventional farmers could do this too.",
