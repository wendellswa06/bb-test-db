        "As other states followed suit and smoking became less socially acceptable, the smoking rate fell to where it is today: 20 percent.",

        "Well, public health messages - such as the media and increasing taxes and worksite restrictions - are very important in motivating people to quit.",

        "There are some people that you can motivate and motivate and motivate, and they can't quit.",

        "But most people don't avail themselves of drugs or counseling.",
        "Cost is a barrier, but the bigger reason, Hughes says, is that people think they ought to be able to quit on their own.",
        "I think it's because, you know, if you have drug abuse and you get over it on your own, you don't tell anybody about it.",
        "But if you quit smoking, if there's a conversation on smoking, you brag and tell about it.",
        "So I think people hear about other people who were fortunate enough to be able to do it on their own, and don't hear about the people that are struggling.",
        "But Simon Chapman at the University of Sydney in Australia says quitting smoking has become too medicalized.",
        "The subtext of that is if you try to do it alone, you're unlikely to succeed.",
        "But Chapman and Hughes have conducted research that was funded by pharmaceutical companies.",
        "Even so, Chapman fears the balance in smoking control tilts towards the drug industry.",

        "Well, the so-called late-stage, or aggressive cancers, I think that's going to come, I hope, out of more aggressive genetic screening.",
