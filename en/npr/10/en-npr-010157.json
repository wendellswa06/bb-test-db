        "He intervened, but was unable to persuade her to leave, and the car sped off, hitting his leg.",
        "For nearly 30 minutes he followed the car as it threaded its way through the serpentine hill roads that connect the closely packed Jewish settlements and Arab villages east of Jerusalem.",
        "(Through translator) Using physical force with the girls won't work.",
        "Our goal is to talk to the girls and to convince them that their place is with the Jewish nation, not with our enemies.",

        "Political director Mike DuHaime said on a conference call yesterday McCain still sees opportunities in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, two states the Democrats carried in 2004.",
        "The reason that this race in these states is as close as it has been in what is a difficult environment for Republicans is because Senator McCain has the ability more so than any other person in the country right now to keep moderates and conservatives together, win a majority of independent voters, and get that lion's share of Democrat voters.",

        "Even my editor said, when I was worried that \"\"American Tale\"\" was swiping something basic from me, in that Spielberg movie about Russian mice, and my editor says: But Art, all Spielberg's stealing is your high concept, and frankly your high concept stinks.",

        "So it just was coming from someplace so uncharted, maybe, that people were taken off-balance and tried to figure out what it was that they were in, and what it was was something I'd kind of - because I believed it wouldn't be really read until after I was dead.",
        "I was young and believed in posterity then.",
        "So what happened was I just built it to last, and people were able to kind of sense that in the work, maybe.",

        "Oy.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Can I just - you see, the whole point of this book was so that I wouldn't have to answer.",
        "I could just say if you turn to Page 123, class, we'll be able to, like, read the section where Spiegelman answers why mice as definitely as he can because there was a certain point where those questions just made me want to confess to anything."

        "It grew out of just being invited into an underground comic I was working up in San Francisco as part of that wave of avant-garde comics of the '60s and '70s where the only requirement for this particular book was to use anthropomorphic characters.",
        "And I was stuck until a friend of mine was showing films in his cinema class in upstate New York, Ken Jacobs, and he was showing these old racist animated cartoons, and he was showing Mickey Mouse \"\"Steamboat Willie\"\" when he's still a Jazz Age character rather than kind of square and then pointed out that Mickey Mouse is just Al Jolson will funny round ears on top, that it was kind of all a form of minstrelsy.",

        "There's the image more basically that Hitler used if the Jews as the vermin of mankind that had to be exterminated.",

        "And now we're moving through one of these insane Gutenberg moments like where the entire world is going to change around this new technology and is changing.",
        "And I would say the same way comic books were related to comic strips but not identical, they had different qualities, and similarly when the underground comics came along, the possibility of working for a small mass medium rather than a big one, the nature of the content, as well as the form of it, changed."
