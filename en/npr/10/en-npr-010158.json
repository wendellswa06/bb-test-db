        "It's one of the higher-frequented, higher-trafficked areas where people are happily gathered and borrowing graphic novels, as we're calling comic books these days, right?",
        "And one of the things that's kind of amazing is it's because while other books can be Kindled, there's no reason not to read, I don't know, \"\"The Catcher in the Rye\"\" on a Kindle, it works, you can have it in whatever type size you want and change the font if you need to.",
        "But comics are really sight-specific.",
        "They're made for a specific page size.",
        "They're made to have pages that hide and reveal.",

        "You know where you are physically in it.",
        "And I guess the way I'm sure about it is I met some authors, they had no idea what their binding was on their books under the covers and what paper stock they were printed on.",

        "And I know it was translated into Farsi in a very small edition at some point.",
        "But so far, \"\"Maus\"\" easily lends itself to being yanked into that Holocaust-related debate about Israel and Palestine, and it's not my debate, but clearly the - it reverberates through the horrors of victims victimizing each other, as I think of the Middle East.",
        "So no, the answer is no.",

        "You said take a look, and you're inviting people to the website, and one of the things about the book itself is it really is an attractively-made thing that could only be made in the late days of our computer technology."

        "In the brand new 25th anniversary edition, we went back and, thanks again to computer technology, could print it well.",
        "But the main thing that it allows for psychologically is it's in a much more overheated, German-expressionist-inflected drawing style and, as you say, uses humans.",
        "And it calls everything else in the book into question.",
        "And I think of \"\"Maus\"\" as a book that keeps interrogating itself the same way that \"\"MetaMaus\"\" interrogates \"\"Maus.",
        "And it makes you understand that the other drawings in the other 270, 280, 290 pages was made with a conscious choice.",
        "Like in \"\"MetaMaus,\"\" I'm able to show some of the other drawing styles I was thinking about when working on the \"\"Maus\"\" books because every project I took on, including that 13-year project and things I've done since, I have to find a drawing style appropriate to it.",

        "Yeah, just as a reader, I found myself going back to that section first when I went to go re-read.",
        "You know, to me, it stuck in my mind of maybe being a key to something larger that was going on, and certainly the fact that it stood out so drastically from the rest of the writing style really was why it was my point of attention when I went back to the book.",
        "Well, it also has - you know, it has an immediate crackling emotional quality that I felt would be - it would be dishonest for me to overheat the other parts of \"\"Maus,\"\" which are received memory from my father that I'm interacting with and giving visual voice to, let's say.",
        "But I wouldn't have wanted to kind of amp it up and make it melodramatic.",
        "It's horrible enough without any amping, thank you, although there seems to be entire large genre of something I call holo-kitsch now that does exactly that in movies.",
        "So here, the parts that have, like, obvious emotional tension are my father's story because he's telling it, and it's a potent story, and the situation is potent, and also the parts that have to do with my father and me are probably the other parts that come to that kind of more electric areas of the book because, again, I'm communicating something I experienced directly rather than receiving and trying to transmit.",
        "Conrad, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Good question.",

        "Yeah, and I can't get the damn mask off.",

        "And yet if I had done something equally intricate and engaged, but it was about - I don't know - my daily life in Rego Park or a love story or an adventure story, no matter how intricately woven, it wouldn't have had that reverberation much wider.",
