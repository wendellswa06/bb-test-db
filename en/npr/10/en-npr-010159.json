        "Hello, Art.",
        "I was just wondering if you have any reservations regarding your comics being made into other forms of media as in like an animation or a film like other comic artists have expressed such as Alan Moore, his regrets of the tones that have been made in - of his comics.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "Also, if I take you to page 227 of the current (unintelligible), since that question does come up as a subset of my comics.",
        "The - I guess what it really comes down to is I worked for 13 years in a medium that I really do feel I understand and was able to control the elements.",
        "And comics, in their own way, are very intimate and have a great degree of abstraction.",
        "As soon as we move toward, like, animation or something else that moves, you have to - you're involved in a lot more uncontrolled variables: the voices, the way people walk, visual information that even as a cartoonist I have to inhabit, but will have to even be more dimensionalized for film.",
        "It made me very wary.",
        "Aside from the fact that when people bring me proposals - and I've had many, many, many, many, many offers, you know, they try to like kind of soften it up a little bit, like the book has a lot of harsh etches in it.",
        "And they say, why don't we end the story with you with your father and mother's grave and with your children?",
        "And that's in the direction of what I was calling Holo-kitsch before.",
        "So I'm not against movies.",
        "I'm addicted to them.",
        "I love movies.",
        "But, A, I don't think I could do it myself without devoting 26 years rather than 13, at least.",
        "And ultimately, my wife had the best line on this one.",
        "I'm feeling bummed out that people are more interested in my \"\"Maus\"\" work than anything else I could ever do, even though some of it's met with some success.",
        "She says, but no matter what, you have two great achievements: You've done \"\"Maus,\"\" and you've managed to not get it made into a movie.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Well, thank you for (unintelligible).",
        "John, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "We're talking with Art Spiegelman.",
        "His new book about his classic \"\"Maus\"\" is called \"\"MetaMaus.\"\" He's with us from our bureau in New York.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, which is coming to you from NPR News.",
        "And I just wanted to pursue that idea, there is an aspect of comics, and there's a great description in \"\"Kavalier and Clay\"\" where they go see \"\"Citizen Kane\"\" and completely changed the way they draw comics.",
        "But I always thought that was something that we saw very much in \"\"The Spirit.\"\" And there is some aspect of your work, and you describe it specifically in \"\"MetaMaus,\"\" as consciously cinematic.",
        "Huh.",
        "Well, I never thought of comics as storyboards for films.",
        "Some of my earlier work before \"\"Maus\"\" wasn't really directly inspired by Will Eisner's \"\"The Spirit,\"\" but - and by \"\"Citizen Kane.\"\" But what's more interesting now is to see what comics are in themselves, not as kind of a low budget way to make a movie or currently as a way to pitch a superhero film or something.",
        "But what has to do with these panels put together on a page?",
        "How do they juxtapose?",
        "What information are you getting as you look at that given?",
        "The page structure - that's an important part of how comics get told.",
        "And as a result, some of the people I like the best right now - like one of the artists who just continues to floor me is Chris Ware, the author of \"\"Jimmy Corrigan\"\" and other works.",
        "And his thing looks more - his stuff looks more like maybe circuit diagrams and is often more inspired like the very earliest comics by a proscenium theater stage, rather by close-ups, overhead, under view - Orson Welles-like shots there.",
        "More about what happens on that surface.",
        "Are you looking at - how is your eye led through the panels.",
        "It's certainly an important part of how \"\"Maus\"\" itself functions as \"\"MetaMaus\"\" tries to open up in that section about comics.",
        "Here's an email from Czarina(ph) - great name.",
        "I found many people became disinterested about certain topics when read in lengthy essays or books.",
        "The \"\"Maus\"\" comic books allow a larger demographic to understand a complex historical event in simple terms and through easy flow of content.",
        "Was a simple narrative your approach?",
        "You think that's what you did?"

        "No, I was actually kind of insulted when \"\"Maus\"\" got a young adult best book award until I realized how democratic a medium I'm working in again.",
        "But I suppose, you know, one of the ways that \"\"Maus\"\" has been able to stay alive is the fact that people are able to, like, just enter and then read without looking under the hood, let's say.",
        "MetaMaus\"\" is a way of letting people look under the hood if they want to or find out more about the history and the family that intersect with the medium in the story.",
        "But ultimately, I didn't think of it as simple.",
        "I just felt I had to, like, get things as clear as I could without screwing up.",
        "It wasn't a matter of over-clarifying.",
        "The idea was - as one of the writers from the essay about \"\"Maus,\"\" Lawrence Weschler, said in a piece years ago, a phrase I hanged on to really tight because it was a perfect phrase, and I could never have thought of it.",
        "He said, \"\"Maus\"\" achieves a crystalline ambiguity, like it doesn't push past what I can know.",
        "In \"\"MetaMaus,\"\" you describe \"\"Maus\"\" as a 300-page yahrzeit candle.",
        "First of all, tell us what a yahrzeit candle is, and tell us what you mean by that.",
        "OK.",
        "I mean, a yahrzeit candle is a memorial candle lit for the dead, as I remember from the early Hebrew school classes I took before I became an apostate and taking a book tour through Rosh Hashanah, and New Year and Yom Kippur.",
        "But nevertheless, I remembered what a yahrzeit candle was, and it was my way of commemorating, of understanding and making a monument on paper with ink, but some kind of monument to what happened, not just to my parents, but by implication, beyond - without trying to charge that with the politics of other issues just as an urgent thing to try to understand, not so that we just don't burn Jews in the future, but just so that we don't burn up the planet, even, for the future.",
        "Like how does something happen, and what it - how does it reverberate through time?",
        "And that act of memory is important, and comics are great for memory.",
        "Like even when you have, like, a short comic, like a three-panel comic, you've got a past, a present and a future, as soon as you look at those three boxes.",
        "And that allows you to reflect and compare times.",
        "You write - at different points, you say that \"\"Maus\"\" was about different things.",
        "But one of the things you say it was about was about memory.",
        "Art Spiegelman, thank you so much for being with us here today.",
        "Well, thanks.",
        "It was a memorable visit, Neal.",
        "MetaMaus\"\" is the new book by Art Spiegelman about his book published 25 years ago.",
        "Coming up: Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Connie Schultz.",
        "After 18 years with Cleveland's Plain Dealer, she's decided she can't be both a local columnist and a political wife.",
        "We'll also hear her memories of civil rights icon Fred Shuttlesworth.",
        "She joins us next.",
        "Stay with us.",
        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "France's president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke today, trying to ease tensions after a weekend of violent protests left a trail of smashed windows and broken pavement on one of the main shopping streets in Paris.",
        "The protesters call themselves the yellow vest movement, named for the fluorescent safety vests they wear.",
        "They're demanding that Macron drop a tax hike on gas and diesel fuel.",
        "He says the tax is key to creating a green economy.",
        "The protesters have no leader, but they've posed one of the most serious challenges yet to Macron's pro-business economy.",
