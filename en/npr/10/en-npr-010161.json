        "So how is Macron dealing with this?",

        "And here is a clip of him talking through an interpreter.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "(Through interpreter) We must listen to the protesters, but we must not do so by renouncing responsibilities for today and tomorrow because there is also an environmental challenge.",
        "So Macron basically says - you know, these plans for this ecological transition for the country to get off of fossil fuels and to have a green economy were laid a long time ago and if France doesn't make that transition now, it's only going to become harder.",
        "And the speech he's making today is a big speech that was planned for a long time.",
        "He's actually outlining the country's blueprint for its energy future through 2028.",
        "For example, he's also announced the closure of 14 nuclear reactors by 2035.",
        "But Macron also says he doesn't want this energy transition to, you know, a green economy to create a two-speed France, one of the rich and the poor.",
        "So he is expected to offer things like zero percent loans for buying new, cleaner cars and cash bonuses for changing the windows in your house.",
        "Is that going to make a difference?",
        "I mean, is that what these people want?",
        "Well, Rachel, no one really knows yet.",
        "But oftentimes Macron is accused of being lofty and idealist and disconnected from the lives of ordinary French people.",
        "So if he comes across like that today, it's not going to be good.",
        "Also, Rachel, analysts have been saying that this movement was set off by the latest gas tax, but it's been a long time coming.",
        "It's very deep-seated.",
        "It's very widespread and disparate.",
        "It's leaderless, difficult to control.",
        "So how do you stop it?",
        "So you know, the protesters say if they don't get what they want, they will be out in Paris protesting again on Sunday.",

        "When the United States in 2009 sent John Demjanjuk to stand trial in Germany as an accused Nazi war criminal, many wondered: What's the point?",
        "Or as Deborah Lipstadt put it in a recent New York Times op-ed: Wasn't there something comic, even shameful, about dragging a dying man across the Atlantic to stand trial for a crime he committed over half a century ago?",
        "Shouldn't there be a statute of limitations, even for genocide?",
        "Deborah Lipstadt teaches modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University, and joins us now from our bureau in New York.",

        "And part of that question line comes - this is a man who spent six months as a guard at a death camp called Sobibor.",
        "This was not Adolf Eichmann, the architect of the Holocaust.",
        "True.",
        "It was not, well, first of all, I don't think Adolf Eichmann was the architect, but we can talk about that later.",
        "All right.",
        "He's one of the operating - chief operating officers.",
        "But John Demjanjuk was certainly not as important as an Adolf Eichmann.",
        "He was not as high-ranking.",
        "He was Ukrainian.",
        "He was a guard.",
        "But he knew exactly what was going on.",
        "And, in fact, the judge - the German judge who found him guilty of being an accessory to murder in 28,000-plus murders made that point, that he had to know what was going on.",
        "And as every guard - the judge said every guard at Sobibor knew he was part of an organization with no other purpose but mass murder.",
        "So to say it was only six months when people like Eichmann were there - were doing this for four or five years is not really an excuse."

        "They said: We had no choice.",
        "Kill or be killed.",
        "Well, the truth of the matter is that no defense attorney, including Demjanjuk's, has ever been able to produce any evidence - defense attorney or historian - of someone actually being killed for refusing to participate.",
        "So the idea of kill or be killed is really, I think, a bit of a myth.",
        "Moreover - they might have been sent to the Eastern Front.",
        "They might have been sent to do terrible jobs, more dangerous jobs to them, but they weren't forced to do that.",
        "And even if they had been forced, I think there is a - an ethical law that they very happily ignored.",
        "And another criticism is there was no specific evidence against John Demjanjuk charged.",
        "He was charged as an accessory to murder in the more than 28,000 deaths that occurred at the time he was a guard at the death camp.",
        "And basically, the allegation was, yes, he knew, therefore he did nothing to stop, therefore he was an accessory in all of these murders, but no specific allegation.",
        "You think the media is too negative...",
        "Practically, for instance, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and other Southern states that would have previously had to seek federal approval can now put in place recently passed voter identification laws.",
