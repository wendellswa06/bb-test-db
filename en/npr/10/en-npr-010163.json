        "Enough already.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the saga did go on for 30 years.",
        "But part of the reason it went on so long is that he fought it every step of the way.",
        "He used all sorts of legal barriers, things - tools that were his to use.",
        "I mean, he had access to a legal system that he wouldn't have had certainly in the Ukraine of World War II, whether the preoccupied, you know, Ukraine or after it was occupied by the Germans.",
        "He dragged this out.",
        "He dragged this out for 30 years.",
        "So, you know, on some level, yes, he was 91, but it wasn't dragged out because anybody was slow in doing this.",
        "He was using those legal maneuvers hoping, I think, on some level that he could delay it and people would say, oh, enough already, number one.",
        "Number two, we've seen him - pictures of him in his wheelchair during the parts - portions of the German trial.",
        "He actually was in a hospital bed with an oxygen tank.",
        "But it's interesting to remember that when -just before he was turned over to the Germans and the United States, again, revoked his citizenship for the second time, his lawyer said to the court, you know, this is such a sick man.",
        "To be taken from his home, he's going to have to be taken on a stretcher.",
        "And the OSI, the Office of Special Investigations of the Justice Department showed film clips from the day before of him walking unaided into an appointment getting in and out of a car without even a cane.",
        "And the next day he's on a bed, you know, unable to move.",
        "So we have no proof, let me put it that way, that this man is as handicapped as he presents himself to be.",
        "We're talking with Deborah Lipstadt, the professor of modern Jewish history and Holocaust studies.",
        "Her op-ed \"\"Demjanjuk in Munich\"\" ran in The New York Times yesterday.",
        "She's the author of the book \"\"The Eichmann Trial\"\" and with us from our bureau in New York.",
        "Al's on the line, Al calling from Eden Prairie in Minnesota.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "Great conversation.",
        "I just have a quick comment.",
        "I was just thinking when I was hearing you a few minutes ago mention the fact that you know, people weren't, you know, kill or be killed wasn't actually a fact of life.",
        "I guess my opinion is - and I'm definitely not standing up for what he did.",
        "It was definitely morally wrong.",
        "But it's very easy for us in, you know, a free Western society, 60, 70 years later, to pass judgment on what we think what it was actually like to be in that situation back then.",
        "I'm not saying what he did was right, but, I mean, pretty much, people back then were really stupid.",
        "They knew if you're going to be sent to the Eastern Front, you had a nil chance of coming back alive.",
        "So OK, you weren't shot like a.k.a what happened in Vietnam, you know, that famous picture, but still, I mean, you knew that you were not going to be coming back most likely alive.",
        "So, I don' know.",
        "I can't...",

        "I think - Al, I think you're making an excellent point.",
        "It's very easy from the comfort - I'm sitting here in the NPR studios; it's raining outside, but I'm nice and dry inside and very comfortable -to make glib judgments.",
        "And, you know, I reached that conclusion.",
        "I realized that.",
        "Not talking about war criminals, but I teach - the courses I teach at Emory University have to do with the history of the Holocaust.",
        "And my students make those kind of judgments about the victims very often.",
        "Why didn't they fight back?",
        "Why didn't they run away?",

        "So you're absolutely right.",
        "But there is a very powerful book.",

        "And it's a study of a police unit that was turned - a German police unit that was turned into killers sort of overnight without the general preparation that often the SS men were given.",
        "And some of them refused to participate and nothing was done to them.",
        "So you're right that they didn't know - or they knew they go to Eastern Front where - I don't think there was nil chance, because we do have people who came back from the Eastern Front.",
        "Half the people I used to meet when I went to Germany, when they were more veterans around, and there's still quite a few, all of them seemed to been on the Eastern Front.",
        "But you're right, it was a dangerous thing.",
        "But nonetheless, that doesn't justify saying, well, therefore, I have to take part in a murder system.",
        "We do know that there were guards at some of these camps who ran away, guards who refused to participate.",
        "And it was a hard thing to do.",
        "And maybe it was a dicey thing to do.",

        "There is another argument you make in your - Eichmann was a planner, a large cog of the Holocaust.",
        "John Demjanjuk, a very small cog.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "And now Hannah Arendt, the political philosopher, whose writings on the Eichmann trial have had far more - far longer legs than Eichmann himself and is, in some way, more important because she has generated a very important and vigorous and sometime feisty intellectual conversation, makes the point that when you're dealing with a machine, a large cog and a small cog are essentially of equal importance.",
        "She wasn't saying that, you know, everyone is treated the same.",
        "But if you take out a small cog, the machine is not going to operate just as much if you take out a large cog.",
        "You, of course, look at the difference - how big a role did this person play in planning the murders and carrying out the murders?"
