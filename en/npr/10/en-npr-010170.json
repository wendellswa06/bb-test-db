        "Robert Traynham, how do you see it?",
        "Well, you know, Senator McCain - no one questions his patriotism.",
        "He obviously has put country first, to use his terminology.",
        "Over the last couple of centuries - over the last couple of days, he has been in the public eye.",
        "However, he's also a politician, and so, we also need to look at him in that lens as well.",
        "And so, we need to understand that although he has put his presidential campaign on hold for the next couple of days, or however long it's going to be, he's also still running for president.",
        "And so, we just need to understand that and recognize moving forward that if, in fact, something does materialize with this bipartisan agreement that hopefully will happen later on today - if not today, sometime tomorrow - that he probably will use this, and use it fairly effectively, as he runs for the presidency over the next three weeks.",
        "How long do you think, Melissa, that the campaign is likely to be suspended?",
        "He said that if there is an agreement on the bailout bill that he'd be ready to debate on Friday.",
        "But is that likely?",
        "Well, given that Barack Obama is planning to debate on Friday, I think it's a really good idea for John McCain to come.",
        "So, I suspect that he will.",
        "I think that more than anything this was sort of a positioning of John McCain as someone who would sort of, you know, drop everything, particularly drop the pursuit of a personal goal of being president in order to address the questions of country.",
        "It was his opportunity to actually enact that notion of country first.",
        "But I think that the big question here is whether or not there was in fact a suspension of the campaign.",
        "If anything, there's a sort of heightened conversation about John McCain and his role as a presidential candidate in this moment, so that by saying that he's not campaigning, he actually drives media attention towards the fact that he is running for president at exactly the moment when the public opinion polls are swinging towards Barack Obama.",
        "So, it was really quite an interesting strategic choice that had exactly the effect of giving his little campaign a bit of a boost.",

        "Well, as we've heard, it's a big dam on the Euphrates River at a Haditha.",
        "Iraq is a big, dry country bisected by two big rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates.",
        "So dams are strategically very important here to the Iraqis and to the United States, who has been watching Islamic State move in on a series of Iraqi dams over this last year.",
        "As we saw in northern Iraq, some of the first U.S.",
        "airstrikes last month were in support of attempts by Kurdish forces to retake the Mosul dam from these extremists.",
        "So how is this different from targets that have been struck so far?",
        "Well, thus far, the airstrikes have been mainly in the northern part of Iraq.",
        "So the Mosul dam, for example, is way up, more than 200 miles north of Baghdad.",
        "While this new target, the Haditha dam, is about 180 miles over to the west.",
        "You could argue that the fight in the northern part of Iraq is in many ways a simpler fight than Anbar Province in the West.",
        "In the areas that have been struck so far around the Mosul dam, around Mount Sinjar where the Yazidi minority was besieged, these Sunni extremists - the Islamic State - don't really have a lot of popular support.",
        "And they've moved in very recently, especially in the Kurdish areas in the north and among Kurdish forces, with whom Americans have had a long and friendly relationship."
