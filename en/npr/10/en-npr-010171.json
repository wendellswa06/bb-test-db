        "And what makes Anbar more complicated?",
        "Anbar, which the province where the Haditha dam is, will be probably remembered not very fondly by many thousands of American soldiers who fought there.",
        "It's where the city of Falluja is, which was a real wellspring of anti-American fighters and Sunni extremism.",
        "And after the Americans pulled out of Iraq, a lot of that anger was redirected at the Iraqi government.",
        "So Anbar is almost all Sunni.",
        "Those Sunnis felt marginalized by the government, which is mostly Shiite.",
        "And they have months of peaceful protests, which met with a violent response.",

        "They've been there nine months, more or less.",
        "So the United States, by getting involved in airstrikes there, is getting involved in a more complicated situation and perception will be very important.",
        "So an airstrike by American forces in support of Iraqi forces who are also not very popular there, there's a risk that it might not be greeted so positively by the local population.",
        "In fact, officials from Haditha told us this morning that a lot of people fled their homes in that area after the airstrike happened.",
        "They were afraid.",
        "On the other hand, it's been pointed out that the local people in Anbar, especially tribal sheikhs there who are very influential, might be more likely to support the Iraqi government to fight against the Islamic State if the American military shows that they are backing those forces.",
        "And are there any other different factors in this now - the terrain?",

        "officials have been traveling around the world trying to build international support for this push against extremism, but do they have support in the region?",
        "Well, the Arab League is meeting in Cairo today.",
        "The secretary general, Nabil Elaraby, has called for a comprehensive confrontation against the militants.",
        "And this comes after John Kerry called Elaraby yesterday to discuss the issue.",
