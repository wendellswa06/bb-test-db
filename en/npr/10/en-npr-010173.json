        "If the dispute between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands sounds like very old news, consider that a British warship set sail for the South Atlantic this week as Argentina's president called for boycotts of British goods and protesters threw firebombs at the British embassy in Buenos Aires.",
        "All this as we mark 30 years since Argentine troops invaded the remote island, starting a war that ended with their surrender after 74 days and nearly a thousand dead.",

        "Britain seized the Falklands in 1833, illegal then and illegal now, according to Argentina, which calls them the Malvinas.",
        "Every Argentine school child learns Islas Malvinas son Argentinas, but the roughly 3,200 residents adamantly insist they and the Falklands are and will always be British.",
        "But Jackson Diehl, none of that has changed since the end of the war three decades ago.",
        "Why has this dispute reemerge now?",
        "I think it has to do with Argentine politics more than anything else.",
        "The reason the Argentine junta in 1982, military generals in charge at the time, invaded the Falklands, was they were desperate to distract popular attention from the fact that the economy was tanking and that they were losing their legitimacy.",
        "Now we have a civilian government in power, which, to its credit, doesn't want to invade the Falklands, but it has the same difficult economic problems again and it has the same problems with potentially losing legitimacy at home.",
        "And this is a very easy way to distract people.",
        "This time, though, there is no hint of military action.",
        "There isn't.",
        "And I think the interesting thing about this government is they have cut the Argentine military budget so severely in the last few years that even if Argentina wanted to invade the Falklands, they would be incapable of doing so.",
        "So that's one good thing.",
        "So what does this campaign amount to then besides words?",
        "Well, they're trying to put economic pressure on Britain.",
        "And I think actually the British are a little bit worried about it.",
        "They are stopping cruise ships that come from the Falklands, not allowing them to dock in Argentina.",
        "They are pressuring the Chileans to cut off the one air link between Chile and the Falkland Islands.",
        "They are calling on Argentine manufacturers to cut down on the import of British goods.",
        "And I think the worry is that they will make this into a regional campaign, that they will try and persuade the Brazilians, the Peruvians and others to start putting economic pressure on Britain as well.",
        "And the rallying cry of anti-colonialism has a lot of residents in South America."

        "It does, although what we learned in 1982 was that the rest of South America is willing to verbally support Argentina on this but not much more, because I think they, like the rest of the world, are kind of puzzled by this Argentine claim and by the claim of the de-colonialization of a place that has 3,000 residents, all of whom wish to remain British.",
        "And that is the opposite claim - the Brits say no one Argentinian has lived there for, what, 180 years now, and this is self-determination.",
        "The people who live on the islands get to vote who they want to stay with.",
        "That's right.",
        "The irony here is that before the war in 1982, the British were thinking about handing it over against the wishes of the people on the island.",
        "They were basically prepared to sell them out because it was too expensive to hang onto the place.",
        "But the war has stiffened their spine so much that I think it would never politically be considered, at least not in our lifetime, again, for the British to hand it back, unless the islanders say they want to.",
        "Unless the islanders say they want to.",
        "More about that in just a minute.",
        "But there's another calculation that has changed - the discovery of oil and gas off the coast of South America and indeed off the coast of the Falkland Islands.",

        "And of course we don' know yet how commercially exploitable it's going to be.",
        "But there has been a strike, and it could be something quite substantial.",
        "And I think that gives the Argentines actually a more tangible reason than just populism to pursue this because they're potentially out a lot of oil if they lose their sovereignty claim.",
        "So there is oil - the Argentines have also threatened to make life difficult for any of the companies that rush in to try to develop the fields around the Falklands.",
