        "Did you worry that you would be, you know, East Coast media leap flaunting in and poking fun at how people in flyover country go crazy for Christmas?",
        "Which sounds like a lot.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the curious thing about this is a little bit self-defeating because, you know, the Argentines have their own large coast, which - for oil, which has not really been explored.",
        "They also have very large shale deposits on land, some of the largest in the world, which are going to require about $25 billion to exploit and which Argentine companies don't have the capital before.",
        "So you would think that Argentina would want to be attracting foreign companies to come and explore in its waters to develop its own shale deposits.",
        "But this kind of hostility that was happening in the Falklands, I think, tends to do just opposite to drive investors away.",
        "And you mentioned that unless the islanders vote themselves to change their status, nothing much is going to happen.",
        "And the same is true - Britain, in some ways, might prefer to turn Gibraltar over to the Spanish.",
        "In some ways, it might prefer to turn Northern Ireland over to Ireland.",
        "But like the Falkland Islands, nothing is going to change unless the people there want it to change.",
        "That's right.",
        "They could give us Bermuda for that matter, which is just similar to the Falkland Islands in some ways.",
        "But, of course, then, yes.",
        "Then the Falkland Islanders are never going to decide on union with Argentina unless they're somehow persuaded by the Argentines.",
        "And the interesting thing about this is before the war in 1982, the Argentines are pursuing a much smarter policy.",
        "They created a lot of links with the Falkland Islanders.",
        "They invited them to come to Argentina.",
        "They sold them goods.",
        "They let their kids come to school in Buenos Aires.",
        "And you could see a process where, over time, the Islanders might decide it was in their interest to be part of a country that was only a few hundred miles away instead of a country that was 8,000 miles away.",
        "And with this whole policy of boycott and hostility, they're just driving them away.",
        "And is this, to some degree, a byproduct also of that teaching in every Argentine classroom that this is a grievance that goes back nearly 200 years?",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "And - well, it makes it easy for the government to play on this because, you know, one of the things I found astounding when I was there as a correspondent 30 years ago is that public opinion turns so suddenly on this issue.",
        "People who are absolutely angry with the military government couldn't wait to throw them out the minute the invasion happened, turned into passionate defenders of the government.",
        "There really is, and as odd as it seems, very powerful, strong, emotional feeling about this in Argentina.",
        "The Argentine military did not fight badly but was severely outclassed.",
        "In a way, I don't think Argentina expected Britain to fight for the Falkland Islands.",
        "There was a fight.",
        "It was decisive in the end.",
        "And the junta crumbled after that as people looked at the debacle of these invasion troops surrendering to the British.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was a wonderful silver lining for Argentina because the - not only that juntas crumbled but the whole tradition of military rule in Argentina crumbled.",
        "For 30 years in Argentina, you had had a military coup approximately every two years, and you had never had a civilian government managed to finish its term for 30 years.",
        "And now, we've had 30 years in which Argentina has basically been a democracy.",
        "No military interventions and no prospect of one ever again.",
        "Because, as you mentioned, in part, the military is considerably smaller than it used to be."

        "As you look ahead, though, is there any prospect that this, well, niceness campaign could begin to bear fruit, that this might seem possible to the Argentine government?",
        "I don't think it's possible for this Argentine government.",
        "They have really committed themselves to this nationalist stance.",
        "They get, you know, they get a cheaper turn on it now, and I think they think short term.",
        "They're not thinking about long term.",
        "They're not really - I doubt they really are that invested in actually trying to recover the Falklands.",
        "It's easier just to use it domestically at home than to embark on a long and patient campaign as the Chinese would do, for example, with Taiwan.",
        "So if it did happen, though, if Argentine companies said, wait a minute.",
        "If you're going to develop these oil fields, we have nearby sources of all this equipment and expertise that may be able to help you.",
        "People could make a lot of money.",
        "Oh, it could be a boon for them.",
        "And, again, you could probably start to attract the same oil companies that are drilling in the Falklands to move over a couple hundred miles and start drilling off the coast of Argentina as well, where there could as well also be supplies of oil.",
        "After all, there's oil off the coast of Brazil.",

        "Why not Argentina?",
        "Now, we have this email from John in Madrid in Spain: Since 2006, at least it's been assumed that Argentina has misreported inflation and GDP statistics to the IMF in order to hide increasingly dire economic situations.",
        "This current conflict over the Falklands just seems to be the Fernandez administration's way of distracting from their real problem.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I was actually meeting with an Argentine journalist this morning.",
        "You know, journalists in Argentina are prosecuted now if they try and report the real inflation rate, which is about 10 or 20 percent higher than the rate that the government wants to report.",
        "Yet, there was real economic progress after a debacle of default several years ago."

        "Well, that - yes, some economic progress.",
        "They managed their domestic economy managed to recover because they were able to devalue after that default.",
        "But they've been struggling - starting to struggle now because Argentina has a very severe balance of payments problem.",
        "They do not get foreign financing.",
        "They have never made peace with the world's financial markets, never made peace with the Paris Club, never made peace with the IMF, and so they cannot obtain external financing for their economy.",
        "And so it makes it more and more difficult to import and makes it more and more difficult to invest.",

        "And so they have some problems that have been building up that would have been very difficult to contain in the next couple of years.",

        "Well, Prince William was there.",
        "And the dispatch of this warship, again, the British say, routine to send a ship like this.",
        "They don't - the Royal Navy is not what it once was either to the South Atlantic and the Argentine's (unintelligible) militarization.",
        "Well, I think it is relatively routine in the sense the British usually do have a ship there just as a deterrence.",
        "Now, whether or not they decided to dispatch a new one just to send a message to the Argentines that they were still committed to the defense of the place or not, I don't know.",
        "But, you know, when you have all this - the campaign going on, the British were taken totally by surprise in April 1982, and I think they want to make sure that doesn't happen again.",
        "And I wonder how the anniversary has played into this, listening to various BBC broadcasts of British soldiers meeting up with their Argentine counterparts in refighting the Battle of Goose Green and various other things.",
        "Has that played into this at all?",
        "Well, perhaps, a little bit.",
        "You know, there is some sort of lobby in Argentina of soldiers who fought in the war and felt very much betrayed by the junta at the time, and they - I think, that to some extent, they'd been a positive influence in which they are anti-militarist.",
        "But they also helped to keep the cause alive and helped to keep the country focused on this problem that really shouldn't be a problem.",
        "So a lost cause like other lost causes can have an effect long after a defeat?",
        "Exactly.",
        "As you look ahead to the - it doesn't seem that this is going to resolve.",
