        "And at first, it was just sort of a good way for a performer to get a little bit of extra money at the holidays.",
        "But what actually blew me away was round about the second or third year, I noticed I was getting a lot of repeat audience members.",
        "And at one point, people were saying, you know, this is our cousin from California, we brought them here, you know, for the holidays and we all came to see this like we do every year.",
        "And it - I just kind of all of a sudden realized, oh, my gosh, I am now part of this family's let's all pile into the car and go do this holiday thing.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Arriving at destination.",
        "And I just felt this massive weight of responsibility all of sudden.",
        "You know, I was just kind of like in it for the lark and then the show really kind of meant that much more to me at that point...",
        "Right.",
        "...because I just - I was like, wow, this is what they do.",
        "I am what they do.",

        "That David Sedaris material on Christmas has been with us now, if you think about it, for 14, 15 years.",
        "And it filled an incredible void that had existed up until then as far as snarky Christmas goes.",
        "People really need a valve to sort of affirm some of the contradictory feelings that they're having about the part of the holiday that insists that we all be happy, that we all be from perfect families, that nobody is a drunk."

        "And in the last decade and a half has gone from 6,000 people to more than 100,000 people, all of whom are from someone else, very much like Frisco, a big box store, mall world kind of town.",
        "And Jeff realized that these places are sort of bereft of anything that feels like tradition or authenticity.",
        "You've got your Olive Garden and Red Lobster and all the comforts, but you don't have the sense that we've always been here and we've always done something this way.",

        "My feelings about Christmas are that sort of the crazy, commercial, crowded, Black Friday kind of parts of it are actually more in line with the very ancient solstice festivals that created Christmas, which were street riots, you know, party, Girls Gone Wild, Mardi Gras, Halloween - all of that sort of rolled into one was Christmas originally, before the Victorians got a hold of it.",
        "After the Puritans got rid of it, you know, what we came out with was this sweet, lovely, tender, home and hearth Christmas.",
