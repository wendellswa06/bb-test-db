        "Yes, he should be worried.",
        "He did brag on Saturday that Republicans have won all five special elections for House seats this term.",
        "And that is true, except the Democrats have been overperforming everywhere.",
        "And he didn't mention that Doug Jones won the Senate race in Alabama.",
        "But if Democrats turn out in big numbers, this could be disappointing for the president, especially in a white, working-class, very Trumpy district like this.",
        "And you can tell how worried Republicans are because the chairman of the state Republican Party is already calling this district a Democratic district because it has a slight Democratic registration edge, even though a Republican has won the last eight elections in this district.",
        "So interesting.",
        "I mean, a Democratic edge that is slight - it's been so reliably Republican.",
        "So talk about why we think Conor Lamb, the Democrat, is competitive right now.",
        "Conor Lamb is competitive because instead of going to the left, the Democrats nominated someone who fits the district, like Doug Jones in Alabama or Ralph Northam in Virginia.",
        "He's conservative on guns.",
        "He doesn't support Nancy Pelosi.",
        "He personally opposes abortion.",
        "So that's one of the reasons.",
        "Also, the president is unpopular, even in this kind of district, and that's never good for his party.",
        "So is that why both parties are pouring so much money - I mean, millions of dollars - into this one race - because there's a feeling that it could kind of set some broader narrative for this election year?",
        "Well, that's true because it won't change the dynamics in the House.",
        "This is a district like Brigadoon, that fictional Scottish town that disappeared in the mist.",
        "Because of the gerrymandering decision by the courts in Pennsylvania...",
        "(Laughter) It's not going to physically disappear.",
        "...This district is not going to exist.",
        "No, but this district is not going to exist in November.",
        "It's going to - the districts will have whole - all new boundaries and voters.",
        "But this is the only thing going on right now, very important to both sides.",
        "The results will be interpreted as an indicator or not of a wave.",
        "And Republicans are worried if they lose, there'll be more retirements.",
        "It'll be a test of whether Donald Trump can help Republicans when he's not on the ballot.",
        "So this race is very symbolic, and it's very psychological.",
        "Also, interesting just to note that Axios reported over the weekend that President Trump has been privately attacking Saccone, calling him a bad and weak candidate - so clearly trying to lower expectations here in case they don't win.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "you're quite welcome."

        "The deal was about the future of mobile connections.",
        "Qualcomm and Broadcom both make computer chips, and Qualcomm specifically makes chips for hand-held computers that we call smartphones."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, does that - does this race to 5G, is that - does that tell us something about why this takeover is being seen potentially as a national security problem?",

        "Qualcomm is a huge industry leader in wireless.",

        "So when a Singapore-based company like Broadcom comes in with a hostile takeover and says, we want to buy your American chipmaker whether they want it or not, a lot of red flags go off.",
        "And one of them is, what if the new foreign owners cut costs and investments at Qualcomm and don't keep advancing to 5G?",
        "So then at some point, the Chinese competitors might become the only available option.",
        "Ah.",
        "Oh, it's so interesting.",
