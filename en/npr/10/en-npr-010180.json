        "It was routine for both white and black miners to be killed.",
        "And indeed, the level of accidents in South African mines has always been very high.",
        "That's partly because many of the mines are very deep and conditions therefore are more difficult.",
        "But it was also based on the notion that, because black labor was plentiful, they were, in a sense, expendable.",
        "There was no real, proper welfare system employed for black labor.",
        "The conditions were extremely difficult and dangerous.",
        "And indeed in many cases, they still continue to be.",

        "You don't have a strong through line.",
        "Is that because you couldn't find these voices or because you chose not to have them in there?",
        "Well, what I was trying to describe was this titanic struggle basically between the British and the Boers, which settled the fate of South Africa.",
        "And all the way through that period, the 40-year period really from 1870 to 1910, the indigenous black population played a subsidiary role in the making of South Africa.",
        "The people who were the protagonists were essentially the British and the Boers and it's not that the voices of the blacks cannot be found, but in this great titanic struggle between the British and the Boers, they were forced to play a secondary role.",
        "And it's just the way that history worked out, as it were.",
        "What has been the impact of the rush for diamonds and gold on the whole future of the region?",
        "I know this covers a very specific point in time ending in 1910, but as you look at today's South Africa and if you look at today's diamond industry, today's international relations, what did this period do to the fate of the world?",
        "South Africa was, and still is today, the richest state in Africa.",
        "It has used its riches, in some ways, to enforce white supremacy through the 20th century.",
        "But it has also enabled South Africa to gain a very well-established infrastructure of everything from kind of power stations to railways to roads and so on.",
        "It has provided the basis for a highly prosperous and well-run state.",
        "And the wealth from diamonds and gold today is far more equitably shared and much of it goes towards restoring, if you like, the rights of blacks.",
        "The diamond monopoly that Cecil Rhodes founded, De Beers, still today plays a hugely important role in the marketing of diamonds.",
        "And indeed, it is the most famous name still associated with diamond mining.",
        "If you ignore the pain and turmoil of the history, diamonds and gold are of huge benefit provided the revenues from them are well used.",
        "And in South Africa's case, that does apply.",
        "In many other areas of Africa, diamonds are used to enrich local factions, they become the basis of military conflict, they are used as contraband, and where they are not properly regulated, they are the cause of an enormous amount of harm and damage.",
