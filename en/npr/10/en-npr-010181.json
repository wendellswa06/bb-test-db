        "His lead in the state, Alex, is down from double digits to single digits.",
        "And seems to have been dwindling in recent days.",
        "And he has been suffering there, much as he has been elsewhere, from the big distraction in the media over the Jeremiah Wright controversy.",
        "At the same time, Hillary Clinton has been making a strong appeal to working-class voters.",
        "And remember that the state population in North Carolina, while it is more than 20 percent African-American, and while those voters are concentrated in the Democratic party, they're not a majority of the Democratic party.",
        "You mentioned the media and the Jeremiah Wright controversy.",
        "There was a Frank Rich column in the New York Times over the weekend that argued Senator John McCain hasn't been scrutinized over his endorsement by another controversial religious leader, John Hagee, nearly as much as Obama has been about his connection to Pastor Wright.",
        "Is there a disparity there?",
        "There seems to have been a huge disparity, actually, and also a lot of reasons for it.",
        "First of all, I haven't seen any video yet, and maybe it's still going to emerge, of John Hagee saying some of the crazy stuff that he has been quoted as saying, like, for example, blaming gay people in New Orleans for Hurricane Katrina.",
        "So we don't have all of that material to deal with on television played over and over.",
        "Just as important, his relationship to John McCain is really rather limited.",
        "McCain asked for his endorsement this year and he got it.",
        "And he probably now regrets it, but it's not like the guy was his personal minister for 20 years.",
        "Now let's move on to the gas tax.",
        "There's that poll out today from CBS News and the New York Times.",
        "It shows only 20 percent of those surveyed say they think it will actually provide some relief to Americans.",
        "Seventy percent say these gas tax proposals are just a way to help out the candidates politically.",
        "So, how will all this gas tax talk play out in these contests tomorrow?",
        "It's entirely a political gesture.",
        "It's a way of saying we feel your pain, and we care.",
        "And we think the government is partially at fault for this.",
        "And it's also a wonderful way of isolating Barack Obama as some kind of an elitist who cares only about what experts say, or what economists say, because he opposes getting rid of this for a few months, this eighteen cents.",
        "And he actually sets out these figures for how little it would save people.",
        "So, some people are going to see this, perhaps, as exploiting the legitimate anger at gas prices in a manipulative way.",
        "And if so, there could be a backlash benefit for Obama.",
        "Ron, with these contests tomorrow, what are you keeping an eye on?",
        "Everyone expects that Hillary Clinton will win Indiana, and that Barack Obama will win North Carolina.",
        "If there's any change in that, if one or the other should win both, or if they should flip which state they win, that's going to require a lot of analysis since it's going to have a lot more of an effect.",
        "Apart from that, people will just be looking at the margins, seeing whether or not the one win in Indiana, say, for Clinton is big enough to be a surprise.",
        "Or whether or not the margin in North Carolina is so small for Obama it is going to be a major discouragement.",

        "Thousands of children are currently fleeing Central America and crossing illegally into the U.S.",
        "So many kids have made the journey in the last two months that federal agencies are turning to Texas charities to help house the teens, mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.",
        "The numbers had been going down after a peak in the summer of 2014, when tens of thousands of kids sought refuge in the U.S.",
        "An enforcement crackdown in Mexico is credited with the drop.",
        "I was reporting on that story this past summer when I met 17-year-old Jorge Barrera.",
        "He had just tried to make it to the U.S.",

        "Well, you know, there's immigration hawks who think that this shouldn't be happening, that the government should take care of this on the border, and they shouldn't have to accommodate women and children.",
        "But in terms of the local communities, Carrie, there's just been a real generous outpouring.",
        "You know, a lot of churches have put together baskets of presents for these kids.",
        "And in one of these places, they actually had some professional soccer players from Dallas come down and give them lessons in, you know, kicking the ball.",
        "And so generally there's been a real welcoming attitude.",
        "That's interesting because it was revealed this past week that immigration officials are planning a massive deportation of unauthorized migrant families who've also made the journey from Central America.",
        "So why does the government treat families differently than kids who come on their own?",
        "What - it sounds like a disconnect there.",
        "Well, children are different.",
        "When you're 17 and under, Health and Human Services takes care of you when you come here.",
        "And so under court order, they have to, you know, have medical care, counselors and so many meals and snacks.",
        "If you are an adult with a child, it's the Department of Homeland Security that takes care of you, which is a police agency.",
        "And so there have been these very controversial family detention centers in South Texas, where there have been hunger strikes.",
        "And so now we have this report that the government is going to crack down on these mothers and children who were turned down for asylum and, you know, round them up and send them back.",
        "And so a lot of the immigrant advocates are screaming about that.",
        "But, as you say, the insurance company in question and their fire marks, their signs were quite distinctive and quite elaborate.",
        "I've seen one that was two hands clasped, another is four hands clasped making a square of wrist, a tree, a fire engine.",
        "The company in question might make an award to the fire brigade that actually succeeded in putting out the fire.",
        "They very well might have.",
        "And chances are they would have already funded the fire company via a subscription.",
        "So the fire company itself would have received a hundred or $200 as a donation from that insurance company."

        "Now, I read this today - and you tell me if there's any truth to it - that sometimes competitive fire brigades in their zeal to be the one to put out fire, maybe to get an award or be backed by an insurer, might actually have played a little defense against another competing fire company.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They would race to the fires.",
        "This reflected community tensions of the era, as well as a sort of manly pride in being first not only to get to the scene, but first to put the fire out.",
        "Now, this was typically pre-Civil War in America.",
        "How is it that the nation's first municipal fire department was in Cincinnati, Ohio?",
        "Well, my work is largely about Philadelphia and this story was true in nearly every city, where fire insurance companies really wanted more regular fire protection.",
        "They no longer trusted the volunteer fire companies and really pushed for a more formal paid occupation, just as you might see in a factory of the same period.",
        "So this was a case of professionalization of an activity that had been a voluntary expression of communal goodwill and manliness, as you say, before that.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And one of the ways fire insurance companies did this is by encouraging the use of new technologies, like steam engines, which, ironically, the firefighters themselves wanted, because their ability to use and command and create technology was part of their expression of community spirit.",
        "When you heard about this story in Tennessee and the man whose house burnt down, what's your reaction to it in terms of the history of fire brigades in the U.S.?",
        "And what surprised me in the Tennessee case is that that whole iconography from the early republic seems to have been lost in this sense of quid quo pro - if you give me money, I will protect you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That eagle in one of those fire marks that I've seen, that's no coincidence.",
