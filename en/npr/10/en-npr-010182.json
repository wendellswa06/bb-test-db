        "And I think it sends a message that if you contribute to our society, you should benefit from our society.",
        "Now you're correct that immigrants pay taxes, and even people who are here without legal status often end up paying taxes.",
        "And yet, you can see the objection to that.",
        "Why should someone who is here illegally be able to claim Medicare, to claim Social Security, who knows what else?",

        "I think that what we can do is we can tighten up our systems and increase accountability.",
        "But what this says is that we will not discriminate solely based on immigration status.",
        "Well, that's really interesting because this is a talking point of President Trump.",
        "Illegal immigrants, as he would phrase it, are costing us money, they're using up all these services, we can't afford them, we're paying for them throughout their lives.",

        "If we passed it, it would merely express the sense of Congress to meet these ambitious goals.",
        "And so if it were passed, I think it would be a profound action by the House to acknowledge the crisis.",
        "But I think the conversation that the Green New Deal sparked - like, if I had to decide, would I rather have the resolution passed, or would I have rather preferred we start a national conversation about the urgency of the climate crisis, I would have chosen the latter every single time.",

        "When you made that critique of your party, that your party's inaction was getting to be more scandalous than the president himself, where does Speaker Pelosi fit in that critique?",
        "Well, I think where we have to see is that we have to be very careful about where the balance of the party is.",
        "So being a speaker is not - I don't think it's a very enviable job.",
        "You're kind of herding cats.",

        "I think the balance of the caucus doesn't do that.",
        "But I think - that I think is the issue.",
        "See, the thing that's tough is that you have a scale.",
        "Like, if the speaker is acting as a scale, we also need to add more weight to the progressive caucus.",
        "Is that why you have been supporting some primary challenges of existing Democratic lawmakers?",
        "Yeah, I think that's definitely one rationale for it.",
