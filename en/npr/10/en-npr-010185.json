        "The problem is in some cases like his is that the detainees do not want to go.",

        "I mean, there are very genuine concerns that he could be tortured or abused or somehow persecuted.",

        "Their home countries, their countries where they had taken up residence before they were captured do not want them back.",
        "So these are just one of the many challenges that the Pentagon is trying to face as they clear the numbers.",
        "Now Human Rights Watch - a spokesman for Human Rights Watch today put out a statement celebrating this decision, saying it's the first time that a court has stopped the Pentagon from transferring one of these detainees back to where it wanted them to go.",

        "Well, it is for the human rights community and certainly for the detainees as well, but it's not a definitive ruling by any stretch of the imagination.",
        "This is a temporarily blocking, a temporary injunction.",

        "If the Supreme Court decides that they cannot do it, then the prisoners don't have any rights.",
        "And in fact, in that case, by extension, somebody like Mr. Rahman would be sent back to Tunisia.",
        "So it's sort of an interim decision right now.",
        "And frankly, the Justice Department has come out and said, look, we don't think Judge Kessler has jurisdiction in this, you know, in this argument as well, so it is by no means the end of the story here."
