        "What's that?",
        "Each new administration comes in, and they change the priorities of the last administration.",
        "And therefore, a new group of cases has moved to the front of the docket.",
        "And the cases that are the oldest that should be heard are moved to the back of the docket.",
        "So some cases - and particularly ones that don't fit into anybody's priorities - basically never get heard because they just keep getting displaced by new priorities.",
        "And, of course, the priorities change - not only with each administration.",
        "But sometimes within an administration, the priorities change several times.",
        "So that disrupts dockets."
