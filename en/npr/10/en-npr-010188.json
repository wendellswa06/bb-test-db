        "Well, it's less than 60 days till Election Day, and he wants to get Democrats and independents to come out and vote for Democratic candidates.",

        "Well, polls for the House - at least the generic ballot, which is like a national vote for the House, shows that Democrats have the potential to take the House back.",
        "But what was surprising last week was there was a bunch of polls for the Senate that showed Democratic incumbents in red states like Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee, states where Trump won sometimes by double digits, holding their own.",
