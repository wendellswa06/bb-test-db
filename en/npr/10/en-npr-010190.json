        "So, what Congress has done is improve the program to encourage more lenders to use it.",
        "I think as it was structured before, it was so onerous for lenders that they would have been more likely to foreclose rather than put people in the program.",

        "Well, so, why didn't Congress come up with something that both lenders and homeowners would like?",

        "Banks do not want to own your house.",
        "That's why we consistently urge borrowers: if they think they can't make their payments, to get into a housing counselor to help them understand what their alternative are, give HUD a call, and go into the bank to say, I need to work out a better solution, because banks should be prepared to find a middle ground if there's something that can be reached.",
        "But I have to say in a lot of interviews that we've done, and in fact, the family that we just heard from, they try to renegotiate their loans with the banks, and the banks seem unwilling to do so.",
