        "Two and a Half Men,\"\" he's no longer in it.",
        "The hostility to women in that is totally undisguised.",
        "I mean, there are hookers in that show, and he sleeps with a different person every night.",
        "And all the women are very stupid, including his mother, and played for laughs.",
        "And so you get the feeling that in that show, men are still kings of their own domain even though they're technically losers, alcoholics and don't have jobs, whereas in these new shows, you really are in a woman's world.",
        "So whether you have moments of hostility, I think the overall point is that it's a woman's world now.",
        "Here's an e-- a tweet, rather, from Triangle Man: More pervasive still are the ads.",
        "There are very few men shown as anything other than uninformed buffoons or sports-obsessed.",
        "You know, one of the first inspirations - thank you for tweeting that - of my story when I originally wrote it was the Super Bowl ads.",
        "You would think that the Super Bowl would be the one time when men could be whatever they wanted and portray themselves as anything they wanted.",
        "And we had a series of ads in which the men were just utterly pathetic.",
        "And this was two years running, now, that we have these loser men ads in the Super Bowl.",
        "So that really brought home the point for me.",
        "If anything's going to be responsive to the zeitgeist, it's going to be the ads.",

        "We're talking with Hanna Rosin, author of \"\"Primetime's Looming Male Identity Crisis,\"\" a piece that she wrote in Atlantic - that spins off \"\"The End of Men,\"\" which she wrote in The Atlantic and was cited by a lot of sitcom producers in their pitch meetings at CBS, at least, according to a CBS executive quoted in an article in The Wall Street Journal.",
        "Do our sitcoms tell us about reality?",

        "Hello.",
        "Yes.",
        "I just wanted to ask the author if she watched the series \"\"Men of a Certain Age.\"\" I know that some of the sitcoms seem to depict men at a certain time in their lives and really kind of dumb down the whole male experience.",
        "But I think that particular show that was created by Ray Romano is really more distinctive, at least, in my lifestyle right now.",
        "I am Christian here in Oklahoma City, and I find myself really dependent on male bonding as far as to get me through, you know, given these hard economic times.",
        "I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "All right, Jason.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "That, of course, is sort of a dramedy but certainly had its comedic elements.",
        "The show has since been canceled.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm so glad you brought that up because that show is much more sensitive, and I actually think that these shows that I'm describing are so unbelievably heavy-handed on this theme that they might lay off a little bit.",
        "They might become a little more gentle and just revert to sitcoms that are about family dynamics, some of which are male loser, dumber guys playing video games, but if they're going to succeed, a little bit like say \"\"Cheers\"\" did where you had ups and downs with both the men and the women.",
        "But that's a really good example.",
        "Thanks for bringing that up."

        "But these shows are white, white, white.",
        "And I think, partly, the sociological phenomenon, what people talk about is, oh, it's creeping up into the white middle class or it's creeping up into even the white upper class, these new sets of dynamics.",
        "And so people are actually newly interested, I'm sorry to say to the caller, in the white experience of these phenomenon.",
        "And so I'm not sure it's going to get any better.",
        "It does raise the question, though, which you raise in your piece, who is going to watch them?",
        "Well, I wonder about that.",
        "I wonder what a man would feel like, because when I watched \"\"Two and a Half Men\"\" and Charlie Sheen again to write the story, I sort of reacquainted myself with the sitcom, and I thought - immediately, I thought, oh, I get why guys watch this show.",
        "There's something deeply satisfying.",
        "If you're feeling like a loser, well, you can console yourself in seeing Charlie Sheen do all his antics and get all these women.",
        "You don't really have that kind of consolation in these shows.",
        "I'm not sure where you'd find it, unless it's just - and having your own experience reflected in that is interesting enough."
