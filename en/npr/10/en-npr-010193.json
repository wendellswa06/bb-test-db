        "And these people in the June 13th Nature Geoscience say that there could be there could have been an ocean that formed this region like this, and it would've been I'm sorry I'm going to use meters - but it's a 550-meter-deep ocean if we spread across the entire planet.",
        "But there's other people, however, who say that, you know, from the chemical evidence, if there was water, you ought to see a lot of minerals that were altered by water, clays, like the clays we have at the bottom of the ocean."

        "And he just keeps saying that the mineral evidence, the clays and minerals are just they are there on Mars but not in large amounts.",
        "And there's a mineral called olivine, which is very, very susceptible to being altered by water and changed into other compounds, but there is a lot of olivine on Mars, and that would indicate, well, maybe there wasn't water because there shouldn't be so much olivine there if there was an ocean.",
        "So people agree that 3.5 billion years ago or so, there was some water, but it's not clear how much.",
        "What people are telling me, too, is that the Mars Science Laboratory, which is supposed to be launched in late 2011 and land on Mars in 2012, that they should pick a place where there is a little bit of this chemical evidence and, you know, look around there, dig around there, and maybe that may really help settle the question.",
        "Or go some of these places, again, where there was localized water, and look for life there.",
