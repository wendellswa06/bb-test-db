        "Right.",
        "No, no, it's just that people are I think there's this tension, as I said, between all these wonderful-looking, intriguing, dried-up riverbeds and deltas and things that look like much bigger than our Grand Canyon - that presumably were carved by water on Mars, and yet we don't see the chemical compounds pervasively that we think should be there.",
        "Now, some people say that, you know, Mars was so much blanketed over by lava that we don't have a whole lot of windows deep down to where these water-altered minerals may be hiding, and maybe that's the answer.",
        "Maybe it is more widespread, and we just don't see it because we don't have that many places where more recently, asteroids gouged into the surface and exposed these regions.",
        "But again, that's why they're saying, you know...",
        "You've got to go there and...",
        "You've got to go there, and you've got pick a really great place for the lander.",
        "The Mars Rovers that are there are not made to do that?",
        "That's right.",
        "They're not I mean, they are they're just more very much on the surface, and they don't, they can just sort of scratch the surface a bit.",
        "They do go to places where there have been excavations, and they have found definitely some evidence of water sulfates, which are water-altered minerals.",
        "But we'd now like to go to a place where these phyllosilicates, as they call them, have really been exposed by big impact craters.",
        "Would they be easily landable places, or would we be taking a chance?",
        "That might be somewhat of a challenge, but I think that there - but some of these places I think are on NASA's target list, or there are planetary scientists telling NASA that these would be interesting places to take a look, and it would be worth it to consider it as candidates, candidate landing sites, yes."
