        "Hey, Lulu.",
        "Geoff, today there's just been a statement from the White House after the president got a lot of criticism for his original remarks.",
        "It says - and I'm reading now.",
        "It says, quote, \"\"the president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all form of violence, bigotry and hatred.",
        "And, of course, that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.",
        "He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together.",
        "Am I right that this is coming from an unnamed spokesman at the White House?",
        "That's right.",
        "This is not attributed to the president himself - the White House has scheduled a press conference, a previously scheduled press conference, for tomorrow.",
        "We'll see if they carry through with that.",
        "And if they do, you can imagine the president will be asked to say this on his own because it's not just the Republicans you mentioned.",
        "It's other Senate Republicans in leadership and, of course, a number of Democrats who say that the president's response so far has been tepid and entirely insufficient.",
        "And, you know, the president's apparent refusal to take these racist groups head-on is really raising questions because, as you say, he's not typically one who reserves his opinion.",
        "And we've seen it in just this past week.",
        "He used his Twitter account to slam, you know, media outlets he doesn't like and even the top Republican in the Senate, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.",
        "Why hasn't the president explicitly condemned the actions of white supremacists, do you think?",
        "Well, I think because whether he likes it or not, white supremacist and alt-right groups are part of the president's base of support.",
        "And the president's critics say he's reluctant or entirely unwilling to alienate that segment of his coalition.",
        "And you'll remember, during the presidential election, this came up in that he initially did not disavow support from white supremacists and former KKK leader David Duke.",
        "He did so following some public pressure.",
        "And, you know, Duke marched yesterday.",
        "David Duke was there at the protests yesterday.",
        "Indeed he was.",
        "And he tied the protests directly to President Trump - said the protests were inspired by him.",
        "All right.",
        "Just briefly, there was a lot of tough talk this week, though.",
        "Earlier this week, the president let loose on North Korea.",

        "Well, the president himself says emphatically there are no mixed messages coming from his administration on North Korea.",
        "And he said - remember - that the threat of raining fire and fury down on North Korea maybe wasn't strong enough.",
        "So the president believes that this brand of tough talk is necessary since, as he sees it, all of the many efforts by the last three our four presidential administrations have all been ineffective.",

        "So the two of you wrote a book called \"\"No More Clueless Sex.\"\" Of course, that is something that I probably should have had even before it was published.",
