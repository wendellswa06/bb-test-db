        "Last Friday was a big day for Bennett College.",
        "It was announced that the school lost its appeal to save its accreditation.",
        "Within hours, though, Bennett revealed it was filing a lawsuit against the accrediting body, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, or SACS.",
        "During these legal proceedings, Bennett will remain accredited.",
        "President Phyllis Worthy Dawkins says the community is experiencing mixed emotions right now.",
        "The students, faculty and staff and alumni are taking it hard and rightfully so.",
        "We need to give them space to internalize that, yes, it's bad news and good news on the same day.",
        "We are accredited, and we need to give them that time to vent their frustrations.",
        "Bennett has been fighting the accreditation battle since 2016, when it was put on probation due to a lack of financial resources.",
        "The school has struggled with declining enrollment, and as a private institution, it's heavily dependent on incoming tuition.",
        "Instead of taking the school off of probation in December of 2018, SACS voted to remove Bennett's accreditation.",
        "The school appealed the decision.",
        "To strengthen its case, the college mounted a giant fundraising effort called Stand With Bennett.",
        "The campaign gained national attention and ultimately raised more than $9 million, well over the goal of 5 million.",
        "School officials also outlined other steps forward, including a five-year strategic plan.",
        "The mood was upbeat when final fundraising numbers came in.",
        "Many thought this would be enough to convince the creditors, but it wasn't.",
        "In Friday's decision, the appeals committee said Bennett had failed to show resources that demonstrate a stable financial base.",
        "The lawsuit doesn't come as too much of a surprise.",
        "President Phyllis Worthy Dawkins had said throughout the appeals process that if the school lost, it would pursue legal action.",
        "Board of Trustees chair and State Senator Gladys Robinson says the fight is worth it and so is a Bennett education.",
        "I know what it does for young women in terms of building self-esteem, in terms of teaching them how to move broadly across a spectrum of people and issues, et cetera.",
        "Meanwhile, Bennett College is seeking alternate accreditation.",

        "As you've probably heard, Scotland is voting this week on whether or not to break away from the United Kingdom.",
        "Voting by mail has already started and polling stations opened this Thursday.",
        "The race is too close to call, but according to an ICM poll out the last night, the pro-independence campaign is showing a slight lead.",
        "Val McDermid is a best-selling Scottish novelist who's voting for an independent Scotland.",
        "She says interest in independence has been building over several decades.",
        "Well, in 1979, we had another referendum, which was about giving the Scottish people more control over their own affairs.",
        "And so in Scotland, we had power over education and over our health systems for example.",
        "And what's happened, I think, with that is we've had a taste of taking care of our own affairs.",
        "And gradually, there's been a head of steam building up thinking we want more control over our destiny.",
        "In fact, we want total control over our destiny.",
        "And I understand you were kind of wavering, going back and forth.",
        "But in the end, you have come out and written about the fact that you are going to vote yes for independence.",
        "Why?"

        "Well, for a long time, I was what we call in Scotland swithering.",
        "I couldn't make my mind up between which said I was going to vote for.",
        "And part of my problem was that every time I asked a question, I seemed to get completely opposing answers from both sides.",
        "Would we still be members of the European Union or not?",
        "Would we be able to use the pound or not?",

        "But when you're looking out of those helicopters, I can tell you, Melissa, you see cornfields that are flattened and tree stands that are so lacerated there's nothing left on them.",
        "I'm thinking about the destruction from Hurricane Florence here in the States and in the Carolinas.",
        "Most of the deaths - more than 40 people so far - have been from flooding.",
        "That's been the main problem.",
        "What about where you are in the Philippines?",
        "Well, you know, we flew over flooded rice fields.",
        "But in this city - I'm in the capital - and, in many cities, there's very little evidence to show that there was a massive storm that blew through here.",
        "For example, the power's back on here.",
        "The streetlights are blazing.",
        "The trees that line the streets are still standing, and there's no trace of flooding here.",
        "And only six people have died.",
        "But the biggest hazard was the winds.",
        "They ripped off roofs of hospitals and homes and buildings.",
        "And the typhoon landed packing 125-mile-an-hour winds.",
        "And the governor, Manuel Mamba, said that they started at 11:00 the night before the typhoon, and they raged until the next afternoon.",
        "And the wind was still strong at 3 p.m. of Saturday.",
        "So that's about almost 16 hours of strong wind.",
        "That's why, the next day, we could not even tell our rescue people to go on to make a rescue, or we could not even start clearing our streets of debris so that we could rescue people - all because of the very strong wind up 'til 3:00 in the afternoon.",
        "You know, Melissa, people talked about these winds being so strong that they felt the earth was moving.",
        "They thought there was an earthquake."

        "It's very important, particularly the residential sector.",
        "We have just gone through a period of unprecedented prosperity in the residential sector.",
        "Last year we estimated in fact that residential expenditures -construction, furnishing, home improvements - was up to 23 percent of the gross domestic product.",

        "While about 75 percent of all whites own their homes, only 50 percent of African-Americans do.",
        "A whole number of trends, Farai, from redlining, discrimination in lending, all kinds of things have kept African-Americans out of the housing market in ways that they've been unhappy about.",
        "And there now is almost a grassroots movement led by groups like the Urban League to help African-Americans buy homes because it's clear that it the bridge from working class to middle class status for so many people.",
        "But aren't those old issues when we think of things like racial covenants, isn't that just a think of the past?",
        "Racial covenants are a thing in the past, Farai, but not redlining, not discrimination lending, and also not the inability to use credit scores discriminatively.",
