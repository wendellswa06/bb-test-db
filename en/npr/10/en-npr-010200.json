        "Now, to sort through what happened, we turn now to NPR's TV critic Eric Deggans.",
        "And, Eric, ABC moved really quickly on this, right?",
        "They sure did.",
        "And they seemed to be sending a message that there was no room for racism amongst the stars or their highest-rated shows.",
        "This was a surprise because \"\"Roseanne,\"\" the revival, was one of the highest-rated shows of the TV season just behind \"\"The Big Bang Theory\"\" in total viewers.",

        "So it is very surprising that they took this move.",
        "Shortly after this tweet went out, Roseanne Barr also sent another tweet that said, I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans.",
        "I'm truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics - referring to Valerie Jarrett and her looks.",

        "What did your new report say about the issue of a bubble?",
        "We do make the observation, which doesn't seem obvious if you think of the last two years, that indeed we've had situations where prices do fall.",
