        "So what does that mean for the community on a whole?",
        "Do we see ourselves to a great degree on the economic front as an invisible community?",
        "I mean, you suggest that traditional economic indicators are good.",
        "The White House will tell you in November 215,000 jobs were added to the rolls.",
        "Yet in some cities, we see for black men, specifically, unemployment as high as 50 percent in many urban areas.",
        "Absolutely, and for black people.",
        "Let me focus on that 215,000 number for a moment, as well.",
        "The Economic Policy Institute has indicated based on some projections that the Bush administration made two years ago when they began their tax-cutting cycle that in order to justify the tax cuts, we had to be able to create at least 300,000 jobs a month.",
        "Last month we created 215,000, and that was the best performance that we'd seen in quite a while.",
        "In several months in 2004, I might note near election month, we also got close to 300,000, but never there.",
        "So we--although the economy seems to be performing, what we need to look at is the people who have dropped out of the labor force, and that's where you'll find those African-American men that you've mentioned.",
        "In New York City, black male, not employed, which would not be technically called unemployment, rate of over 50 percent, and several other inner cities, Detroit among them, rates that high.",
        "When you begin to look at black youth, as well, the non-college-bound youth, you're getting numbers that are Depression-era numbers that policy-makers refuse to deal with.",
        "They prefer to deal with a macroeconomic big picture.",
        "So that 215,000 number, quite frankly, has been celebrated, but it's nothing to celebrate if the benchmark is 300,000.",
        "Let me ask you this: When you hear from President Bush, `We're not going to rest until every American who wants a job can find one'--he said that in a recent speech--and you look at the indicators that you've already alluded to in terms of the market base, particularly for, quote, \"\"unskilled workers,\"\" what does that mean?",
        "Is that more rhetoric than reality?",
        "They were made by a type of bipedal dinosaur called a therapod, which, you know, in much different and much larger scale is, you know, a T-Rex-type creature.",
        "But the individual tracks were between one-and-a-quarter and one-and-a-half centimeters long, meaning that the largest one would fit on a penny.",
        "Wow.",
        "I also, too, have to add in terms of it's not just the music.",
        "I think Dr. Berry is right, a lot of people are listening to the beat.",
        "They couldn't tell you what a song was or wasn't.",
        "They're just nodding their head to it.",
        "But the other part of this is the music videos.",
        "It's the other ancillary things that go along with rock music, rap.",
        "It's the visual content, it's the personas of the artists, and they a lot of times are emulating how these artists dress, how they walk, and how they carry themselves.",
        "So, again, I guess I'm not willing to put all the blame on the music itself.",
        "But I do think it has a big influence in the absence of other, perhaps more positive influences.",
        "The study looked at media in general.",
        "Also talking about wrestling -spiking, if you will - violent tendencies among boys and girls who watch it on a more regular basis.",
        "But, Roland Martin, perhaps I'm a little touchy here because I have a 12-year-old daughter, but it seems to me that Bessie Smith's lyrics, and even the lyrics that you and I grew up on - Marvin Gaye and Prince and the like - were not as outright raunchy as we hear today.",
        "There's a song that many people don't even know about called The Whisper Song.",
        "I can't even repeat it on air."

        "You're right.",
        "It's a difference when Dinah Washington sang Big Long Sliding Thing, and it was sort of very, you know, you was reading between the lines.",
        "But, again, at the same time, Barry White had a song called Take It Off, Take it all off.",
        "You know, so, again, I think the difference today is the proliferation of music with ringtones, with cell phones, with videos where it's all around, with iPods - versus in the past where you had certain music that was suppressed, that was kept under wraps, you know, hidden, you know, from public view.",
        "I think that is the big difference.",
        "But we've always had the sexually explicit lyrics.",
        "But certainly, it is not as aggressive as it is.",
        "You had artists like Gerald Levert and others who said their music is sexual, but it's not as overt as you hear some of the music today because it's just downright, you know, let's just get our freak on.",
        "It's just they just go there.",
        "And so I think that's what the study highlights, is how suggestive the lyrics are and how there's no nuance, there's nothing covert, there's nothing behind the closed door.",
        "It's just wide open, and let's just get our freak on.",
        "That's what it lays out.",
        "Hey, but there's also a danger here that when I asked - at the end of what I said - what do we do about it, even if we assume that it has an influence.",
        "Are we suggesting that we ought to somehow censor the kind of music that is produced, or should parents stop up the ears of their children and their eyes?",
        "What is it that we're saying even if we believe this study without more?",
        "What is it?",
        "I remember when Elvis Presley was on CBS on, what, the Ed Sullivan Show that night, gyrating the first time.",
        "And parents went crazy all across the country.",
        "My child is seeing that.",
        "It's going to make them think about having sex.",
        "I bet you the child had already - if they were going to think about having sex - had already thought about it.",
        "And you do have to have sex with somebody unless you're going to masturbate.",
        "But what is it we're suggesting in this study?",
        "That if the study is true, do we just encourage the non-production of such music?",
        "Do we tell parents not to let their children listen to it and see it?",
        "What do we do?"

        "You know, some kids can handle it, some kids can't.",
        "And really, it goes back to the parents and their participation, I think.",
        "Well, that was what I was talking about, Ed.",
        "I speak on this quite frequently, and I always ask where are their parents?",
        "Because the media has allowed more and more of this music to come into a zone that used to be, I guess, more youth-friendly.",
        "You can hear a lot of this in drive time radio shows when before, a lot of this music was - you couldn't hear it till after midnight.",
        "So now while you're getting ready to go to school or whatever have you, all this stuff is blasting.",
        "Whereas, you know, maybe a decade ago you would've had to stay up late and, you know, maybe disregard what your parents said about going to bed to hear it.",

        "The report is called Visible Invisibility: Women of Color in Law Firms.",
        "And what they're finding - again, no surprise here, Roland Martin - is that many women of color are finding themselves alienated in large law firms, being left out, excluded from golf outings, after hour drinking, networking events.",
        "The study also showed that this isn't necessarily outright bigotry that is happening, but that the partners - usually white males - are finding less in common with these women to connect with.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "I mean, we ran this as a cover story in the Chicago Defender called It's Hard Out Here for a Black Female Lawyer.",
        "And it really highlights that divide there, because, surely they have the skills.",
        "They are qualified.",
        "But it is that bonding, if you will, that also plays a part in terms of how you relate to clients, how you relate to people in the office.",
        "And so a lot of these women are saying, you know, forget it.",
        "I don't even want to deal with it.",
        "Then you have those who are choosing to set up their own law firms.",
        "So this is this is certainly something that the firms need to look at, because when you lose - when you have this kind of talent drain leaving law firms, it hurts not just the firms themselves, but also the clients - people like us - because we don't have the benefit of their expertise, their view of the world in these law firms.",
        "That being said, the best and the brightest, Mary, are also being handed - routinely - inferior assignments, including just reviewing documents, writing briefs, and the like.",
        "This study reflects everything I know about what's happened to young black women.",
        "I know many of these people who have in fact left law firms - major law firms, who have good academic records - who walk away in disgust.",
        "And some of them become very, very, have been successful in business rather than practicing law, although they always had wanted to be a lawyer.",
        "And it's the culture of the firm, it's the old boys' network, it's the assumption on seeing people about what they are - all the stereotypes that we know affect us everywhere else in the world affects what goes on there."

        "Young women have come to me - this study just reflects everything I know, and say I can't find anybody to mentor me in the firm.",

        "One has to wonder if in fact the old boys' network will ever be broken.",
        "Well, I think the main issue that we have to delve into a little deeper is what are we talking about when we say diversity?",
        "I think, you know, we usually get into the topical conversation about race and gender, and then there'll be a workshop and/or a seminar or even in some places a series of them.",

        "If I'm interested in just coming and doing my job and not really having too much interaction with my fellow colleagues, is that good enough for this particular law firm?",
        "And for some firms and corporations, that will be it.",
        "And people who take that stance will benefit or not based on that corporate culture.",
        "If the culture, however, is one that we all need to not just get along and accept each other in some random way, but actually collaborate and be helpful as a total entity - then that will look totally different.",
        "So I'm not suggesting that any of these things that these women have said are not true, because certainly I've dealt with my own share of some of these issues.",
        "But I think that it's not just about mentoring.",
        "I think if I can't find a mentor in this corporation or this law firm, then maybe I need to go somewhere else and see where else I can get help.",
        "I think that for a lot of people - especially I've seen men of other ethnicities - they take some of this, I don't want to say abuse, but I think they're a little harder in terms of saying this is something I want and I'm going to work for it.",
        "And I'm going to do this until I can do something better.",
        "And I think that we might have to get a little harder and be a little more strategic on how we approach these things.",
        "So again, that doesn't let people off the hook.",
        "But I think you - if you want to be a lawyer and you want to get to be a partner, you know the old boys' network is going to stay there as long as we allow it to stay there.",
        "Ed, I have to say this.",
        "The most depressing part in this whole study was when it says that when minority lawyers are in a firm, and they become partners and so on, they don't take any special interest - by and large - in trying to help the other people of color who they see coming in as more junior people."
