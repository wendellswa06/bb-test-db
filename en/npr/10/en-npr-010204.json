        "And this has been seen in other feathered dinosaurs, including a creature called microraptor, and indeed, Archaeopteryx had feathers on its legs.",
        "So several paleontologists told me the fact that this is - seems to be widespread among many species suggests that this four-winged configuration was kind of an important step in the evolution of flight.",

        "Again, it puts the simpler feathers back before the more modern feathers, which are seen on Archaeopteryx.",
