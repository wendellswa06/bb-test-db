        "I mean, look, New York; it's ridiculous.",
        "It's absurd to think of--I mean, New York is a predominantly white city and one would expect that its school population would be predominantly white--same goes for Boston--and it's not.",
        "And what's reflected here is, of course, the fact that there's--America has become, especially urban America, a very unequal society and the schools reflect this inequality.",
        "Upper middle-class and middle-class parents are moving their kids out of the public schools into private schools and are going to the suburbs where blacks are free to go to but cannot afford to go--or most blacks.",
        "Blacks who can afford it go to highly integrated schools or can go to whatever schools they want.",
        "So we're talking about a society which--in which blacks remain disproportionately poor and their poverties reflect--and the same goes for Latinos--in the fact that they go to schools with other poor kids.",

        "One is its presumed educational sort of benefits.",
        "The other is the social benefits.",

        "That has not worked, except in a few cases.",
        "The social benefits are substantial, however.",
        "That is to say, black and whites sort of living together as students do have benefits later on, especially for blacks.",
        "And even when blacks do not improve in their educational skills, it's shown that blacks who went to integrated schools do actually much better later on in life.",
        "I do think that, however, the fundamental problem here is class inequality.",
        "And the question, of course, is the degree to which we can upgrade the amount of funds which are in black schools.",
        "However...",
        "All right.",

        "...having said that...",
        "I've got to stop you there, Professor, because I'm up against the clock.",
        "But it seems what we're looking at here is the idea that class has, to some degree in this country, superceded race.",
