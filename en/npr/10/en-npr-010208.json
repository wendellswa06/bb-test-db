        "I think that the opposition, all along, had hoped to what they say wake up the people of Belarus who've endured a, what amounts to a dictatorship, certainly an authoritarian regime since Lukashenko came to power in '94.",
        "If it's such an authoritarian regime, why haven't the police cracked down?",
        "I think that's a very good question.",
        "And I think even some of the people who are out on the square have been asking that.",
        "It may have a lot to do with the international pressure, certainly from Washington and the European Union, the presence of the journalists who are there, perhaps an effort to just ride out the protest and see if they can, or if the protest will disperse on their own...",
        "There are obvious...",
        "We are planning to stay until this Saturday, until 25th of March, and we expect that much more people will come on Saturday.",
        "It's very traditional day and all protests, big protests, are starting on this day.",
        "...without having to resort to force in order to drive them out.",
        "Having said that, the police there have intimidated a lot of people.",
        "They've arrested a lot of people coming and going from the protests.",
        "They've arrested opposition leaders who they accused of organizing this protest.",
        "And they may try to whittle it away with small arrests of onesies and twosies around the square.",
        "There are obvious parallels to the situation in Ukraine and the capital there, Kiev, after presidential, fraudulent presidential election there.",
        "But after that election, the demonstration seemed to gather a great deal of force, become bigger and bigger.",
        "That's not been the situation at all in Minsk.",
        "Well, you're dealing with two different situations entirely.",
        "Having said that, the Belarusian opposition, represented by Milinkevich, who was elected the leader of an array of political parties and social organizations that are, frankly, tired of this regime.",
        "They took Ukraine as a model.",
        "They really wanted to try to organize this, get people out on the street to protest what everybody knew was going to be a victory for Lukashenko.",
        "The big difference with Ukraine is that even under President Kuchma, there was a semblance political competition.",
        "There were, there was an opposition in the parliament.",
        "There were big businessmen, importantly, who supported the opposition and wanted to see a change in the government, a change in the political system itself.",
        "And in Belarus that simply doesn't exist.",
        "Lukashenko has prosecuted not only the opposition political parties, but also independent businessmen, as well as individual students and so forth.",
        "I mean the control that Belarus has over civil society or political opposition is hard to overstate.",
        "At the same time, President Lukashenko is fairly, pretty popular there, and the economy is doing pretty well."

        "Well, there are two things to say about that.",

        "A lot people there will point out that it's largely due to subsidized gas and oil from Russia.",
        "He does retain popularity.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...nonetheless.",
        "And the question really is, is how deep is that support?",
        "And I think that's something that really is hard to measure when there's very little independent media, certainly none on television, and there's very little debate that it does take place.",
        "I went to a little village outside of Minsk and found people, seemingly genuinely, supportive of the situation.",
        "But it's fair also to say, as the opposition does, that a lot of that support is maintained by a system of pervasive fear and intimidation.",
        "Hmm.",

        "And some of these students are actively involved, and they're limited to what they can say in class.",
        "And I was just wondering to what extent the internet is censored, as far as how wide spread, how many people have access to it, and what can they access when they use it?",
        "My understanding on the internet is that there's, that it exists.",
        "There are opposition sites, independent sites, if you will.",
        "There is a great deal of harassment of those sites.",
        "And in fact, on Election Day several of the most popular, most prominent websites were blocked or entirely shutdown for periods during the day.",
        "The penetration of the web is still fairly limited.",
        "As you can imagine, students certainly would probably have more access to it.",
        "But I was told, even in universities, there's a great deal of supervision over the computers in libraries, and in dorms and so forth, in an attempt to limit access to these sites, to the general web.",
        "Hm.",

        "President Bush met with the widows of two opposition leaders who disappeared and are presumed killed.",
        "Condi Rice has described Belarus, famously, as the last dictatorship in Europe.",
        "All of those statements are very, very helpful to the opposition.",

        "They welcome them.",
        "The United States, as well as the European Union, have also provided a fair amount of financial assistance.",
        "Under American law, the U.S.",
        "government can't directly support a political candidate in a campaign, but they can provide an enormous amount of support for what they call civil society, which is independent newspapers, independent monitors, and so forth.",
        "And as I recall, the number for this year was upwards of $12 million from the U.S.",
