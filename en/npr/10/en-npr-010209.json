        "There are, as we mentioned in our conversation with Steven Lee Myers a moment ago, obvious parallels to what happened in Kiev.",
        "Obvious parallels and obvious differences.",
        "The differences, I think, are more important than the parallels, in that Mr. Lukashenko, the regime that the controls in Belarus, is much more autocratic, much more repressive, than anything you had in Ukraine.",
        "Ukraine, on the eve of the Orange Revolution, was a semi-autocratic regime.",
        "There was some independent media.",
        "There was a channel, an independent television station.",
        "That you don't have in Belarus, and moreover the kind of repression that you've seen in Belarus, 200 people arrested already, didn't happen in Ukraine.",
        "So the differences, I think, have to do with the nature of the regime, of Mr. Lukashenko's regime.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And as this goes forward, do you see this as the first steps, as Iryna does, toward an eventual revolution?",
        "A change?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "I mean it's always is the glass half empty or half full?",
        "I see this, compared to where the opposition was just a few years ago, as a step in the right direction.",
        "I mean, let's be clear, because Lukashenko controls all the media, controls everything, this result, by opinion polls that were taken just four days before the vote, they were expected to get about 53 percent of the vote.",
        "So I think in a free and fair vote he probably would have gotten 53 percent, but that's controlling everything.",
        "George W.",
        "Bush would love to be able to control you and every national television station.",
        "I bet you he would be up a little higher than 39 percent if he controlled all that, and given all that, given the repression, given that you face arrest to protest, different from Ukraine, the fact that people came out I think is a step that the regime is less stable than it was just a few years ago.",
        "Iryna, there was a report in this morning's New York Times by Steven Lee Myers', a colleague C.J.",
        "Chivers who was there, and saying that as opposed to when he'd been there in the past, the students in the square were insisting that he write their names down and spell them correctly so that they would be accountable for what they said and, as an expression that they were no longer afraid.",
        "Yeah, that's absolutely great.",
        "I believe that, again, it shows how much these people believe in what they are doing and that they are doing it right.",
        "And they also understand that the steps they made, basically, is a step to the future, only the reason, there is no way back.",
        "And I'm so proud of these young people who are not afraid and who are able to sustain this cold weather and to stay in the square, despite the calls from Vidal to leave.",
        "They said, no, we will stay, and that's what we were fighting for all these years.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line, and we'll turn to Jim.",
        "Jim's calling us from Fort Wayne, Indiana.",
        "Right.",
        "My wife is a Belarusian, my mother-in-law is a Belarusian, and I agree with the commentator who said that probably in the 50 percent would have voted for him, because like you said earlier, you know, he pays pensions, he gets things done on time.",
        "The standard of living is not good, but at least it's better than what they see in Russia neighboring them, which they believe to be some sort of a chaos.",
        "The other point, too, is that in western Belarus, there's a lot of radio and television, as it comes from Poland.",
        "So, they do get an alternative perspective, but it's not much of the country, and it's somewhat inundated by the Belarusian television system, which is really very much like an old Stalinist system.",
        "But there are lots and lots of people there that would have voted for Lukashenko anyway.",
        "Mike McFaul, I think you said that before, yes?",
        "Yeah, I think that's right, but then, you know, if you, I mean this was an independent poll taken by a western company, InterMedia, four days before, so I have no reason not to believe it, but if you break down the numbers, you see some disquieting information there for President Lukashenko.",

        "Oh, no question about it.",
        "I think that there are lots of people who, who do not act because they're just simply afraid, either of losing their job or losing a position or being turned in by somebody in the society who's going to point the finger at them, so they just don't know whether the ballot boxes are free and open, they just don't know whether their actions might be reported and it will be the end for them in terms of jobs and livelihood or maybe finding themselves a body in the forest.",
        "What I was going to add on the youth, which I think is very important, because it's about the future that Iryna was talking about, when you look at the 18 to 34-year-olds, where they are at, only 38 percent were supporting Mr. Lukashenko.",
        "The rest are either supporting an opposition candidate or refused to answer.",
        "And then if you look in the cities, the same kind of disparity.",
        "So, those kinds of numbers for the long-term, I think, are very threatening to Mr. Lukashenko.",
        "Oh, sure a lot of pensioners vote for him because, you know, they remember the Soviet system, they invested their lives in the Soviet system and for them, it's still, oh, the collapse of the Soviet Union was a disaster, and they're afraid, so they vote for what they know.",
        "They vote for comfort and security and they don't want change.",
        "So there's, but the young people like you said, you know, they may be the future.",

        "And he testified before Congress in early February at the Helsinki Commission.",
        "And I've learned a lot about the situation from being there and I'm calling primarily just to let people know that if they want a good opposition Web site, the best one that we used on a day by day basis as the E.U.",
        "is Charter 97, and it's Charter97.org.",

        "Well, that's right.",
        "I mean the strategic importance of Belarus, you know, we could argue about, but the real story here, the real drama, was to make sure that there wasn't another Orange Revolution so that the folks around the Kremlin who are supposed to be fighting this so-called counterrevolutionary movement could claim victory, and that's exactly what they did.",
        "One of the few countries in the world, by the way, that recognized the results of this election.",
        "And I understand, Iryna, this one is called the Denim Revolution?",
        "Yes, it's one of the names that we use.",
        "The thing is that Belarus is really a very much controlled society, and jeans is still a symbol of freedom for many generations.",
        "Not only for young people, but for those who are now in their 40s and 50s who were students back in beginning of ages, so now to show that you oppose this regime it's enough to wear jeans and then that's how it became a jeans revolution, Denim Revolution, and that's why it became one of the symbols of what we are observing in Belarus right now.",
        "I wanted to add one thing to what we were discussing earlier, that what we called for now is just fair and free elections, so that they can really know who will win those elections.",
        "That the only thing that the people in the square require, is we run the elections as fair and free.",

        "Iryna?",
        "Danger is great.",
        "It's a danger for their health, for the life, for losing their places at universities, for being arrested.",
        "We were reported that more than 100 students were already arrested for either being on the square or bringing food, or warm clothes to those who are on the square.",
        "Many of those who are now in prison are my friends and my colleagues.",
        "And my heart is with them.",
        "And I just hope that people will become a little bit stronger and braver afterwards.",
        "And that's why it's so important for these young people to know that international society community cares about them, they're not left alone, that their names are known.",
        "That's why it's important for us to have media on the square, and we hope that they will keep paying attention to what's going on in the country and to what will happen to these young people."
