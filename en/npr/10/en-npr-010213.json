        "This worries Japan's prime minister, who is President Trump's guest at this week's summit.",
        "Explain why this is of concern to Japan.",
        "Shinzo Abe worries that despite his tough rhetoric towards North Korea, President Trump might come away from his meeting with Kim having agreed to something less than a full dismantling of North Korea's nuclear and missile program.",
        "Obviously Japan is a much closer target for North Korea than the United States is.",
        "And so Abe spoke to reporters this afternoon through an interpreter.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "(Through interpreter) I'd like to underscore the importance of achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization as well as the abandonment of missile programs of North Korea.",
        "Now, White House aides say Japan has no need to be concerned, that not only is Trump himself hawkish when it comes to North Korea and its nuclear weapons, but he's got a hawkish new national security adviser in John Bolton to argue against any backsliding."
