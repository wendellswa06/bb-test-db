        "There are bad things that can happen: prices can fall, there can be too much rain, it can be too hot, it can be too cold.",
        "A lot of those risks are protected against by government programs, particularly insurance subsidies.",
        "So basically they give them cheap insurance."

        "It is precisely because there is a credible threat of force from the United States that there is even the possibility of getting the Syrians to give up their chemical weapons.",

        "administration is that under those circumstances, if, in fact, within a reasonable time limit, the Syrians do give up their chemical weapons, then they may escape the military action that they have been threatened with.",
        "That would be if, indeed, the Russians saw averting the U.S.",
        "use of force to be their primary interest.",
        "What if that isn't their foremost interest?",
        "This, Robert, is one of the few moments that we have seen in this long drama where it actually looks like there could be a best-case outcome.",
        "But that would evaporate if it turns out that the Russians are just playing a stalling game here, that what their real purpose is is not to get the chemical weapons out of Syria, it's to stop the United States from using force."
