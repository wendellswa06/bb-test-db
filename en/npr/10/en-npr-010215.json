        "Which seems more likely to you?",

        "This is a moment for positive diplomacy.",
        "Well, I would give some possibility to the latter, more positive view.",
        "Lavrov is an absolutely loyal servant of President Putin but he's also a very experienced diplomat.",
        "And even Putin wants to avoid a escalation of the war or having American force, once more, demonstrated very dramatically not far from Russia itself.",

        "We just don't know.",

        "And this argument about free markets, is this in some ways the elephant in the room?",
        "Yeah, I mean, there's no question that we've come through this extraordinary period in the last 25 years or so where unleashing the animal instincts of the market was the justification for a whole range of initiatives - lifting restrictions that prevented investment banks from doing things that commercial banks were restricted to doing, lifting some of those lines, talking seriously about privatizing social security, putting formerly national companies in the hands of private enterprise - and basically, just paring back the role that government has played in the economy.",
        "And now, there's a sense that some of these animal instincts are maybe running feral through our streets and they're - you know, there's serious talk that it's time for the regulators to step back in and play a stronger role.",

        "But yes, in the margin, by degree, the guiding philosophy has been deregulation is good.",
        "Market forces can be left to sort out how money moves in this economy.",
        "And now, by degree, there's a sense that the government's got to look a little more carefully at how money is moving and with what consequences.",
        "And a big disagreement is over the risks that companies take and free marketeers would say, well, if Lehman Brothers or AIG, or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for that matter, if they take disproportionate risks and they're wrong, they should be allowed to fail.",
        "Well, the problem with that way of thinking according to most economists now is that - as we're all discovering - that what happens on Wall Street isn't just restricted to Wall Street, and even if you don't play the market or work on Wall Street, your life, if you're an ordinary American, is tied up, to one degree or another, in the decisions that are made there.",
        "And if all of the sudden credit is not available because huge banks are in danger of going out of business, and other banks find their finances are intertwined and there's a reluctance to lend money, that means you can't finance home purchases, you can't buy a car, you can't send children to college, you can't get your hands on capital to expand a business which means you can't hire people.",
