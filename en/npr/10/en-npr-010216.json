        "Now we live in a world where there's incredible fluctuation, and people now tend to have their retirement accounts, if they're lucky enough to have retirement accounts, in 401(k) plans which fluctuate daily with the market, as a lot of people are finding out on the downside, you know, these last few weeks.",
        "So, there's a lot more livelihood that's directly connected to the market than there used to be, and that's the basis for those who are - you know, that the government has to play a role here in making sure that people are taken care of.",

        "Are they going to be tinkering with the same bill that lost yesterday in the House, or are we back to square one?",
        "I mean, what is clear is that there's no safe ground for any of these lawmakers.",
        "And you know, on the one hand there's the fear that through inaction there really is a disaster that lawmakers have to answer to.",
        "And yet, there's the equal fear that at least for those people who voted against this thing, and are still on the sidelines, that they really don't want to be in a position where they're writing a big check to Wall Street, at a time when ordinary people are losing their homes and losing their jobs.",
        "So, there's no sideline to stand on here that safe ground.",
        "And again, the liberal Democrats who voted against it say, look, by doing this, we're privatizing profits and socializing losses and - but the majority of the votes against it were right wing Republicans who said, look, this Un-American, this violates these principles of free markets.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, we've gone through this period where we, Americans, have been lecturing too much of the rest of the world, whether we're talking about the Chinese financial system, or Latin American Companies and governments, that the way to run your economy, the way to maximize prosperity is to get the state out of the way.",
        "And now we're in a position where, you know, at a time when American banks for instance have been going over to China, and advising Chinese financial systems on how to let the private sector arise, how to let the private sector determine where money should go.",
        "We're talking about the government stepping in, and playing a very strong role in our financial system.",
