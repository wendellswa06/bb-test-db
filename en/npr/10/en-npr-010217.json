        "It should never ever in the name of anybody be over 15 to 18 percent.",

        "Well, you know, I do think we have to be concerned about the financial fall which is heavier.",
        "But in terms of Fannie and Freddie, their share rose to 70 percent in the last year, so basically because the private side of that market has disappeared.",
        "So, it had been lowered, it was only after the private side disappeared.",
        "Fannie and Freddie were not leaders in the subprime push by the way.",
        "This has been a myth that's been pushed in the last, you know, few months or so.",
        "They were definitely trailers, they were losing market share in '04, '05 and '06, the height of the subprime nonsense.",
        "So to try and pin that on Fannie and Freddie, it's really misleading, although I'm not going to defend Fannie and Freddie, they deserve their fate.",

        "The attempt to say, well, we're going to fix things, we're going to stabilize things by blocking the market out, and trading wage and price controls.",
        "It's a great play out.",

        "I visited the Soviet Union, in pursuit of business opportunities in 1991.",
        "I was immediately struck by the fact that the Soviet business culture was totally different from that of most of the world.",
        "The difference was control.",
        "Every enterprise there was a state-owned monopoly.",
        "While the large banking and financial enterprises in the U.S.",
