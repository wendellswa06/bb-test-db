        "The backdoor is a program that Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, announced last week, just as the summit frenzy was mounting.",
        "He said the ECB was lowering its official lending rate to just 1 percent, and he said the ECB would make unlimited loans available to European commercial banks at that rate for up to three years.",
        "It was mostly viewed as a way to prop up Europe's commercial banks and avoid a Lehman-style collapse.",
        "But it could have another important effect.",
        "It is potentially a way for the European Central Bank to support government debt throughout the eurozone."

        "Having very weak banks buy the bonds of weak governments, well, that doesn't add stability to the over-all system.",
        "So this is, at very best, a very short-term fix that can only buy quite a limited amount of time.",
        "Kirkegaard thinks the ECB's Draghi may be trying to buy time, hoping for a bailout by the IMF.",
        "If that doesn't work, Kirkegaard believes the ECB will ultimately step in directly.",
        "But Simon Johnson says if the ECB decides to essentially print money to support government budget deficits, it will be self-defeating."
