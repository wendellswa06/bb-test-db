        "And in return, the middleman told the newspaper exactly when during the game there would be what's called a no-ball.",

        "Now, sure enough, the no-balls happened exactly on schedule.",

        "Do you think he would have considered himself worthy of beatification?",
        "Well, I think, you know, John Paul, of course, had an acute sense of his own limitations.",
        "But you know, if the question is would he have had a problem, either with the fact that he is being beatified or how fast it's happening, I think the answer to that is no. It was John Paul II who overhauled the sainthood process in 1983 to make it faster, cheaper and simpler.",
        "I mean, he beatified and canonized more people, not only than any previous pope, but than all previous popes combined.",
