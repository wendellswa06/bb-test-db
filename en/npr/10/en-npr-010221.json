        "And Drew Endy, let me start with you.",
        "I kind of posed the beginning of this discussion in terms of whole organisms, but maybe it's wrong to cast the whole notion of synthetic biology as thinking about it as, you know, as an entire thing.",
        "Is that - is it fair to say that you're looking at synthetic parts that make up biology?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "I think - how I look at it is to consider the whole of biotechnology, all the different things that you could use biology for, things that it might make for you, and then ask where are we with biotechnology today, right?",
        "So when I was born back in 1970 and grew up through the '70s, '80s, '90s and now, biotechnology was just getting started.",
        "So the whole field is about 30 years old.",
        "If you consider it as a field you could ask, well, it's sort of a young adult right now, and how are we doing, how powerful is it, and how much more do we have to do.",
        "Where synthetic biology comes in is it says, well, if we were going to try and make biotechnology more useful and more powerful, how would we do that exactly?",
        "And this is where you get into inventing new tools and trying to make the whole process of engineering biology easier.",
        "So when you talk about building an organism or constructing a genome, what that really indicates to me is there are some exciting new technologies or tools that let people build new pieces of DNA in ways that haven't been possible before.",
        "And then what you'd want to consider in addition to that would be all the different bits and pieces and how you would organize them and why you would be doing it in the first place and what the consequences of success are going to be.",
        "And so to the extent that you can figure all of that out and put it under a nice label or an umbrella that would be synthetic biology for me."

        "I see.",
        "And so how would you characterize the maturity of the field right now?",
        "You know, to go back to it, I think, they're sort of a young adult, where some great things have happened.",
        "You know, going back to production of drugs and bacteria for treating diseases like diabetes decades ago, we have a lot of work to do, right?",
        "So the reports that have come out most recently are terrific advances.",
        "There are the first reports, for example, of building a gnome, all of the genetic material for a microorganism from scratch, from information on a computer database and raw chemicals derived from sugar.",
        "But, wow, you know, how do we figure out what sorts of new genomes to make and could we do it quicker, faster and cheaper and so on and so forth.",
        "So I think we haven't even scratched the surface of biotechnology if you wanted to dig into it a little bit.",
        "Well, okay.",
        "So Paul Rabinow, turning to you and maintaining this analogy of the young adult or the - or maybe the tween - how would you characterize it?",
        "And I guess the other question that comes to mind is, you know, as we raise our young, we do have some guiding principles, but this is all new.",
        "Do any of the guiding principles that we bring with us from, let's say, our history with, you know, basic biology, do any of those inform us about how we should be dealing with this new synthetic biology?",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "My question has to do with the relationship of synthetic organisms and the environment.",
        "And I'm wondering whether thought has been given to such things as sequestration of carbon, whether some of these organisms could eat that carbon up or there would be other uses to help clean up the environment.",
        "Interesting question, Elaine.",
        "Thanks for that.",

        "Well, first of all, good morning.",
        "Good morning, Drew.",
        "And I completely agree with what Drew said, very eloquently put.",
        "I pay attention to analogies in particular and so we could use that analogy, we could use some others.",
        "But I think it's really important to understand that while a lot of attention has been given to potential things that could happen and/or accomplishments like Craig Venter's construction of a genome, there are more concrete things going on that Drew alluded to that are really quite spectacular at this point.",
        "So Jay Keasling at Berkeley, who is head of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Center that both Drew and I are associated with, has engineered artemisinin, which is one of the few effective anti-malaria molecules left in the world.",
        "It's grown - it evolved in nature on the bark of a Chinese tree.",
        "And now, Jay, with the help of the Gates Foundation and One World Health, is producing this molecule both in yeast and in E.",

        "So this tells us really exciting and important things about how nature works and can be made to work.",
        "But - can I interrupt you for a second?",
        "Sure.",
        "How does being able to produce artemisinin differ from, let's say, producing insulin, which people have also been able to produce using yeast and bacteria?",
        "Well, this is where Drew's analogy comes in.",
        "The production of insulin, or human growth hormone or other such molecules, took an immense amount of time and work.",
        "And basically, was an attempt to imitate nature, to build the proteins in the same way that they had been built - more or less in the same way that they have been built in nature.",
        "Whereas, what Keasling's lab has done is to say, well, nature is - can be treated as if it was an engineering challenge and had machine-like qualities, and we can build pathways into organisms that were no way evolved to produce this molecule.",
        "And then - and this is really important - we continue to do that in a way that will do something that's beneficial to humanity and will build pathways not only within the organism itself, but out through other kinds of institutions, such that the science is beneficial both for learning how nature works and can be made to work, but also for addressing an extremely important problem in ways that is both more rapid and efficient than the current international agencies have been able to do.",
        "All right.",
        "We are - let's hear what - because this raises a whole passel of questions, and I want to hear what some of our listeners think about this.",
