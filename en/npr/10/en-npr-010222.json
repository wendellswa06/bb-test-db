        "My question is for everybody involved.",
        "My wife and I are vegan and so we have a deep respect for life and - just in general.",
        "And my question was, how do you think this is going to impact people who view life in general?",
        "Do you think it will, you know, help them realize that there's life all around us and it's valuable and special and unique?",
        "Or do you think it'll have the opposite effects to where, you know, people will start to see life as just another thing to be made in a factory?",
        "Do you think people will, you know, go the other end to where they will have a complete disrespect or they just see it as a commodity like we would see a computer or a car?",
        "Important question.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Paul Rabinow - maybe I can ask the anthropologist - can pitch that in your direction.",
        "Sure.",
        "I think that's an open question and that the public debate and the responsibility of the scientists involved will play a big role into how things ramify.",
        "But keep in mind, one of the leaders of the field, Craig Venter, who you've had on before, took a year off and sailed around the world on his yacht and sampled tens of thousands of genomes and showed that in nature itself there's an immense amount of genetic activity and swapping of genes.",
        "And a lot of very interesting processes whereby organisms develop resistance to certain environments, change their dynamics, and what have you.",
        "So I think at one level - and this is my position - one has a lot to learn about how nature or life or evolution actually works and to not take an overly restricted view of that.",
        "So what Drew and Jay and other people are trying to do is to learn from nature, but also to see that nature itself is an extremely dynamic and changeable set of processes.",
        "So we have to get out of the 19th century view that nature is static and fixed or mechanical in some simple way.",
        "And to find both better analogies and both better research technology.",
        "Now, can that lead to disastrous or dangerous or risky consequences?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So this is the time at the beginning of this exciting field - and Drew has been a leader in raising these issues - that we need to raise public awareness and we need to talk to the scientific community, in my view, to make them aware of the fact that this whole coming into maturity of biotechnology is done in the right way.",
        "Drew Endy, you know, I was going to ask, have you a perspective now having worked in this field for the many years you have?",
        "That is a really wonderful question that was raised by the caller.",
        "The, you know, first thing to say is within the research community whether you're a scientist or an engineer, the capability to construct an organism is going to be an amazingly powerful way to discover and learn how life works…",
        "Right."

        "I am a devout Christian but, scientifically, I'm excited for the advances that we're making.",
        "That being said, I - my question is, at what point as we're, I guess, designing or coming up with genetic codes of genome, at what point do we draw the line and say, you know, let's let nature or God take its course and maybe we don't need to necessarily interact or interfere with the hand of God in nature or whatever way you want to look of that, you know, where do we draw that line?",
        "Interesting question, Zack.",
        "…within the laboratory setting.",
        "But the caller's question really was much more powerful than that.",
        "It touched on how, you know, everybody's view of the living world might change - will it lead to a more respect or commoditization of life processes.",
        "And I think, as Paul mentioned, you know, quite expertly, it could go either way or probably will happen both ways.",
        "The way I would consider it, you know, by bringing up a different example would be to remember what happened with computing and electronics where computers, say around 1950, were very exclusive technology in their electronic form.",
        "And they were deployed against problems, you know, such as designing hydrogen bombs or computing the trajectories of munitions for the military.",
        "Within 25 years, many individuals had become so fed up with limited access to computing that they went off and invented the personal computer, which then led to many, many other dreams being realized around computer technologies, right, whether you want to call the iPhone a high watermark of that is just up to you.",
        "Drew Endy, we have to take a short break so I'll cut you off there, but we'll come back and talk more about this.",
        "We're talking about synthetic biology.",
        "Stay with us.",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Joe Palca.",
        "We're talking this hour about synthetic biology.",
        "My guests are Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology at the University of California-Berkeley, and Drew Endy, an assistant professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.",
        "And, Drew Endy, at the end you were saying that when there was an attempt to put restrictions and people became frustrated with restrictions on computers, they went out and invented the personal computer which, of course, you know, took people who might have been afraid of technology and said, too bad, we're developing it anyway.",
        "And I want to carry that analogy a little further.",
        "I mean, is there going to be a way to keep the lid on things that people might not want to have happen with the synthetic biology?"

        "There are ways one could imagine, but I think the costs associated with them would be tremendous.",
        "And, you know, I don't think you should consider it as, you know, the technology is getting out of the box somehow, but rather it's a really exciting technology in the same way that computers were exciting to people because you could, well, compute - being able to program the stuff of life itself to engineer biology is incredibly exciting to many people.",
        "And so it's almost as if there's a pent-up demand for people to have access to biotechnology.",
        "To come back to the caller's question, you know, as people have different values and want to constructively celebrate them, you need to pay or perhaps even participate in the development and application of the technology so that we can work through what those issues are.",
        "As Paul was saying, I think, it could go either way, right?",
        "Will it lead to a better understanding and celebration of life itself as we become closer with it and participate more directly in taking responsibility for genetic material and the changes we make to it, or will it be a locked-up, you know, pessimistic technology that commoditizes our existence.",
        "You know, again, it's going to be up to everybody who participates in the conversations and the practice of developing the technology.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Paul Rabinow, you were going to add something.",
        "Yes.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Two points.",
        "First, commodification is a word that is used in seemingly in an entirely negative way.",
        "But living here in Berkeley in California, the Alice Waters and Chez Panisse and natural foods were - have introduced a tremendous improvement and remediation of our food supply and what we eat.",
        "But they're also a business.",
        "So I don't think there is any necessary and inherent contradiction between growing wonderful arugula in the Sierras and selling them.",
        "So the question is not so much whether we're in pure life and pure business, but how the ramifications and combinations of those vectors can be put to improve the quality of all of our lives.",
        "So that's one point.",
        "The second point is I think the two major things that we need to do now in a globalized world connected by the Internet and furthermore in which the centers of science are no longer just the United States and Europe, but now are China and India and Brazil and Mexico and South Africa and many other places.",
        "We live in a globalized world now connected by the Internet.",
        "The idea of national regulations seems extremely limited.",
        "So I think we need to do two things, and I know Drew agrees.",
        "First, we need as much open-sourced discussion as possible.",
        "We need a much better education system in which young scientists and young economists learn more than just their subspecialties.",
        "And then we need an open world in which we don't put on visa restrictions on scientists, but we make the most contact possible because that's the way that people will know what's going on in each other's lives around the world.",
        "And that's the way that the very best of science, the enlightenment hope for science, can be encouraged.",
        "But if you build barriers and close down walls and don't allow people to travel and put government restrictions on what's going on, you're asking for trouble in the long run.",
        "And it's not actually going to provide the security that people think it is."

        "Elaine, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Drew Endy, what do you think?",
        "NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman, Tom, thanks very much.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, it's one of the great promises of biotechnology, to be able to take elements in the atmosphere, whether it'd be carbon or nitrogen and ameliorate or impact humans' relationship with those elemental cycles.",
        "It's very controversial if you dig down into it, right?",
        "Because many times, for example, if you take carbon sequestration, some of the best systems in the world for doing that might be natural systems, right, the marshes or the soils of the forest.",
        "And so careful attention needs to be paid if one were to try and compliment what nature is already pretty good at with engineered solution.",
        "But, absolutely.",
        "One of the great applications of biological technologies would be to better integrate the impact of human civilizations within the natural world.",
        "Keep…",
        "There's - sorry.",
        "Go ahead, Paul Rabinow.",
        "Keep in mind that synthetic biology is a young field.",
        "Nanotechnology, which is a little bit older and has more centers and is directly involved with environmental issues, has been doing some interesting things in terms of exactly those issues.",

        "And then, secondly, there's a huge new set of centers at Berkeley, but also at other places as well, in which synthetic biology is now devoting major efforts towards creating biofuels.",
        "And the question of what that's going to do to the natural environment and what's that going to do on the geopolitics of energy and the rest is very much on the agenda.",
        "So there are exciting things going on at MIT and other places, but these are the issues we all need to be talking about before it's too late.",
        "Well, speaking of issues, there's a group of people who've gathered at \"\"Second Life\"\" on Science Friday Island.",
        "And one of them, Troy McCullen(ph) has asked the following question.",
        "Can you give an overview of what biotechnologies can and can't be patented?",
        "So is patenting the right word to think about here or should we be thinking more like copyright or - I don't know, how do you - what's going to happen?",
        "How does ownership of these things going to work?",
        "Drew Endy, maybe you could take a stab at that?",
        "Well, within the current practice of biotechnology, patents are the dominant and accepted form of intellectual property and they're put to good use within certain applications.",
        "I think it's an interesting question.",
        "And the way I considered it is to map how ownership-sharing and innovation schemes changes in response to advances in technology.",
        "And the most relevant one to consider first would be DNA synthesis technology.",
        "So DNA synthesis is a technology where you can go from raw materials derived from sugarcane and information in a computer database and print DNA.",
        "All of a sudden, you don't have to go to your freezer to get a pre-existing piece of DNA, you print it from scratch whenever you need it.",
        "This technology, DNA synthesis, and other genetic construction technologies are getting better exponentially, which is a cliche but, you know, practically it means they're doubling in capacity every 12 to 18 months.",
        "They're getting better faster than computers are getting better.",
        "So if you look at how things like computing and, as Paul is mentioning, the fact that we're in a global Internet-driven world, what happens when we get to the point where there are online databases of standard biological parts and devices and whenever you want to call up or program a new synthetic organism, you download these sequences off the Web, right?",
        "Now this, all of a sudden, instead of looking like a bunch of freezers where you go get your DNA, maybe it looks more like iTunes on Apple's Web site.",
        "And all of a sudden, I think copyright becomes a very interesting thing to consider.",
        "But I don't want to overstate where this might go because, practically, the legal community is starting to think about it.",
        "It's not clear whether we should go with patenting in the future, copyright, something specific to the domain like what's been done with ship hauls(ph) and protection around that.",
        "So the ownership frameworks going forward in biotechnology, I suspect, are going to come under tremendous amount of stress in response to the improvements and the technologies that allow the work to go forward.",
        "Yeah, Paul Rabinow, go ahead."
