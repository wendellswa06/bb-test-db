        "Keep in mind that Drew is being modest.",
        "He's the head of the BioBricks Foundation in - which has devoted the most cutting-edge thought to these issues, and he has a lot more to say about it.",
        "Let me add only that the models have say, the pharmaceutical industry in - and what's happened with AIDS drugs, I think, is not in a global world with really pressing issues of environmental concern, health concern.",
        "And also the fact that science should be a globalized good, I think, that's probably the path not to follow.",
        "So struggling and thinking through the kinds of issues have opened access plus proprietary protection that will enable in further research without closing off large sections of humanity to the benefits both of learning and enjoying science, but also the products of science, that's the challenge.",
        "So one could say that how can we increase our capacities without increasing relations of domination and exploitation?",
        "Now that's a fancy way of saying, how can we increase the general good of this exciting and young field without just increasing the riches and wealth and health of a small group, a small part of humanity.",
        "Let's take another call now and go this time to Zack(ph) in Ogden, Utah.",
        "Zack, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Hey, thanks so much.",
        "I love SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Sure.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I think one place to start is to consider that by constructing or reconstructing things that already exists, this is an approach for understanding what we already find in the natural world.",
        "And so that I personally would feel would be well within, sort of, an acceptable sphere of activity.",
        "As you go forward I don't see an absolute answer to your question, it's something that we're going to have to continue to consider as we build things and learn what it means to be constructors not creators.",
        "I think there's an important distinction in the language here.",
        "A creator, a God, you know, has unlimited power, knowledge, ability to manipulate all that we know.",
        "Engineers, I'm an engineer, you know, I'm useful - used to wearing a hardhat to doing construction projects, right, but I can't really control what I'm doing all the time.",
        "Now, I try and make do and sometimes things work and sometimes they don't.",
        "And so I think as we start to understand the work more in the context of construction and see how it goes then, you know, we'll have to continue to have conversations around the issue you've just brought up.",
        "I, again, don't know perorally(ph) how to answer that absolutely.",
        "Let me add that my chief assistant, the main person who I'm working with out here in Berkeley on our project, Gaymon Bennett, is a doctoral student in Theology and he's a member of a group out here called Theologians for Stem Cells.",
        "So the question is which God, which interpretation of religion, and there's a vast array of difference of religious opinion among the major world religions as well as indigenous religions on all of these questions, so I think the idea that there's a single religious answer or that we know if one believe there was a God we knew what God's will was, I think many people believe is the fundamental center of Hubris, not attempting to do good things in the world but claiming to know what the omnipotent and divine voice is and what's allowed and what's not allowed, because I can assure you there's absolutely no consensus about that."

        "This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "You know, not to make light of it, but every time a new technology comes along there is a question of whether we're stepping over a line and usurping some role that God has determined for us.",
        "And I remember my dad used to joke that if God had wanted us to fly, he wouldn't have given us the railroad.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So there's an element to that every time, and I guess we can keep peeling back that onion.",

        "Thank you very much.",
        "Actually, it's interesting you mention hubris and messing with creation, because I'm kind of coming at the same issue from a different direction which is to say, I think that in our current age there's a certain amount of scientific technological hubris that - I'm no Luddite…",
        "Yes.",

        "…I think, you know, this is very exciting.",
        "But instead of thinking of messing with creation I'm wondering if you can look at the ecosystem as an extremely complex product of eons of evolution where all the pieces kind of have evolved to fit together in a certain way.",
        "I'm not saying it's static, but it is extremely complex.",
        "And if you consider the effects of introducing non-native species into an ecosystem, not necessarily something that's harmful per se, but something that has no natural predators or diseases or simply out-competes other organisms for a certain niche, I think, maybe, you can start to see what I'm concerned about.",
        "That if you engineer a new life form it is not, you know, by definition novel and therefore just introducing it into this complex system, product of such a long evolutionary process, inevitably you're going to have unexpected consequences and they could quite easily, I think, not be desirable.",
        "Interesting question, Chuck, although I suppose one answer would be that most things fail.",
        "Most things don't survive very well.",
        "But maybe I should ask Drew Endy, what he makes of that question?",
        "Joe, I agree with your statement just now, but, you know, it doesn't make the issue any less important.",
        "We depend, absolutely, on the natural living world and its, you know, continued prosperity to the extent that we have anything to do with it, and so we certainly wouldn't want to mess that up.",
        "You know, one of the things which surprises me is somebody growing up in a world already with biotechnology that the engineering community itself is relatively immature.",
        "And so, for example, 30 years after the invention of genetic engineering we don't have what I would recognize as the American society of genetic engineers.",
        "The reason that's funny or interesting to me is when I studied civil engineering and when I was a student, I had to take courses in professional practice and development, and I learned things like bridge designers will sign their work and put a little tag in, you know, or plaque next to the bridge.",
        "And, you know, a lot of times those cultural practices allow for things like, well, when the bridge falls down you're going to go talk to somebody about it and maybe you're not going to be a structural engineer very much longer, right?",
        "And so how do we develop, sort of, the culture of responsibility around biotechnology as it becomes more powerful, as it becomes more distributed so that issues like the one having to do with environmental health and safety, you know, become, sort of, anticipated and the solutions get built into the practice as things go forward.",
        "Well, I'd like to continue this discussion, it's quite fascinating, but I'm afraid we're out of time.",
        "So I have to thank my guests, Drew Endy, you were just hearing, is an assistant professor of biological engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.",
        "And we also talked with Paul Rabinow, professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley.",
        "Thanks to both of you for being with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "When we come back, we'll have a brief that - thank you - we'll have a brief look at time and what it means to be doing a SCIENCE FRIDAY program on Friday, February 29th, that's today.",
