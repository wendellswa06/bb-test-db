        "So that's kind of the back story as Jacobs entered this side room at a campaign event and tried to get Gianforte's response to the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House-passed health care bill.",

        "And their account pretty much matches his account of what happened.",
        "So you have accounts from the left and the right - not looking good for this candidate.",
        "Right.",

        "And part of what we do is try to authenticate and verify the information that we get, and everything that we receive and send out is subject to scrutiny by a team of experts.",

        "One of which you've mentioned already is avian influenza, a story that's been going on for several years now.",
        "Really since avian influenza emerged in Hong Kong in 1997, and then has recurred several years ago and has now traveled around the world both in birds and in people.",
        "And so that's something that we have reports on almost every day, outbreaks both in birds and in humans.",
        "And certainly we follow every human reported illness.",
        "So that's been a major story that we've been covering.",
        "There have been some interesting diseases that have come up recently.",
        "And more recently, there's a disease called chikungunya, which is a viral infection that's a little bit like dengue - a viral infection that's spread by mosquitoes.",
        "And this has been spreading around the world recently, starting in East Africa and through the Indian Ocean, now into India and beginning to occur in Southeast Asia.",
        "There have been not only thousands of cases in these regions, but also people from other parts of the world who traveled to these regions and then returned to their home countries with a mysterious infection which has turned out to be this chikungunya virus.",

        "He's the editor of ProMED-mail.",
        "Also with us is Gerry Callahan, author of \"\"Infection: The Uninvited Universe.\"\" I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Gerry, if I can turn back to you for a second - I mean, Larry just talked about influenza as sort of this long-playing issue since it first, this new H5N1 I guess it is form of the virus that mostly infects chickens at the moment, or fowl anyway, or birds.",
        "But you think that influenza is the one to watch in terms of the next big thing, don't you?",
        "I do think that.",
        "And part of it is that based on the epidemiology of the 1918 flu, the Spanish flu, which actually originated in the U.S.",
        "That's a flu that had a relatively low kill rate.",
        "But within a year or so - in part certainly because of troops being shipped out for the war and other things - but circled the globe, infected nearly 50 percent of the world's population without jet planes, without fast boats, without any of the sort of high-speed delivery systems we have now.",
        "Influenza, especially an influenza that can be spread from human to human, is the sort of disease that could really change the phase of this planet.",
        "Larry, I just - and coming back to that, I mean, how - do you - does it make you nervous at all to be the early warning system for what could be a global pandemic, you know?",
        "What if you get it wrong?",
        "What if you miss it?",
        "What if you don't identify it soon enough?",
        "You know, that does give you pause?",
        "Yes.",
        "Of course, it's a big responsibility.",
        "And we're very aware of that responsibility.",
        "It's - of course we don't do it alone, and I don't mean to imply that we're the only warning system out there, that we are solely responsible for doing this.",
        "There are numerous official and unofficial types of disease surveillance systems of which ProMED is just part of the system, I hope.",
        "And we're very, very attuned to that.",
        "And we have to be very careful.",
        "We realize that we certainly don't want to spread false information or cause undue alarm or panic.",
        "Part of our job is trying to keep concern at the appropriate level, to keep people aware of what's going on and to make people understand the threats there out there but not to certainly cause panic or undue alarm."
