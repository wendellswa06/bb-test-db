        "But all the time, from his MI5 files when he was interviewed during the war and long after and talking to people who were with him at that time in the jail - they all knew that he wanted to try and get back.",
        "So his - it was sort of his safe passage back to the U.K., would be to work as an agent.",
        "How did Eddie Chapman manage to convince British intelligence at a time when they were absolutely ultra-vigilant about spies and saboteurs that he wanted to be a double agent?",
        "It would have been so much easier just to let him languish in prison.",
        "The two great successes of wartime intelligence were the use of double agents, and the fact that we were reading the German codes.",
        "So right from the summer before when he was being trained and the progress reports were going back up to Berlin, the British knew there was this fellow called Chapman.",
        "They knew he had something to do with the Channel Islands, where he'd been picked up.",
        "And they knew he was a certain age.",
        "They knew he'd also lost some of his teeth in a parachute accident.",
        "Again, a typical Eddie - practiced for parachute lands, knocks most of teeth out.",
        "So they were aware there was this person, but they didn't know quite who he was.",
        "And Eddie sort of convinced them that this is me.",
        "This is what I've been doing.",
        "And they could compare what Eddie was saying with the fact that over the last six months they had these reports back from France to Germany.",
        "So they knew that he was reasonably kosher but they didn't get quite get a handle on his character.",
        "And within the first couple of days they realized, well, actually he was fairly reckless, but I see incredibly brave.",
        "The man he really impressed and who became his conspirator, his protector and eventually, we might fairly say friend, was Baron Stefan von Grunen.",
        "That's right.",
        "Baron von Grunen was this large corpulent, sort of, aristocratic figure who'd been in Britain.",
        "He'd also been in America before the war.",
        "And he and Eddie bonded.",
        "And they would get drunk together, and they'd go up to his quarters.",
        "And long after the war when Eddie's daughter was married, they invited him to the wedding and they met.",
        "And the baron burst into tears and said, this man saved my life.",
        "Well, you make plain in the book that von Grunen was in a sense both protected and promoted by Eddie's perceived success as a German spy.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And also from conversations that Eddie had with him after the war.",
        "He suspected that Eddie was working as a double agent.",
        "That's the most fascinating thing of all.",
        "But here's the crucial thing about Eddie.",
        "He would spend 18 months in occupied France.",
        "He was, at first, in the chateau in Northern France.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then he came back to England, and then went back then in Norway.",
        "So unlike a lot of the other double agents who were in places like Madrid or Lisbon, there was no way he could be, you know, taken to a safe house and (unintelligible) from the country.",
        "He was living on his wits.",
        "I have to say, he had this genius for survival."

        "I must say, whenever he was in a so-called safe house and they were training him...",
        "A good time was had by all.",
        "I mean, he disappeared one day and the Germans found him in a bar, dancing with a girl.",
        "And they were so relieved to find him that they all got totally drunk and then ended up back in the chateau, and von Grunen was livid about this.",
        "And then he just thought, well, I'll teach him a lesson, and then just put more and more green chartreuse down his throat.",
        "And you can imagine what happened after that.",
        "They had sort of - had this hangover that lasted for two days.",
        "And so I think he never drank that much ever again.",
        "And he always said he had a great time.",
        "I mean, he was insulated from a lot of the horrors of the Nazi occupation.",
        "They're in the chateau.",
        "They had great food.",
        "Eddie also had a pet pig.",
        "And these wonderful things at the MI5 files from - when they were sending back reports to Berlin on the progress of training.",
        "And this really baffled MI5.",
        "They couldn't understand who or what this Bobby was.",
        "It turned out to be Eddie's pet pig.",
        "So he's parachuted into Britain late at night.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And his mission is to blow up the de Havilland aircraft factory.",
        "Exactly.",
        "He'd come in in (unintelligible) as part of a raid, flying in over Cambridge.",
        "And this plane pitted off, and was going around in great circles because a night fighter suddenly was onto this lone bomber.",
        "And then he tried to get out and he got stuck because he's got this enormous, great parachute on his back.",
        "But he got jammed in this, sort of, bumped(ph) by this hinged door.",
        "So he's hanging upside down, screaming bloody murder.",
        "And the navigator comes out and literally kicks him in the seat of the pants, and then bang, off he goes.",
        "So as well as that, the oxygen mask failed.",
        "And so this apparition appeared in the middle of the night in this farmhouse, and the farmer's wife was absolutely horrified when this guy turns up in a sports coat with blood everywhere, smiling.",
        "You know, it's just such a great scene of incongruity, really.",
        "So they called the local police, and they start frisking him.",
        "And then they find this suicide pill in this turn-up of his trousers.",
        "They just want - who on earth was this - what the hell was he doing?",
        "Where had he come from because he just seemed so happy and serene?",
        "How did he fake blowing up the de Havilland aircraft factory?",
        "Over the years..."

        "Because we should explain, he had to do this to convince the Germans that he was still their guy and was carrying out their mission.",
        "That's right.",
        "His mission, should he wish to accept it, was to come back and blow up the factory that assembled the Mosquito bombers because the Nazis were getting very, very agitated that this bomber that was as fast as a fighter was getting through.",
        "So Eddie's mission was to blow up the factory.",
        "Well, they couldn't really do that.",
        "So a group of rural engineers went in overnight, and they dressed the factory as though it had been blown up.",

        "Exactly.",

        "And they said, you know, why do you want to do this?",
        "And he smiled and said, what a great way out because it would have been his mark in history.",
        "Nicholas, in the end, having lived with Eddie Chapman, in a sense, for a number of years while preparing this book, do you wind up thinking he was a patriot, a total conman or some merry combination?",
        "The best way I can put this - some of your listeners will have known somebody at school who was slightly crazy, who always managed to get into trouble.",

        "Now, those meetings have been the subject of a very great deal of social media commentary because of Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway's sitting position on a sofa and remarks by DeVos that some found historically inaccurate and insensitive.",
        "But the substance of the meeting was President Trump's signing of an executive order moving the initiative on historically black colleges and universities from the Department of Education into the White House.",
        "But he didn't make any other specific commitments.",
