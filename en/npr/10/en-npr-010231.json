        "Yeah, that's really bizarre.",
        "It's white.",
        "The elevator door opens up and everything is white.",
        "That apparently surprises an awful lot of people when they first go into a coal mine.",
        "But they spread rock dust on every exposed surface of coal, which is a white kind of powder to make it so that it's not explosive.",
        "It has to be rock dusted in order to, I guess, make it so it doesn't explode.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
