        "I've been on - of naval vessels and whatnot in various times.",
        "And the people who show outsiders around take this sort of - well, sure, they want to make sure you're safe, but they're not very necessarily happy that somebody who doesn't necessarily know what they're doing is down there.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Yeah, well, I thought I had a lot of that.",
        "I was kind of, like, the annoying tourist that wouldn't stop coming.",
        "But they - I mean, they really - on one hand, yes, that was the case.",
        "But in the other hand, they really did want to show - they do feel misunderstood.",
        "They feel the work is really misunderstood.",
        "They feel that people don't know they're there.",
        "And I think they were really happy to, like, let people know.",

        "We're taking this coal out for you, people.",
        "You know, you think we're all a bunch of stupid rednecks.",
        "And we're here doing this hard work so you can have electricity, so you can have air-conditioning.",
        "And don't forget us.",
        "There was a little bit of that.",
        "Now, let's get Tom(ph) on the line.",

        "It gets very warm as you go deeper down.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I was - I've been down as far as 6,000 feet in a gold mine and you can hardly move.",
        "It's 120 degrees and very, very difficult to breathe without air.",
        "That was just the comment I wanted to make.",
        "And but the mine that you were in, Jeanne, was considerably not -nowhere near as deep as that, but chilly, 50 degrees.",
        "It was - yeah, it was about 50 or maybe 55, 60, but it was constant year-round, which I thought is kind of lovely, like, they always knew what they are wearing to work, you know.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, it would never rained - they liked their weather conditions.",
        "They do.",

        "As a former underground hard-rock miner in the Frank Church Wilderness, I can attest to the fraternity of miners, the extreme dangers faced by the underground professionals, and the intense, mutual trust among coal workers.",
        "There's no room for error and no tolerance for those who don't live by the miner's code.",
        "As dangerous as hard-rock mining can be, coal mines present many more opportunities for disaster like the song says: it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew, where the danger is double and the pleasures are few.",

        "Oh, that's lovely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that camaraderie that almost, you know, that spirit that a tight-knit group of people who work together doing specialized work, dangerous work, that really seemed to come through in your story.",
        "Oh, heck, no. I'm - like I say, I'm claustrophobic.",
        "And, you know, I was trying to do anything I can to get out of the mines.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
