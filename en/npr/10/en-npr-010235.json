        "So, you probably thought that GPS was a pretty good idea when it first came out, I would think?",
        "Well, it was mixed for me because I'm a complete technophobe, so I was terrified of having to use it.",
        "But I - my daughter told me - she's 13 now - when she was little, when we used to get on Washington's Beltway, she said, I was always afraid you were going to have a heart attack, mom, and I didn't know what a heart attack was.",
        "But you would always start crying, I don't know where I am, and would make me really scared.",
        "So, that's - yes, I needed help.",
        "All right.",
        "So, when you first got the GPS, did it ever worked for you at any point, or has it always been a problem?",
        "Well, I have to say, in some ways it is a miracle but you never know when it's going to get you out of a jam.",
        "We initiated it by taking a trip to IKEA.",
        "Now, we'd been there before but always had to print out directions.",
        "So, we got on the Beltway, got off, and then it told us to take a left instead of the usual right.",
        "And we thought, well, this is the genius shortcut only GPS knows about.",
        "And after 10 minutes, ever deeper into a residential neighborhood, we came upon a couch which was not from IKEA, which had a sign on it, saying you can't drive through here.",
        "So, clearly, the people who live there had been driven insane by people looking for discount furniture and being led astray by their GPS.",
        "And did you ever find your way out of that dead end there?",
        "We traced our way out and just went the way we normally did.",
        "But I think it was your in-laws who had a similar problem.",
        "And that ended kind of disastrously.",
        "Well, they've been the most victimized by GPS of anyone I've ever known.",
        "And they themselves don't have a GPS.",
        "They live on a cul-de-sac which GPS thinks is a cut-through to a major street.",
