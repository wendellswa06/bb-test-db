        "Just yesterday, a fellow who was pulled off to the side of the road looking at his GPS decided he had to turn around and head the other way.",

        "So when you - if you're using one for the wilderness, those ones that people hand-hold and they kind of walk all over the place and go with them, mark where you get out of your car.",
        "Because if you go walking and then you turn it on and you don't mark where your car is, all the little device will tell you is where you're accident is going to happen, not how to get out of your accident or get back to where your car is.",
        "So that's one of the things that we teach a lot in our classes.",

        "They do.",
        "And a lot of it is because of the way they're manufactured.",
        "Like - if you were to hit, like, say, fastest route, right?",
        "And the freeways - they will have a speed designated on these machines, whichever brand you may have - Magellan, Garmin or DeLorme or whatever.",
        "And they will take, let's say you're going to go 15 miles in a particular direction, or let's say the freeway's speed limit is 65.",
        "But you could be on a country road that's 10 miles from the freeway, which, you know, everyone on these country roads they fly down the road at breakneck speeds, so it's better to go the shortest route than the fastest route.",
        "So they'll take you along circuitous routes sometimes that you know, it's like no, I know better than this thing.",
        "But if you apply a little common sense, and a little laughter and a little family talk while Lola's talking to you while you're trying to have a conversation with your wife about which way to go, it can get pretty fun and interesting.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for your call, Gene.",
        "Now I understand why this whole country road thing he was explaining - when I was driving my daughter home from camp, it was just on highways, but it told me to take a right and I ended up literally on Skunk Hollow Road, which I'd never seen before and, you know, doesn't invite you to linger.",
