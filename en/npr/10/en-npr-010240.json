        "in Tucson: Here, we're going through our third summer at least of the major part of Interstate 10 being closed.",
        "ADOT - which I assume is the Arizona Department of Transportation - decided that if they close down I-10 for three years to fix bridges, et cetera, they could get it over quicker than spreading it out over 10 years.",
        "They made the frontage roads do the work of allowing the bulk of passing-through traffic keep flowing.",
        "It should be done soon.",
        "But that raises a point that, in a way, we're reaching the end of the designed lifespan of a lot of the interstate highway system.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's what's sort of caused a lot of the shift to these alternative construction techniques because you had all of this stuff sort of ending at once and yet, at the same time, when driving was just taking off and congestion was really increasing in American cities so the more novel solutions had to be come up with, including this thing, which is what the email just referred to, is the full, sort of, facility shutdown.",
        "And it sounds sort of counterintuitive, where, how can you shut the whole thing down?",
        "But it actually turns out to be much faster than the traditional technique.",
        "One reason is simply that the people actually working on the site, the dump trucks hauling gravel and all of this don't have to sit in the same congestion to get to the work zone as all of the other drivers during rush hour traffic.",
        "So just one of these solutions that's sort of been put out there.",

        "In other words, I heard him mentioned something about blocking this - the other lane.",
        "And I see that happening, and I - it seems to me that as soon as it's recognized that you have to merge, you should merge rather than taking advantage of people being in the line and zipping on ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Tom Vanderbilt, one of your theses in your book \"\"Traffic\"\" is that, in fact, there are no accepted rules for when we should merge.",
        "Some people want to rush up as far ahead and merge late.",
        "Some people want to merge early.",
        "And because nobody agrees, it's a mess.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, going state-by-state, there's different ways that it's handled, depending on the construction site.",
        "And, of course, traffic is a very dynamic system.",
        "So when a highway's moving along at sort of a free flow 65-mile-an-hour sort of condition, it really does make sense for everyone to merge early and not sort of go to that bottleneck and cause trouble.",
        "But then when you get to that really congested sort of stop-and-go situation, engineers have suggested, well, maybe it's not a good idea to vacate that open lane early a mile ahead of the actual bottleneck and go down to a single lane.",
        "Maybe you should take advantage of that extra road capacity and have people do a one-on-one merge at the bottleneck.",
        "Some studies have suggested that that is actually more efficient.",
        "I mean, as with traffic, there's a lot of complications here such as the number of trucks in the traffic flow and other things like that that really only engineers care about and understand.",
        "But, you know, a lot of detail that needs to be taken into account is not sort of a simple this way is right, this way is wrong.",
        "Larry, how bad is the situation in Appleton?",
        "Oh, I haven't noticed any.",
        "Actually, we do have some of the construction going on, but this has been - over a long term, I've noticed this.",
        "And so, is the answer then there is no nationwide or even statewide rule?",
        "But the piano work is so beautiful."

        "Does it mean merge right now?",
        "Merge right somewhere in between?",

        "What they then have to do is really, you know, go out and educate the public ahead of time, set up these sort of flashing signs that really give clear instructions on what the detour is.",
