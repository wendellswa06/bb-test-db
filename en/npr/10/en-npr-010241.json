        "It really is a bad atmosphere.",
        "And in reporting the story for Time.com, one of the things that I found out is, you know, part of this human reaction, sort of pulling away from people who have lost their jobs, it comes from these feelings of survivor's guilt, survivor's envy, what psychologists call emotional contagion, which is sort of picking up on some of those feelings of, you know, desperation of the people who've lost their jobs.",
        "Not only that, but you report that in companies where there had been layoffs, well, it's, you know, meant to make the place meaner and leaner, if you want to put a positive spin on it; nevertheless, productivity goes down and turnover goes up.",
        "That's absolutely true.",
        "One of the management professors who I spoke to for this story who's actually social psychologist by training, Joel Brockner at Columbia University, has, you know, measured reduced commitment, diminished productivity in the workplace.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I would hope so.",

        "You know, welcome to America.",
        "Yeah.",

        "You mentioned higher turnover.",
        "There was a study that came out of the University of Wisconsin that found that companies that had had big layoffs saw - national turnover, people just deciding to leave, on an annual basis at about 13 percent compared to closer to 10 percent for companies without layoffs.",
