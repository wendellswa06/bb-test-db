        "Yeah.",
        "I think that the - what gets in the way, the problem - in my research, I've studying this for about 25 years, there's really three problems that get in a way of doing it well.",
        "One is the self-imposed sense of urgency among leaders.",
        "They figure, let's do it quickly; let's not linger; this is morbid; let's not talk about it.",
        "The problem is people can't react to loss quickly.",
        "The second problem is the fear of violence.",
        "Whenever there is an occasional someone coming back to a workplace with a rifle, that creates, obviously, a lot of concern, but the fact is, of all the millions of people who have been laid off because of downsizings, very, very few have ever comeback with violent reactions.",
        "And the third problem is that there still a stigma of failure.",
        "Downsizing implies you did something wrong, which is not necessarily the case.",
        "It's just - could be a reaction to things well beyond your control.",
        "But the companies that are doing this well - at the top of the hour, your newscast, for example, they mentioned how PNC is going to try and rely on attrition to the extent possible.",
        "I think that's great.",
        "That's - you know, ideally we could turn the clock back a few years and let companies be more careful about their hiring and things like that.",
        "But going forward, communicate, communicate, communicate is very important.",
        "I think also just leveling with people.",
        "What you don't want to do, and what I see over and over again in too many organizations, is a macho attitude for the survivors, saying, you know, if you're worried about keeping your job, maybe you should be or just keep your nose to the grindstone.",
        "I was in a high-tech firm just last week, and I was proposing to the executive team that we do some workshops with the surviving employees to - so they could vent, just talk about what they're going through.",
        "And one of the senior executives said to me, no, I don't want to do that because it's going to create stress.",
        "If we talk about the downsizing, it's going to create stress.",
        "And I turned to him and said, excuse me, but the stress is there already; you're not going to create it by talking about it.",
        "And if you've been to the cafeteria, you know they're talking about it.",
        "And the other thing, one of the things, Barbara Kiviat, you mentioned in your piece is, in fact, that the people worry that, you know, when places downsize, it's a moment when a company needs its boldest, most creative people to step forward and do interesting things.",
        "Yet , of course, people are afraid to stick their necks out.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Wayne Cascio was a management professor at the University of Colorado, Denver, who I spoke to who studied this.",
        "He said, this is the exact moment, if you're working, you know, with a smaller workforce, there are obviously forces in your industry, you know, buffeting the company around that you need to react to, more than ever, you need to be innovative, need to think creatively, but everyone after a layoff is very inward looking.",
        "They're afraid they might be next.",
        "They're - you know, as you say, to sort of, you know, focusing on their own work.",
        "No one wants to stick their neck out too far and be innovative in that environment, which is the exact thing that a corporation would need at that point.",
        "Neal, if I may, there's really two issues that are getting in the way of creativity.",
        "First of all, you're spot on.",
        "This is exactly when the company needs down - needs creativity.",
        "Downsizing has been referred to us corporate anorexia: You get leaner, but you don't get healthier.",
        "And this is the time when companies need creativity.",
        "As she said, part of the problem is you don't want to stick your neck out.",
        "No one know - I don't know how you learned to do what your job, but I learned to do my job by making mistakes.",
        "You fail sometimes.",
        "And no one wants to be a failure right now in case the next list is going to be drawn up.",
        "The second problem is no one has time to innovate or be creative.",
        "You've got six people doing the work that 10 used to do.",
        "Who has time to stop and think about how to do work better?",
        "That's the big problem.",
        "Lot of us take - it was one - I think it was a Tuesday.",
        "Anyway, let's see if we could get Greg on the line, Greg with us from Grand Rapids.",
