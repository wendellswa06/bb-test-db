        "But in reporting this story for Time.com, you know, one of the things that I came across a couple times is just because people are worker and putting in more hours, it doesn't necessarily mean that they're getting more done because of the anxiety and the stress.",
        "It sounded like he was very happy to be talking about it, which is the advice I would pass along from the folks I interviewed, which is, this is a part of - part of the economy that we're in right now, and you might feel awful to complain, to feel bad because you have a job and the person that used to sit right next to you no longer does.",

        "That stuns employees.",

        "It's quite another thing to lay someone off for no fault of their own.",

        "And if you talk to psychologists, they - any kind of life stressful situation, they say, go to a therapist, talk to your bartender, talk to anyone, but the problem is people do turn inward.",
        "A small but growing number of companies are having what's called venting meetings, where employees come together after the cuts and talk about what happened.",

        "And you know, in the venting meetings, it's not just about just complaining and griping, because what I find in these sessions, when I facilitate them, they last about an hour.",
        "After about 45 minutes, people are talked out, so what's next.",
        "Then you talk about, what are you going to do differently?",
        "How are you going to walk out of the room and either perceptually change your attitudes, or behaviorally what are you going to change about work?",
        "Because something does have to change.",
        "You just can't go back to your job and do the same old thing.",

        "We were asked by the department head in our industry, which is construction - I'm a file clerk, so I don't have any direct association with the layoffs and who to choose to lay off - but we were questioned about some of the work ethics and attendance and attitudes of other employees who were chosen to be laid off.",
        "And part of that was - we were told that, you know, based on some of our discussion - which was only a select few people in the office were asked these questions, you know.",

        "However, management has done poorly in two ways: One, managers themselves have not been downsized in the same proportion; two, managers do not acknowledge the loss the surviving employees feel when their friends are terminated.",
        "It's not survivor guilt, as that's beyond our control, but a sense of loss that managers do not want to acknowledge.",
        "And there's - I think, Mitchell Lee Marks, I think there are plenty of examples of places that do plan the downsizing pretty carefully, but then don't deal with the aftermath.",
