        "In the spy world, these are called active measures.",
        "A nation state uses its intelligence and diplomatic and other tools to shape the information environment by putting out false stories like you mentioned or exacerbating controversies, in our case, that already exist.",
        "This never really stopped happening after the 2016 election.",
        "There were Russian Twitter accounts that turned up the volume on the Charlottesville unrest last year or the NFL protests over the national anthem or the Alabama special election and other stories.",
        "But what we can't know today is whether the government and the states will be ready to deal with the full gamut of things we saw in 2016 - the cyberattacks that targeted politicians, institutions like the Democratic National Committee or some other new kind of technique for mischief that nobody has thought about yet.",

        "And it'll be very interesting because he has an election this year as well, and he may make the case to his own voters that he continues to be a player and increase Russia's prestige on the world stage through these kinds of measures.",

        "He has shown how effectively he can keep secrets.",
        "He, for example, reached a guilty plea with one former campaign adviser and then kept it completely secret until that was unsealed publicly.",
