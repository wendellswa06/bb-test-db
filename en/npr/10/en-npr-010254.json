        "Well, I think it's going to be much tougher to avert a fiscal blowout.",

        "And so I expect that the former plan that was put on the table a few weeks back by current House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan will be a good starting point for negotiations.",
        "But I would caution that Democrats, particularly HHS Secretary Sebelius, demagoguing the Republicans and suggesting that more seniors are going to die under the plan is not a first responsible step for the secretary to take.",

        "Well, first of all, I think in the short term we're not going to settle this.",
        "If we get any budget deal to get past the debt ceiling, it's going to be rather small.",
        "I don't know how you get there, but that's - I can't see the parties reaching agreement on the large issues until after they're fought out in the election.",
        "And I don't think it's political at all to say that there are two big options here.",
        "You can primarily reform the way we deliver health care, which is what President Obama wants to do, or you can ask seniors to pay more and more overtime for their coverage, which really is what Representative Ryan's budget wants to do.",

        "Just, I would say briefly, President Obama took about a half a trillion dollars out of Medicare and every Republican running for office in 2010 attacked the Democrats for it.",

        "Almost out of time this week, so let me just ask very briefly, do you think Mitt Romney's doing all right, Ron Christie?",
        "I do.",
        "I think it was a very smart move for the former governor from Massachusetts to try to put not distance between himself and his Romney care plan in Massachusetts, but to explain what he had done as governor and how he would differentiate for being the Republican nominee and hopefully the next Republican president.",
        "He's being attacked on the right for this, but I think he did the right thing now to put that issue on the table so that it will hopefully not hurt him as much in the future.",

        "For a lot of conservatives, unless he repudiates his greatest achievement as governor, they'll never give him the time of day.",
