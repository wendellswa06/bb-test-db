        "I'm actually in a city called Zarzis, Tunisia, which is an hour or so west of the Libyan border on the eastern side of Tunisia.",
        "And when Libyans were coming across to visit Tunisia, this is one of their first stops they would make.",
        "What do we know about the town of Zawiyah, which is not too far from where you are?",
        "Who is controlling it now?",
        "It's a very good question.",
        "Zawiyah is about 30 miles west of Tripoli, a couple of hours to the east of here.",
        "And I just can't tell you the difference in the two pictures that we've been getting all day.",
        "On one side, Moammar Gadhafi's government has been arguing that they're in full control.",
        "They've taken the city back from the rebels who were holding it for a while.",
        "They were showing aerial footage on Libyan state television suggesting that their tanks were in the main square of Zawiyah, controlling the situation.",
        "And there were rallies, pro-Gadhafi rallies in Tripoli today, and government officials said that was in part because of the military successes, how they've taken Zawiyah and some other towns."

        "But on the other hand, you have rebel officials who have been, you know, these scattered reports telling wire services and news organizations that, you know, we repelled the Gadhafi forces, we are in control of the city.",
        "And so it's just - with so few journalists on the ground, it's really hard to know.",
        "And, of course, Gadhafi and his government, I mean, they control state TV.",
        "I mean, they can say whatever they want, right?",
        "They can get any message out they want, and that's very crucial to them to sort of control the message within Libya.",
        "And I think it's really a concern to the rebels, who want to try and get the message out to the west.",
        "I mean, the interesting thing about western Libya, what people affiliated with the rebels say is they are in much more control of that part of Libya than the outside world knows about.",
        "We actually spoke to a doctor.",
        "He only gave us his first name, Dr. Makruk(ph), who lives in a city very near to Zawiyah, and here's what he had to say.",
        "The change is so near.",
        "I can see it.",

        "Finally, David, what kind of movement have you been seeing into Tunisia?",
        "A lot of people, a lot of Libyans, coming into Tunisia over the border today?",
        "Not a lot of Libyans.",
        "I mean, what we've seen is this rush of migrant workers.",
        "I mean, it's getting close to 100,000 people, migrant workers from other countries who were working in Libya.",
        "Aid agencies have done a pretty good job of starting to move a lot of the Egyptians and, you know, to get them back home.",
        "The Bangladeshis are a huge problem.",
        "Their country is 10,000 miles from here.",
        "Their country is very poor, hasn't been able to figure out a way to get planes here to get them out.",
        "And so you see a lot of Bangladeshis wandering around on roads outside of refugee camps, just sort of wondering where to go from here."

        "From Mohamed ElBaradei to young students to long-time members of the Muslim Brotherhood, we are seeing a wide range of Egyptian society out on the streets.",
        "And joining us to talk more about that is Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution.",

        "Is that a measure of its importance?",
        "Or is is a tactical low profile:",
        "Well, the Muslim Brotherhood is the oldest and the strongest and the best organized opposition group in Egypt.",
        "But it also knows that it has been used by the Mubarak regime for 30 years to demonize the opposition and to paint it as Islamic terrorists.",
        "So I think the Muslim Brotherhood in this current round of unrest has played it very cleverly, letting others be out front even as it helps to organize these demonstrations.",
        "I think what we saw at the end of last week, particularly on Friday, is that when the Muslim Brotherhood does give the instructions to get people out, you see much, much larger crowd than you had up until that moment.",
        "In any future Democratic government in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood is going to play an important role.",
        "We shouldn't be terrified by that, but we should be aware that that's going to be the outcome."
