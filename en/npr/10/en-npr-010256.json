        "At least a dozen others out of a group of about 60 didn't like Trump, didn't think he was a real conservative, didn't think he could win.",
        "Obviously, he did.",
        "So yesterday, I went back to that weekly breakfast in Charlotte to check in with this group to see how they're feeling about President Trump's first few weeks in office.",

        "And Elton supports the president now, but you can hear the hesitation in his voice here.",
        "He's a little bit erratic and does, says things and shoots from the hip and different things.",
        "But he'll settle down, I think.",

        "Many are retired.",
        "Some owned businesses.",
        "Could I just ask the room how many people voted for Donald Trump in the primary?",

        "And he's done it despite an opposition from his own party.",
        "He's done it with total opposition of the media.",
        "That was Don Reid.",
        "After that, a man at one of the tables in the back raises his hand.",
        "He's in jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt.",
        "His name is Ron Sheppard and he voted for Ted Cruz in the primary because Shepard thought the Texas senator was more, quote, \"\"tactful\"\" than the brash real estate tycoon.",
        "I asked how he feels now, especially about the president's preferred communication style.",
        "Do you mind his tweets even when he tweets out something that is not substantiated?",

        "Nor is this crowd concerned about the executive order that drew protesters to airports in January, the ban on travelers from some majority-Muslim countries.",
