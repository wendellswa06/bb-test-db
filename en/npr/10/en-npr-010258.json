        "By just taking from the retiree trust fund, you are threatening retirees.",
        "And that's why we've got to stop that.",
        "But moving money back and forth between the two funds has been done 11 times in the past with no big repercussions.",
        "That's one of the reasons that Democratic Senator Dick Durbin is suspicious of House Republicans."
