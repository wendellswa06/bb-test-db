        "Thank you.",
        "Now that this containment dome has failed, what is Plan B - if I guess we can even call it that, since the company has tried several things at this point?",
        "Well, we're continuing to fight this aggressively on three fronts: In the subsea to eliminate the leak; on the surface to contain the oil offshore; and along the shoreline to defend the shoreline.",
        "In terms of the subsea intervention, we're pursuing multiple options in parallel.",
        "Clearly the larger dome, as you said, didnt work over the weekend.",
        "We've moved on to deploy a smaller containment device, which we're referring to as a top hat, which we'll be deploying over the next 72 hours or so.",
        "Beyond that we are looking at interventions over the course of the next two weeks.",
        "That would involve the blowout preventer itself, the big valve on the seabed that has failed to operate.",
        "And what we're doing is lining up to pump material into it to seal it, something that is referred to as a top kill or junk shot.",
        "It seems like there's some risk associated with that, though, because the blowout preventer is working in part.",
        "Are you worried that if you start to do anything that it might fail all together and that might send much more oil into the Gulf?",
        "Well, thats clearly why we are taking our time ensuring that we have all of the diagnostics of the blowout preventer.",
        "So we are - we have over the last 48 hours managed to obtain pressure data, which has given us confidence of the ability to execute the top kill.",
        "We have got gamma ray data, which is giving us a good indication as to the configuration of the blowout preventer on the seabed.",
        "Mr.",
        "Hayward, this is the deepest well blowout on record.",
        "And the people are most knowledgeable in dealing with deepwater wells are at the outer edge of their expertise, even when things are going well.",
        "The Coast Guard and oil industry analysts say that drilling here is almost like visiting outer space.",
        "It's like a great unknown.",
        "So why are you drilling there if there's so much that is not known about this territory?",
        "Well, we're drilling because it's a very important source of energy for the United States and the world.",
        "That is the reality.",
        "Almost 30 percent of the United States oil production today comes from the deep waters.",
        "That is where there is the opportunity to provide domestic energy security.",
        "That is where there is an opportunity to provide energy security for the world.",
        "And, of course, oil isnt all of the solution but it's a part of the solution.",
        "That opportunity obviously comes, though, with great peril.",
        "Is deepwater drilling riskier than BP believed?",
        "I think you have to go back to, you know, the track record of the industry and BP's over the last 20 years.",
        "The industry has drilled over 5,000 wells.",
        "BP has drilled around 1,500 of those 5,000 wells, and this is the first time that we've had a major incident.",
        "And I think it is legitimate to draw analogies with, for example, the space program."

        "The space program was not cancelled because of the issues around Apollo 13.",

        "When the Air France plane fell out of the sky coming out of Brazil, we didnt ground the airline industry.",
        "So we need to learn the lessons here.",
        "They will be learned and they will shape, Im certain, the industry as it moves forward.",
        "Is it legitimate also to draw parallels to the EXXON Valdez spill, where it was determined that human error was also a factor?",
        "Well, I think we have to await the results of the investigations.",
        "You know, my focus today, quite frankly, is on the response.",
        "You know, when I listen to you talk about your record, you note that youve been drilling - doing this kind of deepwater drilling for two decades and youve only had one major spill like this.",
        "You know, many people would say that thats hardly anything to crow about, though.",
        "Earlier today, I was interviewing a Nigerian activist, a leader of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign.",

        "Before Trump lectured the world about human rights and civil rights, he should himself respect civil rights and human rights at home.",
        "He enacted the Muslim ban and continues to defend it in court, so he cannot just talk from both sides of his mouth.",
        "Absolutely right.",
        "The problem with the message is the messenger.",
        "It really doesn't matter the words that come out of President Trump's mouth in Saudi Arabia.",
        "No one can forget that he has made anti-Muslim sentiment not just the foundation of his campaign, but the foundation of his four-month presidency.",
        "That's Reza Aslan.",

        "So Laura just mentioned how Symphony can track viewership of streamed shows.",
        "Can Nielsen actually do this technically?",
        "Yes, they can.",
        "Cable channels and broadcast networks have been pressuring Nielsen to come up with this data.",
        "And they feel that they've been slow in developing it.",
        "But earlier this year, Nielsen did reveal that it does have some viewership data on Netflix original shows like \"\"Orange Is The New Black.\"\" but they're only sharing that information with select clients.",
        "They're not making it public.",
        "So it's hard for journalists and critics and the public to know exactly who's watching what or to get a sense of how well they are measuring that viewership.",
        "So it's still a controversy inside the TV industry, but Nielsen can do it.",
        "But what's Nielsen's history here when it comes to the technology, right?",
        "Is it something that they're good at developing?",
        "Well, they do have this history where, for example, they competed against Arbitron to provide ratings for radio listenership for a while.",
        "And then they wound up buying that company.",
        "So it's entirely possible that Nielsen, if it gets to the point where a rival company develops great new technology that they want to be part of their process, they could just buy it.",
        "So there's a lot of options for a company as big as Nielsen that controls as much of the TV ratings game as they have.",
        "And there's an attempt by their customers to pressure them a little bit.",
        "There's an attempt by competitors to pressure them a little bit.",
        "And then we have to see what kind of choices they're going to make.",
        "So when we're seeing traditional TV companies like NBC and A&E testing the technology from companies like Symphony, sounds like they're trying to even the score.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You know, if you're NBC and you're trying to sell advertising, you do that by getting ratings from Nielsen.",
        "So if Nielsen is the only place that gives you the ratings for these shows, then they can charge you as much as they can charge you."

        "If there's a competitor, that sort of reduces their power a little bit.",

        "Now, I can understand why critics care about this and I can understand why the networks care about this, but why does it matter to me, the consumer?",
        "Sure.",
        "When I'm watching, does it matter who else is watching the streaming services?",
        "Well, the superficial answer is that people like to watch what they know is popular.",
        "So if you have a sense that a bunch of other people are watching a show, you might want to check it out.",
        "But I think the deeper answer is that if Netflix or Amazon can control how our perception of how popular a TV show is - how many people are watching it - that controls the TV industry.",
        "So that controls what kind of shows the viewer ultimately gets to see.",
        "Right?",
        "And there's other people, actors and producers, they want to get paid.",
