        "A few months ago, after he relocated to Atlanta from New York, Jeff Varasano fell into a deep funk.",
        "He was working as a computer consultant, and aside from the fact that he didn't get much out of it, he struggled to find a decent slice of pizza in the city.",
        "Now, before I go on, I should mention that Jeff Varasano is obsessed with pizza, so he took matters into his own hands, literally.",
        "He started cooking pizzas at home and over time, nearly 1,000 of them.",
        "He experimented with ingredients and oven temperatures, and he documented the whole thing on his now very popular Web site.",
        "He talked with me from his new restaurant, Varasano's.",
        "Here's how he describes the perfect pizza.",
        "Real Italian pizza is all about balance.",
        "It's very sparsely topped.",
        "It has just a little bit of tomato, just a little bit of cheese, and it's really all about the crust.",
        "High-end pizzas are typically made much, much hotter than regular pizzas.",
        "Typical pizzas take 12 to 18 minutes, something like that.",
        "Our pizzas here bake in just about two minutes or so.",
        "Two minutes.",
        "You bake your pizzas for two minutes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Actually, if you go over to Italy, if you go over to Naples, Italy, I've seen pizzas made in as little as 40, 45 seconds, and it's really a very different style of pizza than most people have become accustomed to.",
        "You actually started cooking pizzas at home before you opened your restaurant."

        "Right.",
        "How did you get your oven at home hot enough to make the kinds of pizzas you're talking about?",
        "Yeah, it's funny.",
        "That's one of the things that made my Web site so popular, I think, was that I had gone to such extremes, it just left an impression on people.",
        "I moved to a new house, and I had an oven that had a cleaning cycle on it.",
        "And the first time I ran the cleaning cycle, I realized it had cleaned by basically incinerating the contents.",
        "So I got a pair of garden shears, and I clipped off the lock, and I bought an infrared thermometer so I could test the temperature at different points in the oven, and I started baking my pies in it.",
        "I understand that you'd actually get it repaired several times.",
        "I was making a pizza one time, and I had a whole party at my house, and a clam - I was making a New Haven-style clam pizza.",
        "And a little piece of clam rolled off the pizza and rolled underneath the stone and immediately ignited and caught fire because it was above the kindling temperature.",
        "Well, I couldn't notice this.",
        "I didn't see this because the glass of my oven was completely covered in aluminum foil to protect the glass from shattering from splattering sauce, which is another interesting experience that I've had in the past.",
        "So the oven was on fire, and I didn't really notice it until the smoke started billowing out of it.",
        "So I opened up the door, and we put out the fire.",
        "I threw some baking soda and salt on it, and the fire was put out.",
        "Now, it's not just the heat of the oven.",
        "It's also sort of the recipe.",
        "And I read on your Web site that you actually experimented with a variety of recipes over a period of six years.",
        "How did you come up with sort of the perfect recipe?",
        "Right.",
        "One thing I noticed right away was that even if I could get the char, it just didn't have the flavor profile that I found in some of the top pizzerias.",
        "So I started to experiment with sourdough cultures and probably over 50 brands of flour or different varieties of flour, probably an equal number of cheese, close to 100 olive oils, and certainly over 50 types of tomatoes.",
        "So a lot of it was just trying everything and seeing what I liked best."

        "And while we were talking, we got word of a new grim story.",
        "Islamic extremists reportedly killed dozens of people and kidnapped close to 200, again nearby the village of Chibok.",
        "I asked my guest about this latest mass kidnapping.",
        "What do you want me to say?",
        "I've tweeted at our government and I've said to them that I hope they learn from the mistakes of the Chibok girls, and that they will do everything to avoid repeating the same pattern.",

        "It's eerily reminiscent of the abduction of the Chibok girls.",
        "Basically, from what we gather, we had gunmen attack this village.",
        "This was actually last Sunday, so it's taken awhile for the news to trickle out.",
        "They - in the classic kind of Boko Haram style - just sprayed the whole place with bullets.",
        "They then took these big, large open-top trucks that they had and they loaded on - they say roughly about 100 women and children, and just drove them off.",
        "So it does show that - as Oby was suggesting, that maybe the government still hasn't gotten its head around protecting civilians in this very volatile area.",
        "It's not unheard of for Boko Haram to issue some sort of statement or even videos.",
        "Has anything been heard from the group in relation to this attack?",
        "There's usually a time delay of several days, if not weeks, between them carrying out an action and then popping up with a video to claim it.",
        "Given the size of the attack and the number of people abducted - if it really is more than 100, then this will be the biggest single abduction since the abduction of the Chibok girls.",
        "I wouldn't be surprised if at some point the man claiming to be Boko Haram's leader doesn't show up on the video gloating about it and possibly making demands, which, of course, he knows the government probably won't be able to meet.",
        "What has been happening with the Nigerian government's offensive into this area of the country against Boko Haram?",
        "It's not looking very good at the moment.",
        "They occasionally report that they've killed large numbers of insurgents.",
        "But if they have, it doesn't seem to have dented their overall capabilities.",
        "This is a group - or possibly several factions - that seems able to pretty much do - it does as it will in that whole northeastern region.",
        "So it doesn't look like they've got very good control of the situation at all, despite what is now more than two years of a military offensive that was supposed to crush them.",
        "That's Tim Cocks.",

        "In the beginning, there was nothing, say the first words you see onscreen, and then there's everything: a swirling cosmos, Adam and Eve, a fall from grace, a fall of angels, teeming industrial cities spreading so much sin and darkness that the creator has second thoughts, communicated to a 500-year-old family man in a nightmare.",

        "Also how much help a family of five would need to build a structure 300 cubits by 50 cubits by 30 cubits.",
        "You may not remember stone giants in this story from Sunday school; the movie makes them literally Earth-bound angels, huge like those talking trees in \"\"Lord of the Rings\"\" and helpful as backup when a snarling king from Cain's side of the family shows up with an army.",
