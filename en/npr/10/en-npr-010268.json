        "In the conventional banking system - trusted third parties, like banks and credit card companies - keep ledgers to make sure I can't do that.",
        "But bitcoin solved this problem by creating a public record of every transaction.",
        "So if I buy something from you with a bitcoin, a record of that transaction is shared and recorded across the entire bitcoin network - everyone knows.",
        "The theory is that public ledger make it impossible for me to spend a bitcoin twice.",
        "Because after I spent it, everyone would know that coin was actually yours.",

        "OK.",
        "But wait, Steve.",
        "If you're telling me that every transaction is supposed to be recorded in a publicly-shared ledger, right, how does it happen that thieves could apparently manage to steal, what you say, could be $350 or $400 million from this exchange, Mt.",

        "Well, that's a great question.",
        "So sharing and recording all these transactions on the bitcoin network it turns out takes some time.",

        "But these temporary ID numbers can be faked.",
        "Apparently people were approaching Mt.",
        "Gox with fake ID numbers, telling the exchange they hadn't received the bitcoins they were owed.",
        "And then Mt.",
        "Gox was relying on these numbers and giving the thieves real bitcoins.",
        "This may well have drained Mt.",

        "Gox was processing more than a billion transactions a day.",
        "It was this key part of this economy.",

        "Gox was possibly bankrupt, I called around to big bitcoin investors and asked if it was too big to fail, if they were going to bail it out.",
        "And I got back a resounding no. Mt.",
        "Gox was pretty widely perceived to be mismanaged.",
        "Several big investors in the bitcoin economy told me that they hoped that the next exchange would be regulated and based here in the U.S.",
