        "The other is this is a reminder of what a filibuster is supposed to be.",
        "We've gotten so used to these sort of painless filibusters or filibuster threats that the Senate minorities used over the last six or seven years to hold up almost everything that we've forgotten there is a legitimate role for somebody who's willing to go to the mat to stand on his or her feet for 11-plus hours.",
        "And that's what State Senator Davis was doing."
