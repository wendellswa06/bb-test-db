        "Just three weeks before the big switch to digital broadcasting, Senate lawmakers have passed a bill that would delay that transition by four months.",

        "That means they can have cable installed, or buy a digital TV, or buy a converter box that allows old-fashioned analog TV to receive the new digital signals.",
        "The government mandated the all-digital TV, both to give public-safety officials more room on the airways and to improve viewing quality, but concern has been growing in Congress that many households are not ready for the February 17th transition date - particularly the poor, the elderly and rural families.",

        "It was the most refreshing, startling and amazing comment I've ever heard him make in the 25 years I've known him on the issue of race; very poignant, very personal and very much, I think, a rallying cry for African-Americans and a point of contention for those who really resent the fact that he's bringing race into this equation.",
        "Is this a different President Obama than we saw in 2009 when he spoke out about the incident with Henry Louis Gates?",
        "It's very different.",

        "This has changed my whole direction of the book and changed my whole view about President Obama.",

        "I'm glad he used it, I'm glad he talked about race and disparities in the criminal justice system.",
