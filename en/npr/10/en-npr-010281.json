        "We maybe have this hard-wired, right, into our brains.",
        "The study showed that Amazonian villagers with no formal math training seemed to understand these geometric concepts as well as we do, as well as we folks who go to school and study mathematics.",

        "And so this year, we were interested in how they understand geometry, and particularly we were interested in how they understand concepts of geometry that (unintelligible) that we can perceive, that go beyond what we can perceive, such as the idea of an infinite line or idea of lines that would never cross, lines that are parallels.",
        "And so the way we asked them questions about these kinds of concepts is we asked them to imagine some ideal worlds.",
