        "Well, they have a very special number system.",
        "They actually have number words only up to five, which is something that is quite common in the Amazon.",
        "But so that's how we got interested in them because we also first did studies of their numeracy.",
        "And we looked at how they could perceive numbers, even though they had this limited lexicon, and we actually found that if you show them images with lots of dots, you ask them to compare where there would be more dots or less dots, they are still able to do that.",
        "So even without a linguistic system, you still have an intuition of numerical quantity.",
        "Why don't they have larger numbers?",
        "Do they not have to keep track of larger items, numbers of items?",
        "Well, they - it's a hard question to answer because of course if you don't have a large number system, then you are not going to keep track of large numbers of items.",
        "But I think it would probably be of some use to them.",
        "But they have also developed alternative systems, like they would use configurations for example, for keeping track of numbers.",
        "They would put five on the side, five on another side, and then, they might complete the picture with even more fives or things like that.",
        "So for example, when they basket, at first, they have to make sure that they have enough lines to make the basket.",
        "And to make sure that they do, what they do is choose some geometric configuration where they make squares of three by three lines, and then they make big squares of smaller square of three by three.",
        "And then, once the configuration is complete, they know they have the exact number they need."

        "So they seem to be independent.",
        "On the other hand, what happens in, as a matter of fact, is that they're much likely to be dyscalculic if you're dyslexic and much more likely to be dyslexic if you're dyscalculic than you might expect by chance.",

        "So you really got to make sure that they understand those processes before you start giving them five plus three or the number bonds to 10 or the multiplication table.",
        "You've really got to make sure that they understand these concepts in either in real concrete materials or what we've been developing recently are virtual concrete materials where you have software, computer games which simulate or emulate what a good teacher would do with concrete materials."
