        "Georgia certainly should have the choice to decide whether to apply for membership or not.",
        "And I think NATO should have the opportunity to debate that and decide among the allies whether to allow them in without feeling intimidated by other parties.",
        "Georgia already was considered, or was considered to be considered, yes?",
        "Well, it was a complicated situation.",
        "Georgia has been in the partnership for peace, as is Russia, as are many nations in Europe that want to have a relationship with NATO.",
        "That's not membership.",
        "But when a nation feels that it wants to lead the partnership for peace and instead try to become an alliance member, there's a process called the Membership Action Plan.",
        "And it's a process.",
        "It's a tool that NATO uses to try to get a nation ready to be a viable candidate for a NATO membership.",
        "Within that process, there are ways that NATO works with that nation to look at how they do their civil government, you know, civil control of the military, market economy, a lot of things that the alliance would like to see in a nation that will become a member.",
        "Now, a nation, a candidate can be in that waiting room for many, many years until the alliance thinks that that nation is ready and has the hallmarks of a good ally.",
        "And that's what the Georgians were looking at joining - the alliance was looking at bringing the Georgians into during the Bucharest Summit just a few months ago.",
        "So what is it that makes you eager or willing to have Georgia be a part or a candidate for NATO membership?",
        "I am willing to have Georgia be a part of the alliance - to go through the Membership Action Plan because I see a nation there that is trying to grow a democracy.",
        "They're trying to develop institutions and relationships and integrate with Western Europe - become a part of the European Union.",
        "NATO membership is a carrot.",
        "NATO membership has been used for years now to get nations to clean up their act.",
        "Georgia's got big, big issues, big, big problems.",
        "We need every tool that we can bring to the - to bring to bear on this to sort Georgia out.",
        "But is the carrot worth the stick?",
        "Is it worth having to send NATO troops into a conflict that it was never meant to be involved in?",
        "Well, I would say yes it is because what we're talking about here is trying to create a community of nations that have to be, it has to be inclusive so that you don't end up in a position where the alliance is sending troops anywhere."

        "Obviously, as we get closer to the old Soviet Union, the sensitivities go up.",

        "Mr. Pfaff, I gather you think NATO membership for Georgia is not a good idea.",
        "Well, I think that the discussion really is, at this point, a totally unrealistic one after the events of the last few days.",
        "I don't see that NATO is going to want to have Georgia be a member or at least the other of the European members of NATO, I think, are very likely to join the minority that said no, NATO should not be extended to Georgia, or for that matter, to Ukraine.",
