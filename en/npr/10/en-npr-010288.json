        "After a person has had an ischemic stroke, the most likely event that they're going to go on to after that is another ischemic stroke.",
        "And a blood thinner reduces the chance of another clot forming.",
        "After Sharon's first stroke, his doctors discovered a common congenital malformation, a tiny hole in his heart about the size of a small seed.",
        "That hole can let blood clots travel from the heart to the brain, another reason to try to keep his blood from clotting.",
        "But there's a second kind of stroke.",
        "In a hemorrhagic stroke or a bleeding type of stroke, there's essentially a small blood vessel in the brain that ruptures and then blood spills out of the blood vessel into the tissue of the brain and does damage by that mechanism.",
        "A blood-thinning agent in this situation is bad.",
        "Segal isn't comfortable commenting on Sharon's care since he doesn't know all the details, but he says Sharon's doctors faced an immediate problem last month.",
        "The initial ischemic stroke that he had was presumably due to some form of blood clot, and this is what prompted his physicians to put him on blood-thinning agents.",
        "And in Mr. Sharon's situation, he kind of got caught, as best I can tell, between the sort of yin and yang of too much blood clotting or not enough blood clotting."
