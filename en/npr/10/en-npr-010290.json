        "The RuTHLeSS Corps teachers would cruise their patch of highway on the lookout for speeders or tailgaters or barrelling down the breakdown lane while eating a hamburger talking on the phone a hamburger and flipping the burgers.",
        "The RuTHLeSS monitors would simply whomp their teacher look on the vehicular violator for 30 seconds or so, just long enough for their cap-mounted camera to record it all, including the license plate number.",
        "Then they'd make a radio call to their patrol officer partner ,who would be strategically placed at the next highway exit and gotcha.",
        "Think about it.",
        "Who is better qualified to monitor self-centered, reckless, immature behavior than the nation's veteran teachers?",
