        "But how exactly does a larvae know the difference between the line that takes him to Penn Station and the line that leads to Yankee Stadium?",
        "After all, there aren't any signs out in the ocean.",
        "But Atima says there are a lot of smells, and for a long time, he's been wondering whether some larvae follow them home.",
        "That thought first hit him 10 years ago, when he looked out of a boat and saw a dusty-looking trail of water flowing out of an Australian coral reef.",
        "And I thought wait a minute, that's a visible plume of dust that can go kilometers as a sort of a highway, streaming out of the reef into the open ocean.",
        "There must be odor in there, and there must be fish in there.",
        "Since then, Atima's been part of a team of researchers studying watery odor trails.",
        "In one experiment, the team put cardinal fish larvae into the aquatic equivalent of a subway station, which allowed the fish to chose between two different water trains, one of which was from their home reef.",
        "Almost every time, the larvae jumped into the stream that smelled like home, even when Atima tried to trick one of them.",
        "And I switched - bad guy I am - switched the odor on him, and then he gets nervous and swims immediately over to the other side, back to his home odor.",
        "The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and it has attracted critics.",
        "They say one big problem is that the chemical compounds that might be creating these odors are never identified.",
        "But evolutionary biologist Richard Zimmer of the University of California at Los Angeles says this study raises some intriguing possibilities.",
        "For instance, if these smelly currents do turn out to exist, they could be used to lure fish back to reefs that are now facing all kinds of problems.",
        "So there's tremendous interest in knowing what processes get fish to a particular reef so that ultimately, reefs can be more effectively managed.",

        "So that's - this bailout not getting done is really not good news for those people in those regions.",
        "What's happening politically right now is, I mean, you've got a situation where, you know, the Republicans in Congress have come out and essentially said, listen, we are holding the line on this.",

        "And there's some thought now that if this doesn't get done this week, that it might just be left on the table for the Obama administration to come in and deal with after the first of the year.",
        "The problem with that being is that the automakers have made it clear that they may not make it to that point if they don't get some sort of a bailout.",
        "So there's this stalemate.",
        "There's this gamesmanship going on.",

        "You have to really think about - you know, there are towns in this state and towns across the Midwest where the major industry is still - if not auto making itself, is still something relative to auto making.",
        "There are some places where the economies just are not as diverse at all.",
        "They've never been diversified at all, like they have been on the coast or in other places, where you've had some manufacturing that went bust years ago.",
        "The auto industry didn't go away at the time that, you know, some other manufacturing operations went away - like textiles, for example.",
        "There was a huge textile industry in Massachusetts and in New England for a long time, but that went away so long ago that it gave those cities and towns that relied on that manufacturing base the opportunity to really diversify their job base and their economic base.",
        "And that just never happened in some of these places that rely on the automotive industry because the big car makers were still producing and selling cars.",
        "Now, that's sort of come home to roost in a lot of these places, and that's why there's so much drama around this bailout.",

        "The demand has gone down because nobody is producing anything.",
