        "In recent months, Grey's was doing just that.",
        "It's not the first drama to depict gay characters, but in this genre, gay is played more for shock value, like the requisite lesbian kiss that one show or another seems to try every sweeps period.",
        "Grey's may have been doing something more provocative by normalizing a gay relationship.",

        "This was in Gourmet, The New York Times, Sunset, Safeway, and it works.",
        "You just take a small turkey--you don't even rinse it because that spreads bacteria--salt and pepper it and it's beautiful.",

        "We are a family with bonds forged over stress, panic and hard work.",

        "The average was only three and a half months, and we know that many deployments are a year or a year-and-a-half or even longer than that.",
