        "There's been, in effect, a turf war going on between Congress and the courts and the president over the right to habeas corpus for years now.",
        "And this is an attempt by Congress to sort of get in the camp of the Supreme Court, get out of the president's court, and say, in effect, this right is too sacred to be suspended at this moment.",
        "Who is behind this bill and what does it say exactly?",
        "Well, it's Senators Leahy and Arlen Specter.",
        "And it's called the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007.",
        "It essentially undoes legislation that was enacted last fall when the Congress more or less overruled the Supreme Court.",
        "In 2006, as you'll remember in the Hamdan case, the Supreme Court said, no, we still have jurisdiction to hear at least pending habeas corpus appeals from so-called enemy combatants.",
        "Shortly thereafter, Congress passed legislation that essentially authorized the military tribunals that were going on at Guantanamo but also stripped the detainees the right to file habeas petition and said even those with pending petitions cannot be heard.",
        "So this would restore that right to so-called enemy combatants, give them that moment to go into court and say I challenge the facts of this detention.",
        "Tell me why I'm here.",
        "How likely is this bill to pass?",
        "And if passed, how likely will it be signed by the president?",
        "Well, we're hearing lots of talk right now of the possibility of a filibuster, and we are also, yes, hearing talk that the president would veto it.",
        "One other timely little note about this, as we start to discuss the possibility of Judge Mukasey being given the attorney general gig, is that he wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal quite recently before his name was officially floated as the president's probable choice in which he essentially said he questioned the wisdom of granting habeas jurisdiction to the folks at Guantanamo.",
        "So he actually has spoken to this issue.",
        "Whether or not that proves to be, you know, something that hangs over his confirmation hearing remains to be seen.",
        "Dahlia Lithwick of Slate.com, thank you.",
        "That's a good question.",
        "When I went into the first book, I thought that there was some rationality about Donald Trump, a method to his madness.",
        "I no longer believe that.",
        "Is that more troubling to you than if he had a grand plan?",
        "It is more troubling, yes.",
        "I mean, we might, in the end, be safer for it.",
        "You know, the narrative when this administration began is that he was a right-wing despot and thug who would bring terrible policies to the United States.",
        "And I think there's probably less of a chance of that because everything shifts from moment to moment, and he has no grand intentions here.",
        "Whatever irrational moment he has now might as well be reversed by another irrational moment to come.",
        "Michael Wolff is the author of \"\"Siege: Trump Under Fire.\"\" Thanks so much."
