        "We're always hiring kids for the summer in a lot of different departments, but consistency in finding kids who actually keep the jobs through the summer is definitely the hardest part.",
        "And is there competition, as we suggested, from older kids and indeed from people who have been out of work for a little while?",
        "There is definitely competition.",
        "Right now we're seeing a lot of older applicants applying, which kind of does kick kids to the curb because we definitely take older applicants who have an open availability before we take kids.",
        "And why is that?",
        "They're just consistently, from what we've seen, we have a better retention rate with them.",
        "They don't quit once school is back in session.",
        "So it's just an easier hire for us, and it's a better retention rate with older applicants.",
        "But is there - every summer, I assume your business picks up precisely because there's no school.",
        "Yes.",
        "And so the summer hires, there's a need every summer for extra workers.",
        "Yes.",

        "Joining us now is Andrew Sum, a professor of economics and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, co-author of the report \"\"The Dismal State of the Nation's Teen Summer Job Market, 2009-2011 and the Outlook for the Summer of 2012,\"\" the report from which we cribbed many of our facts.",
        "And Andrew Sum, nice of you to be with us.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And before we spread more gloom, there are some areas that are more positive?",
        "Well there are and are both industries and states, as well, because a lot, surprisingly, depends on - your ability to get a summer job depends upon, you know, where you live.",
        "So if you happen to live in the right state, large parts of the rural Midwest and the Rocky Mountain regions, you know, teenagers have been - continue to be employed at high rates.",
        "But in our biggest states and our biggest cities, Neal, it's a radically different situation.",
        "So both geographically, income-wise and geographically within state-wise, there is tremendous variability in terms of young people's ability to get jobs.",
        "But just as a little follow-up to the previous caller, Neal, there's a little story I think that our facts back this up.",
        "If you and I go back 40 years now, because I've been tracking this, you know, to see what was happening, we were testifying on it before the Congress a few years back on this, but if you and I went back to the late '60s, '70s, even through the early '80s, what you would find is that during the summer, there was what we would call a large summer job market.",
        "That is, employers from June to August would end up hiring, on average, about four percent more workers than they had in the late spring and winter of that year.",
        "So that you and come out of school and are looking for a job, you and I would find that there are plenty of job opportunities that are available to you."

        "Well, I work at a pet supply store, and they pay minimum wage, and it's just a regular job, pretty much.",
        "And what was the key to getting the job, do you think?",
        "Well, you try to start with the source, in other words the place the burn began.",
        "And much like any other investigation - and in particular in arson cases because they disappear so quickly, in other words the fire is eating away at your evidence, and then unfortunately, the firefighters destroy a lot of your evidence - it's to get into the scene as soon as possible to determine exactly maybe if it was arson or what was the source of the fire, and where did it start.",
        "And is that more difficult in a building or in a forest?",
        "I think it's a little more difficult in a forest, although it's reasonably easy to sort of determine where it started.",
        "Now, why it started or how it started is something - is a different color.",
        "But I think the short answer is maybe a little harder but not impossible.",
        "What tells you, for example, where a forest fire started?",
        "What are the clues you look for?",
        "Well, you're looking for the most intense burn area to start.",
        "In other words, if you have an aerial view of a fire, it obviously started at a particular location, and typically those fires are reported fairly early.",
        "I mean, it may have been burning for an hour or two.",
        "So the investigators, the initial firefighters on the scene sort of know where to go to start a fire line.",
        "And so you have an idea, but clearly the wind is blowing the fire around.",
        "There's so many environmental factors.",
        "Oh you're exactly right.",
        "And one of the big problems, obviously, in investigating an outdoor fire is that it will go on maybe for days or in some cases weeks, as you just talked about.",
        "So the real question is as it's going on, as it's eating away at more forest and more acreage, how can you really figure out - and you need to really go back to where you believe the origin was, and just like any other investigation, you start to peel that back.",
        "One of the keys in arson investigation is the first responders because the first people on the scene see it before anybody has touched it.",
        "Does anything not look right?",
        "Is there accelerant that they can smell?",
        "What is the color of the smoke?"

        "For example, gasoline that burns sort of yellow but the smoke is black.",
        "Maybe that was used in - those types of things.",
        "What did the initial first responders seen at the scene?",
        "Did they see somebody standing around?",
        "Did they see a car drive away?",
        "Are there logical witnesses that may have seen something prior to the fire starting?",
        "I think there are also probably things you can start ruling out.",
        "Was there a thunderstorm in the area?",
        "Were there power lines down?",
        "Those kinds...",
        "Of course because when you walk up to it, unless it's obvious, there's a big propane tank laying in the middle of the forest, you're going to have to whittle away.",
        "Of course you're going to maybe go there with initial weather reports.",
        "Maybe there was a lightning strike the night before that could have logically started it.",
        "But once you get to that general origin, figuring out whether it's arson or not is - I'm not saying you can always do that, but many times you can do that.",
        "How?",
        "Based on a number of things that I've already said, what they will do is they will collect at the original site, or close to the original site, for example embers of wood.",
        "They will try to collect samples so they can go back to the lab, and they vacuum-seal all of this stuff, take it back to the lab to see if they can pull an accelerant off of it.",
        "There's a separation chromatography system, where they can pull it up and check the vapors and determine possibly what the accelerant was.",
        "Also the way the fire burns can sometimes tell them, maybe a little less so in a forest but clearly in a house or a structure.",
        "The way the fire jumps around will tell them do they have more than one spot.",
        "You've probably heard the term pour patterns, where people pour at various locations, those light up a different way.",
        "And when the initial firefighters get to the scene, they can tell the arson investigator look, we think you might have three or four different hotspots at this location.",
        "You will then go to those.",
        "You will look - if it's in a house, for example, you would look underneath the carpeting if you think that was a spill.",
        "It may have been splashed on the wall.",
        "It will burn down a certain way.",
        "It'll flow a certain way under the carpet, again, telltale signs of possible arson.",
        "And I've read that even when you do detect arson, these are very difficult crimes to solve.",
        "They are because first of all, you have to figure out who did it, for starters.",
        "Now, you can go through the list of the motivators of why people set fires, from revenge to insurance fraud to covering up a crime.",
        "A lot of the stuff I work, the violent crime stuff in D.C., arson became parts of it because they burned cars up, they burned houses up to cover up evidence, whether it be biological evidence or evidence to a crime."

        "So someone who does it for monetary gain is not going to fit a typical profile.",
        "They don't really care so much about fire, they're just doing this, you know, to accomplish a job.",
        "But there is a profile, a psychological profile of people who enjoy or compulsively are drawn to setting fires in order to see something burn or just enjoy watching smoke and flames and fire.",
        "And typically we're talking about someone who's, developmentally speaking, extremely immature.",
        "It's kind of a primitive way of acting out a host of issues, one of which is obviously rage.",
        "So a lot of times you interview these guys, and they have an ax to grind, they have some issue that they have not accomplished in terms of trying to solve from their earlier lives, and they find fire as a way of really exercising a certain amount of power.",
        "They enjoy the pageantry of setting the fire and perhaps even watching people, such as, you know, firemen and police arrive at a scene and the commotion and the noise and the, you know, the bells and whistles that accompany all this are really quite exciting.",
        "And in a perverse way empowering the individual who really is thrilled by what they're doing.",
        "It is reduced, and, you know, I would tend to think that most of those fires are started by accident.",
        "I'm not suggesting that one couldn't start it on purpose for whatever reason, but I don't think you're going to get the same type of excitement and drama and theater that you get in an urban or suburban setting.",
        "But I'm sure some of the same core elements may well be the same if someone consciously and willfully sets a fire, you know, in a rural area or in a forest just because they want to watch just this tremendous blaze erupt.",
        "But I tend to think because, you know, people are camping, and there are lots of reasons why people might be in the forest and start fires for legitimate reasons that do get out of control.",
        "People are drinking, perhaps, you know, it wasn't their intention to start this terrible fire, but nonetheless it gets started.",
        "Brad Garrett, how do you tell the difference between an accident or arson in that case?"
