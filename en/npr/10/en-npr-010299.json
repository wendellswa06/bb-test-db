        "Well, a couple different ways.",
        "One is can you actually, as I mentioned earlier, determine if there's some sort of accelerant or obvious foul play, so to speak, at a particular scene?",
        "To go back to the forest scenario, I would agree with him that it's a greater likelihood that it's more of an accident than maybe it's actually set, although there have been, and there are a number of - there's one in Colorado, I think it's presently under investigation.",
        "A serial arsonist in western Colorado, yeah.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So I think one of the plusses, if you're a guy who likes to set fires, and it's to a forest, is you get to watch it for a lot of days or weeks.",
        "It isn't like the house or building fire or car fire that in a few hours it's gone.",
        "So you can sort of continue to get whatever high you're getting off of it for a long time.",
        "And I wanted - by the way, if you are involved in fire investigation, give us a call.",
        "What's the most important thing you've ever learned about arson?",
        "800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And N.G.",
        "Berrill, as we look at this case, you mentioned developmentally challenged people.",
        "I've also read that maybe those are just the ones who get caught.",
        "Yeah, well, when I say developmentally challenged, I didn't mean intellectually.",
        "What I was suggesting is that emotionally, they're fairly primitive.",
        "In other words, these are people who have not developed sufficiently to be able to express issues of conflict, rage, feelings of powerlessness in a way that's productive and helpful to them so that they rely on this rather perverse ritual of starting fires as a way of kind of puffing themselves up, feeling - it gives them a sense of excitement, power, mastery over the environment.",
        "And really, you know, I mean there is, in a weird kind of way, if you're setting the fire, you have an accelerant, and you get a warehouse burning, you know, it's quite a scene that unfolds.",
        "So a person who is grossly inadequate, who really has very little say in his life, calls very few shots, can watch this with some pleasure, and, you know, the more malevolent and the more psychopathic I guess, you know, the more frightening these people are.",
        "Even as the Waldo Canyon Fire burned, there were rumors, and I think they were no more than rumors, but concerns that it was an arson fire, but we don't know.",
        "The investigation is continuing there.",
        "As mentioned, there is an investigation underway as authorities in another part of the state try to identify a serial arsonist who set several forest fires.",
        "We want to get inside the mind of an arsonist today and talk about how fire investigations proceed.",
        "If you've been involved in these investigations, call and tell us the most important thing that you've learned about arson, 800-989-8255.",

        "Great, well, I was a wild land firefighter through college, and one thing that I found out, there was a grandmother who ended up being an arsonist.",
        "She was the grandmother of another firefighter and wanted to make sure that her grandson got enough overtime to get money for whatever it is that he needed to do.",
        "And so she set a fire?",
        "She set a fire, several of them actually, and there was actually a couple - another firefighter that got caught setting fires, essentially doing the same thing so that he would have enough overtime to - who knows what.",
        "And those are obviously unusual cases.",
        "I hope no one was hurt in any of those fires.",
        "Not that I'm aware of, but, you know, I think just recently here in Utah, there was a firefighter that was arrested for doing the exact same thing.",
        "There's a couple of points in there, but thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it.",
        "And one of them is, N.G.",
        "Berrill, a grandmother, that doesn't seem to fit the profile.",
        "Yeah, but, you know, as was pointed out, the reason for setting the fire was instrumental.",
        "In other words, this is not someone who is fixated by fire or is sexually aroused by fire or anything like that.",
        "And in essence, her reason for setting the fire was for financial gain.",
        "So, you know, if - I don't know if there would be a good analogy, but if, you know, her grandson worked at the zoo, and she let a lion out of the cage, it would be the same kind of thing.",
        "You know, overtime is overtime.",
        "So that's a financial motivation."

        "And Brad Garrett, a forest firefighter starting a fire.",
        "Oh absolutely, or an arson investigator.",
        "I think one of the more famous cases, in fact Joseph Wambaugh wrote a book called \"\"Fire Lover,\"\" is about Captain John Orr.",
        "From '84 to '91, he was a captain with the Glendale Police Department in California.",
        "They think he set over 2,000 fires, from outdoor fires to indoor fires to cars.",
        "And he would actually set fires, and in one of them, there was a fatality because it was like a Lowe's home lumber-type place, and it killed at least one child.",
        "And it was not ruled arson.",
        "And he in fact went back and argued that it was arson.",
        "And so they eventually got enough evidence to put it together.",
        "But he would show up obviously at every scene because he wanted to work all these fires that he had set.",
        "Wow, I assume that's been made into a movie?",
        "I don't know about a movie but certainly into a book.",
        "OK, and as you look at - that must be almost impossible to figure out.",
        "Well, it took a long time.",
        "One of the ways they got onto him was that he used the same type of accelerant to start the fire, and he also used the same, like a set of matches with a rubber band wrapped around it, and they eventually were able, because of things he started to say...",
        "The problem with people like that, that are sort of psychologically driven, and the doctor can jump in on this, to set these fires is then they get too involved.",
        "And when you get too involved, you then make mistakes.",
        "And he started to make several, and the other arson investigators said look, this guy knows too much, he's responding too much.",
        "And so they started a surveillance on him and eventually caught him setting fires.",
        "Well, let's turn to N.G.",
        "Merrill(ph), then - Berrill, then, excuse me, and the - one would think those psychologically motivated would tend to do this alone so they don't have accomplices to rat them out.",
        "Well, that's usually the case.",
        "This is a private act that reflects tremendous pleasure.",
        "It's really quite self-indulgent and yet compulsive.",
        "So in essence, you're not going to really choose someone to do this with you unless you're a couple of kids.",
        "I mean, that's where I've seen people working together.",
        "It isn't adults so much who are getting pleasure from it, but it's boys, adolescent boys, who just like playing with fire, and of course things get out of control."

        "I mean, the other dimension, too, that I've run across with firefighters is that it's not so much that they're doing this for overtime, but there's a desire to be a hero.",
        "It's sort of analogous to the physician sort of providing too much medicine or a nurse too much medicine to a patient then rescuing them.",
        "You know, they enjoy that drama, as well, you know, the idea that life is somehow so mundane that they can revel in becoming heroes.",
        "So again, they are first on the scene because they set the fire, and they know precisely what the deal is because they're the architect of this crime.",
        "So the motivation there is yet slightly different.",
        "It's not so much that they revel in the fire and that it excites them so, but they really want to be - they want the accolades and the attention that the community can give when, you know, you're a hero.",

        "I'm in Tucson, Arizona, and I believe it was 2004, maybe 2005, there was a very damaging wild land fire up in the White Mountains, it was called the Rodeo-Chediski Fire, and it was two separate fires that later combined, making one gigantic wild land blaze.",
        "First, I believe the Rodeo fire was set by a government employee, it was out of distress: She received a very distressful letter and burned it, I believe, and the fire quickly started and became out of control.",
        "And the second one, the Chediski, was started by a firefighter who perhaps - it was definitely a financial motive, but anyway, it was to have some work on the fire.",
        "So, you know, these things can start, as I say, through distress, financial motivation.",
        "They can be vengeful.",
        "So there's all types of ways they can begin, which would basically say that in order to alleviate that would be very difficult because, you know, they're individually started in remote areas.",

        "Sure, thanks very much.",
        "N.G.",
        "Berrill, upset, people who are very upset.",
        "I think there was another case of a forest ranger dumped by her boyfriend who burned the dear-Jane letter, and that started the fire.",
        "Right, in cases like that, I would describe that as inadvertent.",
        "You know, nonetheless a fire ensues, but this is not the intent or the motive of the person.",
        "You know, they're burning a letter.",
        "They're so upset, and they don't really pay attention to the details, and they toss it in a bin, and it goes up in smoke or whatever.",
        "But the point is they're not enjoying the fire, and their goal isn't again to revel in the pageantry of all the, you know, law enforcement and firefighters coming out.",
        "These are just unfortunate byproducts of, you know, someone who's not paying attention very carefully, and, you know, there are flames involved.",
        "So it just sort of drives home the point that a lot of times, some terrible things can occur when people are not paying attention, playing purposely, consciously with fire or not.",
        "Brad Garrett, we've been, because of this situation in Colorado and other states where wild land fires are burning, talking a lot about outdoor fires.",
        "Indoor fires, is the science advancing?",
        "I know there was a case in Texas where arson investigators first believed that it was a case of arson, and then it was found not to be later.",
        "Yes, that's exactly right.",
        "There was a case in Texas several years ago where a gentleman by the last name of Willingham was convicted of killing his two children that burned up in the house and was sentenced to death, was on death row.",
        "The defense hired a bunch of experts, science experts, forensic experts that went back and totally disproved that it was arson, that it was a faulty heater.",
        "And things like burn patterns and things that the original arson investigators believed was intentional, pours around the house, ended up not being that.",
        "And unfortunately, Governor Perry didn't buy it and allowed him to be executed.",
