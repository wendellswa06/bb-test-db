        "There are cases.",
        "It's - to a certain extent, it's an inexact science because things that may appear on the surface one way end up being tested in a lab a different way.",
        "And again, you're dealing with the fundamental problem of the fire burning up a lot of the evidence, and then as you say, particularly in a structure fire, the firefighters destroying the rest of it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But one of the keys, Neal, is to get beyond maybe the forensics of what happened.",
        "Clearly, that is important.",
        "But understanding the alleged perpetrator what would have been his motivation to burn up the house, why did he - for example, did Willingham even want to kill his kids.",
        "Those kind of things and all of the conversations that went around him and the people around him end up, to me, being just as important maybe as the forensics as to did he do it or did he not.",
        "So detective work is just as important?",
        "Detective work - arson investigation is detective work with the - a little bit of a different forensic hook.",
        "Let's see if we get another caller in.",

        "Good morning, Neal.",
        "Hi.",
        "Neal, I'd like to point out there are significant differences between a structure fire arson investigation and wild land arson investigation.",
        "For instance, in wild land, the perpetrator seldom uses an accelerant - don't really need one because you have plenty of readily available fuel.",
        "Also, a wild land arsonist very typically will use a delay device to give him time to get out of the area.",
        "As far as point of origin search, that's one of the keys in wild land investigation.",
        "By analyzing char patterns on rocks, fence posts, tree trunks, you can actually trace the point of origin of the fire back to where it started.",
        "And finally, when we're doing arson investigation for wild land, we look for patterns.",
        "I had a case one time where I went back over several years, and I found that every third Tuesday we had a set and eventually tracked it back to the perpetrator and it tied back to when he got his paycheck.",
        "And then he would get drunk, and then he would set a fire.",
        "And this went on for several years before we're able to nail him down."

        "I've not heard that expression before, a set, somebody set a fire.",
        "Yes.",
        "And - so you finally found that person.",
        "How did you find him?",
        "We equipped all our response vehicles with tape recorders, and we did a time-distance study on every car that we passed responding into the area, and we tied it back.",
        "And we also recorded license plates, and we were able to tie it back to him that way.",
        "Then we were able to find the tire tracks that he left in the dirt and make a cast of that and match it to a tire on his vehicle.",
        "So a combination of good detective slogging work and some forensics too.",
        "Yes.",
        "And as the previous caller pointed out, one of the first places we looked is within our own ranks be it structural or wild land because we have a problem there occasionally with wild land or a structure firefighter that sets it for the action to be a hero, so to speak, or sometimes to tap into the overtime.",
        "And did you ever discover someone within your own ranks?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "Yup.",
        "I sure did.",
        "And what kind of fires was he setting?",
        "He was setting brush fires, and he was a seasonal employee.",
        "And he set them just for the excitement of fighting the fire.",
        "And in his presentence - during the presentence period, he asked me if he - after he served his time in prison, if he could back and work for us as a firefighter again.",
        "I told him I didn't think so."

        "Berrill, who's a forensic psychologist, director of New York Forensics, a psychiatric consulting firm in New York.",
        "Also with us Brad Garrett, a retired FBI agent and now an ABC News crime and terrorism consultant, who runs his own private investigation firm.",

        "Berrill.",
        "As you look, how much do we actually know about - since relatively few of these guys seem to get caught, do you think that we have a pretty good profile?",
        "Well, in some respects, I mean, no profile is airtight.",
        "I mean, the one thing you learn when doing - working in forensic psychology, at least, is that there are types, but each situation necessitates taking a careful look at the person involved.",
        "And, you know, typically, what I've been able to do when I've talked to people who've set fires or have been arrested for that, is, you know, to discern whether there are commonalities, but moreover, it's always interesting to hear what it is they have to say about themselves and why they would be setting fires.",
        "So, you know, there are some general aspects to who these people are.",
        "As I said, highly - emotionally immature, impulsive, powerlessness, shortsighted, you know, looking for the immediate thrill, not understanding necessarily that what they're involved in has consequences, terrible consequences for people who might be hurt seriously or killed in the fire.",
        "But you'd be amazed how many adolescents, guys in their 20s I've seen who have set fires, and you don't really think about those things.",
        "They enjoy the, you know, as I said earlier, the pageantry of setting a fire, watching it expand, they get a really kick out of it, makes them feel great.",
        "And then, you know, if they stick around, some of them to watch what happens afterwards, there are some real pleasure in that.",
        "I've seen several different scenarios, but those are some of the common threads, at least.",
        "Here's an email from Gretchen(ph).",
        "My family and I were in Redmond, Washington, last Thanksgiving and went to a local park and playground.",
        "We went to wash our hands in a public restroom and noticed it was filled with smoke.",
        "Once the firefighters responded, two adolescent boys came over, asked what happened and then played on the playground before walking away.",
        "They seemed suspicious, so we alerted the chief.",
        "The boys were caught and confessed, but what amazed us is why on Earth they came back.",
        "Had they not come back to see the mess, they never would have been caught.",
        "But, N.G.",
        "Berrill, as you were just saying, that's why they set it in the first place.",
        "Well, yeah, I mean, you know, it's - if you walk away after you set the fire and don't get to watch what happens afterwards, you know, that's only half the thrills, I guess.",
        "So for these kids, for example, they get to enjoy, I guess, the fruits of their labor.",
        "They find it exciting to watch the commotion.",
        "They don't really think about how it's potentially going to hurt or kill someone, and they want to see it.",
        "That's part of the pleasure.",
        "Well, thanks very much for your time today.",

        "Is that what you're doing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Our theory of change is to flip that on its head for progressives.",
        "So conservatives have traditionally had this view that they want to build and invest and focus at the state level where progressives and Democrats have really centralized and tried try to build their power in Washington, D.C.",
        "And I think that that theory has had negative implications for and negative consequences for Democrats and progressives across the country.",
        "So if you're going to go to work in the states, what states?",
        "We actually have a 50-state view on this.",
        "Our group does not think that you can just write off whole swaths of the country.",
        "You look now after the election, Kentucky, the House there lost Democratic control.",
        "And after that, we no longer, as progressives, have one state legislative chamber in the entire South.",
        "You can probably count on one hand the number of state-level elected officials in the entire South.",

        "It's not that there's progressive-minded people there.",
