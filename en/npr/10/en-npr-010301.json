        "Hi, Mary Louise.",
        "So unlike some earlier meetings that we've been watching between the president and congressional leaders, this one was behind closed doors.",
        "Do we actually know what happened, what they talked about?",
        "You heard that rosy assessment from the president.",
        "He called it a very productive meeting and said they've agreed to continue talks over the weekend.",
        "Democrats sounded a little less positive about the prospects for a quick resolution.",
        "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described today's session as sometimes contentious.",
        "And she and her fellow Democrats all say it's hard to see a path to compromise unless and until the government is fully reopened.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Services are being withheld from the American people.",
        "Paychecks are being held - withheld from people who serve the needs of the American people.",
        "And our border security will suffer if we do not resolve this issue.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "You know, like I look back, I mean, I had many different jobs before I took my first teen job, but I remember my first teen job was working in the summer at the grocery store, you know, doing the bagging, the checkout counter, et cetera.",
        "And a lot of the work I was doing, Neal, was helping substitute for people that were, you know, away for the summer for vacation.",
        "And when I spent my years working at U.S.",
        "Steel, five years, every summer, I'd come out of high school, come out of college, go work at U.S.",
        "Steel, we would get summer employment year-round - I mean, all summer to help fill in that regard.",
        "So - and by the way, Neal, the size of this, the last thing on here, the size of this, though, is tremendous because we went from, remember I said four percent of all jobs.",
        "Remember today that would be like six million.",
        "In the last four years, Neal, the summer job market is under one percent difference.",
        "So that's a tremendous difference, and it suggests that not merely that times are tough, but there's been a structural change."

        "Yes, a structural change of overwhelming magnitude, and it got a lot worse in the last four years because - you know, and by the way, it wasn't very good in the early part of the last decade, either.",
        "But when we had so many individuals lose their jobs, we're talking about hiring the older worker, and a lot of older workers came back in, and they'll tell you, you know, quite readily, that a lot of them only want to, you know, supplement their 401(k) or their pension, they want a, you know, short-term job.",
        "And what we do find is that a lot of the jobs that also normally would have gone to teens are now being occupied by all the groups we just described, with 55- to 70-year-olds being a large part of that.",
        "You mentioned location, as with many other things, plays an important part in the ability to get a job.",
        "Income level also?",
        "Yes, extraordinary, Neal.",
        "This is the thing that I think most people always find surprising, but the likelihood that you and I work during the summer actually rises with the level of our family income until you get well over 150,000.",
        "Kids from low-income families, I'm talking about incomes, you know, families with incomes under 20,000, 25,000, work at the lowest rates by far so that the gap between low-income, particularly low-income minority youth and upper-middle-income youth is about four to one, Neal, four times better chance of getting a job if you happen to live in an upper-middle-income family.",
        "And so by the way, also true for many black and Hispanic youths but especially white youths, and you're - the likelihood of you finding a job goes down dramatically when you're low-income.",
        "And part of the reason why that's gotten a lot worse in recent years, Neal, is we used to have these large-scale summer jobs programs to put kids to work.",
        "The federal government put up money, gives state and local governments money, let's go hire young people, put them to work in the summer.",
        "We got rid of that program in 2000.",
        "President Obama brought it back with the stimulus in 2009.",
        "We had about 420,000 kids work that summer.",
        "Congress would not approve it in 2010-2011.",
        "So a number of the jobs that used to be available for young people are also no longer there.",
        "So on top of the private-sector demand, Neal, you've also got this substantial decline in, you know, in public, nonprofit sector demand for young people.",
        "We also tend to think of summer jobs, you know, fast food industry, entertainment, we had the caller from Six Flags, and retail.",
        "Are those still the places where the jobs are?",
        "Yeah, most teenagers still depend on three sectors, including two of the three - in fact all three of the ones you just described, the entertainment, arts, recreation, retail, trade and fast food, accommodations and food service - will hire about seven out of every 10 young people.",
        "And teenagers, unfortunately though, have been largely thrown out of, Neal, finance, insurance, professional services, construction, manufacturing, utilities, transportation.",
        "It is very rare that you will find a young person working in those sectors today just relative to just 10 years ago.",
        "So we're not only, you know, reducing the number of jobs, but we're confining our young people to smaller and smaller sectors with less exposure to what, you know, what jobs really take to do.",
        "And I think that does us all a great disservice because kids don't get the right, you know, soft skills that you want your employees to bring to the job.",
        "They don't get a sense of what people really do on jobs.",
        "So they're making career choices without knowing more about it.",
        "And the last thing that I think is really important, which is the role of having young people become more exposed to adult roles and working with adults in their teenage years so that you could get that interaction, which I think is crucial, rather than having teens spend all their summer in the youth culture, which doesn't build the types of skills or the types of attitudes that we want out our future workforce."

        "Like originally, I just started, like, did the normal thing where I went to the mall, going like store-to-store and asking if they, like, were hiring anything, like trying to get jobs at the grocery store.",
        "And I just wasn't finding anything.",
        "So then after a while, I just got desperate, and I went on, like, probably around like one in the morning, went onto like monster.com and Craigslist and just started, like, posting to the most random jobs, like even things like - stuff that I didn't really think that I would be qualified for or just completely out-there stuff, not what you would typically consider a summer job.",
        "And I ended up, like, that's how I found - I have a job right now working - I do like direct sales for companies, trying to sell them office supplies.",
        "So the shot-in-the-dark principle.",
        "Well, the key, I believe, that was the most important factor was presentation, just presentation at the interview."

        "I feel like I'm getting a lot of experience, and I'm doing a job that I feel like looks a lot better on my resume than the normal retail job.",

        "In the years following World War II, more than half of U.S.",
        "teenagers spent their summers working as soda jerks, movie theater ushers and elevator operators, and sure, some of the jobs kids did back in the '40s and '50s have gone the way of the girdle, but there's more to it.",
        "These days, summer hiring falls short of 30 percent, a post-World War II low.",
        "Of course, the drop is due in part to the incredibly tight job market even for low-wage jobs, but it's also part of a larger trend of companies cutting seasonal hiring in favor of employees who can work year-round.",
        "If you've landed a summer job, what worked?",
        "And if you're looking for summer help, or you used to, what's changed?",

        "Well, it's good to be back, Neal, thank you.",
        "And is there any rule for somebody looking for a summer job?",
        "What kind of - how do you make yourself look attractive to an employer?",
        "Well, in fact, that isn't - that's the trick, to make yourself attractive.",
        "But let me begin the conversation by suggesting to you that the entire job market is in the process of a very dramatic restructuring.",
        "And a part of what's happening is that there's a new job market out there.",
        "And to participate requires something different and something new, and I think that's what people are going to have to get used to.",
        "And the fact that our Congress can't get itself together to provide some transition assistance to this new economy is just really unfortunate.",
        "Well, I wanted to read you this email we have from Pamela in Corvallis, Oregon: My teenage daughter submitted dozens of applications for summer jobs around town.",
        "She's continually told she does not have the experience they're looking for, so they're not going to hire her.",
        "How is she supposed to get work experience, whether it's retail, restaurant, customer service or anything, if no one will give her an opportunity?",
        "Well, the answer to that one is pretty easy because you don't need to use that as an excuse anymore.",
        "When you go to someone, and they say, you know, gee, we really want someone with experience, you should be able to say, you know, they told me that last summer, and so what I did is I went out and I volunteered, and I made sure that I developed the skills that you are looking for and that you will find useful if you hire me this summer.",
        "And I would suggest that in that kind of market, you really do want to get into a volunteer position.",
        "And what kind of volunteer positions are you talking about?",
        "Almost any position that you have an opportunity to make a contribution to the organization.",
        "And that could be at your local church, it could be at the local hospital.",
        "There are plenty of opportunities there.",
        "That could be at any of the not-for-profits.",
        "There are - just almost anyplace that uses volunteer support or does public service can use volunteer help.",
        "And how early, how young should you start out?",
        "I don't want to be glib, but, you know, outside of early, the answer is as early as possible.",
        "In fact, one of the notes I have here to myself is for people who are looking for a job, the trick to this thing is to in fact start early.",
        "And if you start early in terms of a summer job or a specific summer job or early in terms of your own chronological age, the earlier you start, to a certain extent, the better."
