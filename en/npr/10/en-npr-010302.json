        "And I just want to get back to volunteering for just a moment.",
        "There are a lot of people who will say wait a minute, this is a rip-off.",
        "I'm getting paid nothing, I'm going to work every day, and I could be having a good time with my friends.",
        "Sure, if I'm getting paid, that's one thing, but volunteering?",
        "Well, that's a part of the reality of the new job market.",
        "If you see community service as a rip-off, you've got a long row to hoe in terms of fitting in to this economy, because the truth of the matter is public service still has a certain cache and ring to it that will not only help you help your community, but it'll also help you help yourself.",
        "And so I would encourage people who have that kind of attitude to get a little bit of an adjustment.",
        "I encourage them to go to some of the agencies that provide public service and look at the tremendous work that they do in terms of helping the community.",
        "And that notion of being out there and helping the community is something that deserves their attention, if for no other reason than it will help us become a better place in which to live.",

        "Are you looking for a summer job?",
        "Did you find one?",
        "I did find a summer job this year, actually, and it wasn't too difficult, in my opinion.",
        "That, the way you dress is certainly, I believe, one of the aspects that got me hired, also how you respond to the questions that are asked."

        "What do you mean by that?",
        "Well, you can - a lot of people, they don't, I guess, the difference between the people that get hired and don't get hired is just the amount of effort that they necessarily want to put into the interview.",
        "Like, when someone asks you a question, a potential boss asks you a question, you know, you want to basically formulate a response that's, I believe, as responsible and mature as you can make it sound and basically sell yourself.",
        "All right, well Jonah, good luck in the pet store this summer.",
        "Thank you.",
        "All right.",
        "Here's an - you were about to say something, I'm sorry, Bill?",
        "Yeah, Neal, I'd like to respond to that because the caller is actually onto something.",
        "On the way over here, I did a little survey of some of the local establishments, restaurants and the like, who may be hiring for the summer.",
        "And I asked them the question: When you're hiring, what are you looking for, for people who are applying for jobs?",
        "And while this is very unscientific, I thought the responses resonated with a lot of what the last caller had to say.",
        "The first and most frequent thing I heard is that they really tend to hire people who are referrals from a trusted source.",
        "But down the line, they want someone who is respectful and polite, someone who is reliable, that is they show up to work, and they show up on time.",
        "They have good references.",
        "They're a self-starter, that is someone who when there's 10 minutes left to go in the shift, they don't just stop and watch the clock go by.",
        "That's the time for them to go out and maybe clean a couple tables before they leave.",
        "And they're looking for someone whose appearance is neat and someone who is respectful.",

        "I mean, it's really disheartening because out of 150 kids, we have about three that we can keep.",
        "So I don't think that the job market - because we've been doing this, my company, for the past 15 years.",
        "But we used to have kids, out of 150, we could keep say 50, 75, and this year it's down to three.",
        "Down to three.",
        "So what do you do to make up the difference?",
        "We just hire people that have experience, or we go to the community colleges, and we do internship programs there.",
        "And at the interview process, do you point out to these kids - I mean, clearly they should have learned it before then, but point out that, you know, there are certain rules around here?",
        "They know that when they come in.",

        "And there's also this sense of instant gratification.",
        "Like, I don't feel like coming to work, so I'm not going to.",

        "We only interview minorities, and the problem is, is that they don't have the basic skills to - I mean, even faxing and emailing, answering phone calls, things like that are - we struggle so much with that that literally there are three children that are going to work on our summer program this year.",

        "And I'm not making excuses by any stretch of the imagination, but I've got to tell you, being poor is tough.",
        "And when someone comes and they don't have the basic skills, the question is, what are we going to do as a general society, to help them develop those skills?",
        "What kind of feedback mechanisms are we providing to the schools to say, let's talk about the kids you just sent us, and what can we do to put in place programs and opportunities - and that goes back to Congress - so that these kids can begin to get some experiences and develop those skills?",
        "Because I've got to tell you, even the kids coming out of college today sometimes don't have the skill sets that we're talking about.",
        "And if you talk to the CEOs and talk to the recruiters, they cannot get students of all races who have basic interpersonal and interviewing skills and they can't get them to demonstrate that.",

        "And so we have started now hopefully preparing her for the job - summer job market.",
        "We signed her up for a volunteer program at our local science center, and they're actually doing the training and - the training for the job.",
        "And she'll volunteer this summer and actually get high school credit for it next year, this coming school year.",
        "And then I've also - we've - she's also joined a local swim team, and in doing so we told her that this may dovetail right into going into being a lifeguard.",

        "And she's taken (unintelligible) for the last several years.",
        "And I said - I've already had her at a couple of Christmas parties last year, and I said this would be a great way to make money as you get older.",
        "So we're already trying to be proactive now, seeing that the market has changed so tremendously over these last years that we want to help prepare her.",
        "So, now, whether that will work out, I'll let you know in a few years.",
        "But...",
        "OK.",
        "But it sounds like you're on the right - does your daughter's school have a public service requirement?",
        "Well, it's not a requirement.",
        "We just happen to find out that she - they did have a program that we could contact the counselor of the school.",
        "And they worked with several organizations in our area, and they happened to work with the science - our local science center, and she's very interested in science.",
        "And so the two have worked together, the two organizations, and she now just had her orientation last week to be a volunteer.",
        "And I told her that, you know, this would be a great thing for you to do not only for the high school - the credit in high school, but also, you know, you're going to work there a few years and if you show that you can - you know, how to be responsible with these children that are in these little summer camps and - because that's what she'll be doing is working with younger children and helping the teachers in these summer camps at the science center - I said, you know, down the road this could very easily lead to employment if you, you know, show that you are responsible enough to do this.",
