        "Nonetheless, Sheryl, this must be a moment when there is an increase in tension between the New York City police and some of the communities of color.",
        "How do you see things playing out whether it's mediation from the mayor or mediation of the situation by the police officers?",
        "Well, you know, this goes back to something that Robert said, you know, quoting Judge Cooperman as saying, carelessness is not a crime.",
        "And when you have cases like this, and we've seen them before, the cops will say, you know, well, we were - we have to act on the spur of the moment and we were feared for our life.",
        "But, you know, carelessness is a crime when you are cop carrying a gun and you start shooting at people.",
        "You start firing (unintelligible) and people start dying and get seriously injured.",
        "And, you know, the sad thing is that we continue to have - I think every case has to be judged on its own particular set of facts, but when you continue having these situations where you have black men who are found not to be doing anything illegal, not to have a weapon, and the cops fear them and fear their lives are in danger, generally I think because they are black men and cops - you have cops who fear black men and just suddenly think they are in danger because they see black men and these people who are not doing anything illegal wind up dead.",
        "That is a serious problem.",
        "There's going to be repercussions, you're going to almost definitely have some kind of civil judgment, the city, the taxpayers are going to wind up paying millions of dollars, probably, to the Sean Bell family and to the - his two friends who were injured and that's probably appropriate…yes?",
        "Let me get Cynthia in here, are there any echoes of this case in something that might have happened in South Carolina or your region?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",

        "is declaring that Opposition Leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the presidency.",
        "Now, some say the U.S.",
        "didn't do enough when the election problems first started and Cynthia when it comes to situations like this, where there have been historic tensions between Zimbabwe and the U.S., should the U.S.",
        "get involved, and if so, how?",
        "Well, you know, I think certainly the United States, as other powerful nations, have a responsibility to the rest of the world when they think they see injustices particularly injustices that relate to human injustices.",
        "We see so much going on there in terms of so many people hungry, so many people homeless, and so many people being inflicted actually themselves by all of the confusion that's going on there.",
        "However, when I talked to my friends from that region, they say that the United State should not.",
        "They indicate that while the United States may feel as if it's big brother coming to the rescue, western influence is perhaps the biggest problem that countries like Zimbabwe face.",
        "Sheryl, when you are looking at the situation - we're hearing now about violence, Zimbabwe police have raided the headquarters of the opposition and of independent election observers.",
        "They're taking away voting materials, reportedly police have also arrested and beaten hundreds of people.",
        "Now, in addition to that, China sent a shipment of weapons to Zimbabwe but for nearly a week the ship was detained in different ports in Africa.",
        "So, it appears the ship's on its way back to China due to this boycott.",
        "When you look at the violence on the ground but the fact that arms were not able to reach the country, is it at least the glass half full?"

        "Well, I think it's certainly appropriate for the - I don't know if it's half full or half empty, I think it's a very bad situation and that Mr. Mugabe who's headed the country for 28 years cannot step aside and let somebody else run it for a change, but I do think it's appropriate for the United States certainly to express its deep dissatisfaction, its criticism of what President Mugabe's refusal to release the results of the election, what his party is doing against the opposition party, and I think it would be appropriate certainly to have some kind of boycott to say that this denial of human rights is really something that we don't want to support and that we are really strongly against.",
        "I'm going to move on to yet another topic because it's all fast-paced on this Friday.",
        "Cynthia, Republican nominee John McCain is on a week long tour, often being called the poverty tour, he is taking time trying to reach out to black voters.",

        "Do you think this is going to pan out for McCain in terms of having reach to non-traditional Republican voters, let us just put it that way.",
        "Well, one thing's for certain, McCain's got a lot of time to kill, and I don't know that it's not a good use of time for him to go on to African-American communities and to hear with people are thinking and what people are feeling.",
        "I can't imagine people not appreciating, that especially if he goes to it with a degree of sincerity.",

        "When it comes down to it, the candidates that are coming to our communities, whether it's Clinton or Obama, we normally don't see them either.",
        "So, I think it's not a bad thing for him to reach to African-American people and to reach out to people and hear what they are thinking and feeling.",
        "Sheryl, yesterday McCain toured the Ninth Ward in New Orleans criticizing the Bush administration about its slow response after Katrina.",
        "He called that slow reaction, terrible and disgraceful.",
        "Now, Bush and McCain have had a long, tense history at points.",
        "They were once competitors for the presidential nomination.",
        "Do you think now that with McCain going into the election being the candidate, getting the president's endorsement, they're going to put those issues behind them and work as a team maybe even the current president going on the stump for McCain?",
        "Oh, I definitely do, you know, because the Republicans want to win again and they're going to have to pull together in this election.",
        "So, I do think that they're going to put some of that behind them and you're going to see Bush out there for McCain.",
        "But you just - following up on what Cynthia said, I think it is, you know McCain has a terrible record both for the ACLU, the NAACP and on civil rights issues, and it's amusing to see him down they're buying quilt from the black women in G's band and going to Selma where I gather most of the people who turned out were white and it's probably not going to pan out in terms in votes from black people, but it's good that he is doing that, that he is getting exposed at this late date to what black communities and poor communities of what their concerns are because there is a 50-50 chance that he maybe our president and so it's very important for him to be exposed to that.",
