        "Mr.",
        "Knocke, I looked at some of these pictures online, and I have to tell you, I was somewhat surprised because I think before I had seen them I had imagined kind of these giant, scary-looking fences, but some of these options looked rather simple, almost like something you'd find at Home Depot.",
        "Are you sure that this is going to actually be enough to keep out the people you want to keep out?",
        "Well, it's a great question.",
        "Fencing itself is not going to keep every single determined alien out of the country.",
        "It can certainly slow them up significantly.",
        "So we'll put fencing in areas where the border patrol tells us that they need it to slow up the movement of an illegal alien, sometimes by as much as 20 or 30 minutes, which gives the border patrol enough response time to be able to take that alien into custody.",
        "In other cases, for example, metropolitan areas, virtual fencing has not been as effective for the border patrol in the metropolitan areas.",
        "Traditional fencing is going to be more important because it's going to slow up the alien just enough so that they can take them into custody.",
        "When you're talking about your more desolate or desert areas, virtual fencing is going to be more effective because there are not as many transportation hubs in the dessert.",
        "What that means is that the border patrol can get a signal using that virtual technology that an alien has crossed the border, and they can then determine, at the time and location of their choosing, where they're going to take that alien into custody, well before that alien could ever disappear into the interior.",
        "Sections of this fence will go through federal wildlife refuges, state parks.",
        "A lot of people have raised concerns that building this fence will have a detrimental impact on the environment, that it will destroy native habitat of several different species.",
        "What's your response?",
        "We actually go to great lengths to do environmental assessments before we begin any border construction projects.",
        "That involves coordination, not only with environmental authorities at local and state levels, but also at federal levels, and sometimes with our neighbors on the other side of the border.",
        "That is an important part of the decision-making process for where border infrastructure projects might be built.",
        "Ultimately, we have a responsibility to secure our borders, and so there have been a couple of instances where environmental disputes had languished for several years.",
        "And we, as a department, exercised our authority to waive environmental restrictions and complete construction of fencing in the San Diego area and more recently in the Barry M.",
        "Goldwater Range in Southern Arizona.",
        "So we do have the authority to waive those environmental restrictions.",
        "But even in those cases, ultimately the project itself reflects the appreciation for the environment.",
        "Russ Knocke of the Department of Homeland Security, thanks so much.",
        "Reaction to the proposed border fence has been quite mixed.",
        "We turn now to two men.",
        "They both live in Texas.",
        "They both live in towns where Homeland Security plans to build a fence, but that's where their similarities end.",
        "One of them can't wait for the fence to get there; the other will do just about anything to stop it.",
        "We hear first from Pat Ahumada.",
        "He is the mayor of Brownsville.",
        "That's a city on the southern most tip of Texas where the motto is: On the border by the sea."

        "It attracts people from the northern part of the United States and people from the southern part of the United - Mexico and the northern part of Mexico.",
        "We consider it the crossroads of the hemisphere, tropical climate, and we have about the friendliest people who you're going to find on this planet here.",
        "Now, they've just recently released pictures and some details of what this fence would look like.",
        "Have you had a chance to take a look at those yet?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Symbolically, it's a wrong message to send to our neighbors who we depend on for commerce, and who we've never had a problem with, and who we depend also for tourism.",
        "Our sales tax is the biggest part of our budget here in Brownsville.",
        "What they're proposing is not an effective fence.",
        "I think it's being built just to please mid-America.",
        "Mid-America has a visual picture that a fence will protect them.",
        "I think a physical fence like that will protect them, which is providing a false sense of security.",
        "It's just like a prison.",
        "It's fortifying our city.",
        "What we're providing is to build a weir along the river, which will raise a water level from 12 feet to 26 feet, which make it very difficult to cross because of the currents, along with sophisticated equipment like radar, surveillance equipment, and boots on the ground, will be a more effective virtual fence than what is being proposed to deter any kind of legal activity.",
        "This is a much better - a viable proposal than what Homeland Security is trying to ram down our throats.",
        "Mayor, I understand that some people in your area have been so upset by this proposed fence that they've actually been blocking the work of some of the land surveyors that have been trying to come down to work on it.",
        "Is that true?",
        "Well, they came to us - the city - the city owns a lot of land along the river, which we were hoping to - we build a weir to develop as a river walk (unintelligible) the fence now is going to make it difficult to do that, and it will hurt us economically.",
        "They came and asked for permission to go on our land, and we denied that permission - and rightfully so.",
        "How did they take that denial?",
        "They were very cooperative, very courteous, and you know, we had no problem.",
        "We just told them we're not going to allow it."
