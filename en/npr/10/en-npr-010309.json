        "Hello.",
        "How are you, Alex?",
        "I'm well.",
        "What do you make of this fund-raising total for Fred Thompson?",
        "Well, I think it's damaging, but not fatal at all.",
        "One of the most difficult parts about the preseason now is navigating the fun house mirror world of expectations.",
        "You know, the campaign goes out and says we're going do five, which means they think they can do six and a half, and they ultimately only do three and a half.",
        "So the good news is, it's a lot of money.",
        "The bad news is, the people who kind of monitor how you're doing before the voters turn on here in the preseason, you've kind of failed at that three and half to meet your expectation of five so you take a little hit on it.",
        "And it's compounded by the fact there's been a lot of kind of coverage in the last 20 or so days about how the Fred Thompson pre-campaign campaign, exploratory committee, has had some personnel changes, and eyebrows are raising among the expectation centers - is Fred really in trouble?",
        "All of this is something he can solve by getting in the race and performing well.",
        "But the kind of fan dance that he's been doing to kind of tease the process is now running out of steam.",
        "Well, the expectations have been pretty good.",
        "I mean, this guy has been on the cover of a lot of magazines, and he's supposed to be the savior, isn't he?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "No, I think he'd be an impressive candidate, but he's got to become a candidate and go up there and be impressive.",
        "The problem with the expectations game is you dress up in a Superman suit and you go out there and say I can lift locomotives and get a lot of applause, and there's a lot of hoopla, but eventually somebody says, okay, Superman, lift up that locomotive.",
        "And so Fred, who's done a great job of kind of creating a buzz about his campaign, which has not had to endure the burden of answering tricky press questions or really being out there as a candidate, is now kind of (unintelligible) where the rubber hits the road, and fundraising is one of those things.",
        "You mentioned word over the last couple of weeks - people leaving his campaign and some people writing that there's a problem because his wife is trying to manage his campaign.",
        "What are you hearing inside the party about that?",
        "You know, the preseason that we're in now loves gossip, and nothing is more fun to gossip about than spouses throwing frying pans around a campaign and yelling at everybody, which I think is a disservice to her.",
        "Jeri is a smart, very capable person, but I think some of the breathless speculation is a little overdone.",
        "Most voters in the primaries make their decision at the end, so this preseason stuff, while important, I think can be a little bit overanalyzed."

        "And the Thompson campaign in particular is almost a parody of this.",
        "He's not even an announced candidate.",

        "If you were advising Senator Thompson on what to say in the next couple of days about this, would you tell him, look, move up your date, call a press conference for next week in Tennessee and say I'm in?",
        "Well, I will tell the first to announce that he's going to focus on L.A.",
        "traffic problems as I sit here in a traffic jam on Santa Monica Boulevard.",
        "But after he (unintelligible) with that canny maneuver, I would tell him to have a 30-day rollout plan, start talking about big things in an organized way, and I'd pull the trigger on that with a little more teasing in August and probably spark it off around Labor Day.",
        "He's got to fill the vacuum with his own narrative as a candidate or the vacuum will get filled for him with gossip of whether or not his wife fired an advance man for, you know, bringing the wrong kind of ham sandwich, whatever the rumor of the day is.",
        "Watching politics with the Republican political consultant Mike Murphy - stuck in traffic in L.A.",
        "Mike, thanks for being with us again.",
        "Thank you very much, Alex.",
        "And you actually say this campaign is now reminding you of the 1990s in a way that I hadn't thought about before I read your piece.",
        "There's no question about it that Mr. Murtha obviously emboldened the Democrats.",
        "He gave them cover, as you mentioned, Farai, as a former Marine, as former decorated - or is a former decorated veteran.",
        "And he looks like he's probably going to be the minority whip - or, excuse me, the majority whip.",
        "And so having said that, it's going to be a very interesting tight walk for the Democrats to walk over the next two years.",
        "Very quickly.",
        "We don't have much time.",
        "What are the Republicans going to do to try to get the black vote since it still overwhelmingly went for Democrats?"
