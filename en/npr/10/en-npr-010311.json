        "Well, you are something - someone we need to listen to and be educated by, as well, particularly including about pedophilia, which is considered a mental health disorder.",
        "It's sickness.",
        "It can be, although, Neal, as I think the dialogue that you and Mary Ellen have been having points out - and again without reference to the Syracuse or the Penn State cases - there was a spectrum of behaviors which involves children being sexually molested.",
        "In that spectrum, we have pedophilia, but as also have people who are not mad but just simply bad and mean.",
        "We also have people who may be psychotic, delusional, in some instances demented, who may engage in sexual molestation of children.",
        "And one has to go through a differential diagnosis on a case-by-case basis.",
        "Here is one case where the devil is truly in the details.",
        "I get your point, and of course every individual case is different, and details matter.",
        "Nevertheless, are there characteristics such as those we were talking about that do join them together, at least as a rule?",
        "Well, if we look at the spectrum, on one end of the spectrum we have people who are delusional, who cannot go ahead and control their behavior and who are driven to molest children.",
        "On the other end of the spectrum, we have people who are mean and vain and who have a choice as to how they can express their fantasies.",
        "It's not about their fantasies or the intensity of their fantasies, it's simply an unwillingness to go ahead and control their behavior of an investment in humiliating those who are helpless or those who feel hopeless.",
        "So again, we have a spectrum here.",
        "And that grooming behavior, is that typical?",
        "In some instances yes.",
        "Again, when you have someone - just because someone is delusional doesn't mean that they cannot plan to act out their delusions.",
        "The same is true just because someone is mean and vain, it doesn't mean they lack planning capacity.",
        "And part of planning capacity can involve identifying likely victims, people who will not talk or who feel helpless, people who themselves may suffer from low self-esteem, who need to be befriended by a mentor or by a father figure or a mother figure in some instances.",
        "We're talking with Dr. Harold Bursztajn and Mary Ellen O'Toole.",

        "I'm a father now of several boys and girls, and I just don't let them go anywhere with adults, you know, unless it's a large group, and there's multiple adults.",
        "And how did it start with you?",
        "My mother was a single mom back in the '60s, and I grew up without a dad.",
        "And I think she felt like it would be good for me to have some interaction, you know, with a kind of a father figure.",
        "And it was kind of a boys, you know, a Big Brother, Big Sister, and it wasn't that organization, but it was kind of like that.",
        "It had a religious affiliation.",
        "And he would come by the house, and he really spent a long time working on my mom, you know, not romantically or anything, just to get her to - you know, he could talk about religion and things that he knew would reassure her, and then eventually said he wanted to take me on a trip for some kind of a religious convention or something.",
        "And that's when the abuse started, when he got me alone.",
        "I was 12.",
        "I was totally unsuspecting.",
        "You know, no, and that's a big problem for me.",
        "This lasted about four years.",
        "By the time that I got the courage to do it was oddly enough when my son turned 12.",
        "It just kind of came, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.",
        "I've been trying to ignore it, and that thought came, you know, is he hurting other people.",
        "And, you know, I went to therapy and all that, and there's not much you can do when you're 12, 13 years old.",
        "And of course he went through the whole, you know, you did something wrong, you cannot tell anybody you did this, you'll be punished, that kind of thing.",
        "But no, nothing was - I called the police in California, and they said that the statute of limitations had run out.",
        "There was nothing they could do.",
        "I'm so sorry, Joe, and I hope that you...",
        "Well, it's important to know - I know you don't have time - the important thing is - that I've learned from this as a parent is don't make judgments about who you should trust with your child because that would be to blame these people that sent Mr. Sandusky, who had these kids.",
        "It's not that they misjudged him.",
        "It's that in today's day and age, especially maybe always, you can't send your child alone or in a situation where he could be alone with another adult even that you trust."

        "In a lot of cases, some places there's no statutory limitation on rape, but in other places, depending on what the laws are, and it varies so much.",
        "O'TOOLE: Well, it's a stunning story, and it's just really gut-wrenching when you hear about someone that has been victimized, and it's years in the past.",
        "But one thing that I've seen - at least in the FBI, in the profiling unit - is that when you see this kind of predatory behavior, even if it's 10 or 15 years ago, there's a very good possibility the behavior is continuing to the current day.",
        "And so if the behavior started in California, but the offender at that time now has moved to Missouri or Illinois, you could still begin to take a look at them to see if there are new victims and if the behavior is in fact continuing.",
