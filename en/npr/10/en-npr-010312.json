        "It's huge.",
        "O'TOOLE: It's huge possible repercussions, and so oftentimes they'll do one of three things: They'll ignore it, they'll rationalize it or they'll explain it away, because the alternative is just too great for them to go to the authorities.",
        "And sometimes...",

        "This September I had the privilege of working with the FBI here to teach local law enforcement on how to interview victims, traumatized victims.",
        "I was very much struck how the times are changing, that their conference room was overflowing with law enforcement being interested in how do we interview traumatized victims, which itself is a skill which people need to learn.",
        "It doesn't come naturally.",
        "And we do remember, and it comes up every time we discuss this subject, the recovered memory cases in North Carolina several years ago where it turned out the allegations were false, and they were terrible things.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "How does one - how can one be empathic without being suggestive is the heart of a good interview.",
        "And again, that's not something that you can just well, it comes naturally.",
        "There's a fine balance between empathy and suggestibility that one must walk in order to be able to get at the truth.",
        "Mary Ellen O'Toole, did you get that kind of training when you were starting out?",
        "O'TOOLE: We get a lot of training in interviewing, but it's a real specialty to learn how to sit down and interview a child, especially when there's a threat of an allegation, because you can be assured that that interview, more than any other interview, will be litigated in court, meaning that the prosecution will address it, and defense will address it."

        "And that went on and on, and it finally accumulated into he - him sneaking into my room one night and raping me.",
        "Because of where I was, you know, credibility was an issue, and I was absolutely terrified to tell anybody.",
        "And it sounds like you were the - talking about textbook - the textbook vulnerable kid, in a position of absolutely no power whatsoever.",
        "None.",
        "I had no power whatsoever at all.",
        "And I let it slip to a girlfriend what had happened, and she told a coach, and I happened to have had a pass to go home that weekend.",

        "And probably what bothers me the most about it is I don't think they ever believed me about what happened.",
        "How they got rid of him is that whenever you went on and off campus, you had to be basically searched, and he got fired because he searched me without another staff member there."

        "So it doesn't start at age 30 or 40.",
        "It's behavior that begins to manifest at an early age, and the fact that you fire someone or terminate someone or send them to another part of the United States, that doesn't stop that behavior.",
        "In the last 20 years, media mergers and buyouts have become a regular part of the corporate landscape.",
        "But when a small newspaper chain in California purchased a much larger rival, the news caused a buzz in and outside the newspaper business.",
        "That behavior will continue, and in many cases, it continues until the person is really quite old.",
        "So, really, it has to be addressed.",
        "If it's real, if it's genuine, it needs to be addressed from a law enforcement perspective and therapeutically.",

        "On the other hand, if you have someone who's simply mean and vain and molesting children, they can't be treated.",
        "They can give the illusion of treatment.",
        "Also, thinking again about David's story, institutions themselves need to be able to ask for independent evaluation of such claims.",
        "As long as institutional pride is on the line, institutions themselves cannot be objective about the contribution of their staff, of their faculty, to an abuse allegation.",

        "Must I now start wearing an FBI clearance saying I'm not a sexual predator?",
        "Should I limit my social contact with these other adults from now on and ignore both parents and kids outside the school setting?",
        "I enjoy the company of others, but it seems like nowadays, being a male teacher requires one to avoid being part of the community in which one works.",
        "We noted earlier that only a very tiny percentage of those who work with kids are predators.",
        "But, Mary Ellen O'Toole, you can understand his frustration.",
        "O'TOOLE: Well, I certainly understand that.",
        "And truthfully, if you wore a T-shirt that said FBI background checked on, it's just a T-shirt, and so it would have absolutely no meaning.",
        "And not wanting to get into giving advice to people, but I - what we talk about in terms of looking for behavior for parents and teachers is to look for that person that looks for opportunities, for solo time with the child, that really seduces and grooms the child, that doesn't want the parents around, that wants to spend alone time, have the child come over to their home.",
        "So if you're screening your own behavior, you want to ask yourself: Am I giving them the illusion or the impression that I'm more interested in the child than in the family?",
        "We're talking with Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former FBI profiler, and with Dr. Harold Bursztajn, a forensic psychiatrist and senior clinical faculty member at the Harvard Medical School.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "And here's an email from Clarence in Salt Lake City: When I was about 11, I left home without my parents' permission, went to an arcade downtown in the city where I lived.",
        "A man started to chat me up, even offered to give me some quarters.",
        "We talked, but I was wary of him.",
        "Since I'd moved around a lot, I was experienced enough to realize that not all adults are good or have good intentions.",
        "Finally, after he asked if I wanted to see his room, I got really scared and told him I had to go since I was meeting my brother for a movie in a theater downstairs, which was a lie.",
        "To this day, I have huge trust issues.",
        "It is ruining my relationship with the most wonderful person I've ever met.",
        "I've tried to talk about it, but the guilt at not turning this man in when I had the chance makes me worry that he just found another victim.",
        "So in the end, my comment is that kids are the absolute last stand against being victimized by these people.",
        "It's awful to have to do it, but kids need to be educated that all adults are a threat, regardless of whether they are a family friend, business associate, uncle, aunt, grandparent, neighbor, teacher or anyone else in their lives.",
        "Dr. Bursztajn, you sympathize with somebody who had that experience, but doesn't that sound a little extreme?",
        "Well, Neal, I think that the extremity that you're hearing is there, because very often, blind cynicism begins with blind trust.",
        "If you blindly trust human beings, then it's easy enough to become blindly cynical.",
        "How do we go ahead and teach our children to be open-minded, to be able to use their best judgment as to who to trust, for what, when, is the job of the parents, and it's a job which we - only we can do.",
        "And parents, Mary Ellen O'Toole, you come back to that, too: The children who are most vulnerable are children who don't necessarily spend a lot of time with their parents.",
        "O'TOOLE: Those children can be very vulnerable, not just because they're children and their judgment skills certainly are not where they would be as an adult, but they don't have their parents or caregiver around to help them make right choices and right decisions and right assessments about people.",
        "It takes a lot of effort, training and background to do good assessments on people.",
        "To put it off on a 10 or 12-year-old child is not even reasonable.",
        "Another email along the lines of one we read earlier.",
        "This one from John: I'm a male social work grad student interested in working with children.",
        "I now realize I will face suspicion from parents and other workers of the community.",
        "What do I need to do to help children and families feel safe with male therapists, considering there's a shortage of male therapists working with children?",
        "And, Dr. Bursztajn, I suspect psychiatrists are not immune from such suspicions, too."
