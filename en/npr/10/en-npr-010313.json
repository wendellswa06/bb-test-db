        "In just a couple of minutes, we'll get to the Opinion Page.",
        "But just before the break, we were talking with a caller named Jennifer from Cincinnati who said that when she was a little girl, the friendly old man who lived next door, eventually she heard from her mom that the man had died and, well, that he had maybe done some bad things, but at least not with her.",
        "She was telling her - telling us that, well, yes, in fact, she - he had done some things with her.",
        "Jennifer, obviously, we can't get into details, but how did it play out in the end?",
        "Well, it started when I was in kindergarten.",
        "And about - this is, like, '75, '76.",
        "So by the time I was in third grade, you kind of started hearing towards '78, '79 more stories of kids being abducted or molested.",
        "And it was like I heard the stories, and I was like, wait a minute.",
        "What he's doing is not right.",
        "It's not normal.",
        "And so I would just stop going to his house, you know?",

        "I would, you know, wait out on the porch.",
        "And it just - you know, it was a growing-up process.",
        "But my whole thing is that with parents - I have four children, and I'm very careful now, and I'm very leery.",
        "And when we do church functions and things like that, you know, I ask them to - you know, I go and I ask other parents about, you know, are they going to be with the reverend for the day?",
        "Do you know him?",
        "Have you ever heard any stories about him?",
        "And they kind of look at me strange like I'm asking for trouble, but I just don't want my kids to grow up with that feeling where your mouth goes dry and you start shaking, and, you know, your belly - you get this lump in your stomach like, oh, my God, it's happening again and...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and I just don't want them to feel that hopeless and trapped, ever.",
        "And so I'm very protective.",
        "Jennifer, thank you - as you should be.",
        "Thank you so much for your story.",
        "And before we leave, Dr. Bursztajn, I just wanted to ask you: We were talking earlier about whether predators can respond to therapy.",
        "What about the damage to their victims?",
        "I'm sure some things can never be repaired.",
        "The damage which child molestation causes is intense.",
        "It can be lifelong.",
        "The most important part of therapy is to help the victim get over the sense of helplessness and humiliation which accompanies sexual molestation.",
        "And in order to be able to do this - not just what happens in the therapist's office, but how the family responds to it - fundamentally, education without humiliation is the essence of therapy for victims of child molestation.",
        "And, Mary Ellen O'Toole, as shocking as the allegations at Penn State, Syracuse - again, allegations, but we're talking about it.",
        "Does that help people or hurt people, do you think?",
        "O'TOOLE: Oh, I think it's very helpful to be able to talk about it and to make it normal to talk about it and allow people the opportunity to say this happened to me.",
        "And one of the biggest issues when I was - as an FBI profiler is to make people feel like they weren't the Lone Ranger, that this kind of behavior does happen to other people.",
        "So what happened to them doesn't make them an outcast or that there's something wrong.",
        "So I think that just talking about it so that they know there are other people that have endured this, incredibly helpful."

        "How do you measure something like that?",
        "Well, there have been some polls that it just simply asked people over time what their biggest issue is; I think one by the Washington Post - it was done nationally - over time which showed a six or eight point decline in the salience of the Iraq issue.",
        "And then there was a really striking one done by WMUR in New Hampshire which showed that amongst Democrats and Republicans in that critical early primary state, there's been double-digit drop.",
        "So normally we think of stories-making campaigns; that is, a big issue will make a campaign.",
        "You say now Iraq as a non-story is really a big issue, and is remaking the campaign.",
        "Explain that.",
        "I think it's because several candidates had oriented their messages around the Iraq issue on the Republican side.",
        "So I think Rudy Giuliani arguing that he was the toughest on terrorism and Mitt Romney arguing that he could bring competence to a war on terror that was being badly managed.",
        "And on the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, whose strength and experience argument I think very much meshed with this sense that we faced a very dangerous world, particularly in Iraq.",
        "I think in some ways all of those candidates' messages have been slightly undermined by the fact that their premise, which was that Iraq would be at the front of people's consciousness, is not as true as it was a few months ago.",
        "So this is a story about the harsh reality of nature.",
        "It's also about the harsh economic realities that poor countries face as they face down natural disasters.",
        "And it's predicted that countries like the Philippines are going to increasingly be burdened with ever more calamities as a result of global warming and frequent severe storms."

        "But even with this heavy police presence, a number of so-called antifa demonstrators - these are leftists and often violent protesters who come from around the country - they were able to break through the cordon to clash with the far-right protesters who took part in a silent march across Chemnitz.",

        "There were definitely many townspeople among them or lining the route showing their support for this.",
        "They had a much larger crowd, about 6,500 according to earlier estimates which were later revised downwards somewhat by the city because I think they were embarrassed by the fact that the counter-demonstration which talked about heart rather than incitement only drew about 2,500.",
        "They revised those numbers up to about 4,000 later.",
