        "In my time at the Bee, that was indeed the case.",
        "My staff writer gig was a good job in many ways, even though I often felt like a stranger in a strange land: a black woman who'd grown up in a single-parent home in a notoriously liberal city suddenly living and working in a politically conservative agricultural stronghold.",
        "The editorial management team at the Bee, hardworking and loaded with integrity, nevertheless suffered from a bit of an inferiority complex.",
        "At that time, the biggest newspaper in the McClatchy chain was our sister paper to the north, the Sacramento Bee, and home to the corporate headquarters.",
        "There, reporters had more resources to work on stories, newer facilities, and more aggressive editors.",
        "Or at least it seemed that way to those of us in Fresno.",
        "The Sac Bee had won a few Pulitzers during the '70s and '80s, while Fresno was a perpetual also-ran.",
        "And while I didn't always feel like I had helpful career development advocates among the Fresno Bee editing staff, I held on to my self-confidence and believed that my good work would speak for itself.",
        "It wasn't always easy.",
        "Two years after joining the Bee, I ran afoul of a particularly hostile editor, and I found myself in the doghouse.",
        "I lucked up eventually though, after a turn of events at McClatchy brought a new publisher to Fresno.",
        "Jerry Pruitt, a corporate lawyer for the company, rode into Fresno in 1991.",
        "In short order, we realized that Pruitt, who was shockingly young at the time in his mid-30s, and shockingly handsome, too, really seemed to get it.",
        "He set about reorganizing the top editing staff at the Bee, and took the time to meet individually with reporters for long talks that were pressure-free but designed to reveal to him what worked in the newsroom and what didn't.",
        "Pruitt restored my faith in the Bee, and in the potential for innovative leadership within the news industry itself.",
        "After I left the Bee in '93 for The Miami Herald, I grew to cherish even more Pruitt's fair-minded and forward-looking management philosophy.",
        "Now, of course, the entire news industry also knows about Pruitt.",
        "As CEO of McClatchy, he engineered the remarkable purchase of Knight Ridder.",
        "I was sorry to hear of his decision to sell several of the Knight Ridder newspapers, including the Philadelphia Enquirer, and I hope the various companies that buy those orphaned KR papers take to heart Pruitt's dedication to preserving the newspaper's important role in our democratic society.",
        "As for the staffs at the Knight Ridder papers, those journalists who will soon see their corporate letterhead change to read McClatchy - Chin up.",
        "You're new boss is nothing like the old boss.",
        "Amy Alexander is a media critic in Silver Spring, Maryland.",
        "This is NPR News."

        "That uniquely unforgettable voice belongs to Nina Simone's, whose life is the subject of the new biography \"\"Princess Noire.\"\" Simone died in 2003 at the age of 70.",
        "She grew up in Tryon, North Carolina, studied at the Juilliard School, and eventually dived - she might say was pushed - head first into the Civil Rights movement.",
        "Her tumultuous career spanned not only a wide spectrum of musical genres but put her squarely in the crosshairs of race and politics at a time of tremendous upheaval across the American south and beyond.",
        "Her songs reflected all of those experiences and made her quite frankly loved, admired, fear and even hated.",
        "What does her music mean to you?",
        "Was there one defining song that inspired or even angered you?",

        "Thank you.",
        "So glad to be here.",
        "My first question for you, and I even told the producer this as we were talking about this before we got on the air, is what made you write this?",
        "To be sure, it starts with Nina's wonderful music and her presence on the cultural scene.",
        "But a little of my own background, very briefly.",
        "Before this, I had done a book of Dinah Washington, which meant so much to me.",
        "Dinah is nine years younger than Nina and really a different generation.",
        "And what has interested me is the intersection of race and culture.",
        "And I thought by the time you get to Nina, you get someone whose art was so completely fused with her identity.",
        "She wasn't simply an African-American woman who sang, but she was someone who wove that into the art that she made.",
        "Let me ask you this, because in the book you talked about how that developed.",
        "I mean, she was - she started out to try to learn to play classical piano, which she did.",
        "But she also - because she was in the south and because she had this independent streak from what you wrote, it seems as if her encounters, if I can use that word, with race, would ultimately play a big part in who she became.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "But just to go back to one thing that you said.",
        "Nina started out as really a fine jazz musician who looks at -look at pictures of her in the spaghetti strap cocktail dress.",
        "She had a white audience really before she had a black audience, and it was 1963.",
        "And the bombing of the church in Birmingham and her deep friendship with Lorraine Hansberry, the author of the seminal \"\"Raisin in the Sun\"\" that made her realize, as she put it, I was part of the movement whether I realized it or not by the simple fact of being black."

        "It's not completely back to the 1990s, when foreign policy was virtually irrelevant, but what you are seeing is that domestic issues are playing a bigger role than I think we would've expected, obviously something like health care on the Democratic side.",
        "Illegal immigration is playing an enormous issue on the Republican side.",
        "And questions of personality and character, which were very central to the political campaigns and debates of the 1990s, but I think faded after 9/11 because there was sense that we didn't have time for those kind of questions, I think have resurfaced a bit.",

        "You'll remember, many people were saying earlier this year when Giuliani was doing better, well, maybe Christian conservatives don't care as much about abortion and gay marriage because they're more focused on the war on terror.",
        "I think that's less true than it may have been earlier in the year.",
