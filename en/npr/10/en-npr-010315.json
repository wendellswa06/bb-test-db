        "Yes, she did, called the Midtown.",
        "And to anybody who journeys there, the building is still there.",
        "It's not a bar, but that's exactly what happened.",
        "And she did so in order to earn money.",
        "Why the name change?",
        "She came from a religious family.",
        "This is nothing new in this genre.",
        "Her mother did not at all approve of music that was other than the sacred.",
        "And so, at least in the beginning, she thought I can't go out there as Eunice Waymon.",
        "I don't want her to know.",
        "And on the spot, as she told it, she came up with this combination Nina Simone, which when pronounced like that has kind of continental flare.",
        "Absolutely does.",
        "One of the things about her, Nadine, that I'd like you to tell the audience about is she developed over the years, this - I don't know how to describe it other than to say hot and cold relationship with her audience.",
        "Yes.",
        "She certainly did.",
        "And I think that part of that came from her original training, which was classical and the little concert she gave.",
        "And she assumed - I'm going right now to the notion of decorum.",
        "She assumed you come to hear me play.",
        "You sit in your seat and you listen.",
        "You don't talk, you don't rattle your drink.",
        "And so she demanded attention.",
        "And then I think later on, when she was angry about whatever might have been going on in the world or the shape of her own career or the amount of money she thought she was owed and hadn't received, that kind of bubbled over in her performance.",
        "It absolutely did.",
        "Now, along - at the same time her - I don't know if you would call it civil disobedience or her racial consciousness necessarily, but it happened at a very young age.",
        "And you tell the story about a recital that she did at the library.",
        "Yes.",
        "In Tryon, she was clearly one of the most gifted young people, white or black.",
        "In Tryon, she was asked to perform a recital.",
        "Her parents came in and were seated in the front row.",
        "Before she started to play, she noticed that one of the white leaders in town came over and quietly asked them, could they please move to the back, as was the custom then, because another white couple had come in and should have the front row seat.",
        "And Eunice says, she told it, just looked at that and said, absolutely not, and announced publicly that if anyone expected her to play this recital, she had to be looking right at her mother and father sitting in the front seat.",
        "One of the other things that you wrote about, as we wait for people to call and check in with us and send us emails those who have stories about Nina Simone of their own that they would like to share with us, is that she was not only friends with Lorraine Hansberry, the great playwright, she was also friends with Langston Hughes, the poet.",
        "And he - she seemed to me - and I want you to tell me if I'm right about this or not - she seemed to epitomize what he wrote about the dream deferred...",
        "What happens to a raisin in the sun?",
        "Does it dry...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...to a dream deferred?",
        "Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?",
        "That is an interesting observation.",
        "I thought you might be going in a different place because not only was she friends with Langston, he was - and Lorraine Hansberry, but also James Baldwin.",
        "And as I note in the beginning of the book, these individuals' tremendous talents where her circle of inspiration.",
        "So as we think about the Nina Simone we came to know with this deep engagement, not only in the civil rights movement but with the notion of pride in being an African-American in presence, in wardrobe and everything else, you begin to understand it better.",
        "And, of course, Langston gave her his wonderful poem, \"\"Backlash Blues,\"\" and said, here, set it through music, which she did.",
        "And we're going to hear that before our conversation is over.",
        "Let's take a call.",
        "This is John in Des Moines.",

        "But I was wondering why she wasn't more sellable, how was she financially throughout her life.",
        "And, you know, I just - I have such an utmost respect for her as a blues artist.",
        "I'm a blues nut, by the way.",
        "But she was very unrecognized during her lifetime.",

        "By the end of her life, Nina started to have the stream of income from her songs and her creations that she should have gotten, but it was a struggle.",
        "And the gentleman from Des Moines is certainly correct that it was for many, many years a bitter pill for Nina that some of it was due to bad arrangements with the people around her, the way her contracts read, who got a piece of what.",
        "And the other thing, I must say though - and this is hard to believe sometimes - individuals who were very popular in concert or when they performed in clubs didn't always translate over into big sales.",
        "And I think the other part, we might say that apart from the money, which is, of course, very important, Nina had a sizeable impact.",
        "And we are still talking about her and will continue to be.",
        "But just to wind up - you know, by the end of her life, she had a nice stream of income.",

        "And at the time, what really got me was her distinctive voice.",
        "But as I explored her music more thoroughly, it was her songwriting and her politics that really got to me.",

        "And then, remind yourself that this isn't just nice, interesting, churchy, bluesy chords going on.",

        "That's an interesting observation.",
