        "And this long-time dispute as, well, Aaron David Miller said, it seems to be old hat amidst everything that's going on -Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain and Libya.",
        "Well, on the short term, there's no question that it sets the prospects for peace between Israel and Palestinians back.",
        "No question.",
        "And that's for a lot of reasons.",
        "One, of course, is the attention is going to all these incredible events that everybody is focused on, including the Palestinians, for that matter.",

        "So all of that sets it back, for sure.",
        "But to assume that this is going to go away is almost laughable, almost laughable.",
        "I don't think anybody thinks it's going to go away.",
        "But one thing that Aaron David Miller did say was that the rallying cry, the Palestinian flag that Arab kings and dictators used for so long to, well, as almost as a diversion, well, that no longer flies.",
        "I don't agree with him.",
        "I agree that in the short term, there's no question the change is about internal change.",
        "This - foreign policy hasn't been the mobilizing issue.",
        "But we have to understand what's going on here.",
        "What's going on here is that the Arab public, essentially, was fed up with the humiliation, the absence of dignity, the gap in its own identity, how they see themselves and how they see the government represent them.",
        "Yes, that has a lot to do with their empowerment domestically, but it has also to do with the way these governments were representing them on foreign policy issues, where they didn't think they were in one place and the public was on another place.",
        "We've been documenting this.",
        "And to be honest with you, the Palestine question in and of itself may not be so important for the Arab world, but it has almost got metaphoric power about the very sense of humiliation that Arabs have endured over these centuries.",
        "And let's talk about it.",
        "Until things are settled in place like Egypt, obviously, the Palestine question will be a sideline.",
        "But you open up the politics, and you have a democratic election coming up or parliamentary election, presidential election.",
        "We know where the public is on the issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict.",
        "Immediately, it's going to surface in the debate.",
        "It's already surfacing even from sources that we didn't expect it, people like Ayman Nour, who had not been so much focused on this issue, bringing it up, Mohamed ElBaradei bringing up the issue.",
