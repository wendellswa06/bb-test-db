        "Well, in terms of the risks, Jordan and Egypt have peace agreements with Israel.",
        "It's been the basis of Israel's, well, ability to really stand still on this issue and not negotiate.",
        "At least some people would say that.",
        "In any case, the governments in Jordan and Egypt, well, they're going to be consumed by internal matters, are they going to want to have that destabilizing aspect of questioning their stability on the border with Israel?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think the opportunities particularly for mediators like the U.S.",
        "will be in that the Arab leaders, whoever they're going to turn out to be in Egypt as the election is unfolding or the situation is unfolding in Egypt, they are so consumed by the stability internally, rebuilding the country, dealing with that issue that they don't want to be distracted by a conflict with Israel.",
        "But their public is going to be distracted by it if there's conflict with Israel anyway.",
        "So they want something credible on the line to say, well, here's a project or here's a plan that we support.",
        "Here is some idea that we want.",
        "So they're going to have an interest in a more comprehensive plan that the international community or the U.S.",
        "is going to put in order for them to be able to carry through on their own politics.",
        "The Israelis, on the other hand, have been so shaken by what happened in Egypt that if there is an Arab comprehensive plan on the table, that also, in addition to offering what was offered, revalidates the peace between Egypt and Israel, which is worth more to Israel than the peace with all of the rest of the Arab world put together, then there is another incentive.",
        "So there are opportunities for diplomacy down the road.",
        "There may not be now because the change is still unfolding, but the game isn't over obviously.",
        "This issue's going to be with us.",
        "Right now, even the Palestinians themselves are more interested in what's happening in Egypt and more interested in what happening in Libya because they all profoundly understand the consequences, ultimately, for what happens on the Israel-Arab front.",
        "We're talking with Shibley Telhami of the University of Maryland.",
        "He is Anwar Sadat professor of peace and development and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Israelis were concerned when the bulwark of their stability, Hosni Mubarak, fell in Egypt.",
        "As they look across now their northern border, and it seems to be more demonstrations and more confrontation there every day - President Assad made a speech today that does not seem to have put a lid on anything - might they be a little bit more, well, optimistic about the possibilities of change in the Arab world?",
        "Well, it's interesting about Syria, because Israel actually has - the Syria situation presents Israel with a double-edged sword, to be honest.",
        "On the one hand, you can say, well, Syria hasn't been a good friend of Israel and, obviously, a friend of Iran and so forth, and a friend of Hezbollah.",
        "On the other hand...",
        "And Hamas, yes."

        "On the other hand, the Syrian-Israeli front has been predictably stable.",
        "And Israel's relation with Syria have been so predictable and so stable that Israel could make plans even when it's dealing with Hezbollah or dealing with someone else that were predictable.",
        "If Syria goes into a period of instability, many Israelis worry about that.",
        "What are the consequences going to be for opportunities and non-state actors and other things that they have not taken into account?",
        "And so it's a double-edged sword for Israel.",
        "It does, nonetheless, again, sort of set back the prospects of any Israeli-Syrian peace agreement soon.",
        "I never thought the prospects were high without an Israeli-Palestinian deal.",
        "I never thought you can really do a separate Israeli-Syrian deal without a Palestinian-Israeli deal.",
        "Both of these are for now set back.",
        "And I think if there is going to be a prospect anytime soon, meaning in the next couple of years, it's really going to have to be framed in the context of a more comprehensive peace because so many actors are involved, and the Israeli themselves are going to be looking for incentives far greater than in the bilateral relationship with each one of their neighbors.",
        "Email question from Joseph(ph) in Baltimore.",
        "Will Egypt open the Gaza border after the September elections?",
        "Is that a breach of the Israeli-Egyptian peace accord?",
        "What will Israel do?",
        "Won't this lead to a flashpoint war with Egypt and then with the other Arab countries?",
        "Well, that's a huge issue.",
        "And there's no question that there is already a lot of pressure on Egypt to change their relationship with Gaza.",
        "Actually, the current foreign minister, Nabil el-Araby, made a statement about it yesterday, in essence saying that they are going to review their policy, particularly in terms of humanitarian opening of the gates, even arguing that there has never been a blockade from the Egyptian side against Gaza, putting it in that context.",
        "So the Egyptian public certainly has not been supportive of isolating Gaza, and there's a lot of sympathy with Gaza.",
        "And I think as the political campaign in Egypt opens up, you're going to see a lot more of that.",
        "That's going to stress the Egyptian-Israeli relationship a little bit more.",
        "More importantly, it's going to affect the way the U.S.",
        "is waging diplomacy, because up until now, American diplomacy has been based on the assumption that the U.S.",
        "is going to negotiate with the Palestinian Authority and later deal with the sort of in-house division within the Palestinians.",
        "This issue is forcing the Palestinians in some ways to come together in large part because of the change in Egypt's position.",
        "So I think we're in a fluid situation that's going to be interconnected.",
        "Let's to the phone, and Ed's(ph) on the line calling from Berkeley.",
        "Hi, good morning.",
        "I think this situation is going to be much harder, much more difficult.",
        "Israel lost great chance, as well as the U.S.",
        "to make peace prior to this incident.",
        "The public is extremely angry how the people in Gaza were totally destroyed a couple of years ago.",
        "I think also - well, this is fact, the United States never acted as a fair broker.",
        "And also, truly, truly, the ruling elite in Israel and the support in America, APAC and the rest of them, do not really want any peace.",
        "So it's going to be terrible.",
        "It's going to be really, really bad.",
        "And I think at the end, you know, the Palestinian - our people have been there for thousands of years.",
        "They're going to continue.",
        "I think the chance of Israel's survival has dimmed a great deal.",
