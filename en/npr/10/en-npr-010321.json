        "He told Representative Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut, a Democrat, at a House hearing Tuesday that he was making these moves to enhance the efficiency of the organization, to which she responded, well, what is your criteria?",
        "What does that mean?",
        "And he did acknowledge that the moves that he's made, including kind of a mass exodus from the 10th floor office where the secretary sits, were not because of performance.",
        "Well, you wrote in your story that some of these folks being lost or sidelined have very specific and valuable expertise.",
        "Just quickly, what is being lost by the VA as this happens?",
        "That's right.",
        "So some of the jobs, particularly in the secretary suite, some of these folks have been physically moved out of the office but are still actually doing their jobs.",
        "But these are largely support roles.",
        "But crucial ones that help a new secretary who comes on board who has never worked at VA get acclimated - for example, the person in charge of congressional correspondence - that person, a senior executive, was moved to a detail in another part of the agency.",
        "And there will be a new - there will be a new secretary, so these are obviously...",
        "There will."
