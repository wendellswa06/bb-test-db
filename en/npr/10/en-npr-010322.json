        "Yeah.",
        "The so-called Nation-State Bill enshrines in Israeli law that Israel is the home of the Jewish people - their national homeland.",
        "But there are Muslims and Christians in Israel as well, and that fact is at the heart of this controversy that's surrounding this law.",

        "So what is going on here?",
        "Well, I think to understand this law, you have to know about a decades-long debate in Israel.",
        "And the debate is, you know, this country is defined in law as a, quote, \"\"Jewish and democratic state.\"\" So how does a country balance its Jewish character with its democratic character, you know, with its commitment to equality, for instance, for non-Jews in the country?",
        "Now nationalist conservative lawmakers in Israel say the Supreme Court here has become too liberal and is not giving emphasis to Israel's Jewish character and its rulings.",
        "And so they say this law would help fix that by laying out very clearly that Israel is a Jewish state.",
        "This is a very divisive law.",
        "Opponents are pointing out that the words equality and democracy do not appear in the new law.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Does this bill curb the rights of minorities of Arabs and Christians in Israel?",
        "Well, that's what they're concerned about.",
        "About 20 percent of the Israeli population are Palestinian - Arabs with Israeli citizenship.",
        "They're mostly Muslim, some are Christians.",
        "They say they already face discrimination in many areas.",
        "The new law puts down that the Arabic language, for instance, which is an official language here - in the new law, it's been downgraded to just a special status.",
        "There's another very controversial part of the law that says the government will encourage the creation of Jewish towns and communities.",
        "That's being seen by critics as Israel sanctioning Jewish-only towns.",
        "For instance, a proponent of the law cited an example of a Jewish majority city in Israel and the need to combat a takeover of Palestinian Arab citizens.",

        "It's something that's much larger than you are and you're not sure about, you know, how it's going to turn out, obviously.",
        "And as a result that fatigue of that day and the adrenaline that's run its course, a kind of stress sets in.",
        "And I tend to challenge everybody to think about anything you do in life that's going to be something you have to answer for at that level, it's, you know, it's difficult.",
        "Most of us don't know how they'll react, you know, how we're going to feel about it till we been there.",
        "And I can't tell you personally how you're going to tell, you know, yourself, but I will tell you, it's a great challenge and I have a lot of empathy today.",
        "I get up a thousand miles west of the Station fire in the mountains and there's smoke all around my house.",
        "I can smell this acrid smell in the air.",
        "And it makes me think about all the days I have spent - base camps at big fires and out on the line spiked out.",
        "And of course I miss it, but I'm old enough now to, you know, let the younger guys take the control of that.",
        "So I work more as an instructor.",

        "Spiked out is a situation where you don't get to return to base camp in the evening like everybody else.",

        "And so you're, you just stick it out.",
        "You've already done a 12-hour shift and you're fixed to do another one.",
        "And maybe even a third one, at times, you know, depending on what the resources are like.",
        "So you know the fatigue and, you know, you know there's people out there that appreciate you doing the work, but at the same time it's still hard to get up to this and to do it.",

        "And I found myself in the fire world, you know, not really understanding what that challenge would be because I've not been in the military.",
        "And I know men and women that have come to us fight fire that are in the military understand these issues, but most of us don't.",
        "And until, you know, that fire throws its first punch and you find yourself getting above the ground, there's no way to tell how you're going to respond.",
        "It's just, it's each individual person and how they respond to it.",
        "And I don't mean to leap on your every metaphor, but the fire throwing its first punch - are we wrong to imagine that people out on the lines start seeing the fire as a living thing?",
        "You - yeah, I mean you do.",
        "It's - I say that, you know, there's more smoke eating in fire work than there is direct fire contact, especially this kind of kind of fire in California that you see these extreme fires.",
        "So your body has to contend with a really tough physical environment.",
        "And one of the worst of those is really heavy smoke.",
        "And that's not easy to do.",
        "It tends to take your sense of direction away from you, your sense of balance.",
        "And so, you know, you have to have enough training to fall back on.",

        "So I'm very humbled by the fact that I'm a member of that group and have learned that lesson.",
        "And glad to have the opportunity do it, but I want to tell you that it takes an enormous amount of people to effectively fight a wildfire like you guys report on from time to time.",
        "And as you're out there in a situation like they're talking about in California, just north of Los Angeles, I don't know how well you know the area, if at all, but what kind of equipment is up there?",
        "I mean we're used to seeing, you now, the fire trucks race down the streets of suburbs and cities.",
        "Are fire pumpers out there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I want to tell you that, you know, that the Phd in (unintelligible) firefighting is in California without a doubt.",
        "Some of the best firefighters that do that for a profession came from that part of the world and have written books and educated us on their techniques.",

        "But with that, you're in a completely different environment.",
        "Everything's burned, which makes the ground, the rocks, the trees highly unstable.",

        "The environment, just the weird things that you see out on the line.",
        "We would come across animals that didn't get out of the way of the fire.",
        "And they will just be frozen in position.",
        "It was just, you know, kind of a moonscape, too, because it changed everything that you were used to seeing, and you could see it in a different way.",
