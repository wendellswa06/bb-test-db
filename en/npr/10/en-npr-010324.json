        "It's really good experience for them to help them see how they can be part of a team and help to become, you know, productive members of society.",

        "Well, think of some kind of flat area - it could be a cattle pasture, it could a football field in a small town, that kind of thing.",
        "And all the crews, the Hotshot crews, for example, will show up in their large vans and they all have their own camping gear, so they'll set up camp by team.",
        "And so, imagine seeing maybe 300 or 400, 500 tents spread across a large field and there will be a central area with usually a small tent city that will have a mess hall.",
        "It'll have showers.",
        "It'll have the infinite command center for the fires.",
        "It'll have a place to check out equipment, communications tents.",

        "One thing that it, you know - just as part of a group and then also just some amazing experiences out in the wilderness, and growth, personal growth.",

        "A repeller repels out of a perfectly good helicopter into a fire.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And so, my experience as a repeller was fairly minimal, but my experience as a Hotshot was considerably greater.",
        "And in the - especially in 1994, we had some really, really big fires, especially in Central Washington, on the Wenatchee forest.",

        "One thing that's striking me here listening to this conversation is it doesn't seem to me back 35 years or so ago when I was doing this as a young man that there were so many homes involved in the process.",
        "It seems like the fires were fought in the forest in those days.",
        "Douglas Gantenbein, we've had a lot of construction of housing in previously wild areas, but I think that's responsible, partly, for what David's talking about.",
        "Oh, it's a huge issue.",
        "I mean, compared to 30 years ago, there are thousands more homes in remote areas.",
        "And whenever you have homes involved, there becomes just a massive emotional issue around trying to protect those places and it really changes the way fire managers approach a fire.",
        "And it changes their behavior in, what I think, is a very poor way.",
        "You've got to think of living in the forest as living in Florida, where you've got hurricanes, or living along a flood plain.",
        "You're going to be contending with the force of nature sooner or later, and the house may not pull through."

        "I - the crew I was on from '71 through '75 grew out of, truthfully, a commune in Marblemount, Washington, and I am still very close to quite a few of the people that were involved on that crew.",
        "And it really - between the experiences we all had together being out there, pulling together as a unit to become, you know, a really crack, I guess, firefighting unit, it really did change the way I kind of look at the jobs I do nowadays.",
        "No matter how tough any job I've done since then has been, it always seems to me like, this isn't anything like having that log rolling down the hill at Bacon Creek in the night when we couldn't see it or, you know, being evacuated by helicopter, so on and so forth.",
