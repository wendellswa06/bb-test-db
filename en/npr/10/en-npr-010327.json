        "And, Ari, remind us, in what situations is the FBI supposed to use these national security letters?",
        "Well, it used to be that they could only use them to get information about foreign intelligence agents or terrorists.",
        "But under the Patriot Act and the subsequent reauthorization, the FBI can now use it to gather information in a wider range of circumstances.",
        "Basically, as long as the information they're seeking is relevant to an investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities - is the phrase they use.",
        "So, essentially, you know, if I'm a phone company, or an Internet company, or a library, and I get a national security letter from the FBI, I have to hand over the information, the personal records, that the FBI is asking for.",

        "According to this report, there have been many, many more of them in the last few years.",

        "And they're being used much more frequently against Americans than they ever were before.",
        "And are they used in other cases that aren't related to terrorism?",
        "Well, that's part of the findings of improper behavior that the Justice Department inspector general cited in this report.",
        "The money, quote, from this report is this, they said, \"\"we believe the improper or illegal uses we found involved serious misuses of national security letter authority.",
        "And here is just a couple of them as used as they identified.",
        "They said, when the FBI reports its use of national security letters to Congress, it's under-reporting its use of these things by about 20 percent.",
        "It's said that they're getting more information than they're allowed to under the law in these letters.",
        "They're getting information that is not related to national security investigations.",
        "And they're also using these things called exigent letters, which basically say, we urgently demand this information right now and we will follow up with the national security letter or a grand jury subpoena, or something like that.",
        "And the inspector general found that in some cases, they're just not following up with those things.",
        "And did the inspector general find whether or not these were intentional or just mistakes?"

        "Well, in a lot of ways they are.",
        "And it sort of follows the same blueprint we saw with Uber and Lyft where tech companies are looking to provide transportation and mobility solutions, but they're asking for forgiveness after the fact instead of permission before the fact.",
        "So while you've got the inconvenience, the awkwardness, the frustration with local cities, is there also a problem that's being solved here?",

        "His column, The Listener, chronicled the highs and lows of AM and FM, described the increasing decline of local radio in the face of new technologies and the rise of conglomerate media corporations, yet always managed to convey to his readers his love of the medium he grew up with as a kid in New York City.",

        "And as the whole shift takes place to all kinds of new technologies and new distribution systems, some of the old media are looking for ways to stay creative and sharp and others are really cutting - cost-cutting to such an extent that they are unable to hold their own, let alone find a new path.",
        "And the numbers seem to reflect what you're saying, but the way you describe it is almost like the industry has become dispirited and lost faith in itself.",

        "And what's happened is we went through a decade in the '90s of corporate consolidation, where a handful of companies bought up literally thousands of radio stations across the country, spent so much money buying those stations that they then had little choice but to cut costs, reduce local programming.",

        "Yeah.",
