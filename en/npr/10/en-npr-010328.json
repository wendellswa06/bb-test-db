        "Well, besides all those things I've already mentioned, there is one thing that's sort of pertinent to the discussion that we noticed here in the Midwest, and that is that these bats, when they do warm up, they tend to move to a warmer spot in the cave.",

        "Sure.",
        "So that appears to be the response of these affected bats.",
        "So when they get to their end of their life or the end of their fat and they just have no other option, they pick up, leave the cave and go look for food - which, obviously, in New England in you know January there isn't lot foot out there.",

        "We're talking about putting artificial spots that are closer to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "So we're just sort of mimicking what we see in nature, but extenuating it, doing it to an extreme.",
