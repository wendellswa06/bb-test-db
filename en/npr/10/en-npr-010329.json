        "And how will the bats know that the boxes are there, and will the feel the warmth coming out of them?",
        "Well, eventually.",
        "We think they will find them that way.",
        "What I sort of envision happening is, is if a few individuals find them - you can find a warm bat in a cave fairly easily.",
        "They're - tend to be fairly noisy.",
        "So if a few individuals find it, it won't be that hard for the other bats to find them.",
        "And if they notice a lot of bats are going to this one spot.",
        "They probably will learn where these warm spots are at.",
        "Do you envision giving them food while they are there?",
        "Well, no, we actually don't.",
        "This has been a suggestion, to give these animals food.",
        "But there are really two problems.",
        "For the most part, they don't eat during the winter.",
        "So, you know, during hibernation, bats normally don't do this.",
        "So that's not a behavior that they really have evolved.",
        "So we would be teaching them something new there.",
        "We've also - there's been some discussion of taking the bats out of the caves and feeding them, but that could just be a logistical nightmare to maintain enough bats that way, though probably no food.",
        "You talk about in your paper and - about some possible problem with the idea that it might keep whatever the vector is, whatever is causing the death of these bats, instead of allowing the bats to be killed off, they might be able to survive, and infect other bats.",
        "Sure, sure.",
        "So if we increase the survival and the bats make it through the winter, they could then transfer whatever it is - if it's the fungus or it's something else - to their colony mates during the summer.",
        "It looks like, or there's at least been a suggestion that this fungus, if it does turn out to be the fungus, doesn't grow very well above about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take.",
        "And the bats experience temperatures much, much warmer than that during the summer.",
        "So the fungus might die back or not grow as well, which might mean it's not transmissible.",
        "So if that's the case, if it can't be transmitted during the summer, we really don't have to worry about that.",
        "That side effect isn't as big a deal.",
        "What kind of reaction have you gotten from the science community about this?",
        "Oh…",
        "Not good, huh?",
        "Well, well let's say mixed.",
        "No, there are actually a lot of people that are on board with this.",
        "It's fairly controversial, or it's fairly unconventional maybe is a better word.",
        "So we're doing - you know, we're sort of going against a long-standing paradigm.",
        "And it is has been mixed.",
        "We do have a lot of support on this, and there are lot of people that are really interested in trying it because white-nose syndrome is such a huge issue in the Northeast right now that unconventional ideas -especially unconventional ideas that have support like this one does, (unintelligible) - are worth trying them.",
        "So we're working on it.",
        "We're slowly explaining this to a lot of people to try to build support for it."

        "Yeah.",
        "Bats chose their hibernation locations because they like that temperature and humidity.",
        "If it's too warm, their metabolism is too high and their fat reserves don't last out the winter.",
        "If the temperature is too high, is too low, they'll desiccate.",
        "I really don't see why warming the cave would help.",
        "There are caves - some caves are colder and some caves are warmer.",
        "And the bats chose their colder caves because that gives them the best survival.",
        "All right, Bob.",
        "Let me get an answer.",
        "Well, he knows his hibernation literature.",
        "I would say that he hit on this paradigm I'm talking about.",
        "And the recent literature is actually sort of moving away from that in the last three or four years, where we're getting away from this idea that colder is always better.",
        "But that's sort of a different argument.",
        "This goes back to, look, why would we only want to heat localized areas?",
        "The cold spots where they hibernate, we're not going to change.",
        "Those will still stay the same.",
        "We're talking about giving them additional warm spots that aren't affecting their hibernation temperatures.",
        "Are we pretty sure or closing in on the idea that it's the fungus that is the cause and not just - it's an opportunistic infection?",
        "It really looks like the smoking gun, but we can't say that.",
        "There are some experiments going on right now, David Blehert and his group at the National Wildlife Health Center are doing these experiments, and hopefully they'll have any for us at the end of the hibernation season.",
        "We'll know one way or the other.",
        "He was on our program in October.",
        "Sure.",
        "Here's the question for you, if that's true, from Candis Looming(ph) in Second Life who says: Why don't you spray the cave with a fungicide?",
        "This has actually come up a lot.",
        "There has been some talk about it, like I said, but it's probably logistically difficult.",
        "In some of these caves we're talking about and mines we're talking about are huge.",
        "They're massive.",
        "And I've been in a few of them, and it's hard to explain how large these things are.",
        "So that would be difficult, not to mention that in natural environments - and especially in the caves -there are lots of other things in there that we don't want to kill.",
        "You know, there are lots of natural cave species that a fungicide would be very bad for."

        "You know, radio really had two golden ages.",
        "The first one was the one in the 1930s and '40s, the sitcoms and the variety shows, and that was almost all national programming from the big networks.",
        "But that was an age when radio was really - had the idea of mass entertainment to itself.",
        "And when TV came along and took over, literally those shows walked out one studio door, went across the hall to the next studio, and went over to TV.",
        "Radio was left bereft, and the brilliant solution that came along then was exactly what you were just talking about, that local connection, where local mom-and-pop radio-station owners in small towns across the country said, you know what?",
        "We can provide coverage of local high-school sports, and the weather, and the traffic, and all of these things that we now take for granted on the radio.",

        "One of the things - cheap is an interesting word, and Phil, thanks very much for the call.",
        "But cheap is an interesting word, and one of the things that happened, they had to have cheaper programming to replace that network programming, which, of course, no longer existed, and they found that somebody spinning records was, well, hard to beat.",
        "Hard to beat.",
        "You can't get much cheaper than taking records that you get for free, a low-paid DJ, or in those days, someone who was getting payola from the record company, and that was the bulk of his income, and putting them on the air.",

        "There is, and certainly, Internet radio is - has tremendous promise.",
        "It's very much like the rest of the Internet, though, in that it - while it fulfills us in all the ways that the Internet does, because we can go directly to the people who have the same interests that we do, these are naturally much smaller groups.",
