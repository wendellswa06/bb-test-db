        "And this has all sorts of political and social ramifications, because you're not able to bring people together around a common foundation as you were in those two golden ages of radio.",
        "There are fascinating things happening on Internet radio, however most of the music that is available on Internet radio is - runs on kind of an amazon.com model where it's all based on recommendation engines.",
        "And it really has a very automated feel to it, and you don't have the same connections with personalities that you had during radio's better years.",
        "We have a question on the microphone here at the Newseum.",
        "Hi, my name is Taylor Barnes (ph), and I am from Bakersfield, California.",
        "And although radio conglomerates like Clear Channel have taken over commercial and terrestrial radio and made it kind of mindless, do you think that satellite radio companies like XM and Sirius have kind of brought the creativity back to radio and kind of opened the mind of listeners?",
        "It's a great question, and I had tremendous hopes that they would do exactly that, and to some extent, they have.",
        "There is certainly a far greater variety of music and of other programming available on XM and Sirius than on most commercial radio.",
        "However it is - because it is reaching a nationwide audience, you don't have that local connection.",
        "You don't have that feel of emotional bond that you might to a local personality at a local station.",

        "I'm from Atlanta, Georgia, and my question is, what was the defining moment, or moments, or possible events, that made you distrust radio's future?",
        "I don't want to say distrust as, like, such a harsh word, but it's the...",
        "Also, for cost reasons, XM and Sirius tend to pick up mostly - aside from their music programming, almost all of their news and talk programming is nationally syndicated.",
        "It's, in many cases, the same programs you can hear on AM and FM.",
        "And when it's not, it tends to be the sound from television, the audio from television, which leaves me feeling pretty empty when I listen to it, because you are missing out on the pictures.",
        "But...",
        "Some of those TV programs turn out to be better on the radio.",

        "And I understand that there are more low-power, LP, stations being licensed all the time.",
        "Maybe there's 800 in the country right now.",
        "What do you think of that as something that fills in that local connection?",
        "It's a terrific initiative.",
        "It was an idea that the FCC came up with.",
        "It hasn't quite proliferated across the country to the extent that it was initially envisioned to, because a lot of commercial broadcasters have been fighting against having these low-power stations that are meant to reach a single urban neighborhood or a rural town.",
        "And these are often community groups, church groups, schools and so on that set up stations, sometimes political activists.",
        "Some of them are just terrific.",
        "Some of them are unlistenable, but they are kind of fun to eavesdrop on, because it's your neighbors getting on the radio and trying it out for themselves.",
        "They are, in many ways, a reincarnation of the initial idea behind public radio, and public radio's own struggle to decide what it wants to be in its next phase.",
        "Very much has the same conversation going on between national programming from NPR and other sources, and local programming from the individual stations round the country.",
        "So that tension exists both in commercial radio and in public radio.",
        "But what's happening with these low-power stations is it is, indeed, a \"\"Back to the Future\"\" kind of idea, that - where you're going back to these local roots, because these are defined as being so narrow and so local they are not going to have the same impact on a larger community that a real big, grownup radio station might, but I think they are a tremendous initiative.",
        "Michael, good luck with your station.",
        "Thanks very much."

        "And there was a sense of inevitability during these hearings that the FCC was going to win and Michael Powell was going to allow conglomeration to go forth.",

        "But I do think that it can turn around even now.",
        "And I think what you're seeing, both in Clear Channel and in the other major companies that own thousands of radio stations across the country, is that they are not making the profits that they had anticipated ,and they are therefore starting to unload stations.",
        "And so, I think in the next several years, you're going to see not quite the wholesale sales that you saw in the '90s, but you're going to see a lot of these stations being spun off.",
        "And it's an opportunity for those who still believe that radio can still be a great creative force and a great way of connecting communities and making money, you're going to see those folks coming in and buying up stations.",
        "So I think there is hope for a de-evolution, if you will, back to what we had before the great consolidation of the 1990s.",

        "My relationship to radio changed in that, while I listened to more radio programs more regularly, I regularly listen to them on the radio.",
        "I catch most of my favorite via live stream, sometimes on my local station, but often on stations from around the country.",
        "Similarly with television, I can listen to shows when I choose, as opposed to when my local station plays them.",
        "I am often surprised by traffic and weather from another part of the country during a break from a national program like yours.",
        "There's really a tremendous joy in being able to, now, range the country and the world and find the music that you want to listen to, whether it's coming from Germany or California.",
        "And yet, there is something lost in that, because although we each individually have far greater choice, we no longer have the community of people to share that choice with.",
        "And so, you know, you lose the water-cooler piece, where everyone comes into work the next day, and did you hear what so-and-so said on the radio yesterday?",
        "And you know, for many years that was the sales line, the slogan of many radio stations.",
        "It's, you know, the bad boy morning DJ would always be advertised as, did you hear what so-and-so had to say yesterday morning?",

        "So do you still listen?",
        "I still listen, but I find myself listening, as the caller said, all over the world and to many different things.",
        "There are still some very strong strains in America radio, public radio, obviously, is one of them.",
        "And there are still individual stations here and there, and I try and highlight some of them in my book, that are run by one person who just wants radio to connect with his community.",
