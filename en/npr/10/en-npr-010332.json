        "Most of the time when we're texting each other we're actually talking rather more complicated messages, more sensible messages, and the abbreviations simply don't work there because they would be too ambiguous.",
        "And so there's always a combination of abbreviation and real language in a text message.",
        "And the proportion is to say is that the majority of it is actually in standard English.",

        "When you actually start collecting them all as I had to do for this book, you end up with a few - really just a few dozen that are common, and of course, people do play with some artistic ones from time to time and make emoticons look the Simpsons and things like that, you know.",

        "So, people were actually abbreviating the language in this way long before cellphones were invented.",

        "I'm sure there were games like that, that were on the television there in Wales as well.",
        "Another thing that people have trouble with though is the - the lost of vowels in a lot of words.",
        "Yeah, but I mean the - there's a line I often see used around if you take a sentence and leave the vowels out, actually people can understand it, you know ppl cn undrstnd t.",
        "It's because vowels don't carry very much information in language and the consonants carry all the information.",

        "If you left all the consonants out and just had the vowels left, oh that would be a real disaster, you wouldn't understand word.",
        "So, actually what the kids are doing is they instinctively do it - recognizing a basic fact about the nature of human language and that is the information is in the consonants.",
        "The information is in the consonants, and indeed - well I think I may be wrong, but doesn't - doesn't the expression OK, go back to Morse code and the railroads?",
