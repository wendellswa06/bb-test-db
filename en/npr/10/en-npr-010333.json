        "For example in Spanish, a common text abbreviation for \"\"saludos\"\" is SL2, where 2 equal \"\"dos\"\" of course.",

        "In other words, the more you text, the better your literacy scores, and the reason is that texting gives you extra practice in reading and writing.",
        "Even though it's on your mobile phone, it doesn't matter, you're getting extra practice.",
