        "Sealed with a loving kiss as well.",
        "Yes, I remember those.",
        "That illustrates the point perfectly, doesn't it?",
        "That each generation has got its favorite abbreviations, and these are the ones that are coming in with the present-day generation.",
        "They're new and they're cool and they're fresh and so on.",
        "Adults who criticize them should remember always that they did the same thing once upon a time.",
        "And the research you did for this book suggests that, in fact, as more and more older people get into texting, well, they compose differently than kids, men compose differently from women, and boys from girls.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "This is one the interesting things.",
        "It's - again, it's so early days that it's difficult to be absolutely certain.",
        "But yes, there are big differences in style between males and females in text messaging.",

        "Women use more exclamation marks when they text than men do.",
        "Make what you will of that.",
        "And women have more complex sentences on text messages than men do.",
        "Lots of differences of this kind, and as the age range goes up, you would expect a rather more conservative style to be used in text messaging, and that happens to an extent.",
        "But on the other hand, when older people like your 82-year-old colleague from a little while ago starts texting his grandchildren, he actually picks up some of those young abbreviations, and we all become children again.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "Well, what irritates people with language is when something is overused.",
        "And if like is overused, then of course, it gets irritating.",
        "But actually, it has a very specific function in linguistics, you know, we call it a quotative, because what it is, it's like a pair of quotations marks.",
        "If I say, \"\"I'm going to go like,\"\" and that's like opening a quotation mark to introduce the next point that's going to be said.",
        "And that sort of thing is a very useful feature in a conversation.",
        "It's a way of succinctly saying, I'm now going to refer to something that comes from somewhere else.",
        "Interestingly, you don't get that sort of thing in text messaging.",
        "People don't - in text - say things like 'like' and 'you know' and 'you see' and 'I mean.",
