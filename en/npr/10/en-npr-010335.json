        "This insurgency has been taking place since 2013.",
        "Initially, the Egyptian military was perhaps not adapted to an insurgency of this scale and this determination.",
        "They have since then, however, developed their tactics.",
        "And what we've seen is less massive attacks against the military and police targets in Sinai and the increasing resort to more IED and sniping.",
        "On the other hand, the Islamic State has begun increasingly targeting what you might call soft targets.",
        "Since December 2016, they launched a campaign against Christians in Egypt, killing more than a hundred in church bombings in the mainland.",
        "They've also targeted Christians in North Sinai, causing hundreds of them to flee.",
        "And they are unable to return.",
        "So that's seen by some analysts as a sign that being pressed by the military and police, they're just lashing out at easier opportunity targets.",
        "The death toll of this attack is enormous.",
        "What is the reaction that you're seeing there in Cairo, in the capital?",
        "I think people are shocked.",
        "This is unprecedented both in its scale in the sense of the casualties and also in the choice of targets.",
        "They targeted a mosque full of elderly women - elderly men, excuse me - and children.",
        "And this just hasn't happened in Egypt.",
        "They've targeted Christians.",
        "They've targeted Sufis in other situations.",
        "Obviously, they've targeted policemen.",
        "They've targeted tourists.",
        "But there's a shock.",
        "There's complete - a complete sense of shock.",
        "And there also seems to be - the president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, gave a speech in which he said that he vowed to respond with, quote, \"\"brutal force.\"\" At this point you sense that, you know, what else are they going to do?",
        "They've said that this is going to be a long-term war of attrition.",
        "We'll see results soon.",
        "But then these major attacks happen, and it's more of the same, I think, for them.",
        "Samer Al-Atrush, deputy bureau chief in Cairo for the news agency AFP.",
        "Samer, thank you.",
        "Thanks.",
        "When police officers go on trial for shootings, why are so many acquitted?",
        "I think and I hope - can't guarantee anything, but I hope we're going to surprise you with a really good plan.",
        "You know, I've been talking about a plan with heart.",
        "I said, add some money to it.",
        "There were a lot of different talking points, but the one thing everyone kept going back to was the desire to have universal background checks for gun owners.",
        "A lot of people were actually wearing T-shirts that said, we are the 97, alluding to the fact that 97 percent of the American people supposedly support universal background checks for gun owners.",
        "One of the people wearing one of those T-shirts was Lizzie Simpson, and she's a high school sophomore in Texas.",
        "As a high schooler, I'm scared everyday of going to school and if that's the last time I'm going to see my parents, if that's the last time I'm going to see my best friend.",
        "That needs to stop.",
        "There needs to be at least a beginning point where we as students, as parents, as church leaders, as people of the United States come out and say enough is enough.",
        "Something needs to be done, and I think that starts with universal background checks.",
        "Was there any particular call to action at this rally?",
        "You remember when there were these massive student rallies a couple of months ago, a very large one in Washington, D.C.. They had a specific kind of list of things that they wanted people to do.",
        "Was there something like that here?"

        "So for me, unfortunately, at this point, every gun death is personal.",
        "And whether that is a drive-by shooting, or it's a mass suicide, or a school shooting, I feel them all.",
        "Because I've experienced that grief, I'm not able to ignore these ever again.",
        "They're not white noise.",
        "And I will fight every bit as hard to stop suicides as I do school shootings and any other kind of shootings.",
