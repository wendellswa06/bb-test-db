        "Well, let's think back to a little more than a year ago, when a tape submerged of outtakes of Trump talking to \"\"Access Hollywood\"\" then-host Billy Bush back - I think it was 2005.",
        "Access Hollywood\"\" is an entertainment news show owned by NBC.",
        "And in it, Trump was boasting about his ability to seduce women, about his ability even to sexually assault them and to get away with it because of his charm and of his celebrity.",
        "He talked about grabbing a woman by the genitalia.",
        "And he also talked with Billy Bush about his sexual interest in one of Bush's co-hosts who was standing, I think, just yards away outside the bus that they were rolling on in the studios out there in Hollywood.",
        "NBC didn't break this story.",
        "This story surfaced, to the shame of many journalists at NBC News, in the pages and on the website of The Washington Post.",
        "And, you know, NBC held back on that.",
        "NBC also did not pursue what our colleague Kelly McEvers and others have reported on, which is that there's said to be many sexist and possibly racist things that Donald Trump said back when he was hosting NBC's \"\"Apprentice.\"\" NBC doesn't own the rights to those tapes, but it could have reported on that with vigor and didn't.",
        "I think there are a lot of people within NBC who question whether there's some relationship there.",
        "Well - and you've reported on NBC News, doing some reporting that's raised questions about their handling of the Harvey Weinstein situation.",
        "That's right.",
        "Earlier this year, Ronan Farrow, who had been a host on MSNBC, became an investigative reporter for the network, had what he felt was - and in fact what the network's lawyers said was reportable information about Harvey Weinstein and allegations of sexual assault - sexual harassment by the Hollywood powerhouse.",
        "NBC said, you know, it's not ready yet and allowed him to go shop at somewhere else.",
        "Ultimately, after additional reporting, it appeared in the pages of The New Yorker.",
        "The network says - look, we may have made a mistake editorially on that.",
        "But it wasn't ready yet, and he did more work.",
        "By the same token, there are some journalists - not all - but some journalists with NBC who say, you know, there was concern about Lauer's behavior and suspicions about it that may have acted as a break and added to the reservations the network had about going forth with this important story that, of course, has done so much to make us recast how we think about sexual interactions in the workplace.",
        "Let me just ask you about the other big name, Garrison Keillor, the longtime host of A Prairie Home Companion from Minnesota Public Radio.",
        "I know a lot of listeners know this voice.",
        "What's he been accused of?",
        "So both parties are on tenterhooks about what to do because they have tremendous policy implications, as well as political implications.",
        "Well, that's it.",
        "And Kinney who was sitting in a reception area in the St. Paul Skyway in Minnesota last week says he likes the fact that President Trump promises to bring a businessman sensibility to government.",
        "As for all those people who want Trump to sell off his properties...",
        "Probably a bunch of people that have never been in business, so they probably wouldn't understand he's not going to just hand everything over."
