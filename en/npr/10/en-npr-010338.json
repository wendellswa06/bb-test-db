        "What was it like?",
        "Well, it was very much like a 2016 campaign rally.",
        "As a matter of fact, it was sponsored by his re-election campaign, so it was a campaign rally.",
        "It would be...",

        "There were the attacks on Democrats as obstructionists.",
        "At a mention of Hillary Clinton, there were the lock her up chants.",
        "There was also the reprise of the greatest moments of his campaign including the primaries.",
        "And there was the recitation of his historic accomplishments in office and the airing of grievances about the witch hunt, the Russia investigation.",
        "Which he's said again and again and again and made other remarks that have been seen as damaging about the Russian investigation.",
        "But when it turned to health care, how's he talking about replacing the Affordable Care Act?",
        "Well, one of the reasons that he held this rally, of course, was because the health care bill is going to be announced today in the Senate.",
        "In addition, this was a way for the president to reconnect with his base.",
        "But he did talk about - he said he was thrilled to be out of the Washington swamp.",
        "And he did talk a little bit about the health care bill after, of course, saying that Obamacare was a disaster and was now over with, completely collapsed.",
        "Here he is.",
        "So this is really interesting.",
        "He didn't provide any details about what was going to be in the Senate plan, but you - we know that privately he has criticized the House bill as mean.",
        "This was the same House bill that he celebrated in that Rose Garden ceremony.",
        "And he has said privately that the Senate bill should be more generous.",
        "And now, publicly, he's talking about a bill with more heart.",
        "We don't know exactly what he - what he wants.",
        "Mara, is it going to be awkward for Republicans if the Senate bill turns out not to be much more generous than the House bill?",
        "Well, we don't know what's going to be in the Senate bill.",
        "But we think it's going to look a lot like the House bill with probably a longer, slower timeline for phasing out the Medicaid expansion, turning it into a block grant, maybe with deeper cuts.",
        "But it also might have more generous tax credits for older, poor Americans than the House bill does.",
        "That's one way that they could say it's more generous.",
        "You know, just watching that event in Iowa last night, there is a reason that President Trump does this.",
        "That is the gear that he is comfortable in.",
        "He has not yet found a way as president to whip up support for policies and his agenda.",
        "And until he does, I think you're going to see him going back into a gear that is comfortable because he hasn't found that other gear."

        "I mean, you know, Kushner may be in his 30s and with no Mid East peace diplomacy experience, but he is Trump's son-in-law and a close confidant to the president.",

        "First off, it's a summary of the very latest science.",
        "It's based on over 1,500 scientific research papers.",
        "And it's unequivocal.",
        "It says that human activities are the overwhelming cause of warming that the world's experiencing.",
        "And that warming is extraordinary.",
        "The last century is, quote, \"\"the warmest in the history of modern civilization,\"\" and temperatures have increased over the last century by two degrees and will continue.",
        "Another important thing is the report points out that the scientific community has looked at all the alternative explanations for warming.",
        "And they insist, quote, \"\"there's no convincing alternative explanation.\"\" And that's important because the Trump administration has a different view.",
        "Earlier this year, in fact, President Trump's EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, said there's tremendous disagreement about whether humans are causing climate change.",
        "Exactly, and that's why I think - I think that's why you only saw two Republicans really break from the Republican ranks for yesterday's vote.",

        "We talk about how unpopular this war is and how much anger there is around the country about the war, and yet for the most part the vote in House last week and the Senate yesterday were pretty close.",
        "Well, let's see if we can get another voice into the conversation.",
        "Joining us now is Senator Richard Shelby, Republican from Alabama.",
