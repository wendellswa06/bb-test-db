        "Well, I thought it had some meaning.",
        "Otherwise, we wouldn't have been voting the way we did.",
        "It was a close vote, but it's not the end of the day.",
        "I think it had substantive meaning because it had that timeline in it that we've all been discussing.",
        "What will happen now with the House and the Senate conference and ultimately when it comes back, we don't know.",
        "When it comes back, you mean after the president vetoes it?",
        "That's right.",
        "We don't know what's going to happen.",
        "So this risks the prospect of - the president says he needs this passed within a matter of just a few weeks or else funding is going to run out to pay for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "Well, I think what most of us are trying to do is make sure that the troops are funded, and that's very important.",
        "And I believe that putting a timeline on the beginning of a withdrawal is the wrong message at the wrong time.",
        "It's an ambiguous message because we have said we're not going to do this two weeks ago.",
        "Now we're saying yes, we are going to put a timeline; and we're saying we support you, but we don't have confidence in you.",
        "We don't think you can succeed, and that's the wrong message.",
        "I think that we all realize that we're in a quandary in Iraq.",
        "We don't know what's going to happen there, but General Petraeus, who a lot of us have a lot of confidence in, is the new commander, personally met with a lot of us and I was very impressed.",
        "And he says basically to us that he needs some time, and I believe that he is making progress on the margin as we speak.",
        "Seven, eight months from now, say Labor Day or a little after, we will know for sure, and so will the president.",
        "But I believe we ought to give our troops every chance in the world to succeed, that is to bring stability to the area, and then perhaps we can ask the diplomats to get involved, maybe find some political resolution to the area because none of us want to stay in Iraq forever."

        "But if we can bring stability, we have a lot at stake here, and I think we should give our troops and General Petraeus, our commander, every opportunity to succeed.",
        "Senator, not to deal in hypotheticals, but if we have to here - assume the president does veto this bill that comes to his desk.",
        "And let's assume that he Democrats still insist on a date certain to withdraw and they will not fund the war without this date certain.",
        "How do Republicans vote against it if that's what the language is going to be, if majorities of both the House and Senate call for that timetable?",
