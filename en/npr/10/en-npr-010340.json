        "That was part of the reason, but the main reason was to support our troops.",
        "We've got to get this money passed and within a month.",
        "We can't dilly-dally around.",
        "Not every Congressman could get his or her own first choice on these bills.",
        "We've got to get something passed because our troops are literally running out of money.",
        "What happens, again - let's say the president does veto it, hypothetically, and then says look, we're going to run out of money for funding the war in Iraq and Afghanistan in a couple of weeks unless I get a bill on my desk, and I'm not going to approve one that has a date for withdrawal.",
        "Well, the president has whip hand in this debate because no one thinks we could override a presidential vetoed.",
        "And Democrats need to realize what slender majorities we have in both houses.",
        "We lost 14 Democrats on this vote in the House, and it only passed 218 to 212.",
        "In the senate, it passed with the help of Republican Senator Chuck Hagel with a slender one or two vote majority.",
        "So we do not have the majorities we need to set U.S.",
        "foreign policy.",
        "And the Congress is institutionally incapable of setting effective foreign policy because we're a committee of 535 people.",
        "Congressman, I was struck by the 14 Democrats who voted against the bill last week.",
        "Half of them were - the far left of the party basically felt that the war should not be funded at all, and others were conservatives who felt that there should be no timetable.",
        "Is the party united on this war?",
        "I think it was a remarkable achievement for Nancy to get 218 votes because both the left and the right wings of the party are upset about various parts of this bill.",
        "I think the vote is a testament to the fact she found the political center of the party.",
        "Nancy is a very adept politician.",
        "She's a remarkable leader, and she's had a great three months as first female speaker in American history.",
        "But these are very tough issues.",
        "I think if you have a historical perspective, you'll see we're behaving much better than the Republican majority did when Clinton was president and we were involved in Bosnia.",
        "And it's much, much better than it was in the late days of the Vietnam War.",
        "So we're trying to pressure the president in appropriate and fair ways.",
        "He is showing signs of listening.",
        "Look at his reversal on North Korean policy and his change in Iranian and Syrian policy.",
        "So I think we're making progress.",
        "It's not always easy or pretty, but I think we're making progress.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line.",
        "This is Richard.",
        "He's calling from Tennessee.",
        "I'm not sure if he's in the Fifth District or not.",
        "But Richard, go ahead.",
        "You're on the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Question for you: Is it such a good - I support the idea of moving a bill through that will support the troops.",
        "I stand behind them myself.",
        "But if it's going to be a problem and the president's going to veto something that he doesn't like in there, why couldn't the Congress pull out the withdrawal terms and simply vote for a censure, which has never been done in probably the last hundred years or so for a president.",
        "Censure the president?",
        "Yes."

        "president.",
        "Many people are disappointed with President Bush's various failures, but it doesn't help America to have these internal censure movements.",
        "I think we've got to move forward, support our troops, and let's do the best we can to have successful foreign policy.",
        "What do you - thanks very much favor the call, Richard.",
        "How do you respond to people who say look at the opinion polls?",
        "We Democrats were elected last November by people who wanted a change in policy in Iraq.",
        "You look at the opinion polls, a substantial majority of people say it's time to set a deadline for withdrawal.",
        "But the Constitution is something we swear to uphold, and the founders gave us a process that is cumbersome, has checks and balances.",
        "Not everyone gets his or her way, but it's been pretty darn successful over the last 230 years.",
        "Our challenge is to make the constitutional structure work in this case and in all cases, and I think it's working.",
        "Let's talk with Robert(ph).",
        "Robert's with us on the line from Novato in California.",
        "Yeah, I was just going to ask the question - Ken Rudin before said - how can we not put in a timeline if we expect to ever get out of here because this - we've already lost the war.",

        "Read the New Yorker article last week, \"\"Betrayed\"\" by George Packer.",
        "We owe an obligation to the folks who have supported us and we've got to honor that obligation.",
        "Parts of Iraq are doing very well.",
        "The Kurdish area is remarkably stable and calm.",
        "There are other signs of hope, and we just can't - unless we want to become isolationists - give up on the rest of the world.",
        "I would certainly agree with the caller, our standing in the world is much lower than it's been probably in American history, and there are a lot of reasons for that.",
        "Hopeful that we're starting to correct some of those reasons, because most people do not blame the American people for these problems.",
        "They might blame particular leaders that we have, but most folks have generally good feelings toward the average American.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Robert.",
        "I think you were listening earlier when Senator Shelby said look, let's give it until September, October, Thanksgiving.",
        "If by Thanksgiving it's not working, it's time to really reconsider.",
        "Is that basically something that you would agree with?"

        "I'm just wondering if there may be some move after the president vetoes this bill, if the Democrats might say okay, we'll give you the funding for the war, we'll pull out our timetable.",

        "And those Republicans that we were mentioning earlier, people who are a little unconformable with this, or even more uncomfortable than Senator Shelby.",
        "People like Norm Coleman in Minnesota, the two Republican senators from the state of Maine, even John Sununu in New Hampshire.",
