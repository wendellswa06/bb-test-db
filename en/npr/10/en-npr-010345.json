        "That desire is still there, but it's not in a great place, though President Trump does continue to call for better relations.",
        "While in Georgia, Vice President Pence said that he hoped for better days and improved relations, but he really emphasized that what Russia has been doing is not OK.",
        "He said that the recent move by Russia telling the U.S.",
        "that it has to reduce its staff in Russia by 755 people wouldn't help things.",
        "You know, interestingly, this is something that President Trump himself has not weighed in on yet.",
        "But now both Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have both talked about this.",
        "And the White House says that sometime soon, President Trump will sign a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia.",
        "But also, that same bill limits his ability to lift those sanctions on his own.",
        "Talk about Russia's response to all this because I know we've been hearing a lot about the expulsion of American diplomats, for example.",
        "Russia has about a hundred thousand troops, its own troops, deployed doing these massive military exercises.",
        "And even today, there was another close encounter over Estonian air space where Spanish and Finnish planes had to intercept Russian military aircraft because Russia's not supposed to be there.",
        "But today we're hearing this message from Mike Pence - right?",
        "- the vice president.",
        "Given past comments by Trump, how much reassurance can Pence deliver?",
        "I spoke to a couple of Europe analysts who have been talking to their friends in Europe who say that they're hearing from people that they aren't sure.",
        "Pence comes, and he says, I'm here on behalf of the president of the United States, but they just aren't sure that they can believe that he really is speaking for the president of the United States."
