        "Well, I don't know if there's a Heisenberg principle operating.",

        "And in 2000, they accurately mirrored one of the closest elections in modern history.",
        "That isn't to say that in all cases, this methodology is going to work and that we shouldn't have a little pause and let the reality speak for itself and not only, you know, the strong assumption that something is going to happen, particularly when we're dealing with two unknown phenomena.",

        "I wasn't up there screaming and saying, whoa, these polls are probably going to be wrong.",
        "But this poll - this experience, as the caller suggests, has taught us a lesson.",
        "It's not refreshing for the polling community.",
        "And you enjoy it, please.",
        "But we're not enjoying it, but hopefully we're going to learn from it.",

        "There may have been a little bit of a bias there, but it was pretty good.",
        "And they had the election results to weight them too pretty soon.",
        "And so they - you know, we didn't have - we haven't had the miscues of these exit polls that we saw in 2004.",
        "And 2006 was pretty good.",

        "And the reason I'm saying this is because as a Democrat in Nevada, which is, you know, puts me in a minority, I've been following this race and wondering why Bill Richardson, who's the guy I like, hasn't been getting any media attention.",

        "Now, to what extent to people who are not doing well in the polls, never make it, many of them don't.",
        "But you have a candidate like Mike Huckabee, who was at about 3 percent in the polls in August or September, gradually come up in the polls, come into Iowa, and do very, very well.",
        "And the polls saw that.",
        "And the polls really do give voice to what's going on in terms of American public opinion that the media often doesn't recognize until they see it manifested itself in the polls.",
        "I mean, the polls are sort of a - in many respects, a troop squad for the media because there's - the media is sometimes surprised.",
        "The biggest surprise, for example, years ago was the extent to which the public actually became more approving of Bill Clinton after the Lewinski scandal broke, not less approving.",

        "And there are many other examples of how - what the polls tell the people, challenges the media's assessment and the conventional wisdom.",
        "Now, which isn't to say that, you know, the notion that the media can get poll-driven isn't also a problem, but they're both problems.",
        "And the media also looks at the fundraising capabilities, which before people vote is taken as a measure of their organizational strength and their likelihood to be able to compete in the future.",
