        "And that sort of skews opinions as well, and it's not reality.",

        "At the end of the day, traditional media is still considered legitimate, while online media is not so.",
        "And one reason you mentioned, Debra, is indeed there have been cases where authors of books have been caught going online to give their own books rave reviews.",

        "Well, and I have to tell you honestly, Neal, I have not done that.",
