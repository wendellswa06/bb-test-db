        "Great to be here.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "No, there is such a thing as bad publicity.",
        "But I help people fight back by turning it around and sometimes going out and trying to get good publicity, because there are so many opportunities for people to get good publicity, even after a crummy review.",
        "And what are those?",
        "Oh, they're all kinds of ways.",
        "Let's use the restaurant industry, for example, since you talked about that earlier.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Back in the 1980s, I was a restaurant reviewer for a newspaper in Cleveland, Ohio, and reviewed restaurants every other week and would see - you know, occasionally would give bad reviews to restaurants.",
        "Some of those same restaurants would turn around and pitch story ideas about their restaurant to people who worked for our paper…"

        "It's a huge topic, and there are all kinds of story ideas that restaurants can pitch.",
        "So in this case, revenge is not a meal best served cold.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, you know, many restaurant people, in particular, their first reaction to a bad review is to yank their advertising, thinking a-ha.",
        "I'll show them who's boss, and they yank their advertising.",
        "That's the wrong approach, because often that can backfire.",
        "Nancy, isn't the - isn't just the opposite true in Hollywood?",
        "If you get really bad reviews and you've invested a quasilion(ph) in dollars in some blockbuster, you escalate the advertising if the reviews are bad.",
        "That's right.",
        "You sort of bury it...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "We've got something that's broken here.",
        "Let's fix it.",
        "The great thing about online these days is that studios can let, you know, not paper critics, but Internet critics see a movie early, and then with a few months advance, and then they get their opinion on it, and they can make tweaks as necessary.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And with that, the critic feels included in the process, and then they will more likely to give it good buzz if they make those adjustments, which is something that Hollywood's never done before, you know, try and get your audience's opinion before the movie comes out and then actually listening and fixing it.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And I think that that's how restaurants succeed as well.",
        "If you've got a dish that's not that great, you could fix it and you make it better, and I think that that's how you turn something around.",
        "Joan Stewart, is this an option, particularly with online situations?",
        "You were talking about newspapers earlier.",
        "How do you combat bad reviews in the blogs?",
        "Oh, I absolutely agree with what she just said.",
        "You know, if somebody has given an opinion that your food happened to be off the night they were there or your service was off, don't get defensive and try to argue with them.",
        "One of the best ways to make the situation OK is to, let's say, write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper, and a lot - I hear a lot of people say, well, I'm not going to write a letter because nobody reads letters to the editor.",
        "That's not true.",
        "The big advantage to writing a letter to the editor and being able to speak in your own words about the review is that editors seldom will edit those letters.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yet that doesn't address the situation of what if it's blog?",
        "Do you get on the blog and…",

        "Yep.",
        "...that anyone in this business needs to recognize these days that this is - we are in a critical culture.",
        "I mean, this is the way the culture is.",
        "We all have an opinion, and we all have now a format to express that.",
        "In the past, critics were sort of seen as on high, where, you know, if you're a critic, you know more.",
        "You're smarter than your reader.",
        "These days, in the user-generated society, online we are a community.",
        "We all are either the same or some of us are smarter than the people that are critiquing.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And I think that that makes a crucial difference in how you respond to a bad review and also how you can fix it.",
        "This is a culture we're not - there's no last say, unfortunately, sometimes.",

        "If you happen to get a bad review at Amazon, don't sweat it.",
        "Amazon.com gives anybody about 17 different opportunities to get fabulous publicity for your own book or whatever it is you're selling.",
        "For example, the author who got a bad book review on \"\"The Art of Small Talk,\"\" if I were her, I would go over to Amazon and start taking a look at other books in that genre, and she can review those books and get a link back to her own Web site.",
        "Hmm.",
        "All right, so this is a way to spread the news.",
        "That's right, and Amazon actually gives you about 17 different opportunities.",
        "You can post free articles there.",
        "You can post lists of your favorites books, CDs, etc.. And if you're proactive about this and you go out and try to get as much publicity as possible, as much good publicity, that bad review could be just a little blip on the screen.",
        "And it must be a lesson then to these businesses: You'd better Google yourself everyday.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think so, and I even encourage people to set up what's called a Google Alert."
