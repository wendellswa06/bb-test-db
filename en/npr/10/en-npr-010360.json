        "And, you know, that's an important thing.",
        "It's a little easier to do online.",
        "But we tend to try and do it proactively, where we send out questionnaires and we send out e-mails to our subscribers and to Consumer Reports subscribers, getting them to provide the ratings.",

        "Sometimes something isn't working properly, and that community can get together and it creates and environment where you are useful.",
        "You can now have a little community that shares information on how to find the best of something and to be aware of the worst of something.",
        "I think the examples of the unfair reviews, obviously, there are sort of nut jobs out there writing crazy reviews.",

        "The ice shelf she was studying is called Larsen C, and it now has a massive 90-mile-long crack running through it.",
        "The big rift is slicing the ice shelf from top to bottom.",
        "It's now a third of a mile deep and as wide across as 25 highway lanes.",
