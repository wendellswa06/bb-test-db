        "So they can take the gains they get from Iraq - weapons, vehicles they get from the Iraqi army and weapons taken in Syria to use in Iraq - and also as a propaganda tool to bring fighters who come into Syria - bring them to Iraq and to really push and create another front against the Iraqi government.",

        "That's a fatal genetic disease that leaves its victims without an immune system, but there was hope.",
        "Using gene therapy, the researchers were able to insert a healthy copy of the faulty gene into the sick children, and many of the kids went on to develop an immune system and were cured of the disease.",

        "So these people, the, to the French group, take the bone marrow of these children, who would have surely otherwise not survived unless they got a bone marrow transplantation, took their bone marrow, introduced into them the gamma-C chain using a viral vector system called retroviruses, and all these children showed a remarkable improvement of their immune function as judged by their ability to make antibodies, as judged by their ability to fight infection.",
        "They went to school.",
        "They behaved normal.",
        "And as you said, three years later came the development of leukemia, and the argument was made that why--what happened is, that when the virus gets into a cell, it really cannot be controlled where it goes.",
        "It may have gone in the vicinity of another gene--in this case referred to LMO2--which normally is not making any protein, but when it does inappropriately, it can cause leukemia.",
        "So the argument was made that the virus might have inserted itself next to this gene, thereby activating it when it should not have been activated, and that results in T-cell lymphomas.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So, based on that data, we said we will perform the same identical experiment in mouse to ask the question, can we reproduce the phenomena that happened in human and could we learn from this?",
        "So we found a mouse which is exactly the duplicate of the same disease as the gamma C chain deficiency; made exactly the same experiment, except we used a different vector--a same family of vector but slightly different--and did the same experiment; and were surprised on two counts.",
        "one, where we took just the gamma C chain alone; second, where we just took the LMO2, the gene which is the offending gene of causing the disease; third, we combined the gamma C and the LMO2 together in one vector, so we give it the best chance to make cancer; and finally, a control which had a nonspecific gene, has no business to cause cancer.",
        "So what we found that the control, 100 percent of the animals were fine.",
        "In those which had the LMO2, 40 percent of the animals came down with leukemia, as we expected.",
        "But what surprised us the most was that where gamma C chain alone was used, 33 percent of those animals also came down with the same kind of a tumor that was witnessed in these children, except it took them six months before we could observe them and some came as late as 10 months.",
