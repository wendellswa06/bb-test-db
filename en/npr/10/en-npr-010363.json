        "When it was over, the audience filed out, having seen an entire evening devoted to a topic that is, for many of them, still the issue in this and every election.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",

        "Just as unhappy families - at least according to Tolstoy - are unhappy in their own way, so, too, are economically endangered countries endangered in their own way.",
        "That's certainly the impression you are left with after reading Michael Lewis' new book \"\"Boomerang.",
        "Iceland, Ireland, Greece, even the United States.",
        "And in each case, he found a fatal flaw deeply engrained in the culture that at least partly explains how they lost their economic way.",

        "Good to have you with us, Michael.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "So the world in the first decade of this century is, as you explain it, was awash in cheap credit.",
        "Each country was kind of like it was left in the dark with a big pile of money, and what they did with that money was very revealing about that country.",
        "Can you explain that a little more, what you mean by that?",
        "So in children, it was also after three months, uh, three years.",
        "Now it's difficult to compare the life of a mouse and that of a human, but it pointed to the fact that the gene product that was being used to correct the defect, had also the ability to cause cancer by itself.",
        "And therefore, one has to be, uh, rethink the idea of using genes like this, which have the ability to cause cancer.",
        "Possibly because, this gene is just not for one gene alone.",
        "There are a number of other genes which requires the same gamma-C chain to function.",
        "So we don't understand how that works.",
        "Yeah.",

        "We...",
        "Or else you would not have put it in in the first place.",
        "So, what happens is that, this gene is a third leg of a receptor which requires this.",
        "In other words, there are many receptors which are needed to make T cell, B cells.",
        "They have two components, but they need the third component which is called the gamma C chain.",
        "But it turns out there are six other receptors which also need the same gamma C chain.",
        "So when we put gamma C chain in cells--in this case, all of them got the same gamma C chain--and therefore, there was a dis-regulation.",
        "So we don't know why and how, when multiple components which were missing this gene also got it, how they might have behaved.",
        "And that's something which we'll follow on.",
        "But the surprise still remains that the gamma-C chain alone has the ability to cause about the same number of tumors as have been observed in the case of human.",
        "Do you think this is gonna make everybody pause and think about...",
        "I think it certainly should make people think about it because the first question one will ask is could it be that the method we used made more protein than normally, and it's therefore not natural?",
        "Well, that is a reasonable argument, but you can't really say that because we can't control in the human gene therapy trials how much protein will be made.",
        "We can't control how much virus will go in.",
        "We cannot control how much virus will integrate, and therefore, there is a concern now--that since we can't control that, and since the protein has the ability, whether we make too much or too little--it certainly has the potential to cause the disease.",
        "And therefore, it requires rethinking how we might want to do it.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Do you think that this rethinking in these risks are true not only for this gene but for others like it?",
        "Or do you think that it's likely to happen with all forms of gene therapy?",
        "No, no, no, because, definitely, not.",
        "Because there's another kind of a SCID, the same bubble boy, where the deficiency is a gene called a adenosine deaminase gene, which is a known enzyme.",
        "There you just put the enzyme back, and that enzyme can do the function.",
        "So there we don't think the same function will happen.",
        "Now there, the virus that can integrate in the vicinity of an offending gene can still happen, but it can't be due to the gene product itself.",
        "It may be due to other reasons but not the gene product, so it's different than the gamma C chain.",
        "What has happened since with the other kids who did not come down with the cancer?"

        "Maybe they made the correct amount of it that fit perfectly, and I hope that that is the case.",
        "However, we didn't see this tumor till six to 10 months, so it's a little be more long-lasting.",
        "We need to wait a little bit longer to be absolutely certain.",
        "But it is quite possible that these kids, and I hope, are going to be ok.",

        "But I know one who's responding, and one got a marrow transplant.",
        "Is it not possible to think, and I'm thinking as a parent, or someone who takes care of kids, that if your child had this disease you might want to take that risk?",
        "You know, it's very hard, because when you're a parent whether that child, and when the time comes, I don't know.",
        "But I personally, would think, yes, it's worth taking the risk.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Taking the risk and trading, possibly trading one illness for another.",
        "And one--and at leukemia, you know, we don't want it to happen, but might be curable, whereas the baby-bubble-boy disease may not.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The only other thing one could argue in that case is, and that's been done, that if you have a matching bone marrow, that may be the easier way to do it, because bone marrow transplantations are very successful, and that that might allow these children to have a normal.",
        "But finding a successful matching bone marrow is also not a trivial undertaking.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So your case doesn't make, your study doesn't make a case for halting all gene therapy trials."
