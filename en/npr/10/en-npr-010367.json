        "How much military intelligence sharing is going on about Syrian chemical weapons and Hezbollah guerillas and the various military aspects of this civil war?",
        "Look, we don't know for sure, but from what we know, the intelligence cooperation in general between the United States and Israel has really picked up in the last several years.",
        "And you've also seen a lot of visits between U.S.",
        "and Israeli security officials at a frequency level in the last few years that is above what we used to see.",
        "Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have stated explicitly in the last couple of days that if the U.S.",
        "does not strike Syria, it will show Iran that, for the United States, a redline is not a redline.",
        "And that's a big concern, generally speaking, for Israel, right, especially as it concerns Iran much more than Syria.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think the debate here is viewed differently than it is in Israel.",
        "They're not worried they're going to get hit by chemicals by the Syrians.",
        "The Syrians use chemicals against weaker opponents, not with people of very potent military capability.",
        "So there's no real threat to Israel of a Syrian chemical strike.",
        "The threat to Israel is they are very much dependent on the president's commitments about redlines.",
        "And if now redlines are conditional and require a majority of 535 other people...",
        "That's Congress.",
        "...which is Congress - to even agree to limited strikes, then, in their view, this is a horrific kind of outlook.",
        "So, I think they feel even if they win, they lose.",
        "But I'm wondering how much this figures in American politics.",
        "The New York Times has quoted an unnamed administration official as saying that the pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC, is - and I'm quoting the New York Times here - \"\"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\"\" Is that your impression?",
        "I think they have to speak for themselves.",
        "I really don't know how they're going to make their calculations.",
        "I think they probably feel that, you know, the more they get deeper into this debate, the more people think they're doing this for Israel.",
        "And that's not the way Israel sees it.",
        "The Saudis feel this way, most of the Gulf States - the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait.",
        "They also deal with countries that are not Gulf states, like Jordan and others.",
        "You know, they have always relied on American credibility.",
        "This is not an Israel issue, per se.",
        "This is whether countries in the Middle East can, you know, rely on when the president of the U.S., you know, puts forward a redline.",
        "At this point in time, as things stand, does Israel want to see Bashar al-Assad go?"

        "The other school of thought is the devil you know, but the other guy could be worse, with a lot of these Sunni extremists, including al-Qaida offshoots.",
        "And I think part of their hesitancy - certainly refraining from doing whatever they can to make a recommendation of the United States - is that they have not clarified this policy debate over there.",

        "And you - first of all, tell us how many people you interviewed and what you found.",
        "Well, over the years, I first started out interviewing low-income people, and that was when our town closed some schools and many of my high-income neighbors were vehement that their kids be redistricted to only the high-income schools and not the mixed schools - not the low-income schools where it would have been mixed.",
        "So after those interviews, and I learned that low-income people really did want their kids in high-quality schools mixed with other children, I then interviewed about 40 low-income adolescents, 36 high-income adolescents, about 35 school personnel.",
        "And the last study - and my book is mainly based on that - is 20 high-income mothers.",
        "But high-income - we're basically talking middle-class educated people, many of whom had doctoral degrees and master's degrees.",
        "So it's not the elite, it's really educated middle-class.",
        "Hmm.",

        "Right.",
        "…about diversity and about the need and the benefits of integration, for example.",
        "In fact, they talked about that on the theoretical level, but when it came down their own child, they worried about a downward trajectory and the importance of their children being in what they called good schools or class-pure schools or high-tracks or ability groups.",
        "So they pushed for this.",
        "Now, the implications of that always are that other who aren't doing this negotiation, their kids end up in lesser circumstances and lesser schools.",
        "So in spite of their rhetoric about the importance of integration and, you know, the social values of interaction, they choose to push for privilege for their own children.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And were they aware of - I mean, I guess you could call it a contradiction.",
        "In other words, they weren't saying, I'm for segregated schools, but were they aware that in effect that's what they were saying?",
        "Yes.",
        "And they would start out - these are interviews, so - long interviews, lasted a couple hours each, but they start out by talking about benefits of integrated schools, but the necessity of segregated schools for their kids."

        "For example, if the school board said no more tracking in this district, what would - how would you react?",
        "And they'd first say, well, that would be good idea and they'd say, but it wouldn't work, our kids have to be separated from those kids.",
        "They saw the other kids - and I'm talking about social class here, we're about - we were about 95 percent white, we're probably a little more diverse now in Bloomington, but we're talking about segregation from low-income children, whom they saw as contaminated.",
        "They feel sorry for them.",
        "They'd say, well, their parents just aren't doing a good parenting job.",
