        "What's your reaction to that?",
        "Well, there are two things.",
        "One is the curriculum.",
        "And I think that most American schools now, both in white and unfortunately, also in predominantly black neighborhoods are European American-centered.",
        "They have not incorporated a broader range of issues - other continents besides Europe.",
        "And the other thing is - we're watching the Jena, Louisiana situation…",
        "Indeed.",
        "…where we see the blatant racism that exists in mixed schools or predominantly white schools.",
        "It's not obvious to whites.",
        "So, we've watched the whites down there, they say, well, we're in an integrated town and we're not racist.",
        "And yet, looked at from another perspective, many of us watching from the outside would gasp at some of the racist things that were occurring, the differential penalty systems.",
        "We don't get a good look at that school, but I've been to many schools and - going back to Jonathan Kozol's work, the schools in low-income neighborhoods get only about a third of the resources of schools in high-income neighborhoods.",
        "So sometimes, you have to choose in a defensive way to protect your own child if you are a person who has generally been prejudiced against or discriminated against in terms of quality schooling.",
        "To me, the best schools are integrated schools with comprehensive curriculum.",
        "Because I think then we all learn about each other together.",
        "But I could see why African-American parents in schools that there is a lot of discrimination and not much mention people of people of their own race and history, or whatever.",
        "I can see why they'd make that choice, as a defensive move against a racist and European American-centered system.",

        "Hello there.",
        "We had our daughter in a really cute, lovely country school by our house and we had to transfer her out.",

        "But she was coming home with work she did in preschool and, you know, was very bored and stuff like that.",

        "Well, it a great question.",
        "Ellen Brantlinger, do you want to respond to that question from Chris?",
        "I think all kids thrive when there's academic push, and sometimes - I remember being very bored in school, but so were the kids that weren't as advanced as I happen to be.",
        "I think you can really develop a very rich curriculum that reaches a broad range of learners.",
        "And everything I'd say is I think kids from different income levels or different races are really more alike than different.",
        "So, if we could encourage teachers to provide academic push for all children and rich curriculum so that everybody is challenged and excited about school.",
        "I think the biggest word in school when people do research in boredom, and boredom for teacher and kids.",
        "And so, how can we enrich, enliven, and advance the curriculum to reach the broad range of learners?",
        "And I think it's possible.",
        "It's very difficult, but it's possible.",
        "And, Kingsley Jones at the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles, I'd be curious to hear what you have to say to Chris as well about her question.",
        "What's your advice?",
        "Well, you have to take into consideration the education - the level of performance.",
        "And that's one of the things that we do.",
        "Each student - well, we teach them to their - they have IEPs, they have individual educational programs.",
        "So a child that is, in fact, advanced, we keep pushing them and allow them to continue to achieve.",
        "The size of the classes are significantly smaller than the classes in the typical school system, so we're able to give a child a lot more of the one-on-one type of assistance that children need.",
        "But the thing that we concentrate on most, we're a believer in the power of words.",
        "We really believe that the - that our words - we teach the words are like food.",
        "Verbs are like vegetables and nouns are like nuts.",
        "So we are careful the kind of nutritional speak.",
        "We make sure that our children are getting the RDA, the recommended daily allowance of nutritional speak in their lives.",
        "And if food - if words are like food, then thought must be seed.",
        "So we protect what the children think and what they watch and what they process.",
        "And we - our computers have - there's a term called GOGI - garbage in, garbage out.",
        "And more times than not, our children are processing the wrong kinds of information.",
        "So we get the wrong kinds of results.",
        "If we could prepare and we could process the right kinds of information, then the end result would be different.",
