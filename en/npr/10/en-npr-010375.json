        "That was a fabulous cast, and they are just so right at playing the youth in the play, and also the direction really highlights as playing the youth but not sort of commenting on it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Even though they are - they are in their mid-20s, but I think that they really play it in a very real way - the youthfulness of the characters and their journeys.",

        "Right.",
        "What one of the story points of the play was having - I was reading an article about the gifted camp at Johns Hopkins in the summer, and that there was a girl there that had memorized Pi.",
        "And by the end of the summer, there was a guy there who had memorized Pi kind of to be like her, and I thought that was very sweet.",
        "And I loved the idea of kind of these kids in this very nerdy environment getting to be very nerdy and comfortable with that, and that was one of the little sparks that kind of started the play - or started that character.",

        "Also the movie \"\"Mean Girls,\"\" which is a more recent one that came out a couple of years ago, which is really fabulous, I hadn't watched before I wrote the play.",
        "And then kind of when I was watching that I became kind of excited because it was dealing with some of the same things.",

        "And I do get to change a lot of stuff, and I did do a lot of rewrites while we were in the room.",
        "And we - and production-wise, we continued to make changes throughout of course the rehearsal process but even once we got into the theater and saw how things were landing once we were on stage and what was - how things were working with certain audiences, so..."
