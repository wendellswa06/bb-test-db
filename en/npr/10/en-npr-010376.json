        "Do the actors have input into you should change this, change that in a small production like this?",
        "Well, I think the biggest input the actors bring is just themselves.",
        "And like every actor brings something, you know, something new to a role, and I've learned so much from this group of actors about these characters too, you know.",
        "And I think that's kind of the fun of being a playwright, too.",
        "Did you have to find actors who like math?",
        "No, and actually I think our actors don't like math so much.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We did some practice math problems in rehearsal one day, and I think it was helpful for them because they felt the kind of the tension and frustration that some of the characters feel in some of the scenes in the play, but...",

        "Do you have to have a math adviser?",
        "Well, our dramaturge on the project, Carrie Hughes(ph), actually was on the high school math team.",

        "Also our lighting designer is also - Sarah Sedman(ph) is also a former mathlete, so.",
