        "Law Professor Solove believes ZabaSearch is symptomatic of a larger problem: government and industry groups' refusal to protect consumer privacy.",
        "I think we need more laws.",
        "Regulation is the only way that this can be effectively dealt with, because for some time, the companies have been saying, `Of course, we're going to protect privacy.",
        "But that still doesn't really--and hasn't worked to protect us.",

        "But even if you do manage to opt out of ZabaSearch, Matzorkis says they can't promise you won't end up right back in there later, when the site buys a new batch of data.",

        "And you're giving us a sense here of the complexity - the political complexity, anyway - of sending humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza.",
        "You've reminded us that Fatah is in control of the West Bank, Hamas is in control Gaza.",
        "A lot of Israel's neighbors and the neighbors of the Palestinians also have concerns here.",

        "That's right.",
        "She goes to Israel next.",
        "And, you know, the question hanging over all of this even here at the conference is whether Fatah and Hamas will eventually form some sort of unity government.",
        "How will the US and Europeans deal with that?",
        "A lot of people here have been talking about the need for reconciliation.",
        "Secretary Clinton avoided that issue entirely in her remarks to the conference.",
        "And so far, her aids have stuck to this line that, you know, the Bush administration set out, and that is if Hamas is to be part of the government, it has to renounce violence, recognize Israel, and recognize previous agreements with Israel.",
        "A spokesman told us that, you know, if Hamas becomes part of the government, then we have a problem.",
        "That's going to be definitely an issue on the next stop, Israel, as will be the need to even get humanitarian supplies in, because Israel has kept up quite a tight closure of Gaza.",
        "Is Israel going to allow these humanitarian supplies in if the political situation is not what Israel wants?",
        "Well, we'll have to see.",
        "I mean, Europeans and Arab officials here have been, you know, urging to the US to persuade the Israelis to ease up on the closures.",
        "That's something Secretary Clinton's going to have to tackle.",
        "We heard French President Nicholas Sarkozy today say that Gaza should not be allowed to be a prison with an open sky.",
        "On the other hand, you know, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said that he doesn't want to see the international community get into what he called an endless discussion with Israel over getting macaroni into Gaza.",
        "He wants to make sure that the broader goals are not lost here, you know, the broader goal of having a viable Palestinian state.",
        "And he made clear that his government will only remain viable if it's seen as working toward that and trying to work toward an end of Israeli occupation.",
        "NPR's Michele Kelemen, reporting from near the airport there in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is travelling today.",
