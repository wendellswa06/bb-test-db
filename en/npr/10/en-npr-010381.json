        "Well, we found - overall, we found less sexual content in the media that these kids were choosing to watch and listen to than we were expecting to.",

        "That's correct.",

        "We found that it did, particularly with our white subjects, and in particular with the white girls.",
        "So less so with white boys, but it was still significant, and it was not significant for our black population.",
        "When you say significant, what does that mean?",
        "That we found that for the white population, they were 25 percent more likely to have sexual intercourse two years after this time one study if they had a heavy sexual media diet.",
        "So the amount of sexual content that they consumed with their media use impacted their early onset of sexual intercourse.",
        "And that was after we controlled for all the typical things that you might think would have an effect, like -",
        "Now there's a new study from the Rand Corporation that finds a link between sexually explicit lyrics in pop music and sexual behavior.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm familiar with that study, and our results in some ways are similar.",
        "We found a very strong effect for music, as well.",
        "But in the Rand study, I think they looked at sort of raunchy lyrics versus non-raunchy lyrics, and the lyrics that were deemed not raunchy might still be sexual in content, and so that's why I think some of our results were different.",
        "So we show an overall effect just for the sheer amount of sexual content that they consume, and in our study, anyway, it didn't matter so much what that particular content was.",
        "Is there any way of knowing whether the media diet is the cause of the sexual behavior or that there's just a correlation, in that kids who are more likely to watch sexy things are going to be more likely to, you know, engage in sex?",
        "Right, and that is the million-dollar question.",
        "Wouldn't it be great if we could know that for certain?",
        "So part of the difficulty is there's not very many studies that deal with sex and the media that have a longitudinal aspect, and the studies that do are kind of coming out now.",
        "The Rand study is one that started the same time that our study started, and there's another one out of California and then out of the University of Pennsylvania."

        "Diane Levin, I wanted to ask you about something like Kidz Bop or some other phenomenon such as, you know, there are TV shows where they show tweens sort of acting almost like they're college students, or certain kinds of clothes that are aimed to young girls.",
        "You know, they all seem kind of benign if you think about the world at large.",
        "Maybe they're not so bad.",
        "I mean, do you really see a problem with these kinds of things?",
        "Well, what I see is a progression, so that starting at young ages, there are things that are happening that we're pretty desensitized to that don't seem like a big concern, but gradually when children are the age of the study that Carol was looking at, they've had a whole history of socialization into viewing themselves as being much older than they are, thinking of sex as being - and sexual behavior, not necessarily sex per se - as very connected to them.",
        "But the part that kind of in that continuum that worries me the most is that they've come to see sex almost as entertainment.",
        "I mean, when they see it over and over again on the screen, when they see it when they get dolls like Bratz dolls that say what you do is get involved in appearance and going out to clubs to attract males, what that does is kind of get girls involved in imitating behavior that they can't understand.",
        "It gets them focused on appearance and how they look rather than relationships, and what we're hearing about now in older kids' sexual behavior is often that it is sex as entertainment, sex with no complications.",
        "Sex is something that's not connected to the relationships that they've having, and in the long run, that's probably the most harmful part of what's going on.",
        "Because magically, when they grow up and they haven't had experiences with what it means to have relationships with a caring partner to whom you're deeply connected with, it's going to be very hard for them when it's time for them to become parents, when it's time for them to have stable adult relationships.",
        "And what about the role of the internet?",
        "We haven't really talked about that yet.",
        "That's really kind of a separate, somewhat different issue from the whole question of marketing.",
        "But as we heard from the tape we played earlier and as I learned as I interviewed kids, that they are indeed bumping up against pornography on the internet.",
        "I'm hearing that over and over again, and children are curious.",
        "And by the time they're tweens, they think they can handle just about anything, contrary to what the voice said that you played earlier.",
        "Most of the children that I've talked to and heard about, they're ambivalent about it, but they want to act tough and grown up, and they've learned that they're supposed to, and so they're exposed to content all the time which they can't make sense of.",
        "I mean, one of the things about tweens that's so deceptive: it seems like they have a lot of information and they can deal with a lot, but they don't have the emotional maturity nor the cognitive maturity to really use it and put it together in thoughtful, interconnected ways so that they can start reaching their own conclusions about what's appropriate and what isn't.",
        "It's hard enough for adults to do that, but for tweens, it's even harder, and that's the other piece that I think we really need to think about in terms of the role of parents.",
        "I mean, it's harder - parents have to know more and more to be able - You talked about knowing about what the media culture is, but they also need to know how to connect with their kids around these issues in ways parents never had to before.",
        "And so parents need much more skill and knowledge than they needed, say, 20 years ago, and so we also need to begin thinking about how can we help parents, but also that it's not fair that there's such a big burden that's being put on parents to deal with these issues.",
        "All right.",
        "I think we might have some parents on the line that we want to turn to now."
