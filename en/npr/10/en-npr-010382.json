        "Well.",
        "And that's why I'm more concerned, like the example of that music, the albums of re-wording songs for kids, that of popular music, when so much of the music is filled with sexual content.",
        "And it's content about, the majority of it is relationships.",
        "It's relationships, like Diane was saying, out of context.",
        "The research that I've done shows that whenever there is these sort of romantic relationships, the people are never married or rarely in committed relationships.",
        "It's lots of provocative clothing that is just all over the place, and so, you know, it's the way a 4-year-old would know how to dress.",
        "It's what is available there.",
        "And so, you know, then you go to the stores and you see the clothes and so on, so -",
        "And this dad was talking about the, I guess the older women here kind of going along with it.",
        "I mean, what's the parental responsibility here?",
        "Well, I think part of it is because sometimes I think we may have our concern on the wrong target, that we're overly - this is just my personal opinion, but from my research - overly concerned with the internet right now and not concerned enough with music, which seems pretty innocuous, and kids are listening - I mean, in our city, we found kids are basically listening all the time.",
        "And so they're listening to lyrics all the time of which nearly half of those lyrics are sexually explicit in nature, and most of that sex is about non-committed relationships.",
        "And parents probably really aren't paying that much attention to those lyrics.",
        "Exactly.",
        "They're just hearing a kind of boppy sound and they think, it's okay.",
        "Right.",
        "And they're not paying enough attention to that."

        "Exactly.",
        "One thing, if I could just say one thing to the father, I think women have grown up - I mean, if I talked, since 1984 this has been going on, and the women who are the mothers of young children today grew up in this environment, so it's not surprising that in some ways they're desensitized to it, too.",
        "But I think having conversations about it, talking about your concerns, talking to the 16-year-old about what you're seeing and why you're concerned, not expecting to solve the problem - either it's a problem or it's not - but to make it better than it otherwise would be and have it be something that you're talking about, is really important for paving the way, for as your children get older and the issues become bigger, for you to be able to work on it with your wife and for you and your wife to be able to work on it with your children.",
        "Just before I let both of you go, both of you could answer this for me, and thanks so much for calling in, Roger.",
        "You know, it seems like such a sort of almost namby-pamby answer to say, you know, communicating with your kids is the most important thing.",
        "But Carol Pardun, before you go, is it, is that it?",
        "Yes.",
        "But you know, our research found sort of an interesting result that we were not expecting.",
        "We found that if parents just, you know, flat out said don't do that, that it was very effective.",
        "And so sort of the current literature indicates that we should be having these reasoned conversations with our kids.",
        "But our research, although we were expecting it not to result in this, was just, you know, parents who will boldly say you can't do that, stop doing that, I don't want you to do that, and were very explicit, tended to have the biggest affect.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thanks.",
        "We're going to take that up with our next guest.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us, Carol.",
        "Sure.",
        "Carol Pardun is director of the School of Journalism at Middle Tennessee State University and she's a researcher with the Teen Media Project at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.",
        "And Diane Levin, before you go, the importance of communication?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, what I'd like to say is I think it's time for parents to really get up in arms about what's happening to their children.",
        "Communication, I think, is important of all sorts.",
        "Communicating our values, saying yes or no is important, but also letting our kids have a voice.",
        "But we also need to get up in arms because what's happening to the society is making it harder and harder for parents."

        "And it's the media and corporate culture that's doing this to make money off of our kids, buying those sexy clothes that the father called about.",

        "And Carol Pardun, who's been doing research on kids and the media, says the parents who maybe talk tough with their kids or certainly are strong in their opinions are the most successful.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "Now Deborah, before the break you were responding to a listener's call who had expressed surprise at what her son and some of his friends were doing and exchanges - things they were saying to each other online.",
        "And you were saying it's not a surprise to you.",
        "No.",
        "And quite frankly, for the first 20, 25 years I was in this job, hardly anything surprised me, after a while.",
        "And I would say toward the end of the '90s I started to hear things that almost knocked me off the chair.",
        "Well, amidst all of this very scary information that we're hearing this afternoon, I think we have to remember and point out to parents over and over again that decades of research has demonstrated that it's parents who really make the difference here, that parents who are engaged and involved in their children's lives - just across the board, but in this area specifically - those parents who are open with their children about this topic, don't have their hand in the sand, are willing to address it in as many different ways as it needs to be addressed, that those children grow up healthier."

        "Go ahead, Deborah.",
        "By the same token, I want to reinforce what Diane said at least a couple of times, which is adults are not getting what's going on here.",
        "First of all, the reason that the media is in our children's faces in the ways that they are has to do with the fact that parents have not been doing the job that I was just - the kind of job that I was just alluding to.",
        "Adults for decades, and schools for decades, have created a vacuum in children's lives around these issues.",
        "While we weren't looking, the media having discovered - and by the way, I think it's so interesting that we're using the word tweens, as if it's a bona fide handle, developmental handle.",
