        "Yeah.",
        "I think - one of the analogies I love to use with parents is that you have to think of your children as Martians.",
        "They're just plopped into this culture, they're trying to figure it out all the time, and even more and more things are being broadcast directly and targeted directly at them.",
        "And actually what her son is being exposed to is not a surprise to people like me.",
        "So that I - I think that's why - one of the reasons that parents aren't doing the limit-setting job, they have to be willing to see the world in which their children are being raised and see the world through their eyes.",
        "All right, we're going to wrap this conversation about tweens and the media when we return from a short break.",
        "And if you'd like to join the conversation, give us a call at 800-989-8255.",

        "If you'd like to give us a call, the number is 989-8255.",

        "Or conductors having a bad day.",
        "Like the things that kids are exposed to.",
        "Well, for one thing, my seniors - and I teach kids from grades four through grade 12 - my seniors are suddenly telling me that they - they sort of didn't recognize their younger siblings who were in middle school.",
        "They didn't recognize their social life, they didn't recognize their attitudes about sex, that they seemed to have a different perspective."

        "And I began to worry, because this was a - like a mini generation gap.",
        "And I do think that that's explainable by what was said earlier, that these marketers are very good.",
        "They push things along quickly enough so that over a six or 12 month period you seem some big changes in what our kids are being exposed to, but they don't do it so quickly enough that there's a gasp factor.",
        "It's one of the ways that they're very brilliant at what they do.",

        "Once I did tell him I wanted to look at it, I found that some of the young girls had written in his yearbook very sexual things, and I was in shock.",
        "I just couldn't believe they would write these things in the yearbook and that my son would try to hide it from me.",
        "This is my first experience with this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Look at the guilt and shame there.",
        "It's - you know, you scratch the surface of this culture of ours and it looks so new and different and underneath are very antiquated, centuries-old attitudes about sex that we just haven't figured out yet.",
        "And the media know this.",
        "They know that we're conflicted about sex, they know that we're conflicted about femininity and they use it.",
        "And so that our children are not just having to deal with what's new, they're having to deal with what's old in our culture, the bathwater that we should have thrown out in the '60s and didn't.",
        "I want to make a suggestion to parents.",
        "It's very important that in thinking about how to approach your children, that you try as hard as possible not to sound sex negative.",
        "Because when we get so upset about these things, and it has to do with sexual content, our children think we're saying that sex is bad.",
        "And really these conversations are not so much about sex.",
        "They're about values.",
        "They truly are.",
        "And what's wrong with the sex that's in our children's lives is not that it's sex.",
        "It's that the context in which this information is being presented to our children violates all of the values that parents across the country tell me all the time they want their children to hold in relation to sexuality.",
        "And that's where the emphasis needs to be.",
        "It's not that sex is bad.",
        "Sex is good.",
        "Sex is fundamentally positive.",
        "But it's also very, very important and very, very powerful.",

And just saying no does not give them the information that your interviewee right now was just saying.",
        "I have been honest with my children about sex.",
        "Sex is a normal part of life.",
        "And to lie to them and tell them no goes back to those archaic ideals that sex is bad.",
        "And we have to give it to them in the proper context at the proper age.",
        "And it's horrifying to me that schools now have almost reverted to pre-'60s.",

        "Parents are acting like it's something that doesn't exist, and then we wonder why our kids are looking at it as this taboo instead of it's a natural part of life.",
        "So I just think that that's really important.",
        "We can't just say no. We have to give them the information but give it to them in the proper context of values, of people caring for each other.",

        "Sure.",

        "And from the rest of society, they're getting just say yes.",
        "And even though they sound very different, it's basically the same message, which is there's nothing for you to think about.",
        "We're going to tell you what to do, or it's simple, there's nothing to think about.",
        "And what we need to be doing, if we are going to step up to our adult role - both families and schools - we need to be teaching them the opposite message, which is no. This is very important.",
        "You must think about it."

        "It's those daughters that produce California's monster strawberry crop.",
        "And all along this chain of clones, from petri dish to final harvest, people are working obsessively, fanatically, to protect these plants from disease because California's strawberry growers don't want to take any risk that their crop will fail.",
        "They have too much money invested, especially in expensive land in prime growing areas along the coast.",
        "So every year, a month before planting, fumigation machines move slowly across the fields injecting chemicals into the soil and sealing in the fumes with sheets of plastic.",
        "The chemicals kill weeds, insects, and fungi - like a fungus that strawberry grower Daren Gee dreads called fusarium wilt.",
        "Fusarium wilt, you can kind of picture, is like the Great White shark of the soil.",
        "It's floating around in there and then it just gobbles up your plants.",
        "Now, organic strawberry growers don't fumigate; they stay a step ahead of diseases by moving from field to field.",
        "But even organic growers buy their strawberry plants from nurseries that do use fumigation."
