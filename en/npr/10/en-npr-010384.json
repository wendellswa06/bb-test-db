        "So here's the coconut coir; it's the fibers from the outside of a coconut.",
        "Yeah, looks remarkably like soil, actually.",
        "And its wets and it has good water-holding capacity, and it mimics soil.",
        "But it's not soil, which is the point.",

        "Using the heat of the sun to sterilize the soil or ground-up seeds of canola plants.",

        "It may work four out of five times and that looks great to a researcher, but that means 20 percent of the growers fail.",
