        "What is wrong with the way science is done, these days, Tom?",

        "I mean, these are congressman or senators who are actually sending the money to the NIH.",
        "And, in fact, when the ceremony for Louis Stokes, where they kind of cut the ribbon, the acting director of the NIH said of Stokes, his word was his bond.",

        "Of course, the National Airport is named after Ronald Reagan, but he didn't fund that.",
        "So what I'm saying is, government science has become much more - the problem is government has gotten control of science.",
        "It's not that the liberals or the conservatives, the Democrats or the Republicans, have gotten control of it, is what I would say.",
        "So who should be in control of science?",

        "A minority in real science, a minority of one can be right.",
        "But now, with government science, there's a tendency to centralize power to intimidate dissenters.",
        "The person who really foresaw this and put it better than anyone was Eisenhower and his famous Military-Industrial Complex speech, in 1961, just before the Kennedy inaugural.",
        "He, in the same speech - and very few people know about this - lamented about the increased share of research that was being taken over by the federal government, the decline of the solitary inventor, as he called them.",
        "And he feared the domination of scholars by federal employment.",
        "And he also commented that it looked as though government contracts were becoming a substitute for curiosity.",
        "These are amazingly prescient remarks made by Eisenhower.",
        "And in the same speech of just a few sentences later, is the Military-Industrial Complex.",
        "Government agencies have a tendency to want to expand and to enlarge their own mission.",
        "And in order to do this, they're inclined to discern crisis and to inflate them, global warming, stem cell - and opportunities.",
        "And we've seen this in recent years in such issues as global warming and bird flu, I think, is another one.",
        "Stem cell…",
        "So you don't believe in global warming or that the bird flu is?",
        "Well, bird flu…",
        "…is a potential problem.",
        "Well, I mean, bird flu may be a potential problem, but we're talking about 120 cases over a nine-year period in the whole world, where there are 55 million people, I believe, die every year.",
        "And, you know, it is just - when you take the worst-case scenario and you pump it up with headlines, the media, you know, of course, plays along because - in a sense, naturally, because for them, you know, a story - saying that something frightening is going to happen is much more likely to - is much more headline worthy than if you have, for example, a climate scientists just says that climate is doing - is fine."
