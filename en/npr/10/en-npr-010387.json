        "See, what you're saying here is that the experts, that there is a kind of consensus that should be allowed to develop and nobody should be allowed to say anything against that.",
        "That's basically your…",
        "No, I'm saying that a lot of people have studied this problem, spent a lot of time on it.",
        "And when consensus develops in science, it's based on repeated testing of an idea.",
        "And when it does develop, that's a very, very strong thing.",
        "Do you think that - do you think, Tom, that an individual scientist, the opinions of one is just as valuable as a consensus of the general scientific community?",
        "And should hold as much weight no matter what the information is?",
        "No, I wouldn't say that, but there has been a lot of controversy about AIDS, especially in Africa, especially when you redefined it so that you don't have to have the HIV test at all.",
        "That's because they have trouble with the facilities.",
        "They can't always perform the test.",
        "So they do the best that they can with what they have available.",
        "And, of course, they can't always do the clinical examination that you would want.",
        "So, what are we going to do?",
        "We're going to make do, and we're going to have to do some estimating, okay?",
        "There's a lot of people; there's limited resources.",
        "I mean, be reasonable about this.",
        "Estimates were grossly exaggerated.",
        "And…",
        "Okay.",
        "Let me - we made that point.",
        "Let me move on because there's so many other points to get to.",
        "I want to - we don't have as much time.",
        "You're also talk - you also talk about in your book intelligent design, and saying, intelligent design has more evidence in its favor than Darwinism.",
        "Now, I'd - I'm afraid what you're doing here, Ira, you're, to some extent, quoting from the press release that was put out.",

        "Well, so you flip-flop on this, then, because I'd like to read you a quote from your book, page 202.",
        "You say, \"If the advocates of design can invoke an invisible designer or guide, who can prevail over all difficulties any time he wants and design any form of life at will, then we are more within the realm of magic than science.",
        "That's from your book.",
        "Well…",
        "So, you didn't seem to be supporting intelligent design there.",
        "Well, I'm, you know, I'm - I guess I feel about the same way as David Berlinski who feels, you know - have you read any of his articles, who's interested in intelligent design?",
        "I mean, it looks as though the Darwinian mechanisms are inadequate and insufficient to create the organisms that we see.",

        "The consensus on evolution, which goes back many - you know, Tom Bethel wrote an article in '76 where he actually said that evolution was on the verge of collapse, and of course that didn't happen.",
        "It's only gotten stronger since then, and the best evidence that we have - the strength of evolution is convergent evidence from a wide variety of different fields.",
        "Tom, what about that judge in Pennsylvania?",
        "He sort of really…",
        "Oh, sure.",

        "It a battle that has to be fought, you know, in the free market.",
        "Now, Mooney makes a point in his book that I thought was interesting, where he says that, you know, he quotes the Triple-A.S., the American Association for the Advancement of Science, saying that intelligent design is pseudo-science, and the reason he gives is because they subscribe to a philosophy of science called methodological naturalism, which is a mouthful for saying that only physical causes are going to be allowed in science, only material causes can be allowed.",
        "It is a form of materialism.",
        "Right.",
        "When we hear thunder, we no longer think the Gods are angry.",
        "That's basically what we're talking about here.",
        "Right.",
        "So…",
        "You pose as the alternative to this the supernatural or the miraculous.",
        "Now, there is something else.",
        "You can thread that needle with something else, and to illustrate the point, I'll - there is a concept of agency.",

        "Muscles?",
        "You could say, well, muscles caused it to go up.",
        "But what, it was my mind that made the decision.",
        "So mind introduces the concept of agency, and where does, you know, there is this constant intervention in the natural world in ways that do not have to be regarded as being miraculous."

        "I think it would have to go on for much longer.",
        "Its only been going on for less than 30 years.",
        "And there was a period of about 30 years before that, in the mid-20th century when there was global cooling, when there was still plenty of carbon dioxide being emitted into the atmosphere.",

        "We know why.",
        "It wasn't - first of all it wasn't global, it was mostly in the northern hemisphere, and scientists know very well why it happened.",
        "It was actually human caused.",
        "It was air pollution, sulfate aerosols, which basically counter the effect of carbon dioxide.",
        "And now, of course, we have the Clean Air Act amendments which took the sulfates out of the air, and so then the carbon dioxide came back.",
