        "He says two weeks ago, he and others didn't even flinch in the face of police in riot gear and gunfire from the crowd.",
        "When you have a person standing there, going to do their thing whether they get shot or not, that's a very dangerous point for America to be at.",
        "Holmes and others warn that if some in this neighborhood continue to feel that they're left out and police are not held accountable, the reaction will be even stronger.",
