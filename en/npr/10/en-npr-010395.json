        "Why is this committee divided over Judge Alito?",
        "It cannot be because of his qualifications or temperament, but only because our Democratic colleagues don't think he'll vote the right way, the way that they think he should, on some cases.",
        "I fear a very bad precedent is being set today.",
        "Democrat Dianne Feinstein answered Kyl, suggesting that the president and his allies have so polarized the country that this is a very different time than it was a decade ago.",
        "If one is pro-choice in this day and age, in this structure, one can't vote for Judge Alito.",
        "It is simply that simple.",
        "There's more than even abortion at stake in the Alito nomination, she added.",
        "And I came to the conclusion that the fundamental right to liberty is at question in this nominee, and it has nothing to do with his qualifications and his credentials.",
        "But it does have something to do with how far we are willing to see this court move to the right and out of the mainstream of legal thinking in this great country.",
        "And I, for one, really believe that there comes a time when you just have to stand up.",
        "Republican Lindsey Graham responded this way.",

        "What we know about Cleopatra's looks is based purely on her coin portraits.",
        "Engraving was imperfect, and that when you are a ruler and you ask for a coin to be engraved with your likeness on it, you are probably trying to project a certain air of authority.",
        "So in those portraits, she comes across as a very - almost frightening-looking, serious-minded woman.",
        "But we can be certain of several things, which is that she has a very strong chin, hooked nose very much like her father's, sunken eyes - no great beauty, by no means an Elizabeth Taylor look-alike.",
        "And the idea that in fact, it was not her beauty but her charisma that was the dominant quality is very much supported by the ancient texts, all of whom point to her as having been just sinuous and velvety in her personal interactions but really, no great beauty.",
        "Are you concerned that if a new film is made - and we understand that one is in the works, and a big-name director is attached to this and an even bigger-named star - are you worried, as someone who's been sort of a conservator of her history now, that she will be further cliched?"

        "And I think what's fascinating is how, over history, you know, the image has evolved, what we've taken away from her and given back.",
        "So I guess I feel as if there are Cleopatras for all of us.",
        "There isn't just one Cleopatra for all time.",
        "I'm wondering if at the end of this, you actually like her?",
        "I find her terrifying in the extreme.",
        "I guess that may come from, you know, murdering siblings, and some of the things which are less part of our cultural drinking water today than they would have been for her.",
        "But absolutely inspiring - and fascinating in her single-mindedness and in her vision.",
        "I mean, she clearly knows precisely what she needs.",
        "There is an enormous amount of strategic thinking going on, and she's a very subtle thinker.",
        "And those things I found vastly appealing, as I did the wit and the humor and the ability to sort of blend herself in with any circumstances.",
        "I mean, she's involved with two very, very different men, Caesar and Mark Antony - one of them something of an intellectual; one of them somewhat more of a football player, I guess you might say.",
        "And with both of these men, you know, she changes her personality.",
        "She's just a quicksilver study in what to do to charm people, and to accommodate people.",
        "And that's rather extraordinary."

        "On Monday, the first day of the trial, Rowling's lawyer Dale Cendali had the British author read alphabetical entries in five different books, books like \"\"The Idiot's Guide to Harry Potter\"\" and \"\"The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter.",
        "Arguing each case, the paragraphs in \"\"The Harry Potter Lexicon\"\" were short and similar to Rowling's own words.",
        "The other books had extensive commentary, new and often scholarly material, and were therefore more properly a case of fair use.",
        "Rowling called Vander Ark's Lexicon sloppy and a rip off.",
        "The lawyer for RDR Books said the lawsuit was an attempt by Rowling to stamp out competition to the encyclopedia she is writing.",
        "Rowling said she liked Vander Ark's Web site and even gave it an award, but on the stand she implied that a free fan Web site was one matter, a book costing $24.99 that was mostly her own words was another."
