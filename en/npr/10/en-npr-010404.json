        "One of the things that we need to remember is that playgrounds are for play, and that that social interaction between that up-going child and that down-going child - that kind of conflict is an important part of play and learning for the kids to figure out how they can negotiate that and problem-solve it.",

        "The local elections supervisors down there immediately challenged their residency, saying they didn't wait 90 days to register to vote after they had relocated.",
        "And the party chairman down there, John Canegata, was challenging their validity because they didn't follow all the strict rules for signing off and approving of their election in the caucus.",

        "Well, John Yob says he's a new Virgin Islander because he always wanted to live there.",
        "But at the same time, this is important because this nomination, as tight as it is, could come down to just a few votes, basically, at the National Convention.",
        "Then the critical lobbying that will go on and jockeying will be along unbound delegates.",
