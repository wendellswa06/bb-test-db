        "The federal government put nearly $25 billion into No Child Left Behind programs last fiscal year.",
        "That's less than $500 a student, and it's far less than the program was designed to deliver.",
        "But Senator McCain doesn't want to increase funding?",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And first of all, it's not far less than it was designed to deliver.",
        "No Child Left Behind simply says every state has to clearly define academic standards and tell parents and the public whether their schools are getting there.",
        "Well, the cries of teachers and administrators across the country are that there isn't enough money to comply with the mandates of the law.",
        "Andrea, let's be serious here.",
        "Effective teaching is happening all over the country and often times in some new innovative exciting public charter schools in urban settings that don't have nearly as much money as these schools that are saying they don't have enough money to be effective.",
        "One of the things that a lot of people agree on, including Mr. Ellenberg, the teacher, and Michael Acardi, the parent that we heard from, is that there is too much emphasis on tests.",
        "Does Senator McCain see that as a problem?",
        "Effective schools pay very little attention to the tests themselves.",
        "They pay a lot of attention to what that test wants kids to know.",
        "So how does John McCain make more schools like the ones you're talking about?",
        "You don't pass a law and all of a sudden people who previously didn't know how to teach math know how to teach math.",
        "That's not how it works.",
        "You go get great math teachers.",
        "And if you don't have great math teachers, you say to somebody, well, it looks like this isn't a great place for you, and you go get somebody else.",
        "That is not possible today in American schools because of the kind of bureaucratic collective agreements that we have.",
        "Senator McCain...",
        "Give me some specifics.",
        "Yeah, specifics.",
        "OK.",
        "Senator McCain has said, look, let's take the money that goes to schools when they are failing right now in No Child Left Behind, and, instead of penalizing schools, let's give parents the opportunity with that money, give those parents opportunity to immediately go get tutoring."

        "Another thing Senator McCain has said he wants to do is to take the dollars meant for teacher development, give those dollars directly to the principal and say, look, you create your incentive programs, but base it on student achievement.",
        "Don't base it on whether, you know, three teachers think a fourth one is a good teacher.",

        "How much more would an Obama White House put into it?",
        "Well, if you look at the levels that were authorized for No Child Left Behind, there was about an additional $15 billion that was anticipated to meet the goals of the law.",
        "So he has pledged not to leave the money behind in implementing and reforming No Child Left Behind.",
        "We just heard, though, that Senator McCain says that more money is not the answer.",
        "Well, first of all, schools aren't funded equally.",
        "So across this country, unlike other countries, some schools receive a lot more money than others.",
        "And when you're also talking about dramatically reforming schools that have been failing, which typically have been under-resourced schools, you need to be able to put resources in place to be sure to have high-quality teachers, the materials they need, the leadership they need to, in fact, create a whole system full of good options.",
        "Another question is, though, that we're in the middle of an economic crisis.",
        "Are some of these pieces of Obama's education plan going to have to wait?"

        "And I think that's how the senator looks at education.",
        "We heard from both of our guests that they're both concerned with the amount of testing and the kind of testing that's going on.",
        "Well, Senator Obama is also concerned about the kind of testing that's going on.",
        "We shouldn't be spending all our time having kids bubble in multiple choice questions on tests all year long.",

        "That's because not even a month ago, another close associate of Jack Abramoff's did exactly the same thing--agree to cooperate with prosecutors in building their investigation of Abramoff and his lobbying activities.",
        "Washington consultant Michael Scanlon admitted that he and Abramoff conspired to defraud Indian tribes they lobbied for and conspired to bribe public officials.",
        "Outside the Miami courthouse yesterday, Kidan's defense attorney, Joseph Conway, didn't try to ease anyone's anxieties.",

        "Kidan pleaded guilty to charges arising from a business deal in 2000.",
        "Kidan and Abramoff, old college buddies, bought the SunCruz Casinos fleet of gambling boats in Florida.",
        "According to the government and now according to Kidan, they lied to their lenders, defrauding the lenders on loans totaling $60 million.",
        "Abramoff's lawyers had no comment on Kidan's plea, but Mark Elias(ph), a Washington lawyer specializing in ethics cases, said the plea might leave the defense to try to push back Abramoff's trial, now set for January 9th.",
        "But there is no question that whenever that trial begins, this is going to be a powerful blowtorch in turning up the heat on Abramoff."
