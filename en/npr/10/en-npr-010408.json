        "There's been a rather sustained assault on truth.",

        "And she's chronicled how Americans have been fighting over that for a long time.",
        "Jill Lepore has written numerous books and articles exploring American history, and she joins us now.",

        "Jill, you've written a lot about how we see our history and how that defines us.",
        "And the problem, as you see it, is we don't actually share a common understanding of our history.",
        "How so?",
        "Can you point to some moments in American history where the story we tell about ourselves has diverged?",

        "They're all a little shy, like they're not totally sure what they're doing, but they know they can't stay with the boat during the storm.",
        "The area is being evacuated.",
        "Ramirez says their plan is to stay up the road instead in a bigger town, which is actually also being voluntarily evacuated.",
        "But Ramirez says they're going to stay there anyway.",
        "I don't think we got somewhere else to go.",
        "Researchers have found that this - feeling like you do or don't have somewhere else you can go - is at least as important to people's decisions as the risk posed by a storm.",
        "Add to that that most of the evacuations so far for this storm are voluntary, so it's up to each person or family to figure out what is the safest place they feel like they can get to.",
        "For a lot of people, that means having multiple plans, most of which seem to start with buying food.",

        "Boudreaux is sitting in her truck while her friend gets groceries - enough to feed Boudreaux's 13 grandchildren, who all live in the area, and six of whom are under four years old, including three 3-year-olds."

        "And how do you make it entertaining, as well?",

        "Sure.",
        "His film was really about insurance reform and how, you know, broken our insurance system is.",
        "Our film is much more sort of holistically looking at the system from a number of different angles, and really, how we a disease-care system, not a health care system, a system that profits and is oriented towards sickness, not towards health.",
        "And so I think the goal of the film was to really shift how our country views health and healing and really create a system of health and wellness, as opposed to a sick-care system and disease-care system.",
        "And it seems like part of the point was that the incentives are messed up, right?"

        "Yeah, I think - you know, it's been three-and-a-half years of this journey, and I think - you know, what I'm most optimistic about in this topic - you know, I think there's - we screened the film at film festivals across the country and theaters.",

        "And he found a whole cultural shift in that company, it sounded like.",

        "And so, you know, we wanted to look at the military both to highlight this problem and to highlight how they were trying address it, looking at alternative means to deal with it.",
