        "Well, I do want to congratulate Matt Heineman on \"\"Escape Fire.\"\" In fact, I'll mention that the current Army surgeon general, Lieutenant General Horoho, recently showcased that film to the medical - military medical leadership because we are a reflection of civilian medicine.",
        "We just happen to practice it in some rather strange places around the planet, and we do that very well.",
        "But we obtain our standards from the civilian community.",
        "And sometimes, particularly in conflict, those standards don't necessarily serve us as well in that extreme environment.",
        "So it did cause us to really reflect and take a top to bottom look at how we were managing pain and how we were using these medications and where we could possibly improve the system.",
        "That process was actually started by the previous surgeon, recently retired Lieutenant General Schoomaker, and resulted in the pain task force document, which preceded the IOM report, Institute of Medicine report, \"\"Relieving Pain in America,\"\" that was in June of 2010 by about a year.",
        "And we were very pleased that those two reports, both critically looking at large systems, in our case, the military, in the case of the IOM report looking at how we're managing pain in America, were very similar in that they recognized we had some issues in that.",
        "As Matt describes, we as physicians are often rewarded for doing things to patients and not necessarily for looking at things with less side effects or perhaps more holistic methods that focus on the health of the patient rather than disease management."

        "And so in 2003, when I first deployed to Iraq, myself and many other providers were concerned that the standards that we did have back in the United States weren't necessarily available and the tool that we had at the time was morphine.",
        "And we realized very quickly that we needed to improve upon that.",
        "In fact, I was deployed at that time to specifically look at a very advanced technology at the time, regional anesthesia with continuous peripheral catheters, where we placed the catheter next to a nerve bundle serving a mangled limb or amputated limb and run a continuous infusion of local anesthetic and essentially turn that limb off.",
        "And while that was - at that time, in 2003, we were way out ahead of really most medical centers in the nation, but we had sort of missed the point on some of the basics.",

        "So I think - again, the one stat that really stands out to me is that 75 percent of health care costs, literally three quarters of the health care costs, go to preventable diseases.",
        "So we as a society need to figure out how to treat those diseases, how to, you know, prevent those diseases from happening in the first place.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
