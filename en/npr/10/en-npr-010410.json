        "I mean, you're just trying to bolster his authority and try to become once again an active involved player in the peace process.",

        "They've fallen off track several times.",
        "Any progress it seems is contingent on whether violence in Gaza can go away enough that they can actually talk to each other.",

        "Prime Minster Olmert today said Egypt has no mandate to reach a truce agreement with Hamas.",
        "But again, you talk to senior Israeli officials, they're saying they're working with Omar Suleiman; he's the head of Egypt's intelligence service.",
        "He's an influential and powerful figure in the region.",
        "And officials from both Hamas and Israel have traveled to Egypt in recent days for separate talks.",
        "And I'm told that Israel is listening and there has been an exchange of ideas although it's not clear what that really means.",

        "The one that I've been really struck by over the last few years in thinking about it is the mid-1970s during and in the immediate aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, which are eras that we go back to all the time because we know that there was a fracture there.",
        "But if you were to go back and look at Richard Nixon's inaugural address in January of 1973, he actually - he actually makes this argument.",
        "He says our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country.",

        "And there are moments in American history where there's just been an extraordinary amount of cynicism about that claim.",
        "It also is in real tension with the universal truths of revealed religion, and a lot of the kind of cultural wars of the 1990s were about kind of these competing notions of where we get our truth from.",
        "I mean, you mention the inevitable truths, one of which is all men are created equal, except that wasn't true (laughter) except the United States enslaved a large portion of the population.",
        "How does that dark chapter in our history play out in this conversation about interpreting our American story?",

        "The way your children have been taught American history is that there are things to be ashamed of in the American past, and that's wrong.",
        "We need to be proud of these founders.",
        "I found that really fascinating because what it does is it makes history a religion in some way.",
        "So the very political tolerance on which the nation was founded, which comes from religious tolerance, that allows people to have tolerance for political parties, that our very notion of political tolerance is founded in a tolerance of religious difference.",
        "But then if you make your history essentially a kind of religion, then you take it out of the realm of debate and inquiry.",
        "But when you say people are craving in their history the same thing they get out of their religion - and what that sounds like to me is people are craving something definitive - that if all of a sudden history is malleable and history is subjective according to the narrator, that's unsettling.",
        "We shouldn't ask historians to write a simple history.",

        "What's wrong with that?",
        "Well, the executive action that is the biggest problem is he's trying to redefine law without going through Congress, which is not permissible under the Constitution.",

        "So why shouldn't the president do something like he's doing now - take executive action to request, you know, $500 million to increase access to mental health care?",
        "Well, I share his frustration about that, but part of my frustration goes back at him and at Democrats in the Congress who simply have been unwilling to work with us on common sense changes to the mental health policy of the United States of America.",
        "So if he was really serious about this, he would work with us on that.",
        "Let's get over those differences, make those policy changes instead of trying to change the law that would have had no impact on the mass shootings that we've seen these last couple years because in each one of those cases, the shooter got a gun or somebody they got the gun from got a gun through a licensed gun dealer that, in fact, had to go through those background checks.",

        "What's going on on the Republican side is we just don't have any good faith negotiating partners on the other side, and we don't have any negotiating going on with the White House.",

        "He would get personally involved in all of these efforts that we've had to try to get changes in the federal law that deals with mental health.",
        "If he would do that, I think he would find a lot of Republicans in Congress, me included, who would really like to work with him on that.",
