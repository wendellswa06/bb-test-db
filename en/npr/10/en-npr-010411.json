        "A new study of veterans from the Vietnam War has troubling implications for troops who have fought much more recently in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "The study suggests that while it's been 40 years since the Vietnam War ended, hundreds of thousands of those vets still struggle every day with mental health problems linked to their war experiences.",
        "Here's NPR's Daniel Zwerdling.",
        "Researchers have been studying Vietnam veterans longer than they've studied anybody else who's fought in wars.",
        "Congress has ordered these studies to find out how war affects soldiers over their whole lives.",
        "Charles Marmar led the latest look at almost 2000 vets.",
        "He's chairman of the psychiatry department at the NYU medical school.",
        "He says, first, let's focus on the encouraging findings.",
        "Seventy to 75 percent of the Vietnam vets they studied have never suffered mental illness linked to the war.",
        "They did not get PTSD or depression.",
        "They did not become alcoholics or drug addicts.",
        "It doesn't mean they haven't been affected by their experiences for sure.",
        "To go to war is a profound experience.",
        "It changes you forever in many ways.",
        "But they didn't break down with psychiatric illness.",
        "This study is officially called the National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study.",
        "And now, here's the sobering finding.",
        "Roughly 11 percent of the vets they studied are in serious trouble.",
        "They still suffer from PTSD or from a disorder like it, and that's around 10 times the rate among veterans who did not serve in Vietnam.",
        "The Vietnam vets still get flashbacks.",
        "They're irritable, depressed.",
        "They can't sleep well.",
        "A number of them are quite alienated from family and friends and have trouble either in the workplace or in their family environments, those kinds of troubles.",
        "Marmar says when you extrapolate those findings, it suggests that more than a quarter-of-a-million Vietnam vets still struggle every day.",
        "And Judith Broder says those findings should make you worry about what's going to happen with the troops who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "Broder's also a psychiatrist.",
        "She founded The Soldiers Project in California.",
        "They've given mental health counseling to hundreds of young troops and family members.",

        "Of course, a great conductor will have a concept and will help them play together and unify them.",
        "But there are conductors that actually inhibit the players from playing with each other properly.",
        "And, of course, there's interpretive things.",
        "There are conductors that - I cringe, you know, when I see the way they don't follow the score or they don't - they're giving cues that are contrary to what's intuitive for a musician for - who's trying to follow them.",
        "There are so many things that make, you know, that one can do wrong.",
        "I'm still learning myself, you know, as - what works, what can help create the excitement and what - where I should just not give a cue and just let them play.",
        "And then when you do that, when you're not giving a beating every single beat and showing every single thing that you have on your mind, when you don't do that then when you do show something, it makes so much more of an impact.",
        "So I'm still learning all those things myself.",
        "Can you hear - taking a familiar orchestra and saying, oh, well, that's clearly Tilson Thomas at the helm there?",

        "And I've been in so many rehearsals with conductors who let attention fly and not be centered on what's really happening with - so that's what I feel like a great conductor can really do to a group.",

        "It's - you have to - it's kind of a little bit of chicken and the egg there.",
        "You have to earn their respect first to get them to listen to you as well, and to do that, you have to be a good conductor.",
        "But it's a little bit like, I guess, it - sometimes it might sound silly because it's almost like a teacher in a classroom, you know?",
        "You have to be a psychologist as well, and know how to get people's attention.",
        "You have to be - you have to juggle being a friend with them and being - and you have to joke.",

        "So you see a 95-year-old conductor who doesn't have the flexibility and the strength to move around a lot, and yet they can show with a small gesture a kind of power that an orchestra can feel, and they can get this amazing sound out of an orchestra without huge gestures.",
