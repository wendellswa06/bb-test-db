        "The inmates have been able to coordinate the hunger strike through letters and through visits, and families and advocacy groups have helped get the world out to prisons throughout the state.",
        "And I think one reason the protests are catching on - we're getting information that there's as many as 30,000 inmates involved in this action - is it's the inmate's response to Governor Brown here declaring an end to the prison crisis."
