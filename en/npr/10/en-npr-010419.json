        "Rick Pitino has an amazing record in college basketball.",
        "He led three different schools - Providence, Kentucky and Louisville - to the Final Four championship series.",
        "He's a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.",
        "But Rick Pitino was also the only NCAA men's basketball coach to have a national championship taken away.",
        "His Louisville Cardinals team was stripped of its 2013 national basketball title because an investigation found recruits to the team had been offered sex with paid escorts.",
        "And coach Pitino was let go by Louisville last year when federal prosecutors revealed a player named Brian Bowen was recruited after an Adidas executive offered his family $100,000.",
        "Rick Pitino's basketball sense and skills are perhaps unparalleled but so are some of the scandals that surround him, including a case in Louisville in which the coach admitted to sexual involvement with a woman who tried to blackmail him.",
        "He has written his version of some of those events in the book \"\"Pitino: My Story\"\" with co-author Seth Kaufman.",

        "I've said for years idleness is the devil's workshop.",
        "So I always tied up my day, every minute of the day from 6 a.m. to late at night with basketball, scouting, recruiting.",
        "And now I wake up at 6 o'clock and put on my gym shorts, and there's no place to go.",
        "You still give, I gather, motivational speeches and make appearances, don't you?",
        "I do.",
        "What do you say?",
        "People do have to fight and fight hard to get through adversity.",

        "And I sort of have a Ph.D. on it right now.",
        "And - but I am very upbeat, very positive about the future.",
        "I've got to ask you about one of your former assistants.",
        "Andre McGee paid for a woman named Katina Powell to bring in paid escorts for potential Louisville recruits and players between 2010 and 2014.",

        "You are the legendary coach Rick Pitino.",
        "Wasn't it part of your responsibility to protect them and know where they were every hour and minute?",
        "Well, I'll go back to when I was an athlete, and the answer is yes and no. The answer is, yes, I'm responsible for all the actions that go on, for all the people that worked for me.",
        "But as an athlete, when I visited - I believe I visited 13 colleges out of high school - the coach would take your family out to dinner, and then you'd go out with the players, and you'd either go to a social party, you'd go to some event.",
        "And then the next day, the coach would ask you what you did, did you have a good time?",
        "And no different than when you speak to your parents - what'd you do last night?",
        "Went to a party, Dad.",
        "Did you have a good time?",
        "Yes.",
        "So when the NCAA said to me, did you notice any red flags, I said I sat down with the family for two hours, asked a young man everything he did that night, and for a two-hour morning meeting, we discussed everything.",
        "So should I have known what went on at 1, 2 o'clock in the morning?",

        "Kansas, like many other states, also has one party dominating state government.",
        "Conservative Republican Governor Sam Brownback took office in 2011 and helped usher in new, more conservative Republican majorities in the Legislature.",
        "University of Missouri political science professor Peverill Squire says a lot of states are seeing similar transformations.",
        "Both of those institutions and a number of others in the country have been pulled much farther to the right than they would have been, say, a generation ago.",
        "Now, lawmakers are focused on a state Supreme Court ruling about education funding that just came out.",
        "But before that, they had not had a big core issue to struggle with.",
        "They don't have to write a full budget or wrangle the tax issues they've dealt with in recent years.",
        "Squire calls this time of year silly season when more controversial, off-topic bills are introduced.",
        "In part, because the legislature needs something to talk about publicly because most of the really important decisions are being worked out behind closed doors."
