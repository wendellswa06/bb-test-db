        "Well, Mark Zandi of Moodyseconomy.com reminds us that, say, today's two-tenths of 1 percent increase in the CPI is an average.",
        "It's not the same, meaning the same thing for all of us.",
        "It's somewhat plutocratic in the sense that it represents the spending patterns of all Americans and since wealthy, high-income Americans spend more, it more closely represents their spending patterns.",

        "It's just the fact is that people choose not to do it because they have better alternatives.",
        "Mark Bils's favorite example is a car that he used to own - a 1983 Honda Accord.",
        "Which was a great car.",
        "It had no air conditioning.",
        "It had no power windows or power locks.",
        "It didn't have any, you know, air bags, etcetera, but it was, you know, I was very happy with it.",
        "It cost $10,000 in 1983.",
        "I firmly believe that if that car as it was, brand new, were to go on the market today, you couldn't get anything close to $10,000 for it because there's just so much better alternatives.",
        "Professor Bils says that we can mistake what is really deflation -that is the 1983 Honda would cost much less today - for an increase in price if we don't pay enough attention to those power windows, power locks, air conditioning and other improvements that we find in newer models."

        "Namely, if you start with a lower dose and work your way up to a higher dose, you get a progressively incremental increase in the immune response, which, from the standpoint of testing vaccines, is a very good thing because that really tells you that you really do have a vaccine.",
