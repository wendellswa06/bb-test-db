        "Even if it changes substantially that you would have to modify the vaccine and use perhaps a variation of that strain, the whole process of knowing that this particular class and type of vaccine is safe--we already know now because of these studies what the most relevant dose would be and how to administer it.",
        "So all of this that's going on may be directly relevant to if we get a real pandemic flu.",
        "But even at worst, it would be very important information to guide us to getting to the vaccine that might ultimately be the real one that we use.",
        "But, obviously, you've got to have enough doses of a vaccine to make a difference and have it in the right places where there might be an outbreak.",
        "How much of this exists now, and how are you going to go about making more?",
        "Well, that is an important--a very important issue.",
        "We've already ordered and have in bulk two million doses of this vaccine, and we will now be moving rapidly to develop a significant amount more.",
        "But the capacity of the vaccine industry, the global capability, is not where we want it to be to make enough vaccine that's needed.",
        "And are these two million vaccines in the US?",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "And what about--how soon could this vaccine make its way to the area that's been most affected by this flu so far, which is Asia?",
        "How is this going to affect the president's ability to shape the debate over what a stimulus package should look like?",

        "NBC and Fox and ABC all provide programming that's distributed by cable operators and satellite companies, and that is a lucrative business.",
        "The fees from the cable operators alone is something on the order of $30 billion.",
        "So this has created an internal conflict between the media companies and their business partners, who built this very large and mutually lucrative business of television."

        "So therein lies the conflict.",

        "So the media companies may see this as a moment to set Hulu free and sell its content across multiple distributors.",
