        "Now two suicide bombers, though, apparently have been captured, which isn't something that happens a lot.",

        "The bomber, according to police, is Libyan.",
        "This is the second such person to be captured this week.",
        "Iraqi security forces outside the Green Zone caught one suicide bomber whose vest also failed to explode during what was meant to be a triple suicide bombing on Thursday.",
        "This is pretty rare.",
        "It's hard to catch these people.",
        "And these men would probably be considered important because they can provide the military and the Iraqis with intelligence on how these people are being recruited, how they get into the country and who provides them with their target and their training.",
        "I've been out with US forces and before every mission now, they go through what to look for when they're driving through the streets so that they can spot a potential suicide car bomber.",
        "Soldiers say they look out for cars that look like they're low to the ground, for example, that seem to be carrying a suspiciously heavy load; also cars, obviously, that get too close to them.",
        "And they also say they watch out for men whose hands may be tied to the steering wheel, and this is because there has been intelligence that suggests and also after the bombings they have found evidence of this, that some of these people tie their hands to the steering wheel so they will not lose their nerve at the last minute when they ram themselves into their target.",
        "Now another unusual event.",
        "The US military came out today and said it was charging 11 soldiers with misconduct there in Iraq.",
        "What can you tell us about that?",
        "Well, very little.",
        "The press release simply said that the military had charged 11 soldiers in a unit that served in Baghdad because of a complaint by another soldier that the group had assaulted detainees.",
        "The statement added that none of the insurgent suspects who were allegedly assaulted had required medical treatment.",

        "Gary Bennett examines his hands in the locker room after the game.",
        "They look OK, but the index finger seems a little swollen.",

        "It's a little thicker than the rest of your fingers just from, you know, the constant pounding of the ball.",

        "One of the researchers is Andrew Koman, an orthopedic surgeon at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.",
        "One of our chief residents was a college and semipro catcher.",
        "So in one of our conferences, we were talking about the potential damage from a baseball and repetitive trauma, and we came up with the idea of actually looking at semipro baseball players.",
        "The doctors ran medical tests on three dozen players from the local minor leagues.",
        "They found that catchers were far more likely than other positions to have numbness, swelling or blood flow problems in their hands.",
        "Well, I mean, certainly, Julianne Malveaux, as the economist, is very clear-eyed on this.",
        "I will say that part of the problem is now we have the Congress and the president fighting to do this stimulus package, which is, ultimately, a little more than, you know, how many different kinds of groups are we going to send to the mall on Saturday.",
        "Will it be just the middle-class?",
        "Will it be the middle-class with their grandmothers?",
        "The big question is, how are we going to fundamentally address the underlying crisis which we are facing, which has to do with home ownership and the mortgage crisis?",
        "There are other very clear-eyed economists who are making very strong suggestions that what needs to happen is a big exogenous shock by the Feds in which the Feds will cut rates about half of what they've already done, down to below 2 percent, at least in the short term, in order to change the kind of impact that these variable interest rates are having on families.",
        "And it will do it without, again, undermining the budget that we need to be operating with at the federal level.",
        "So, you know, yeah.",
        "Are they going to fight over this?",
        "Sure.",
        "But they're doing it because there's some political capital here, not so much because it will save us from the crisis that we're in."

        "Is this something that's in line with what the administration wants or with what Republicans or conservatives want?",

        "I find a couple of things about the stimulus package kind of puzzling and frustrating if someone who considers himself a fiscal conservative.",

        "If this package were approved this week, I've heard that the rebate checks will start coming out in May.",

        "What we needed to do is change immediately the long-term incentives for people to work, save, invest and produce.",
        "And you do that by cutting taxes, by deregulating, by changing the nature of people to, say, okay, I will open up a factory; I will hire more people; I will expand my payroll; I will open this new store; I will go produce and market this new product.",
        "And you don't do that by giving people checks for three or four, $500, say, you go out and buy something nice or go stick it in the bank.",
        "This to me does not look that much different from George McGovern's Democrat program of 1972, where if you vote for McGovern and he got in and became president, everybody goes - would get a check, I think it was for a thousand dollars or something like that.",
        "This seems to be kind of the same idea only pushed by a Republican president and not even as much money as McGovern was pushing himself.",

        "What is he leaving behind?",
        "Is he leaving behind the al-Qaida on the run, as he argues, or a country in a war that we can't figure out what to do about?",
        "I think we'll see in the next - in the months ahead whether the progress we've seen as a result of the surge, the decrease in violence, the increased political stability, the not-full-blown reconciliation among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, but some improvement in that area, if all those things congeal and continue in advance or if there's backsliding.",
        "I think, at the moment, it looks as if al-Qaida is on the run in Iraq.",
        "Bin laden just did - put out a tape a couple of weeks ago, basically castigating the Sunnis and the Shiites for getting along as well as they are and the Sunnis for cooperating with the government and so on.",
        "And I believe bin Laden's son actually came out and sort of attacked his dad and said, you know, give peace a chance.",

        "So I think that they appeared to be in retreat, and that's a good thing.",

        "And if Iraq can calm down to be stabilized and serve as a model for its neighbors - not Switzerland or Holland for sure, but perhaps, a regional Mexico if you will - that would be a big step over where - a huge step over where it was before, which is as a blitzkrieg(ph) dictatorship.",
        "And if that actually happens, I think it will - history will show that president Bush's policy was indeed a success despite the bloodshed and the tremendous losses of human life and injury of Americans and certainly people in the ground in Iraq as well.",
        "Melissa, let's throw something else into the mix.",
        "The president has taken a harsh stance against Iran, but he didn't address its nuclear ambitions in his speech.",
        "He also didn't talk about North Korea.",

        "is and is not capable of doing.",
        "You know, so many of these things are tied together in these very quirky ways.",
        "So the notion of getting support and a standing ovation about what bin Laden is putting out on his tapes is quirky given that it means bin Laden is still out there making tapes.",
        "And if there was one thing against which we should measure a response to 9/11, it should be about the capture of bin Laden, not the capture and hanging of Saddam Hussein.",
        "Further, this idea, for example, of the young men who are - and young women who are going to give over their benefits to their families because they're not able to use them - part of the reason they're not able to use them is because they're doing five tours of duty in Iraq.",
        "They don't have time to go to school.",
        "So these things which look like kind of the president doing something big or being aggressive or making this sort of largesse are really about his fundamental policy failures.",
        "So he's not bringing up these other very serious threats to the U.S., both sort of threats to our understanding of our standing in the world as also - and as well as potential military threats, because there really is almost nothing we can do about it from a military perspective."
