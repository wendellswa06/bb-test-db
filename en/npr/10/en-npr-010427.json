        "Well, we talked to some of the fighters and some of the higher-ranking people with Zarqawi's al-Qaeda in Iraq group after the Web site came out and they said that Zarqawi was shot somewhere between the shoulder and the chest in what Lieutenant Abu Karrar said was an ambush Saturday to Sunday by US and Iraqi forces.",
        "And they said the location of this ambush, somewhere around Ramadi, which is in western Iraq, in the province that's caused the most trouble for the Americans, and that surprised me.",
        "Why would people associated with Zarqawi be willing to say approximately where he is or at least where he was?",
        "Well, I guess that was where it happened, but we don't know where he--they claim he is right now.",
        "They say that he's in a safe place being treated by foreign doctors right now.",
        "And, you know, this is a message that, for whatever reason, al-Qaeda in Iraq has chosen to put out, and it's a consistent one, but just because it's consistent doesn't necessarily mean that that's actually what's happened to Zarqawi.",
        "How can you feel confident that this person who represents himself as an aide to Zarqawi is who he says he is and that what he says is true?",

        "The American military says that while he's, like, the poster child of the insurgency, if you have it, that--I mean, it's like a hydra-headed insurgency, and if he dies that doesn't at all mean that their fight is over.",

        "And the US military believes that foreign fighters, in particular, are operating all along the Euphrates River and using these towns as kind of a channel for money and for fighters and for arms, and it sounds like they've just kind of cordoned off the town and they're going house to house seeing what they're going to roust up.",
        "You reported that there was evidence that insurgents were able to escape some villages before the US military got there in the last offensive.",
        "Is there any indication that the US military learned from that experience?",
        "The local people did say that a lot of the foreign fighters slipped out through Syria, that they had enough advanced notice.",

        "The fact that they're--the Marines are going back so quickly after just a week, this tells me that they're trying to stay on the offensive."
