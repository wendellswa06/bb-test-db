        "I understand this is early into the investigation but do you have any inkling of what might be responsible?",
        "Well, in 1987 was sort of the first time we were ever faced with one of these kind of events.",
        "And at that time, we had no idea where to look.",
        "Since then, we do have some potential suspects.",

        "Is there something you can do?",
        "Right now, quite frankly, all we can do is respond to the animals as they come ashore.",
        "And in that regard, it's really critical that as soon as anybody sees an animal that appears to be acting abnormally or in distress or if they find an animal on the shore, that they contact the appropriate authorities as soon as possible.",

        "This must hurt you personally.",
        "When somebody reports that there's a very fresh carcass on the beach and we get word that it's being brought into the lab, the adrenaline picks up because that's the animal that hopefully will unlock this riddle, and then we plunge into our automatic mode and we start conducting the investigation on that animal.",
        "But, you know, in the evening when you sit back and think about it, it does stick with you.",
        "Unfortunately, a number of the animals we've looked at have been neonates, that is infants.",
        "And as a father, that's always hard to do."

        "Well, according to my last count, which was in the beginning of February, we had at least 562 individuals who had been involved.",
        "There have been many explanations for why radicalism has rooted itself in Belgium - the divisions in the country itself, lack of communication between intelligence agencies, difficulties integrating immigrants.",
