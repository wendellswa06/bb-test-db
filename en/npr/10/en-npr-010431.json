        "You're saying that the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq in the fall of 2002 was fundamentally wrong and the main point is to whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.",
        "But even so, in reading it, you were persuaded against voting to authorize the invasion of Iraq.",

        "I don't know what other sources they were relying upon, but I found the NIE and the circumstances which surrounded it to be the document that provided, to me, the clearest insight that the intelligence was being manipulated in order to make a particular case rather than being used to inform judgment as to what case should be made.",
