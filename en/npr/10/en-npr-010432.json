        "It's all an attempt to improve the oil industry's image, not just with the public, but with political leaders.",
        "If you've watched the news or public affairs program on television, you've probably seen an ad like this:",

        "Well, speaking of footing the bill, how much is the industry spending on this ad campaign?",
        "It is being coordinated by the Industry Trade Association in Washington, the American Petroleum Institute.",
        "They didn't have anyone who could comment on the PR campaign by our deadline, but they told the Washington Post that the cost is less than 100 million dollars.",
        "Now, if it is anywhere near that, that's a whole lot of money compared to other public issue campaigns of its kind, which rarely exceed about five million dollars.",
        "One of the additional expenses of this campaign, they take groups of reporters and bloggers out to offshore oil rigs to show them how oil is extracted domestically.",
