        "And it still is not clear where the White House is willing to give on this.",
        "Remember, the White House is the reason we are part - or is essentially the reason we're in this shutdown because the White House has indicated to Congress back in December that they would sign a government funding bill.",

        "They just reopen the government, and the fight does - it continues.",
        "I think the president sees this as having a lot to lose here because the border wall has become a very big symbol of his presidency and his campaign and a core issue to his base.",
        "Part of the reason why we got here is conservatives in the House were really encouraging the president to fight on this issue because, I think, if he is seen as wavering here that it goes - it could weaken his support among the base, which has really stuck by him through basically everything.",
        "And he doesn't - he has shown no interest in giving on this.",
        "And if he wants border wall money, he's going to have to give Democrats something in exchange.",

        "Often that comes in the form of immigration legislation, something that would be a bit of a give-and-take to get both parties behind it.",

        "House Democrats, expected to be led by Nancy Pelosi, have already made clear their first order of business is going to vote on funding bills to reopen the government.",

        "Especially their bills that have already passed the Senate.",
        "So we know these bills can pass Congress."
