        "Just this past March, bomb components and explosives, I believe, were found at Terry Nichols' former house in Kansas.",

        "Well, the feds had spent a lot of time at that house and had searched the house.",
        "But here recently, they went back in in March and found these other components, and some of them are believed to be 300 blasting caps that were consistent with the caps that were stolen from a nearby quarry that--the feds believe those caps were stolen by McVeigh and Nichols and then used in the bombing.",
        "And so some of those were there.",
        "And then Nichols says also that some of the stuff in the crawl space had come from Moore and some of it was used in the bombing and some of it was still there in storage.",
        "And there was a fear among many that Nichols or someone had hidden those there and was planning a second bombing on the anniversary, which was last month, of the Oklahoma--10-year anniversary, and Nichols denied that that was the plan.",
        "But it does seem odd that they sat there for so long.",
        "And I think the house turned ownership over a couple of times, and that suddenly we're just now finding them and it just sort of feeds on the whole conspiracy mystery of this case.",
        "Well, what has the FBI had to say about Terry Nichols' charges?",
        "Not a whole lot.",
        "They told me yesterday that 300 of the blasting caps are consistent with what was taken from the quarry, and the other material is being examined forensically at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia.",
        "There's been no conclusive determination yet as to where those came from.",
        "Terry Nichols says that the FBI should be able to find Roger Moore's fingerprints on that material, so we'll have to wait and see what they find out.",
        "You know, all of this fuels suspicions of the people who think that the government didn't fully prosecute or investigate this case and that there are unanswered questions.",
        "Well, in any big case like this, there's always unanswered questions.",
        "There's always many who believe that there are others involved, and there may very well be others involved.",
        "Congress may soon open its own formal hearings this summer to answer some of these questions.",

        "Congressman Rohrabacher from Southern California is the chairman of a subcommittee who's gathering evidence now and trying to make a decision, and he says he'll come to some decision within a couple of weeks.",
        "And it'll be interesting if they do that.",
        "They did that after Waco.",
        "They had hearings up on Capitol Hill several years after Waco to sort of figure out what happened.",
        "There were a lot of conspiracy theories about that, too.",
        "And it might not be a bad thing to do, to air out a lot of this in an open forum.",
        "And I mean, there's--for instance, there's 23 surveillance tapes that were made around the federal building in Oklahoma City.",
        "One of the tapes showed the Ryder truck in the moments before the bombing and, of course, people want to see the other tapes, see what might be on there.",
        "Was there somebody with McVeigh?",
        "Was other people there?",
        "And they refuse to make those tapes public, even though the case itself is over and closed.",
        "They refuse to make them public, and that's one of the things that the congressman wants to get access to and let the people see them."
