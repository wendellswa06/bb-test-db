        "Well, we're working with the state to sort that out.",

        "Essentially, just very briefly, about three years ago, the administration, the Bush administration decided that every detainee here at Guantanamo must go through something called a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, or a CSRT.",
        "And essentially what that does is that establishes that the detainee is a so-called enemy combatant.",
        "And if they are, that meant the government could hold them down here indefinitely - they could try them, they could not try them.",

        "In that act it said that in order to charge somebody - bring one of the detainees to trial - they must be called an unlawful enemy combatant.",
        "So that one word, unlawful, was enough to get Khadr's case dismissed today.",
        "So is it just a semantic difference and will prosecutors re-file the charges?",
        "No, it's more than that.",
        "Actually, because what they are going to have to do, the lead defense attorney came in and said one of the things that they'll probably have to do is go back and re-write the rules for these CSRTs, the process that determines enemy combatants so it allows the term unlawful to be written into that.",
        "In other words, they're going to have to go back in try almost 400 detainees again before any of these trials can move on.",
        "So it's a huge process.",
        "You know, it's a small thing, but it's absolutely critical to the whole process of these tribunals.",
        "And until it's sorted out, they're not going anywhere.",

        "It came out today with his lawyers, he has not - he's dismissed all his American attorneys, both civilian and military, and it turns out that the one that was sitting at the defense table today, by the rules of this process, had never talked to him.",
        "So that was - if this whole thing about unlawful combatants didn't come up, then certainly the whole idea about who can represent him would have, and that would have been enough to probably really slow down this trial as well.",

        "Now, their customer has an international competitor who is producing the same semitrailer in an offshore location, and their steel pricing already had an advantage.",
        "All right.",
        "So Tim Eckerle worried about these tariffs.",
        "But as we talked more, it was clear that despite his concerns, he does see some nuance in this whole debate.",
