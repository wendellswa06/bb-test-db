        "I'm going to go to another listener because we're running out of time.",

        "Like I said, I've listened to your show for many years and I remember talking about that one a lot.",

        "He says Acosta's office gave Epstein the deal of the millennium.",
        "First, it's unusual for the federal government to give someone an agreement saying, we won't prosecute you since you're pleading to these state claims.",
        "That's not run-of-the-mill.",
        "What's also quite unusual is they did that even knowing that the state punishment would be quite lenient given the type of conduct that's described - basically trafficking in underage girls.",
        "And finally, what is completely unprecedented and that I've never seen is this very broad agreement that they would not prosecute any of Epstein's co-conspirators.",
        "In other words, there were people out there who helped Epstein procure underage girls.",
        "And the government was agreeing it would not go after them.",
        "Acosta has defended his actions in the past, right?",
        "He says that Epstein had this star defense team that was very aggressive.",
        "He called it a, quote, \"\"a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors,\"\" which he claims included investigating them and their families in hopes of finding something that might be the basis for disqualification.",
        "That's how he talked about this case, I think, back in 2011.",
        "You were a federal prosecutor.",
        "Are those typical defense tactics?"
