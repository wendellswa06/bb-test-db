        "They're unusual, but they're not unknown, particularly with defendants with a lot of money.",
        "They will find anything they can to use that money and power to grind you down, particularly if they don't have a particularly good defense.",
        "And so that may include attacking you.",
        "But generally it's very unusual to see a federal prosecutor or former federal prosecutor using that as an excuse of why someone got a historically unlikely deal.",
        "The president says in his quote we heard earlier it was a decision he thought maybe not made by Acosta but by a lot of people.",
        "Again, from your position as a former federal prosecutor, is that a good response?",
        "Well, it's probably true because something this high-profile and potentially incendiary you would think would normally go up past the U.S.",
        "attorney, Mr. Acosta, up to someone in the Justice Department and that other people would be consulted.",
        "But that's a double-edged sword because it might take some of the responsibility off of Alex Acosta, but it really suggests that higher up people in the Justice Department knew about this very unusual and, frankly, somewhat questionable deal and signed off on it.",
        "Now, as we mentioned, Epstein was arrested earlier this week and charged by the U.S.",
        "attorney's office in the Southern District of New York.",
        "Help us understand; help us see the differences between this case and the case that was prosecuted by Acosta.",
        "Well, as far as we can tell so far from the indictment, the main difference is that New York is charging it, and Florida didn't.",
        "So there never was a case by Acosta because he agreed not to bring one.",
        "But it appears to be based on the same time period that Acosta was looking at in Florida and the same type of conduct.",
        "The main difference is New York talks about things happening at Epstein's palatial New York house, and that gives them the jurisdiction to do it - that and the movement to and from Florida to New York.",
        "So this seems like a variation on the same case that Florida could have brought but didn't.",

        "This of course will happen unless Mexico does more to address the growing number of migrants crossing through Mexico into the U.S.",

        "Good morning.",
        "All right.",
        "So this is definitely not the end of talks between the White House and the Mexican delegation.",
        "But the big news from late yesterday is that Mexico plans to deploy its National Guard to its border with Guatemala.",
        "How big a deal is this for the Mexican National Guard?",
        "It's a big deal since the National Guard was just recently created and improved by the Mexican Congress.",
        "It's not even really up and running.",
        "The head of public security here in Mexico has said he wants as many as 60,000 troops in that Guard when it's fully operational but estimates that it won't even take place until the end of 2021.",
        "So it's unclear where these troops are going to come from, especially in the short term.",
        "And then there's also that Mexico's president campaigned heavily on bringing down Mexico's record-high murder rate.",
        "He also promised to tackle organized crime and drug traffickers, not to mention his latest fight since taking office is stopping Mexico's pervasive gas thieves.",
        "All of this would require significant resources from this National Guard he created.",
        "Stopping migrants at the southern border was not a top priority for the new president, and it's not clear at all where he's going to get the manpower to stage that many troops on the border.",
        "And more importantly, which fight is he going to take troops away from in order to send them to the border?",
        "Well, all a sign that Mexican officials were pretty shaken up by the threat of tariffs from the Trump administration.",
        "I know that you've been out talking to regular old people along the U.S.-Mexico border about what they think of the tariff threat.",
        "What are they telling you?",
        "Domenico Montanaro, thanks so much.",
        "You're so welcome."
