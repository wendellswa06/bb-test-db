        "Yeah.",
        "We're already seeing it shape the 2020 Democratic primary.",
        "Yesterday, former Vice President Joe Biden announced that he has changed his mind about a law involving federal funds for abortion.",
        "This comes after nine states have passed these new restrictions or just outright bans on abortions this year.",
        "None of them have actually been enacted, but this has all set the stage for a possible challenge to Roe v.",
        "Wade in the Supreme Court.",
        "This is this - the federal law that guarantees a woman's right to an abortion.",
        "And today, we've got this new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that gives us a good sense of how Americans are feeling about this debate right now.",
        "NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro has been digging into the poll and the numbers there.",
        "Hi, Domenico.",
        "Hi there.",
        "So what does this poll show?",
        "What are the headlines?",
        "Well, the poll's showing that even though the debate around abortion takes place around these very bright lines or with these bright lines around it, it's really not an either/or argument for a lot of Americans.",
        "There are broad agreements around, for example, the fact that most people don't want Roe v.",
        "Wade overturned.",
        "Our poll found that three-quarters of people said that they want it upheld in some fashion.",
        "I mean, within that, there's a lot of nuance.",
        "I mean, some people want it upheld as it is.",
        "Some people want it upheld and expanded.",
        "Some people want it upheld but with more restrictions.",
        "And, in fact, in a separate question that we asked from talking about Roe v.",
        "Wade, we gave people some choices about what comes closest to their view of abortion.",
        "What we found was broad agreement that people want abortion legal in the first three months, in cases of rape and incest and when the health of the woman is at risk.",
        "All right.",
        "So let's dig into where people fall as either supporters or opponents of abortion rights.",
        "What did those numbers show?",
        "Well, first of all, let me just say that in writing most of our stories or talking about it on air, NPR's standard is usually to use more neutral terminology.",
        "We talk about abortion rights supporters and opponents, and we don't usually get into the language that the advocates on either side use.",
        "But we wanted to get at how people see themselves in this debate either as, quote, \"\"pro-choice\"\" or, quote, \"\"pro-life.\"\" And in this poll, 57% said that they call themselves pro-choice.",
        "Thirty-five percent said pro-life.",
        "Now, that 57% number is the highest since 2012.",
        "But it's a pretty flexible number.",
        "I just want to make sure people understand that.",
        "Just a few months ago, it was 47 apiece.",
        "So the pollsters attribute that to the debate that's being had and dominated by things like the very restrictive Alabama law that bans abortion completely except in cases when the woman's health is at risk."

        "That's really interesting.",

        "In light of that, what does this poll suggest about how people view that Alabama law and these other restrictive laws like it?",
        "Well, we asked a series of questions about what people support and oppose.",
        "And there's a whole lot more that people should dig into in our story online about that.",
        "But we purposely didn't say which state various proposals came from.",

        "Yeah (laughter).",

        "Just a couple days ago, he reaffirmed his support of it.",

        "Right.",
