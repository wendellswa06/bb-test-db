        "Fragments tend to be too small to maintain viable populations of the species that occur there.",
        "Hundreds of species unique to Madagascar are critically endangered, meaning close to being extinct in the wild - everything from grasshoppers to tortoises, frogs, ducks, fish and lemurs.",
        "Thousands more are endangered, including many we might not even know about.",
        "And a big part of that risk comes from deforestation, whether it's logging or converting woods to farmland.",
        "What happens with forest fragments is a bit like when a child uses scissors to cut a sheet of paper into a snowflake.",
        "You get a little less paper and lots of new edges.",
        "In forests, those edges make it easier for predators.",
        "And they're vulnerable to drought.",
        "And when people light the fires in the fields, which they often do every year, the fragments get eroded year by year by fires.",
        "And that's exactly what's happening with fire at Ankafobe.",

        "Thousands of native plant seedlings were lost and a chunk of forest, too.",
        "(Foreign language spoken).",
        "Solofo says the fire made the association double-down on their work.",
        "The goal is to expand these tiny forests again and maybe even reconnect them so it's easier for animals to find a mate or spread seeds as they move back and forth.",
        "Here's Pimm, the extinction expert, again.",
        "Reconnecting fragments is one of the most cost-effective conservation solutions that we have because it dramatically slows down the rate of extinctions.",
