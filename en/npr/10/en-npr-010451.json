        "Well certainly unlike popular perceptions of Brazil that there are no concrete definitions of blackness, certainly, the black population have -not just accepted, but also realized and have come to terms with, not only with their blackness throughout history, but certainly with their rights as blacks to certain resources to include education.",
        "I think that there has been much resistance to affirmative action programs in Brazil by reactionaries who believe that it's difficult to determine who is black in Brazil.",
        "But for the black population who recognize that they have been historically excluded from this institution, they know that it is necessarily to - necessary to include quotas as part of state-sponsored equality efforts.",
        "Peter, how does the issue of civil rights or even the definition of civil rights fit into what you do as human rights watch?",
        "Well, there's a tremendous overlap between the what we'll do in times of a human rights protection and promotion.",
        "And the civil rights movement in times of its central objectives, which the - desire fight for freedom, for respect, for dignity, for economic and social rights, and the most particularly of the achievement, establishment of equality under the law.",

        "In the United States, a lot of people would associate, for example, South Africa, with a civil rights movement, in part because there was a racial component to that.",
        "Many places on the continent have dealt with colonialism and race in that context.",
        "When do you call something civil rights?",
        "When do you call it human rights?",
        "Does the label matter to you?",
        "The label doesn't matter to me.",
        "Obviously, the context might differ.",
        "You are right, that because of the intensity of racial civilization in South Africa made it more akin to the context in the U.S., because of insignificant kind of penetration of the racial minority in South Africa, which was not necessarily the case elsewhere in Africa.",
        "So the racial segregation part of the civil rights movement in Africa was not quite compared to the American situation.",
        "But…",

        "I think that in the context of the United States, the terms mean very same thing as they do - as their communities, as color, in particular, other blacks.",

        "African-Americans, historically, have looked to Brazil as a model of racial democracy even when I do believe that racial democracy was being misunderstood in Brazil.",
        "Scholars like Dubois and many others went to Brazil to see what was going on that was working and in the same way that UNESCO certainly went to Brazil to look to see what was working in Brazil that they could prevent another Holocaust from happening.",

        "Jim Krane, an energy expert with Rice University in Houston, says because it hasn't given any indication why, figuring out Saudi Arabia's motives is creating something of a parlor game.",
        "(Laughter) It really is, yes.",
        "You know, if you're somebody who looks at geopolitics and energy, you could come up with any number of ways, you know, or any number of reasons that the Saudis are not doing what they would usually do.",
        "And there's lots of good reasons for them to keep on producing, but exactly why they're doing it, probably only a, you know, few dozen people in Saudi Arabia know that.",
        "One popular conspiracy theory is that Saudi Arabia is trying to deprive valuable oil revenues to Russia for its backing of the Bashar al Assad regime in Syria.",
        "Another target: it's arch-regional rival, Iran.",
        "Bronson says the low oil prices are hurting both Russia and Iran, which depend heavily on oil exports.",
        "They need higher prices than Saudi does to meet all of their domestic needs.",
        "So the Saudis are always mindful of oil prices, and they always try to keep the oil prices high enough for them to cover budget but low enough to hurt the Iranians.",
        "Another theory is that Saudi Arabia is manipulating the markets to try and quash competition, especially from new oil producers like those involved with the Canadian oil sands and the shale revolution here in the U.S., says Krane."
