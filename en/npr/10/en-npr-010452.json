        "We're not talking about a country where the state has the means, the wherewithal and the might to actually ensure that the basic needs of its citizens are met, right?",
        "In the Haitian context, we're talking about a state that doesn't have the means necessarily, that doesn't have all of the infrastructure, that doesn't have all of the institutions through which the people's needs might be met, through which people's quality of life might be improved, so and so.",
        "You're not talking about a state that's willfully neglecting a significant portion of its population although there happens to be a bit of that going on, too.",
        "But overwhelmingly, this is a state that's trying to establish itself, trying to spend on itself, trying to consolidate its resources.",
        "I don't think that…",
        "Let me just jump in on that.",
        "Mm-hmm?",
        "I want to reintroduce our topic.",

        "We're just hearing from Gepsie Metellus, executive director for the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center in Miami, Florida.",
        "Also talking to Peter Takirambudde of the African Division of Human Rights Watch in New York City and Keisha-Khan Perry, assistant professor of Africana studies and anthropology at Brown University.",
        "So Keisha-Khan Perry, I'm going to turn back to you about Brazil.",
        "When you look at the research that you've done, do you think that Brazilians have looked at the civil rights struggle in the United States for guidance?",
        "And how does and doesn't it apply in Brazil?",
        "I think certainly, historically, Brazil is part of the black diaspora network, which is part of an always ongoing process of sharing information and, particularly, political information.",
        "So clearly, we need to understand Brazil is part of this context.",
        "Certainly, also, Brazil has been inspired by U.S.",
        "civil rights movement, particularly, the discourse of civil rights, which they have also connected to, as the other previous guests have stated, to human rights struggles in Brazil, particularly, the focus on the struggle against the genocide, the mass genocide of blacks through police abuse, through land eviction, forced sterilization, that have also impacted black Brazilians."

        "Also, the black civil rights movement in the U.S.",
        "such as - even the Black Panther Party has also impacted Brazilians and the way they wage politics today, particularly, are focused on positive self-affirmation, a positive sense of self as black people, black pride and so forth.",
        "So I do think that blacks have been inspired by the U.S.",
        "civil rights movement, and also - even cultural movements such as what there be today hip-hop.",
        "The hip-hop movement in Brazil is quite strong, is quite political, and it has impacted young men and women who are incarcerated and are also in urban communities and, certainly, the language of citizenship that African-Americans have focused on have impacted the Brazilians.",
        "But I do think it's important to focus on the fact that in similar ways that U.S.",
        "civil rights struggles have impacted Brazilian discourse, certainly Brazilians focused on achieving the goal of racial democracy has also impacted how African-Americans themselves have thought about civil rights in this country.",
        "So I do think it's a two-way conversation that needs to be remembered.",
        "Let me go to you, Peter.",
        "Can you give us a very specific example from one nation, since you worked with many different nations, of where you see progress being made?",
        "That regret didn't stop Romney from launching his own negative Spanish-language radio ad, targeting Gingrich.",
        "Well, South Africa itself - South Africa was dominated by racial minority until '94 when the (unintelligible) in media, a transition, which was ushered by a non-racial majority-based constitution, which had terminated the racial segregation which had pervaded South Africa's landscape, and made a media breakthrough in terms of equal rights protection.",
        "South Africa has, since '94, consolidated its democracy.",
        "It has the most - one of the most liberal constitutions in the world.",
        "So Peter, let me just jump in.",
        "Lucky Dube, internationally known reggae star, was killed in a carjacking, an apparent carjacking.",
        "Some people who look at South Africa say, yes, it's got this great constitution, but it still has so much inequality, people are not feeling the benefit of that.",
        "How would you address that?",
        "Well, I think it would be - I think it would be an inappropriate to pass judgment on South Africa's experience because of the possibility, of the fact that a reggae star was killed by criminals.",
        "Yes, there are still people who have not fully benefited from the post-apartheid government (unintelligible).",
        "And a lot needs to be done in terms of access to basic services, education, health, water, electricity, housing and so on.",
        "But nonetheless, it is quite clear that the government in South Africa has made tremendous strides.",
        "I think in the last 30 years, probably, close to about 1 million people have been pulled out of poverty and are now moving into middle-class lifestyle.",
        "Gepsie, let me turn to you.",

        "And the only reason the rankings issue is important to anybody is because it's distracting and harmful to those two issues.",
        "How is it harmful?",
        "Well, it's harmful to access because it leaves lots of college students, lots of potential college students, to think if I don't go to these four or five colleges, my life is ruined and everybody gets in a big frenzy about just a very few colleges.",
