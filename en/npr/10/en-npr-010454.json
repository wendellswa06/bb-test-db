        "Did the company not see this coming?",
        "Did they not think that offering such a good deal - I mean, people were actually going to do it and they would lose money?",
        "Like, when did they realize that they were in trouble here?",
        "Well, you know, I think the company always knew that they would lose money on every sale, which I know sounds silly.",
        "But they were anticipating that ultimately they would forge enough partnerships and deals with movie studios and theater chains that they would have so many customers that these other third parties would have no choice but to, you know, be an alternate revenue stream basically - share concession sales, pay for promotional considerations.",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "They'd be like the new must-have to see movies.",
        "I mean, they'd be that big.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So basically unless you're working with MoviePass, no one's going to go see your show or at your theater, which sort of makes sense.",
        "I think what MoviePass didn't anticipate was that so many people went to see so many movies.",
        "I mean, they're anticipating a lot bigger drop off from people.",
        "OK.",
        "So what is this new policy they have?",
        "How is it going to work?",
        "And does it - do they have any chance of righting the ship here?",
        "Well, you know, so there's actually two policies within the last week or so.",
        "Last week, they had said, you know, we're going to raise our prices to $15 and not show first-run movies.",
        "This week, they're saying, OK, wait, we'll keep the $10, but we're going to limit you to three movies per month.",
        "And that actually does seem pretty sustainable.",
        "Three per month instead of once a day.",
        "That's right.",
        "That doesn't sound like as good a deal.",
        "Yeah, very sad for a candidate to resort to that kind of epithet; it's just inappropriate.",
        "There are differences between candidates on important issues, but we don't attack each other with those kind of terrible terms."
