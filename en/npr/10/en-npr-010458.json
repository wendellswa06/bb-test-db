        "Does it tell us something about who's on top in the international economy, or a sort of shift in power in dominance in the international economy?",
        "The economic center of gravity, in a way, has shifted as a result of the global financial crisis, and China came through it pretty well.",
        "I think we will look back on the financial crisis as a major inflection point that has reinforced the ascendency of emerging markets, of which China is obviously far and away the most important.",
        "Of course, one of the other underlying issues in global jitters that we're having right now is the question of growth.",
        "Obviously, we know the U.S.",
        "is struggling and some analysts are suggesting that China may end up with a quick slowdown in a hard economic landing.",
        "Do you think that's likely?",
        "I think it can't be ruled out but I would say it's a very low probability.",
        "China's been growing in the 9 to 10 percent range so far this year.",
        "The risk that they're going to slam on the brakes at this point as part of an anti-inflation program, I think, is really quite small.",
        "They're not going to take strong contractionary measures that would put them in a hard landing situation.",
        "But how do they grow if the U.S.",
        "and Europe are not buying their products?",
        "Well, they've been quite successful in maintaining strong economic growth, for example, in 2009 and 2010, when the United States and Europe were not doing particularly well.",
        "There are some questions medium-term over how long they can sustain this growth path.",
        "You know, in 2009, '10, when they had a big stimulus program, they probably built five years' worth of infrastructure in a two-year period.",
        "But you can't keep repeating that indefinitely.",
        "So, they need to shift more to more spending by households.",
        "And that's been one of the themes that the vice president has emphasized.",
        "What's your assessment of the value of a trip like this by Vice President Biden to China?",
        "I think this trip is quite important for several reasons.",
        "Of course, the most obvious is that Xi Jinping is all but certain to become the next president of China.",
        "He will be the chairman of the party as well.",
        "He will be the most powerful person in China.",
        "So, getting an early readout on the way he looks at the world can be quite important.",
        "And secondly, I think the Chinese are really looking to better understand what has been happening in the United States, and quite frankly, there's nobody better than the vice president to do this.",
        "He can explain with great authority exactly what happened and also give them a very good idea of what's likely to unfold over the next few months.",
        "Nicholas Lardy is a China expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
        "Thanks for joining us.",

        "At this point, we actually do not know precisely how much oil per day has been spilling into the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "That is why it would be wise to have a test to see exactly how much oil has been coming out, put it all in ships up on the surface of the ocean, so that at the point at which the liability of BP is being determined - that is, $4,300 per day per barrel of oil is the fine - if they have found to be grossly negligent, that that number can be established with some precision and that it is not contested in court by BP.",
        "That's Cole Porter himself singing the song.",
        "It's a love song in which the singer compares the object of his affection to a list of wonderful things.",
        "But since it was written in 1934, a lot of the things Porter thought were wonderful are now meaningless to most of us.",
