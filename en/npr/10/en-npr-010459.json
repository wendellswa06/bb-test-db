        "Thanks for joining us, Mr. Leavitt.",
        "Oh, thank you.",
        "I'm pleased to be on your program.",
        "Perhaps you can explain to us what you're doing there on that Medicare bus.",
        "I guess you're trying to enroll people in the Medicare plan today.",
        "How are people receiving it?",
        "For the last nearly a year, we have been going around the country, preparing for this day.",
        "So, obviously, we're pleased that today has come and that people can now begin to enroll.",
        "This is among the most significant changes that will have occurred in health care in some 40 years.",
        "For the first time, people will have prescription drug coverage as part of Medicare.",
        "Now I know the government has been spending a lot of money on workshops and drives to educate people about this plan, but we still keep hearing about a lot of confusion among seniors who are attending these workshops and are trying to learn about it.",
        "And I guess, just when I've been reading these reports and hearing it, my question and I think a lot of people's question is: Why is it so complicated in the first place?",
        "I think when seniors actually get down to the business of enrolling, they'll find that it's not as complicated as they fear it is.",
        "There are decisions that need to be made, and it isn't without complication because it's health care.",
        "Health care's complicated.",
        "There are a lot of things in our lives that require us to work through things: registering our car, doing our tax return, signing up for cable TV.",
        "All of those take some effort to learn.",
        "People who are actually signing up find that it takes between 20 and 30 minutes once they have their information in place.",
        "I've been working with my parents, for example, getting ready to enroll them.",
        "And it--we'll be able to accomplish it in well under an hour.",
        "Have you used the Medicare Plan Finder Web site in order to help your parents?",
        "Have you gone there and tried to use it?",
        "I have, actually, and I found it very helpful.",
        "Once a person has the medications that they take, they simply put it on the plan finder and put their ZIP Code and it will provide them with a list of the plans that are available.",
        "Now, of course, not everyone likes to use the Internet, and so they can call 1 (800) MEDICARE in order to get the same service, or they could ask someone at a pharmacy or a doctor's office or senior center to help them.",
        "We're working hard to make certain that every senior has the help that they need to make this important decision.",
        "I have to just say, because I've been--I've just been hearing so many stories on this and so many voices, so many people--the other night I heard one man say, you know, `I'm a college graduate.",
        "I'm an engineer.",
        "I'm used to dealing with complicated things, and I just don't understand this.",
        "So clearly, some people are having trouble with it.",
        "Well, we need to work at making it more and more streamlined.",
        "We'll get better as we go, and I think people will come to understand it.",
        "It is--having been through it myself, I know that it does have complications, because it's health care, and that's just the way health care is.",
        "But we're working hard to get people enrolled.",
        "The good news is they'll have prescription drug coverage when they're finished.",
        "It will benefit everyone who signs up by, on average, about $1,300.",
        "So if it takes an hour and they're able to work through it, they're rewarded with a $1,300-a-year benefit that they wouldn't have had before.",
        "So we're optimistic that people will see the virtue of this.",
        "It not only saves them money, but it'll help them stay healthy.",
        "They'll have prescription drugs to prevent illness as opposed to just treating it after they're sick, and that's a big change in the way we think about health care."

        "Are there some people that shouldn't participate in the plan, that aren't going to--it wouldn't help them, if they have a health-care plan already, for instance?",
        "I know it sounds like a sweeping generalization, but I have yet to find anyone who hasn't benefited by being part of this plan.",
        "A third of Americans will get the plan for--with zero output of their own, because the federal government will pay for all of it.",
        "If they're in an income bracket below, say, $20,000 a year for a family and about $14,000 for an individual, the federal government pays for all of it.",
        "If they are in an income bracket above that, they will have to pay a small premium, but in every state there is a plan under $20 a month.",
        "It will save them a lot of money, and it will give them the peace of mind of knowing that they're never going to have to worry about losing their savings because of prescription drugs.",
        "The target is to get 30 million people enrolled by 2006.",
        "What if you fall short of that target?",
        "What if people just say, `I can't wade my way through this.",

        "What would that mean...",
        "Well, it means we need to keep working, because this is a good benefit.",
        "It's an important change in the way we think about health care.",
        "I feel confident that we'll get the 28 to 30 million.",
        "Many people currently have a prescription drug program with their retirement.",
        "They may have worked for the government or for the--they might be a veteran of the Defense Department or worked for a union or something, and they have a benefit already.",
        "We're encouraging them to keep that plan if it's as good as or better than Medicare.",
        "Medicare's actually going to write a check to their plan so that their plan will continue to offer it.",
        "We're going to take the money that we would have spent to help them have an individual benefit to have continuation of their group benefit.",
        "And we know that there will be--we expect there'll be several million people who will join a prescription drug program through that mechanism.",
        "...people are going to be paying more out of pocket?",
        "No, they don't.",
        "Oh, they don't.",
        "So how would a person find out that they were in a plan that has that?",
        "And how would a person find out that they're in a plan that doesn't?",
        "Just one other thing.",
        "I know that the government is saying that there are a large number of insurance companies competing, because that way prices can be held down.",
        "But couldn't there have been a way to keep the number a little lower than, let's say, 40--40 different insurance companies, 40 different plans in some states?",
        "And that's where it's really hard for people to wade through it and figure out what's the best thing to do.",
        "That was a little bit of a surprise.",
        "In fact, a year ago, people were saying, `Oh, this isn't going to work.",
        "There's no insurance companies who are going to want to do this.",
        "But now we ended up having lots of people, and the good news is it's driving the prices down.",
        "It is working.",
        "The government actuaries originally estimated that it would be about $37 a month, on average, for a person who did not get extra help, and it's turned out to be substantially lower than that, and billions of dollars are being saved as a result of the fact that these plans are aggressively competing for the business of seniors.",
        "Now over time, I suspect that all those who start out won't continue and that it'll get a little more simple, but there will always be a competition to earn the business of seniors, and that means the plans will continue to innovate and have the lowest possible prices."

        "OK.",
        "First of all, maybe you can answer the question: Why is it so complicated in the first place?",
        "Well, it's mostly so complicated in the first place--and it's far more complicated than the rest of the Medicare program--because there were basically 15 people who sat down in a room and tried to compromise until they could come up with the program.",
        "That's how--this was designed by the people in Congress who wrote it, and they had some limitations.",
        "They needed the support of the drug industry and they needed the support of at least all of the Republicans; as it turned out, not too many Democrats voted for this.",
        "They wanted very much for this not to be a benefit delivered through Medicare, but one delivered by the private sector.",
        "They want this to be a model for, perhaps, the rest of Medicare, because, as everyone knows, Medicare is financially not really sustainable for the retirement of the baby boomers.",
        "So--and again, as the secretary said, they--at first it was expected there wouldn't be very many insurers that stepped forward.",
        "What we've had, of course, is many.",
        "They're not all insurance companies, by the way.",
        "Some of them are pharmacy groups, groups of pharmacists, group of pharmacy benefits companies.",
        "And actually, what we have are not so many companies; I think in most of the regions of the country it's more like 20 companies or 15, but they're all offering three different variations of plans.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, the way it was designed, I think, was a political document--that they definitely wanted this not to be something that the government actually set the prices for drugs.",
        "That was something the drug industry was vehemently opposed to and the president was vehemently opposed to.",
        "In fact, there is an explicit requirement in the law that Medicare not be allowed to negotiate prices of drugs, that they want to let the private market competition do that for them.",
        "OK.",
        "And for a while, as Mr. Leavitt was just saying, you're hearing now that in some states there are as many as 40 different options to choose from.",

        "On the one hand, they're afraid that if only the sick people get into these plans that they're going to lose money, because it's supposed to be an insurance product, but that--the companies were afraid that if they didn't get it, their competitors would get a leg up on them, that if this works later they sort of can't afford not to try it.",
        "And, of course, the feeling--and this is also a concern, as the secretary alluded to--not all of them probably will make money.",
        "Some of them probably will drop out.",
        "In fact, some of the ones that aren't charging very much won't make money and they'll drop out, and then people will suddenly have to switch plans...",
        "I was going to say, what happens to the people that enroll in those programs, then?",
        "We could see a lot of churning, which we saw in the late 1990s with some of the Medicare private health-maintenance organizations.",
        "And I haven't even mentioned those with the choices.",
        "It's not only the choice of these stand-alone drug plans, but now the government has very much increased the payments to these private HMOs, who will also be offering drug coverage.",
        "So, in fact, in many of these places, they'll not only really have 40 or 50 choices of drug plan, but sometimes 70 or 80 different choices between the managed-care organizations and the plans.",

        "People with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid but still below about 150 percent of the poverty line will get what they call `special help,' and they'll get--have lower premiums, lower deduct--lower co-pays, I believe it's no deductible.",
