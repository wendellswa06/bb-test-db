        "Does that answer your question, Nancy?",
        "Yes.",
        "It's confusing because on one of the applications I was reading for my mother, after reading what I read I thought I should just throw it away, that she was not eligible, that if you made a certain amount of income you could not apply.",
        "I think what happened was, earlier this summer, the Social Security Administration sent out several million applications for people to apply.",
        "You have to apply for the special help separately from choosing a plan.",
        "So, in fact, if your mother is--has too much income or too many assets to qualify for the special help, she can still sign up for a regular plan.",
        "The point was that that's a two-step process; you sign up for the special help, and then you pick a plan.",
        "But if her mother already has good health insurance, is there any point in doing this?",
        "Not if she has good insurance for drugs.",
        "For drugs, I mean.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Probably not.",
        "It depends.",

        "If they have retiree coverage, they'll be notified.",
        "If they have Medigap drug coverage, they'll be notified.",

        "As a person knowledgeable about health policy and a medical care provider, I have serious concerns about the Medicare drug plan.",
        "One question I have not heard addressed is this: What happens when someone enrolls in a particular plan because it covers the medications they need, but is then prescribed a medication not covered?",
        "I believe this will happen a lot, and I hope one of your guests can address this.'",
        "Julie?",
        "This is certainly a possibility.",
        "The plans are allowed to change the drugs that they offer.",
        "Beneficiaries can change once between now and the middle of May, and after that they'll have to wait until the next open enrollment period, which will be next November 15th.",
        "So if, sometime in June, the person is prescribed a new plan, or perhaps their plan just stops offering that drug, they're going to have to pay for it.",
        "Maybe you can explain also what is meant by `the doughnut.",
        "There's a period of time--I'm not even going to bother trying to get into it.",
        "You explain it, Julie.",
        "OK.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "This is--this really is a political creature that was developed because Congress didn't have enough money as they wanted to do this benefit.",
        "They really wanted to get people to join the program, so they wanted to give a fairly rich benefit at the bottom, where most people's average drug costs were, and they really wanted to help people with very high drug costs, which is the catastrophic benefit.",
        "And what they discovered is that if they did both of those things, they were going to have a gap in the middle, and that's what they've left.",
        "So this is what's called the standard benefit, which--you pay a $250 deductible, you get 75 percent of your drug costs covered until you get up to $2,250.",
        "Then, if you go on to spend $3,600 of your own money--so that's the 250 plus the 25 percent plus your own money--you basically get to $5,100 worth of drugs--then the plan kicks back in and it pays 95 percent of the rest of your drugs.",
        "Now I see you rolling your eyes.",
        "What's even worse is that many of the plans--in fact, I believe most of the plans that are being offered--don't have that standard benefit.",
        "They--there was a rule that they could offer anything they wanted as long as it was, quote, unquote, \"\"actuarially equivalent\"\" to that standard benefit.",
        "So a lot of them have lower deductibles and/or higher premiums, different co-pays.",
        "They have some coverage in what we call that gap, the doughnut hole.",
        "Sometimes they just have coverage for generic drugs in the doughnut hole, sometimes they have full coverage in the doughnut hole, so it's really--the landscape, I think, is much different than people anticipated.",
        "But wait.",
        "Do all those plans have a doughnut hole--that is, a period of time when...",
        "The plans actually say.",
        "In fact, I think there's a--if you look on the Web site, the way it's structured is there's a chart or, you know, one line in a chart that says `Coverage in the gap,' and it will say what kind of coverage, if there is any, and what kind there is.",
        "So no, they don't all have doughnut holes."

        "And the other thing that I've learned about this program, I think from your reporting, as a matter of fact, Julie, that's difficult for people is they may go through this process, go into the Web site, do the research, make phone calls, come up with a drug plan that they say `This is the one that works for me,' and then they go to their pharmacy and the pharmacy doesn't use that drug plan.",
        "Well, that's one of the things that you can check.",
        "You can check that on the Web site.",
        "In fact, a lot of people, a lot of seniors I've seen, are starting with that.",

        "And I think if you live in a rural area, where--or you have a pharmacist that you particularly trust, that might make sense.",
        "So you start with the pharmacy and then you say, `Which of these plans does my pharmacy participate in?",
        "So you can--if you want, you can do it that way.",
        "And if your pharmacy is in a plan that doesn't cover your drugs, you're just out of luck.",
        "Yes.",
        "OK.",
        "But we just...",
        "You'd either have to change pharmacy or change drugs.",
        "We should say, on the other side of that, that perhaps without this plan, those seniors wouldn't be getting any coverage at all.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And adding another element of complication to this, there are plans that may not cover--most seniors take more than one drug.",
        "It may not cover one of your drugs, but it may still be the best plan for you because you may end up saving so much money on the other drugs that paying for the drug it doesn't cover out of pocket still gives you a net saving."

        "And it would appear that now they are approaching these decisions with a little bit of trepidation now that they hear so many plans are going to be offered in their areas.",

        "How do they begin working on it?",
        "Well, that is exactly the right first question to ask: `Should I sign up or not?",
        "And that might depend on whether or not you have another source of coverage.",
        "People who have employer coverage or veterans, another source of coverage that is considered at least as good as the standard Medicare drug benefit, might well want to stick with what they have, but most people on Medicare do not have that kind of coverage, and that's a group of people who should think long and hard about signing up.",
        "And there are strong reasons to sign up.",
        "There's kind of a carrot and a stick.",
        "The carrot is they do get insurance.",
        "If they're low-income, they get fairly substantial help.",
        "And anyone gets help just at the idea of, the notion of having insurance.",
        "But there's also the stick, which is if they don't have other coverage, they will pay a penalty for late enrollment, and it's a penalty that they repay if they change their mind and sign up in the future.",
        "And it's one that would--they'd pay for the rest of their lives on Medicare.",
        "How much of a penalty are we talking about?",
        "It's 1 percent for every month that they delay enrollment, based on the average premium in the year that they sign up, and in the first year or two that might not be a lot of money, but over time, it could really add up.",

        "How different is that from other insurance policies where, let's say, you sign up at the age of 50, but then you--one person signs up at the age of 50 and another person signs up at the age of 55, and the person that signs up at 55 is going to pay more.",
