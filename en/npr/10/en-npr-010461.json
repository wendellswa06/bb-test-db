        "And that's true.",
        "That's true of Part B, as well.",
        "Same thing.",
        "There's also a late enrollment penalty, as Tricia pointed out, for enrolling late in Part B when you become eligible.",
        "If you don't enroll in it when you're first eligible, but--for instance, if you're still working when you turn 65 and you still have your employer's coverage, you don't sign up for Part B, then a couple of years later, if you retire at age 69 or 70, there's no late enrollment penalty there.",

        "Oh, I see what you're saying.",
        "Yes, and that's part of it.",
        "But it's also--I mean, one shouldn't look past the fact that this is also insurance.",

        "But it's--I think it's fair to say that it's a fairly labor-intensive process, and it takes some getting used to.",
