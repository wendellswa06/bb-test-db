        "But it would also give some detainees the right to appeal tribunal decisions to the federal courts.",
        "On another amendment, senators voted in favor of requiring the administration to provide quarterly reports on the war in Iraq.",
        "You can hear details on those stories and others later today on \"\"All Things Considered\"\" from NPR News.",
        "And tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, VCRs, TiVo, cable, MP3 players--we'll look at some of the old and new ways in which TV programs are being offered.",
        "How does this affect programming, and what does it all mean for you?",
        "Right now we are talking about the new Medicare prescription plan and how it affects which seniors eligible for Medicare can start signing up today.",
        "Our guests are NPR's health policy report Julie Rovner and Tricia Neuman; she's vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and director of their Medicare Policy Project.",
        "If you've got any questions, the number: 1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "Julie, I have an e-mail here from Cynthia, and she asks, `Could your guests discuss the prescription drug plan and how it relates to those disabled people who are on Medicare but are not seniors?'",
        "Yes.",
        "Everyone is eligible for this on Medicare including those six and a half million Medicare beneficiaries who are not seniors but are disabled.",
        "They're always sort of left out.",
        "People talk about Medicare as being the program for seniors, but in fact, if you have Social Security, disability and you wait a period of time, you do get on Medicare.",
        "And those people are indeed eligible for this.",
        "I think the e-mailer might ask, because there have been programs in the past, private programs for Medicare, where the disabled were not allowed to enroll.",

        "All right.",

        "I know.",
        "OK.",
        "Yeah, but a lot of them are all-inclusive without drugs, and some of them are with drugs.",
        "Short answer is if you have the one with drugs, you can keep it.",
        "You probably don't want to.",
        "You'll probably want to get a different one.",
        "You could get, in fact, the same Medigap plan without the drugs; you'll spend less and then you could join a Part D plan.",
        "But there are some people who do have that Medigap plan with drugs.",
        "No Medigap insurer will be allowed to offer new plans with drugs or offer their plans with drugs to new people, but the people who are in those plans now may stay with them if they want.",
        "They will, however, have to pay a late enrollment penalty if they switch later.",

        "They can start--you know, I guess I should say the majority of seniors don't go online, so when you think about going to the Web, I think it's 76 percent of seniors have never gone online.",
        "But those that do or those who have family members or friends who will go online for them can go to www.Medicare.gov to get much of this information.",
        "Beyond online resources, they can call 1 (800) MEDICARE, and also in each state there are state health insurance programs that provide assistance to people, and their state telephone numbers are listed in the Medicare new handbook.",
        "Kaiser has actually studied how much seniors are using the Internet and particularly with relation to this program, and it's a small number.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's why I thought it was important to say.",
        "I mean, that might be a great tool for future generations of seniors, but for the current generation it's probably not going to help most people."

        "`You say you could change your provider from a cheaper plan when you don't really need much coverage to a more full plan the next enrollment period if you find yourself in need of greater coverage.",
        "If, in the meantime, you have developed a condition that necessitates the greater coverage, can the new provider raise those rates or deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions?'",
        "Well, the answer to the last question is no. You cannot be denied a Medicare prescription drug plan based on your medical history.",
        "And I think another issue that was maybe implied by this questioner was whether or not rates could be raised over the course of the year, and the answer to that is no. The rates are across the whole group and not--they don't vary by individual.",

        "OK.",
        "And actually I think TRICARE should have sent a letter to that effect too.",
        "I think it's important to say--if you have a lot of retiree health coverage, you will be getting a letter from your provider that tells you whether or not the plan is equal to the Medicare benefit, and if it is then the retiree plan actually gets the subsidy from the government, although I'm not sure the military plan does.",
        "But private ones do, so they have an interest in telling you that it's OK and that you can stay on it, 'cause then they'll get some extra money from the government.",

        "And that could be a real problem in terms of being able to, you know, not lose money on this benefit.",
        "So I think that's the worry is not so much will they get enough people, but will they get enough healthy people to get a viable insurance product.",
        "And what about the people who need it most?",
        "Apart from the healthy vs. sick what about those who have the greatest concerns in terms of their income?",
