        "So it's early and hopefully all the education and outreach efforts will reach people to encourage them to look seriously into signing up.",
        "As for low-income subsidy assistance, the Social Security Administration has sent out something like 18 million applications.",
        "But programs that serve low-income people have historically suffered from low participation rates, and this is a case where getting this help really makes a difference in terms of getting the value out of the drug benefit, so...",

        "Well, they actually are a special group of people in some respects.",
        "They're treated differently in that they will lose their Medicaid drug coverage at the end of 2005 and they are being randomly assigned to Medicare drug plans so that in theory they will have coverage on day one in January of 2006.",
        "And there is some concern that there could be a gap in coverage and many are worried, I think it's fair to say, that there could be gaps in coverage in the transition for people from Medicaid to these Medicare drug plans.",
        "But I think it's fair to say that if you don't have any drug coverage now, there's no question that this will be a benefit.",

        "Now the question is if you do have coverage now or if you have some coverage now, whether--you know, exactly how much it will help you and then sorting out all of the various options.",

        "I mean, there are real benefits for many people with low incomes.",
        "There's the catastrophic benefit, which will help people if they have an unexpected or an expected expensive illness which requires a lot of prescriptions, and then there's the people in the middle who just could benefit from having the insurance coverage that's made available and is subsidized by the government.",
        "So people who've been listening to this program, hearing about all the complications shouldn't be afraid of this.",
        "They should--because, you know, I'm warned by a little--a lot of the coverage I've been hearing has made me think, `Whew, boy, I don't know that I'd want to have to do that.'",
        "You know, well, in fairness I don't know that they should be afraid, but it's tough stuff and they might need some extra help, some counseling, some one on one support to work through these decisions about whether to sign up and which plan to get.",

        "As long as you sign up by the end of December, you'll get the benefit as soon as it starts.",
