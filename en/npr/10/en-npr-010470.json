        "Thank you for having me.",
        "As we mentioned, 73,000 workers on strike, where are these folks striking and how many facilities and how many states?",
        "General Motors has about 50 facilities and that includes parts plants, engine plants, assembly plants, even the General Motors' tech center.",
        "So it's pretty much on the eastern side of the country.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, the job security issue pretty much comes down to this.",
        "General Motors is planning to cut about 30,000 jobs through next year.",
        "And once its finished with that restructuring, the UAW wants some guarantees from General Motors that there won't be anymore job cuts.",
        "And anybody who has a job under this contract will stay employed until the end of the contract.",
        "To put this in context, there are about 73,000 GM workers now.",
        "There are about 400,000 GM workers when the last strike took place in 1970, and that number pretty much held in place until about 1990.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now, there's an old joke that General Motors should be called Generous Motors.",
        "What kind of benefits do these workers want to protect?",
        "Well, that's very true.",
        "And, in fact, they also called it Mother Motors something that would protect you throughout your lifetime.",
        "It used to be that General Motors' workers had extremely generous health care benefits that you could include your wife and your children on your health care benefits essentially for free.",
        "Now, that changed a couple of years ago, and GM workers pay a greater part of their health care coverage - they pay for office visits, they pay for co-pays.",
        "But compared with a lot of people who have health care coverage, it's still a very generous plan.",
        "Hmm.",

        "How so?",

        "I mean, their fate is tied in with the auto companies.",
        "As the market share goes down for Detroit, jobs go away for the UAW.",
        "And I think they were trying to be seen as someone who is on the car marker's side.",
        "For General Motors, they're trying to prove that there can be a large American car company that survives this great crisis facing the auto industry.",
        "And they really wanted to be the one strong American player who got through this period of decline.",
        "Felgenhauer says the Russian military isn't ready for any kind of offensive action apart from a nuclear attack.",
        "He says despite the extra money the military got under Putin, it has managed to buy only several new fighter jets.",
        "And it can't deploy its latest nuclear submarine because its highly touted new ballistic missiles don't work.",
        "Felgenhauer says Moscow needs to change its military doctrine and stop pretending it's a global counterweight to the West.",
        "Only then, he says, can Russia start building a new military instead of trying to revive the old Soviet one.",
