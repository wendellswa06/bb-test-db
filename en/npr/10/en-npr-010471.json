        "Micheline Maynard, what do you think of that autoworker family member who seems to think this strike is not a good idea?",
        "Well, I have a lot of sympathies for the family members of autoworkers because these were jobs that essentially guaranteed you a middle-class lifestyle, sometimes without even having a high school degree, and they were jobs that were handed down through generations.",
        "But I used to cover the airline industry.",
        "And I covered six bankruptcies.",

        "We - nobody really wanted to go on strike.",
        "I mean, this is a - it seems like the issues are that General Motors didn't want to negotiate in good faith with our representatives and they felt no choice but to call us out.",
        "And we were warned two weeks prior to that we may end up going out and we - they called it off.",
        "So General Motors kind of knew that we were ready to go.",

        "You said you didn't want to go on strike, but do you agree with the decision to go out on strike right now?",
        "Yes.",

        "Any merit in that concern?",
        "That's a good concern.",
