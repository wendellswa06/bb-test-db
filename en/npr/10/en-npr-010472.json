        "In Aden they are regular shortage of electricity, of water, of fuel and even the shops start to be close, so even for the food it should become difficult.",
        "But I do think that 15, 20 years ago when the Japanese automakers were starting to make inroads, if there had been an effort to sit down and look at the contract and say, you know, let's adjust this, then they might not be in this predicament.",
        "But unfortunately, the contract that we have in place today is essentially what we've had in place since the 1950s.",
        "Hmm.",
        "How long can the UAW afford to stay out and how long can GM endure a strike of this kind?",
        "Well, I think that both of them could easily afford a strike of about a month.",
        "I think after that, GM runs into a problem because we have the start of the new model year in October, the 2008 model year.",
        "And, you know, people pulled off from buying cars when a company has struck.",
        "They sat on their wallets in 1998.",
        "General Motors never recovered the market share that it lost during that strike.",
        "And I think in the case to the UAW, there does come a point your - you strike to make a point, does the point diminish after a month or so?",
        "Especially now that we have Japanese auto plants in the United States that don't have unions.",
