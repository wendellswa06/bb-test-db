        "Yeah, I think it makes it tough for them because when there's a distillery down the street that's marketing, you know, whiskey made by a big distillery that's 10 years old, it's very hard for a small player who is, you know, trying their best to make the whiskey.",

        "It's interesting to me that when we talk about play today, the first thing that comes to mind are toys.",

        "You see, for most of human history what children did when children played was engaged in freewheeling imaginative play, elaborate narratives of pirates and princesses.",

        "They improvised play, whether it was in the outdoors, the fields, and the forest, or whether it was on a street corner or somebody's back yard.",
        "They improvised their own play; they regulated their play; they made up their own rules.",
        "But, Chudacoff argues, once TV and toys begin to supply children with ever more specific scripts and special props for their stories, the size of children's imaginative space begins to shrink.",
        "And that's not the only way that imagination comes under siege, according to Chudacoff.",
        "In the second half of the 20th century, he says, parents were increasingly concerned about safety, which again affected play.",
        "Because then adults want to structure it more, to create environments that are safe, that are secure, that cannot be penetrated from threats from the outside world.",
        "To protect their children, parents began to place their kids in adult moderated activities, which, says Chudacoff has another benefit, especially to middle class parents worried about achievement.",

        "So clearly, the way that most children spend their time has changed, and of course, there have been other changes in the lives of kids, but a growing number of psychologists believe that these changes in how children play have led to changes in their cognitive and emotional development.",
        "Here's some of the evidence: back in the late 1940's some psychological researchers did a series of tests on children.",
        "In one of the tests, they asked kids ages three, five, and seven to stand perfectly still without moving.",
        "The three-year-olds couldn't do this exercise at all.",

        "In 2001, some researchers actually repeated this experiment, but as psychologist Elena Bodrova explains, the results were very different.",
        "Today's five-year-olds were acting at the level of three-year-olds 60 years ago, and today's seven-year-olds were barely approaching the level of five-year-olds 60 years ago.",
        "So the results were very sad.",
        "Sad, because the children were less able to do something called self-regulation.",
        "Self-regulation is the ability to control emotions and behavior.",
        "It's a key component of a broader set of skills called executive function.",
        "Kids with good self-regulation aren't impulsive, they have self-control, discipline.",
        "And this self-regulation is incredibly important.",
        "In fact, good self-regulation is a better predictor of success in school than a child's IQ.",
        "Self-regulation predicts effective development in virtually every domain.",
        "This is executive function researcher Laura Berk, of Illinois State University.",
        "She says, make believe is a powerful tool for building self-regulation.",
        "That's because during make believe children engage in what's called private speech: They talk to themselves about what they are going to do and how they are going to do it.",
        "Laying out the rules of play for themselves.",
        "We find that this self-regulating language is highest during make believe play.",

        "If we look at our own use of private speech, what we find is that we are often using it to surmount obstacles to master cognitive and social skills, and to manage our emotion.",
        "Unfortunately, the more structured the play, the more children's private speech declines.",
        "Essentially, what's happening is that because children's play is so focused on lessons and leagues, and because kids' toys increasingly inhibit imaginative play, kids aren't getting a chance to practice policing themselves.",
        "When they have that opportunity, the results are clear: Self-regulation improves.",
        "One index that researchers, including myself, have used to look at that is the extent to which a child, for example, cleans up independently after a free-choice period in preschool.",
        "We find that children who are most effective at complex make-believe play take on that responsibility with greater willingness, and even will assist others in doing so without teacher prompting.",
