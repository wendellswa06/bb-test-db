        "Investigators found no evidence that anyone at the Justice Department evaluated the reasons for firing each U.S.",
        "attorney.",

        "The last time I counted there were over 30.",
        "That's partly because those mapping platforms are run out of servers that are located in countries that have their own laws about how the world needs to be represented politically."
