        "Now, in sprinting, the knee lift is the fundamental principle.",

        "Which raises the question, if Jamaican sprinters are so genetically well-endowed, is there a speed gene, some inherited trait that distinguishes the elite runner from the broader population?",
        "Well, both Dr. Morrison and Dr. Irving have collaborated with Dr. Yannis Pitsiladis at the University of Glasgow.",
        "Dr.",
        "Pitsiladis has studied a DNA bank of samples from hundreds of Jamaican and African-American sprinters, not to mention Kenyan middle distance runners and Ethiopian marathoners.",
        "He says he started out hopeful of finding a speed gene.",
        "We were so convinced by arguments that had been put forward by other scientists, by the media that these populations like the Jamaicans have the right genes that we thought it'd be easy enough.",
        "Just go to the island, collect DNA samples, analyze them, come up with those genes and there's the end finding.",
        "Well, four to five years later, I can tell you that we have been looking at the genes and, in one line, I have to say that we have found no genetic evidence for the phenomenon that we're observing in Jamaica.",
        "It's not that genes play no role, but the genes of elite sprinters just aren't that different.",
        "As for the diet of yams and green bananas...",
        "I know that worked very well and I've even co-authored some abstracts with Professor Morrison on this.",
        "And I would say that there's actually even less evidence to defend that argument than there is on the genetics.",
        "In lots of countries, people eat yams or similar tubers and those countries are not known for their sprinters.",
        "There is, of course, a cynical explanation for the rise of Jamaican sprinting.",
        "Some would say they must be doping and masking the drugs better than others.",
        "In fact, the country's suspension record isn't especially bad.",

        "Still, the mussels hang on tight with the help of their beard.",
        "And these fibers are stiff but stretchy, and they basically function as kind of a holdfast and a shock absorber.",
        "Harrington works at one of the Max Planck Institutes in Potsdam, Germany, where he tries to get ideas for new, manmade materials by studying ones found in nature.",
