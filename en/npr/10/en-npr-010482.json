        "Well, if it was the last day, then it was a particularly violent spasm and the Israelis were bombing very heavily in and around Tyre today.",

        "What have you seen today?",
        "Well, in waking up, you know, you see all sorts of smoke and dust from the distance, to some extent.",
        "But this afternoon I was in a hospital and the building shook from an explosion and at the same time, throughout the day, I've seen katyusha rockets being fired out.",
        "Now, they arc in sort of smoky lines heading south towards Israel, so I got the sense that this was two combatants battling it out and in a sense giving it all they had for the last day.",
        "I think Hezbollah sent 250 rockets towards Israel, which is the highest number so far.",
        "How long have you been there in Tyre?",
        "I'm slightly losing count, but I think it's a week.",
        "The problem has been for journalists here that - it produces a sort of monotony - is that we can't drive.",
        "About five days ago, I think it was, the Israeli military issued an edict saying that any vehicle south of the Litani river, which sort of delineates southern Lebanon, is a potential target.",
        "And they're serious about it.",
        "I mean, we've seen them targeting civilian vehicles here and that is a strong disincentive to getting into one.",
        "And so some journalists have been taking the risk, and some civilians take the risk and drive around, but not me.",
        "What did the people around you think of the ceasefire agreement?",
        "Are they at all optimistic that this could be what ends the violence there?",
        "They are, actually.",
        "I was surprised.",
        "I sort of went out and asked people, including a 17 year old guy who'd been buried under the rubble of his living room today, this morning.",
        "And you know, he seemed relatively optimistic.",
        "This was a Hezbollah supporter, I should add, and he seemed relatively optimistic.",
        "Doctors I spoke to seemed, you know, relatively optimistic.",
        "Now, whether their optimism comes from desperate hope, which is common currency in this city which has very few supplies - gasoline, medication is running out in some places, and so on - I don't know.",
        "I suspect that I could have happened across other people that have deep skepticism in their views of what's going to happen at 8:00 o'clock or one minute past 8:00 tomorrow morning."

        "The first obviously is that it's really, really close to both the maritime border and the natural land mass of North Korea.",

        "As I understand it, North Korea does accept that Yeonpyeong Island belongs to South Korea.",
        "But obviously, there are still ongoing disputes over other parts of the border.",
        "How does that factor in and escalate tensions, I assume, when you have flare-ups like we've seen this week?",

        "The maritime border is the place where, here, you've had incidents in the past, in the 1990s in the early 2000s.",
