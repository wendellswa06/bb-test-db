        "Salim Ahmed Hamdan was captured in Afghanistan and has been detained for more than three years at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
        "He is one of only four detainees who have been charged and face military trials that the government calls military commissions.",
        "Hamdan, who's suspected of being a driver for Osama bin Laden, is accused of conspiracy to commit, among other things, terrorism and murder.",
        "His military trial began a year ago, but at the same time a lawsuit on his behalf was filed in civilian court.",
        "When a federal judge overseeing that case ruled that the procedures in his military trial were unlawful, everything ground to a halt while Hamdan's case went to an appeals court.",
        "Neal Katyal, a professor of law at Georgetown University and who argued Hamdan's case, says there were three claims being decided.",
        "One is that President Bush has the authority to set up any military tribunals he chooses.",
        "The second is that the president has the ability to exempt people from the Geneva Conventions and its requirement that a military tribunal be convened to decide whether someone is a prisoner of war or not.",
        "The third claim, Katyal says, is whether the president can write all the procedures and decide the make-up of a military trial.",
        "And the ruling on all three questions is that the president has the power to do those things, and taken together these three rulings are a massive transfer of power to the president.",
        "In the first claim, the judges said the president has the ability to run the military and that Congress gave him the authority to wage this war.",
        "In the second claim, the appeals panel said that the Geneva Conventions, which are meant to protect prisoners of war, cannot help Hamdan because he doesn't fit the definition of a POW.",
        "As to the third point under which the president has the right to design and staff military tribunals, David Rivkin, a Washington lawyer who served in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, says the president would not control specific decisions made by a military panel.",
        "In every single case, whether it's military commissions or court-martials, you have very conscientious military officers who take their oaths seriously.",
        "There is no undue command influence.",
        "There is no undue pressure from anybody about them in the chain of command.",
        "Today's decision didn't go all the administration's way.",
        "The ruling said that Hamdan could use federal courts to contest a conviction after all appeals to the military justice system had been exhausted.",
        "Still, Eugene Fidell, a lawyer and president for the National Institute of Military Justice, said that overall the ruling is a vote of approval for the administration's policies concerning Guantanamo Bay.",
        "It is a window on the deference that the federal courts almost invariably gives to the executive branch in matters relating to the war power.",
        "Judges really don't like to get in the way of the government when the country is facing a crisis of one kind or another.",
        "Defense lawyers say that they will appeal today's ruling to the US Supreme Court.",
        "Jackie Northam, NPR News, Washington.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Why are mortgage rates not going up in step with the steady increase in short-term rates from the Fed?",
        "For some answers to that question, we turn to Mark Vitner.",
        "He's a senior economist at Wachovia Corporation."

        "Thanks for being with us.",
        "Oh, it's my pleasure.",
        "We've seen this consistent upward march in short-term interest rates over the past year or so, but a very different pattern with mortgage rates.",
        "How would you describe the pattern there?",
        "Well, mortgage rates are actually lower today than they were when the Fed began raising interest rates about a year ago, and it's a bit of a mystery as to why.",
        "I mean, we have some ideas as to why long-term interest rates have fallen, but Alan Greenspan himself has come out and said it's a bit of a conundrum.",
        "It's very unusual for long-term interest rates to have done what they have done.",
        "Well, what are some possibilities?",
        "What are mortgage rates responding to?",
        "Well, mortgage rates are very closely tied to long-term Treasury rates, or the rates on the Treasury's 10-year bond.",
        "And this afternoon, right after the Fed raised interest rates, they were essentially unchanged at 4.2 percent.",
        "And the rate on 30-year mortgages tends to be about 1 1/2 percentage points above that, which would put rates, you know, slightly under 6 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which is just incredibly low.",
        "If you look at patterns in the past, when short-term rates have been high, have mortgage rates also been high?",
        "Yes, particularly when the Fed began to increase interest rates, because in the past, when the Federal Reserve began to tighten monetary policy, it was usually because inflation was showing signs of accelerating, and accelerating to some unknown level.",
        "This time, the Fed has been very clear that even though we are seeing some signs of inflation out there, that they believe that inflation will be well contained.",
        "And because Alan Greenspan has been at the Fed for so long, and the Fed has done such a good job of bringing inflation down from those double-digit levels that we saw in the late '70s and the early '80s to the very low levels that we've seen in recent years, they have a lot of credibility in the bond market.",
        "Does that mean that the bond market is seeing something different, seeing some different factor maybe than what the Fed sees?",
        "Well, obviously, bond investors either see much weaker economic growth out there, much lower inflation or it may be that they're just saying, `Gosh, you know, there's so much risk in this world today that I feel much better about holding Treasuries today.",
        "And I think the risk of holding Treasuries is so much lower than being exposed on the stock market or being exposed overseas or maybe even in real estate right now since there's so much talk of a bubble.",
        "And that may be part of the reason that long-term interest rates are coming down.",
        "We also have a lot of buying from overseas investors.",
        "Europeans and Asian investors have been buying a large number of Treasury securities, and that's helping keep interest rates down."
