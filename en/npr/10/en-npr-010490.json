        "OK, thank you.",

        "As a former soldier myself, I strongly believe the American people should be engaged in their wars.",
        "They have been very supportive of the troops, even if they haven't understood the strategy or what's at stake.",
        "On the other hand, although the American people are not strongly in favor of continuing the war in Afghanistan - that's obviously an understatement - they aren't that concerned about it.",
        "And so the level of intensity isn't very high.",
        "This gives whatever administration comes to power in 2013 a great freedom of action to do essentially what they want to do in Afghanistan, continue the effort there as both President Obama and Governor Romney have promised they are going to do.",
        "So there isn't clash between the two parties on this issue.",
        "Both agree - both Governor Romney and President Obama agree with the current strategy.",
        "And my sense is that although the American people aren't happy about it, they're going to allow this to continue.",
        "They're going to focus on domestic issues, and the United States' defense establishment, the national security establishment, will be able to do what I believe it needs to do: maintain bases in the region, continue operations in the region, even understanding that it is going to continue to cost us some of our sons and daughters.",
        "John Nagl, thanks very much for your time today.",

        "And it shook me.",
        "It made me feel bad.",
        "There's been a lot written about how our sexual attractions are programmed by the culture - what movies we watch, what we learn about race growing up, what our families teach us.",
        "So here's my question.",
        "Once your racial preferences have been programmed by your cultural bubble, can you change them?",
        "I started calling around to sex researchers.",
        "But before I tell you what I found out, one quick note - basically, almost all the researchers I spoke to told me there's a huge difference between something like sexual orientation and racial preference.",
        "Sexual orientation is much more biologically based, whereas racial preferences are not written into your genes, not even if you feel a racial preference strongly."

        "...All of which taught to Zunino a crucial lesson that might even apply to people.",
