        "Exxon reported big profits yesterday, but Wall Street wanted even more, and so Exxon's stock slipped a little.",
        "In general though, stocks are climbing.",
        "Yesterday the Dow closed above 13,000, the first time it has done so since January.",
        "You might think this is a little strange considering that the over-all economy is not doing so well.",
        "Well, here to explain this seeming contradiction is William Knapp.",
        "He's an investment strategist for a division of New York Life.",
        "And Mr. Knapp, the stock market is up more than 10 percent, what's driving this increase?",
        "Well, it's optimism with respect to the future.",
        "And being a predictive animal, the stock market will look forward to the recovery from the current period of economic stagnation.",
        "It may actually still see some negative headlines with respect to things like employment, production, inflation.",
        "But in the meantime, the stock market is trying to predict where profitability of the companies that make it up is going, as we head towards recovery later this year and early in 2009.",
        "So, is it too soon to tell or can you tell right now if this is a permanent turnaround, a permanent increase or...",
        "Well, I like to be optimistic and I think that it is.",
        "And I think recently we've had a pretty big change in sentiment with respect to investors in not only the equity market, but in fixed-income markets and commodity markets as well.",
        "General Motors announced this week that it lost more than three billion dollars in the first quarter.",
        "Lots of other big companies have announced similar big losses, Citibank included.",
        "Why haven't these really bad earnings reports dragged down Wall Street?",
        "Well, again, it's optimism with respect to the future principally, really other than the financial sector, companies in general are doing OK even though the economy has slowed.",
        "How accurate is Wall Street's health as a barometer of the overall economy?",
        "You're saying it's predictive.",
        "In general, I think it has been pretty accurate, and I think it's very accurate right now.",
        "Again, I'm not in a camp that thinks that we have been or going into a recession.",
        "And that I think that perhaps there has been a little mongering with respect to the level of economic stagnation that - if you look into the statistics, and if this is actually declared a recession, it'll be the weakest recession that the U.S.",
        "has ever had, if it's ever made official."

        "What's yours?",
        "Well, that's a great question.",

        "We might have to ask more of our systems - whether that's of our journalists who I think are working overtime and are catching a lot of these falsehoods but also of our government, but also, as you point out, ourselves.",
        "I think that I try really hard to think about how we deceive ourselves and how we let ourselves be deceived.",
        "And race is one big component in that.",
