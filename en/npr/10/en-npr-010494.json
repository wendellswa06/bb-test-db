        "Tamara, are these mostly symbolic sanctions?",
        "I mean, North Korea's already under significant sanctions.",
        "Significant.",

        "sanctions programs.",
        "These are largely targeted at North Korea's weapons development - nuclear weapons development.",
        "So you could easily argue that these new sanctions are just piling onto a pretty big pile already.",
        "U.S.",
        "officials insist, though, that these are new and different because they name 10 individuals, most of whom work for the country's main arms dealer.",
        "They say that this naming them is going to make it very hard for those people to do business basically anywhere in the world.",
        "The White House also says that there are more sanctions yet to come.",
        "And some sanctions are targeting North Korea's military intelligence units.",
        "That could be more than symbolism.",
        "It could be, except it seems highly unlikely that anyone in U.S.",
        "financial institutions is doing business with the North Korean intelligence agency either.",
        "Tamara, the White House press secretary says this is just the first phase of the response.",

        "officials were asked about that, and one U.S.",

        "That was before we screwed up our soil so badly so that the nutrients in the ingredients that the dogs and the cats ate in the wild were much more dense than they are, currently.",
        "Be that as it may, if you go into those woods, you find me the trees in which live the Keebler elves cooking kibble, or find me a can opener hanging from a bush.",

        "No, certainly, but it's not to be appetizing to me.",
        "You take, you know, raw products, ground-up egg shells and all kinds of vegetables, nutrients, raw chicken with the bone, grind them up with a grinder, and you create their diet, and I try to do it for three or four ahead of the time and freeze them, but it gets so labor intensive.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I will say with what he's talking about and with the raw diet, what goes in comes out, and there's a lot less waste in the yard, and the waste goes away faster, but…",
