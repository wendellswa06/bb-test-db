        "Republicans have tended to allege, since 2000, that there's this enormous epidemic of vote fraud, of people going to polling places and voting falsely, several times.",
        "Democrats, on the other hand, respond to that saying, not only is there no evidence of pervasive vote fraud, but that attempts to get rid of it, all of these ID laws, actually have a very, very subversive subtext, and that is to suppress minority voting because, of course, the people who can't get a hold of ID in order to vote tend to be minorities.",

        "We might come away differently.",
        "But at least looking at this Indiana law, and the proof that was brought by Democrats, they said, we just are not seeing a lot of vote suppression here, and we think this law serves a legitimate purpose in doing away with vote fraud.",
        "And I guess what surprised me, Dahlia, was the decision was six to three, not the usual five-four split that we see on the more contentious issues before the court.",
        "That's exactly right, Madeleine.",

        "I might come out differently, but, in this particular case, you just didn't meet the extremely high bar you needed to meet.",
        "In other words, it has to take a lot to - for the court to strike down a law.",
        "I mean, a lot of obvious problems with the law for them to do that.",
        "And, specifically in this case, Madeleine, this was brought as a facial challenge, which is a constitutional challenge that says, under every set of facts, this law is unconstitutional.",
        "That bar is extraordinarily high to meet.",
        "It leaves open the door for opponents of this law to bring back what's called an as applied challenge, a much narrower challenge when you say, it's not always unconstitutional, but as has it affected me, this time around, it is unconstitutional .",
        "In effect, what they did was really, really narrow the gateway through which opponents could get through, if there was a subsequent challenge.",

        "So will this ruling affect the vote next week?",
        "Well, the law will be in affect.",

        "Whether that, in fact, will unspool the parade of horribles that Democrats fear, really remains to be seen.",
