        "So you're talking about community engagement.",
        "But I also want to talk about community policing.",
        "In other words, foot patrols.",
        "Many people that we've spoken to say that this is lacking.",
        "You know, cops just drive into communities.",
        "They jump out of their cars.",
        "They arrest people.",
        "Then they drive away.",
        "We spoke to one activist named Ray Kelly.",
        "He's with the No Boundaries Coalition for Central West Baltimore (ph).",
        "And this is some of what he told us.",
        "There have been more open dialogue between the police department and residents.",
        "But there's still not a foot patrol or beats being delegated to the officers just yet.",
        "And if it is, it's barely noticeable.",
        "What do you respond to that?",
        "I'll say this - the implementation - the creation, rather, of a community foot patrol academic curriculum is something that I just did in the last year that's never been done here before.",
        "When the last academy class graduated on February 27, I mandated that they spend their first 90 working days exclusively on foot patrol.",
        "They won't see the inside of a police car for over three and a half months.",
        "So we are doing things differently.",
        "Again, if we're going to change this - if we're going to fundamentally change the way we police in Baltimore, it's going to be a journey.",
        "On the issue, though, of how police interact with residents - you know, a lot of people say that there is a systemic problem.",
        "And I bring up, for example, the use of Tasers.",
        "The number of Tasers used by police has tripled to 1,700.",
        "But policies - specific guidelines for how police should use them have not kept up.",
        "What changes are you pursuing in that regard?",
        "That treaty has huge flaws, as North Korea has shown and as Iran is in the process of showing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that's not a correct statement.",
        "I was named interim police commissioner back in July of 2015.",
        "And one of the first policies that I looked at was the Taser policy.",
        "And I changed it in August of 2015, just over a month after being into office.",
        "And specifically, the use of a Taser in Baltimore was too broadly interpreted.",
        "Officers were allowed to use a Taser when they felt it was quote, \"\"reasonable and necessary,\"\" unquote.",
        "That just wasn't specific enough.",
        "So I changed that to reflect, or mandate, rather, that police officers will only deploy their Tasers when they are in the midst of dealing with a person who's exhibiting active aggression."

        "I think in the city of 623,000, the number of folks in the city who are responsible for the violence is very, very small.",
        "So that's why our policing strategies and philosophies really are more laser-focused on the gun-carrying bad guys that were repeat offenders - those are the people that we are going after.",

        "So I'm not into grading myself, but I'll grade the men and women of the Baltimore Police Department.",
        "And I'll give them an A-plus.",
        "And that A-plus is for the emotional trauma that visited this city to include Baltimore's police department.",

        "And the biggest thing is that people would send me pictures of their scars with every single one, so I saw a huge degree of scars that are completely healed up where the pinkish tone has faded away.",
        "And then majority of them were ones that were pretty recent to where it's really pink in complexion, and they can't be tattooed in that case.",

        "And it depends on the person.",
