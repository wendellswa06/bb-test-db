        "It doesn't change my mind because I'm looking to still be able to get facts, but it was the same thing that I stated before.",

        "I've had the opportunity to be able to go through decades of history related to him.",
        "And then this accusation came in.",
        "So the important thing for me to be able to hear was to be able to hear Dr. Ford, to be able to hear Brett Kavanaugh, to be able to get two entirely different perspectives on it.",

        "And that's the challenge for me, are the individuals that Dr. Ford had said they were also there, and they can also testify to this.",
        "All of them instead came out and said, we don't remember anything like that.",
        "So while I don't have any reason to doubt that Dr. Ford had something happen to her, I can't piece together that it was actually Brett Kavanaugh, the one that was actually there.",
        "What would the FBI have to find to change your mind about Kavanaugh's fitness to serve on the Supreme Court?",
        "Well, the FBI's going to go back and do interviews.",
        "And this is the hard part about this.",
        "The FBI process is interviewing all the same people that the committee staff has already interviewed to be able to come through.",
        "So they're going have to find something different than what we have already seen, which I think is very unlikely because the FBI is not doing a full-on criminal investigation, not going through DNA and going through sites.",
        "Well, then, if you think it's unlikely that the investigation will turn up anything worthwhile, what's the point of the investigation?",
        "Is this just a gesture and - a hollow gesture?",

        "In fact, I have never seen my own nephews for almost 15, 17 years - and they are absolutely fascinating (unintelligible) and yesterday was a most beautiful, you know, day to spend, you see, to, you know, celebrate this absolutely fascinating feast.",
        "I mean Thanksgiving is a very sacred day and I know how much it means to the American people.",
