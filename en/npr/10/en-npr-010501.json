        "Later in the program, that full-of-herself college girl from \"\"A Different World\"\" joins us, actor, director, writer Jasmine Guy, but first, Google's digital library.",

        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And the legal issues here are significant, and we'll get to those in a minute, but does anybody doubt the Internet will eventually house all or virtually all of the books ever printed?",
        "Well, I think there's no doubt that books are going online, just the way music and other media have.",
        "But I think, you know, we don't - we're seeing how that will play out and who will control that, and you know, I think libraries and bookstores are going to be around, but clearly people are spending more time on the Internet.",
        "There are so many benefits to accessing all these works over the Internet.",
        "Books are going online.",
        "And what does all this massive digitizing mean for you and me?",
        "Well, I think it means we're going to be able to find a variety of books that, you know, we couldn't track down at the local book store or the library by just going on the Web.",
        "It could also mean that books become cheaper because they're easier to access.",
        "This is all playing out.",
        "We don't know how - what these services will look like at the moment.",
        "But you know, the benefits that Google and others talk about are greater distribution and lower cost.",
        "And how all of this is going to work out is being worked on in part by a federal judge.",
        "This case is in court, to nobody's great surprise, but for those of us who are not copyright lawyers, what is going on here?",
        "Well, last October, Google, which was sued by authors and publishers for scanning books off library shelves, reached a settlement with those authors and publishers.",
        "And that deal last October said that Google could get the rights to all the books they scanned off library shelves, which are largely out-of-print books, and that Google could create new services to distribute these books, sell these books, sell advertising against these books and then share back the revenue it earned with authors and publishers.",
        "So that settlement was announced between the parties, but it's going before a judge in federal court in New York that has to review it, that basically has to approve it, and what we've seen over the past couple of months is a wide variety of criticism of the settlement.",
        "Companies that are competitors to Google were raising concerns, privacy advocates, copyright lawyers - everyone now has weighed in with the court, raised some objections - there are a number of supporters, as well.",
        "And now it's all before the judge, which, sometime in October, is going to hold a hearing and decide whether to approve the settlement or not.",
        "And likely not to be quite resolved in that one hearing, if experience with the courts is any experience, but I guess eventually it will be settled by the federal courts.",
        "And given - if this settlement is eventually given the green light, what is that going to mean?",
        "Obviously, it depends on what kind of settlement is agreed to, but what is it going to mean for Google and its competitors?"
