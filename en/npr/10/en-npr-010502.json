        "Ambassador Burt, is this a valid argument?",
        "Well, I really don't think it is.",
        "First of all, the language in the preamble is very well-known to me because it's the same language that was in the preamble of the treaty that I negotiated in the early '90s.",
        "Actually, the origins of that language are from a meeting that took place way back in the mid-1980s between Foreign Minister Gromyko and Secretary of State George Shultz.",
        "And you remember at that time, the Russians were very concerned about President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.",
        "So this is just a continuation of the Russian desire to force us to recognize that there, as the preamble states, a relationship between strategic offense and defense.",
        "Now, I've paid several visits to Moscow over the last three months, and I've talked to people in the foreign ministry.",
        "I've talked to people on the Russian defense staff, as well as their academic community.",
        "They all will candidly recognize that they're not going to get anything more than that preamble language in this agreement.",
        "And they recognize they are not, during the course of this treaty, going to be able to in any way constrain our options in that area.",
        "That's why they're emphasizing the notion of somehow cooperating with us like they did last weekend at NATO, at the NATO summit, rather than throw down the gauntlet.",
        "I doubt very, very seriously that if we engage in any upgrading, any augmentation of our existing ballistic missile defense capabilities, that the Russians will walk out of this treaty.",
        "Now, does that mean they won't raise it in a follow-on negotiation?",
        "Of course they will.",
        "That will continue to be an issue of interest to them.",
        "But I think you can't really argue, I think, convincingly, that this agreement in any way, shape or form constrains our options.",
        "Well, we'll give Director Woolsey a chance to argue..."

        "This kind of language had no particularly effect in the START treaty that Rick negotiated because we had the ABM treaty at the time, and the ABM treaty was what was controlling thing.",
        "And we had a dispute about broad versus narrow interpretation of it and so forth.",
        "That was where the effort was.",
        "The problem is that the Iranians have now launched two satellites.",
        "The Leon Panetta said last summer that they could well have a ballistic missile with a nuclear weapon on it within two years.",
        "And DIA's estimates are that by 2015, they could have an intercontinental ballistic missile.",
        "Thank you very much for having me.",
        "Because of the changes the administration made, we're weaker with respect to protecting the United States, even though they made some improvements in our ability to protect southern Europe.",
        "And these changes, that need to be reversed if we're going to do a decent job of protecting ourselves against Iran, are going to get jammed up with Russian objections to our doing things like boost phase intercept and the rest.",

        "Go ahead, please.",
        "Well, my question is this: We have a recently negotiated START treaty that obviously is the subject of debate here.",
        "But we also have new information that we're planning on going ahead with a missile defense shield for the NATO countries, of which Russia is not a fan.",
        "What's going to keep Russia at the negotiating table in the future if their belief is that we can't ratify any sort of treaty in the setting of a bipartisan Congress?",
        "James Woolsey, that's a point that Ambassador Burt made earlier."

        "I just think it's flat wrong.",
        "I think that putting this off until January, when the new Senate would be able to look at it and ascertain what the administration is going to do with respect to developing a (unintelligible) boost phase intercept, with respect to being able to protect against an Iranian threat much better than they can now, I think if that gets clarified in an appropriate way, the Obama administration would not have substantial difficulty in getting this approved by the Senate.",
        "The problem is they're stalling on that.",
        "That is what is causing a number of the Republicans to be very worried about what they're doing.",

        "First, to repeat, there is nothing in this treaty that restricts American options in developing and deploying strategic defenses.",
        "Secondly, the Russians appear, I believe, to be moving in our direction on this issue.",
        "The fact that Dmitry Medvedev attended the NATO Russia council meeting this weekend, the fact that the Russians are prepared to consider cooperating with the NATO plan on strategic defense is a very, very positive sign.",
        "I think it would be a huge mistake for any member of the Senate to begin trying to negotiate let's call them loopholes on systems that haven't been studied, on capabilities whose requirements have not yet been defined, when there are no restrictions on us in the treaty.",
