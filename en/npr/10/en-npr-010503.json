        "I think we're just politically making it easier for the Iranians, the North Koreans and others if we can't negotiate arms control agreements.",
        "If they can't be ratified, we're simply highlighting what many people will say is the hypocrisy of American foreign policy: On the one hand pressing other countries not to acquire or grow their nuclear arsenals while at the same time we're somehow unwilling to do that.",
        "We should bear in mind the United States and Russia presently possess over 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons.",

        "However, our stance towards Iran seems to be different; that, it seems once again, that we our only source of security security can only be attained with Iran through continued superiority, technologically, rather than negotiation and reduction.",

        "I think that we have now delayed at least the protection of the East Coast of the United States, most of it to 2020 by the Obama administration decisions last year.",
        "And with respect to something like a Scud missile, a simple ballistic missile, on something like a fishing boat with a primitive nuclear warhead on it, being able to defend against a threat like that is what was put off by canceling the boost phase and early phase intercept programs, or delaying them seriously, that the administration did a year and a half ago.",
        "It's not a question of the size of an Iranian arsenal.",
        "It's a question of whether Ahmadinejad is deterrable the way, say, the old Soviet Union was or whether he is enough of a fanatic that he might do something crazy.",

        "I don't think Ahmadinejad is suicidal, whatever qualities you want to give him.",
        "And I believe M.A.D.",
