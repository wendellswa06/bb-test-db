        "If the Republicans would support anything, you know, it might he might be able to take their argument a little more seriously but since they vilify every decision made by this administration, it's really hard to take any of that seriously, especially if we're supposed to be afraid of a nuclear attack from Iran.",

        "Well, I think it is largely because in the past, these arms treaties have essentially been debates within the American foreign policy and national security establishment.",

        "I have the feeling that this time it's more a reflection of the broader politics going on in Washington.",

        "But that's happened before, so I'm not surprised about that.",
        "What I worry about here - and I'm not going to also - I don't think the Obama administration did a very good job after this treaty was signed to get up on the Hill, make the case and not find itself in a position where it has to get ratification in the lame-duck session.",
        "I think that's an awkward situation to be in.",
        "So all of that said though, it's so difficult now for Republicans and Democrats to agree on just about anything, and with 2012 looming and...",

        "If the Senate is convinced, the new Senate coming in, that the Obama administration is seriously looking after the country's interest with respect to nuclear programs, and that involves modernizing the laboratory establishment, 10 laboratory directors, former ones who have written in saying that they have made bad decisions on that.",
        "And it involves going back to instituting some of these ballistic missile programs, which are far more than things that people haven't studied.",

        "So we've got to make some very tough decisions here, but I don't think it's impossible to get the treaty ratified, but it is I think impossible to get it ratified with it being given - with the Republicans being given the back of their hand - of the administration's hand.",
