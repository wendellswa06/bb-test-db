        "A library has a collection that is carefully selected, organized, catalogued and presented for easy use.",
        "Whether digital or virtual, it is staffed by professional librarians who know the collection and can help users find the information they need.",
        "Google books is more like a heap of books on the floor.",
        "Many of those books, particularly the newer ones and the ones that were not purchased legitimately, are not complete.",
        "This is not a library.",
        "Yes, I am a librarian, though I work in private practice and not in a public library.",

        "Books will become more and more precious and collectible.",
        "My work is secure.",
        "On the other hand, the information will be free.",
        "Well, free to view, maybe.",
        "You may have to pay to buy it.",
        "Fred Von Lohmann, let me ask you.",
        "You say Google could establish a virtual monopoly here, no pun intended there.",
        "Could Google itself do something to spur a more competitive marketplace?",
        "Yes, I think Google could do some things, and in fact, they have taken a few steps in the face of all of this criticism.",
        "They have made efforts to make some changes.",
        "And in fact, just last week, in testifying before Congress, Google's representatives said that they would be willing to let other companies, like Amazon, for example, be a reseller for some of the books they have.",
        "And so that's a step in the right direction, but we're still left with this problem that as to the books whose owners can't be tracked down or who aren't interested in answering the junk mail that gets sent to them, for those books, largely out-of-print books, those will be Google's to scan, and anyone else who does it will face a copyright lawsuit.",
        "And so that's something that we need to level that playing field, and it's not entirely clear to me Google could even fix it by themselves.",
        "And on the privacy issue, has Google given you any assurances that they will not turn over records of who's been looking at books on marijuana policy or terrorism?",
        "Well, Google has again, just on the eve of all of these objections being filed, posted a privacy policy for this new product, and I'd encourage the listeners to take a look for themselves.",
        "It does take some steps in the right direction, but it doesn't really commit Google to protect user privacy the way we think they should."

        "And secondly, we think Google should really insist on getting a warrant before they hand over this kind of personal reading information.",

        "And it was interesting that the caller mentioned Elsevier, which is a very large company, which controls a lot of electronic databases.",
        "And many universities, for example, already complain that Elsevier has such a powerful position having exclusive access to some of these journals that they are already feeling the pinch of price gouging at the hands of Elsevier.",
        "And those same university libraries are saying some of the same things with respect to Google, a fear that if there is this one library in the hands of Google that ultimately, price gouging may be a real problem for the university community."

        "And the people I know are not so much concerned that Google is doing this but the way in which it is being done.",
        "The assumption is being made by Google that they have the right to publish whatever they choose, and the author is left with the burden of proof as to whether it is copyrighted or in print.",
        "And if we cannot prove it to Google's satisfaction - not to the law's satisfaction, but to Google's satisfaction -Google is essentially saying it's all right for them to steal our work.",

        "So one of the important elements of the settlement that I think it's important for rights holders to understand is how much it builds in ways for the rights holder to come forward and tell Google exactly what to do or not do with the book.",
        "There's, you know, not only obviously can they opt out of the settlement and just not be part of this, but even with the settlement finalized, rights holders can come forward and say don't show my book at all.",
        "Or you can show it, but you have to charge the following price, or any number of very granular controls.",
        "So the idea is actually that going forward, the rights holders continue to exercise the same kind of control they have now, but unlike now, the authors of out-of-print books, like Katrina's grandfather, with his book from the '70s on alcoholism, will have a means to distribute it.",
        "So the books are actually getting out there, and they have readers, and people have access to them.",
        "Sara, does that…?",

        "Go ahead."

        "If someone wants to sell something that I have produced, why don't they have to come to me?",
        "So this is something - the settlement was worked out over a couple of years of very zealous, arm's-length negotiations with the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild, who were representing absent authors and publishers.",
        "And this is actually the set-up that was bargained for as a very beneficial outcome for rights holders, you know, precisely because it does start the revenues coming and set up the Book Rights Registry, which is a new, totally independent entity, you know, controlled by authors and publishers that has the mandate to go find the rights holders and to give them their money and to show them how to exercise that control.",
        "And yet most authors are not in the Authors Guild.",
        "The Authors Guild represents only a small fraction of authors in America, let alone in the rest of the world.",
        "Right, of course, but the Book Rights Registry is seeking out all authors, anyone who's a member of the class.",
        "And Fred Von Lohmann, just to bring you back in, there are other writers' groups who are part of the case that's going to be heard in federal court, as I understand it.",
        "That's absolutely right, and in fact, a large number of foreign publishers have stepped in to complain that they didn't fully understand the settlement, it may not have been translated into all of the languages that their various constituents might speak.",
        "So there is definitely some concern in the author community that this - ironically, part of it is directed at Google, but part of the concern is directed at the balance of power between authors and their publishers, a subject that there has been a lot of debate between those two communities about who should get the rights to online publication.",
