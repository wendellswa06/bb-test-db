        "Sure.",
        "I'm a editor at a small, I guess, you could say boutique press -Flatmancrooked in northern California.",
        "And when we go to book conferences or book fairs, the conversation that we always have and the opposition that always stands out is the opposition of really large publishers to this digitization and the support by small publishers.",
        "What we tend to do is we're trying to make this movement towards creating books that are, again, art objects which is something that the Internet can never do.",
        "And the idea of these large publishers losing money because they're not able to sell these massive quantities of cheaply printed books because they're being replaced by the Internet is really a non-issue for the small publishers, who, for years have been looking at doing things that are closer to works of art, small quantity and, typically authors that don't have a big-enough readership anyway.",
        "So, anytime that we can get a bigger readership for our authors, it's always a good thing.",
        "All right, Elijah.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "I appreciate that.",
        "And Daphne Keller, just to clarify for people, I mean, the new Dan Brown, that's not one of the books that you scanned in?",
        "It - that would not be.",
        "It's very likely that new commercial books like that might come into Book Search through the partner program which is actually separate and not part of the lawsuit.",
        "If you've looked at the Google Books product and you've seen more than a tiny snippet of a page, if you've seen a full page of a book, that means either it's in the public domain, or in the case of a very popular work like that, that we got it under a license from a publisher through our partner program.",
        "And, actually, you should know that the same people who sued us for scanning and showing these small snippets of books from libraries are also our publishers on - or, sorry, our partners on the other side of the house.",
        "So, we have a very active relationship working with rights holders on the one side.",
        "Here's an email from Phillip(ph).",
        "I am writing a long academic work, and Googling of books has made it so much easier to access in a hurry and without having to wait for interlibrary loan rare books.",
        "My concern is long term.",
        "If putting books online drives down the cost of books, what will happen to the publishing of academic books which typically have a smaller audience and a higher per unit cost?",
        "Well, I would think that this is actually a huge upside for the publishing of academic books because it gets the books out there with cheaper distribution so that academic authors, you know, again, like Katrina's grandfather are able to find the audience that they're looking for.",
        "Something that we've heard from a lot of academic authors is that they're not necessarily looking to make a lot of money from their books.",
        "What's most important is to find a readership and get their ideas out there.",
        "And so, the settlement lets them set the price at zero if they want.",
        "It lets them maximize their distribution.",
        "It will also let them do things like put a creative comments license on their work so that further distribution is made possible under terms that they control.",
        "Just to be clear, if Katrina's family has - she told us - they declined payment, then the book would be free to the public who might want to download it or would there still be a charge?",
        "Up next, Jasmime Guy - yes, Whitley Gilbert to many of you.",
        "She's left \"\"A Different World\"\" behind and continues to act, direct, dance, and write.",
        "Her next project, a tribute to Langston Hughes.",

        "Okra was on the wrong side of history.",
        "The rejection of such items of Negro food as okra or chitlins could only drive those foods underground.",
        "Like the so-called funk of black music, the slime of okra was a little bit defiant and a little bit shameful.",
        "But unlike the music, okra did not cross over.",
        "No surprise that okra's adoption by white America was limited to poor, rural folks.",
        "And poor families, black and white, often shed okra as they rose in status or moved to the city.",
        "But okra is coming back.",
        "The strongest force behind okra's revival is immigration.",
        "Like it or not, that African sauce gumbo has come to America.",
