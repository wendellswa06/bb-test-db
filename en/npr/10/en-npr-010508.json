        "She's a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "From Spotland Productions in Nashville, Tennessee, Jeff Obafemi Carr.",

        "I thank you all for joining us.",
        "Greatly appreciate it.",
        "We want to get right into this question of what many people are joking about, there goes the neighborhood.",
        "We just talked about the shrinking middle class.",
        "And, Mary, your friend, President Clinton, is being blamed by some residents in Harlem for making that area now unaffordable, that they are seeing skyrocketing property prices and the like since he's moved in.",
        "The reality is while that may be the case to some degree, we are seeing areas like Harlem being gentrified, as people like to say, taken over, and those who've been long-term residents are now finding it almost impossible to live in these areas.",
        "Well, I guess it is true that no good deed goes unpunished, because the big guy, President Clinton, moved into the neighborhood because he thought that that would show his appreciation and help to revitalize the neighborhood and he loves to be around black people.",
        "So for all of those reasons - and good restaurants where you can eat soul food or whatever.",
        "And for all of those reasons, he moved into the neighborhood and it was great.",
        "And everybody was excited.",
        "I remember when he first did it.",
        "But people weren't thinking about what was going to happen to prices.",
        "And so I think that it probably is a two-edged sword.",
        "Some people are benefiting from the rise in prices, but a lot are being moved aside like they are in other neighborhoods in cities all around this country where gentrification is going on.",
        "And so I guess Bill Clinton was wise to do what he did when he was asked - was to have no comment.",
        "Ed, I want to correct something.",
        "First of all, Bill Clinton did not choose to move into Harlem as a first option.",
        "Remember the Manhattan office space that he wanted was far too expensive.",
        "Congress, the Republican-led Congress, objected and Harlem was a second option.",
        "I think that's a critical point.",
        "I think the problem with this issue that African-Americans are going to have to deal with, and that is we cannot on one hand demand development, demand stores, restaurants, say well, we want the same amenities that you receive in other communities, but then when the prices go up, then say, well, they shouldn't go up.",
        "I mean this is still America.",
        "It is still capitalism.",
        "There is a reason when prices are depressed when they are down because there are things that are not there.",
        "People who own businesses, they tend to build in places based upon homeowners not necessarily renters."

        "That caused the property taxes to then go up and then people said, I can't even afford to pay my property taxes.",
        "It is a dilemma because we're saying we want a resurgence in cities, but then, at the same time, we don't want prices to go up.",
        "And so you've got to achieve some kind of balance.",
        "As to how to achieve it, I really don't know because, again, this is capitalism; this is what it does.",

        "So we...",
        "And why was that, Jeff?",
        "Well, it was because, to be honest, there weren't many white people coming into Harlem and there weren't businesses there.",
        "That was before the Old Navy store got there.",
        "It was before the Clintrification.",
        "It was before all of that.",

        "I think that since Clinton moved to Harlem and these prices have gone up as a second option, what he should now do is move to the Bronx.",

        "I may suggest that to him.",

        "And with the growing relocation of all of these inner city entertainment venues, downtown revitalization efforts in major cities, rising gas prices, property inside the city loop is going blindingly fast and Clinton may have been a visionary.",
        "One could argue that he knew it was coming and was just in the first wave.",
        "Roland, what of the idea that people argued that there should be some kind of preservation for areas like Harlem for African-Americans or other minorities who have a particular historical investment to a particular area.",
        "Well, if you establish that then you could say the exact same thing for Italian enclaves and white and Polish and others.",
        "And so how you make that standard - basically what that also says is that we want a protected black place here in America where you can have prices that are low.",
        "The issue here is not necessarily just a matter of prices going up.",
        "Because, again, you can't on one hand ask for development and you can't ask then for low crime, you can't ask for all of those things that come with that but then you say, I don't want prices to go up."

        "They reserve a certain number of those for average income, low - not low income, hardly - but the average-income to middle-income people.",
        "But if you're building a 50-unit tower, most of the time when we talk about a relationship with government, if you say three to five of those units out of 50 units for somebody that's of average income, you still achieve the same effect of locking most people out of their economic opportunity in the new neighborhood.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's move on to another quandary, if you will, and that's what many schools are finding themselves in.",
        "And that is as the United States grows and browns - as we like to call it in the media - we're finding that schools are having to determine whether or not they're going to acknowledge and give days off for more than just Christian and Jewish holidays.",
        "It's interesting, Jeff, because this is something that I've often thought about and now we're seeing it come to fruition.",
        "The idea that Muslims or Buddhists, Hindus and others want their holidays recognized, yet you've got to send kids to school.",

        "And you have to, in a pluralistic society, respect people.",
        "Now where do you draw that line of respect, where do you say one person's religion is more legitimate.",
        "Where do the Christians, Muslims fall in when you take them and juxtapose their religious beliefs and their holy days, so to speak - the origin of the word holidays - and you juxtapose that with the Hindu or the Buddhists or the people who practice Ciphau(ph) or Santeria or any number of other religions that are out here that claim there's much legitimacy in the way they raise their kids and teach them their spiritual perspective.",
        "I think that - personally, I think giving people a certain number of days as days that would be excused absences and allowing people to work that out amongst themselves would be the best option for this, as opposed to trying to litter the calendar with holidays one way or the other.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "We're finding that in some regions, Mary - pick up on your point -we're finding that in some regions, but we're also finding some areas where there is a louder cry for the extended holiday to be recognized, for the entire school to have to have to take off."
