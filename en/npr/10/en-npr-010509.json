        "No. I think the best solution to it is to let everyone pick their own set of religious holidays voluntarily or work it out practically with the school system.",
        "For example, we may have to recognize that the Muslim religion is the fastest growing religion in the United States.",
        "And there are more and more children who are in school systems.",
        "And so it doesn't make any sense to privilege one.",
        "I happen to be a Christian, but that doesn't mean that I should be privileged over - my children should be privileged over other people's kids.",
        "And so, therefore, I think that the best way to handle it, and as somebody who teaches, practically if at the - you know, figure out which holidays people have to take off for religious observance, work around it, and let everyone choose.",
        "That's about the only thing you can do.",
        "Otherwise, you have to just not let anybody be off for any holiday, which I think is unacceptable.",
        "Well, Roland, obviously when these days off started, the vast majority of people going to these schools were Christians.",
        "Then we saw the Jewish holidays being given, calendar days off for schools.",
        "Yet we are starting to hear, even in communities where there may be a disproportionate amount of another religion versus the Jewish religion, clamors and concerns and complaints about the idea that if a Jewish religion is given a calendar day off in school, then these other religions should be.",
        "Well, I think the people who want to criticize one religion but then protect theirs should frankly shut up; even, especially, those who are Christians, because I find that to be completely ignorant.",
        "You can't say well, what's good for me is not good for you.",
        "If you're going to designate religious holidays, this is what is going to happen.",
        "You're going to open Pandora's Box; you're going to have to deal with other religions.",
        "And so it can't be, well, what's the threshold, or does it have to be 20 percent?",
        "No. Once you begin to go down that line, this is what you're going to have to face.",
        "I mean, as Jeff stated, if it is on an individual basis, that is a different story than saying we're gong to give the entire school off because of that.",
        "I mean, you know, I remember there were Jewish students in my high school - very few of them - who were off certain days because of their holidays, but it was a 90 percent black high school.",
        "Well, what do you do there?",
        "Again, I think an individual basis makes a lot of sense as opposed to - because once you start talking about four or five different religions and then the while school being off, I mean, you're right, when the heck are they learning?",
        "All right.",
        "Let's turn our attention very quickly to something we found interesting.",
        "And this is from businessweek.com.",
        "They gave out awards for Hollywood's biggest earners, and the award essentially talked about the person who enjoys the highest return on investment for their movies, paying back the Hollywood studios that usually pay the freight up front.",

        "Not Tom Hanks.",
        "Not Johnny Depp.",
        "But Tyler Perry was first and foremost among those in Hollywood.",
        "Interesting here, Jeff, because Hollywood is such a trend city that one would believe the trend of Tyler Perry making huge dollars would bring a spate of black movies to the big screen, but we're not seeing that necessarily."

        "They're -you're tied to one individual based upon a celebrity or a personality, and then you hope people will show up because it's Denzel.",
        "But remember, Denzel has had bombs.",
        "Beyonce has had bombs.",
        "And so this is a different kind of thing.",
        "Plus, his costs are lower because he writes it, he directs it, he produces it.",

        "And there is a great audience for that demand, wear a dress, tell - crack the jokes, do the whatever, all of that.",
