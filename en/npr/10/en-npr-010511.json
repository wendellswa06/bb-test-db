        "Today, Israel's foreign minister said the use of the identities of foreign-born Israelis did not prove that Mossad assassinated Mabhouh.",
        "A former high-ranking Mossad official told Israeli Army Radio it was unlikely to be Mossad because of the apparent mistakes that were made.",
        "Almost all of the alleged hit squad were, for instance, videotaped quite clearly by video cameras.",

        "Claire Spencer is head of the Middle East program at London think-tank Chatham House.",
        "Mabhouh was targeted because he was the intermediary who arranged arms deals, if you like, and arms deliveries for Hamas in Gaza.",
        "So, obviously, there are clearly a number of people both within the Fatah camp with the Palestinians and in Israel who'd be keen to put his operation out of operation.",
        "It does certainly intensify - if I can put it like this - the lack of trust on both sides, but also with - I think more seriously - within the Palestinian side.",
        "And as if that was not all complex enough, a Jordanian government spokesman told the Associated Press that Jordan turned over two Palestinians linked to the case to Dubai authorities several days ago.",

        "Way back in 1882, Mike Callahan learned a difficult lesson about oil shale.",
        "He built a log cabin on the banks of Parachute Creek, and for the fireplace…",
        "He used some rocks that he found abundantly in the area, these dark brown rocks that they quarried really nicely.",
        "They broke nice and straight and flat.",
        "That's Jason Hanson with the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.",
        "And what Callahan didn't know is that in the tiny pores of that rock was a hard substance called kerogen and when it's heated to about 650 degrees it converts to oil and gas.",

        "We firmly believe that oil shale is a cruel hoax.",

        "He's pleased the Obama administration recently withdrew research leases that were put out for bid as President Bush was leaving office.",
        "Those leases were so large they looked suspiciously like they were intended for commercial development instead of just research.",

        "So when you look at this route from North Africa to Italy, and you combine the political instability in the departure countries with the more dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean with the more rickety boats that people are using on this route, is there any reason to believe that things won't just get worse all summer long?",
        "I mean, I think that the figures of the last week suggest that those numbers will increase over the summer.",
        "We're also starting to see numbers departing from Egypt and making an even-longer crossing towards the Italian coast, which is a new dynamic that should be taken into account.",

        "The drivers that have been impelling people towards Europe are not receding, so there will have to be, I think, some serious consideration about what the long-term prospects are for managing migration flows to the European Union and some extremely hard decisions, I think, facing European politicians.",

        "Well, not surprisingly, the 28 member states have committed to fighting terrorism, and each one of them knows what they need to do and that it needs to be done quickly given, you know, the frequency of these attacks these days.",
        "For example, by April, the plan is to adopt a directive to share airline passenger records between European countries.",

        "But the problem is they've pledged to coordinate before many times, including after the Paris attacks, and then there's slow follow-up.",

        "How would you describe the mood of the ministers there in Brussels?",
        "Well, there certainly was a lot of frustration, as you heard, in the commissioner's voice.",
        "They - it wasn't a very happy meeting to begin with.",
        "I mean, clearly this was something that was called very quickly because of these attacks, so there was a lot of sympathy expressed for the Belgians and expressions of solidarity with their fellow ministers.",
        "And there was a lot of fear about whether other European capitals will be next.",
        "But definitely dominating was the frustration.",
        "A number of the ministers were going into the meeting expressing that frustration.",
        "The German interior minister tried to be polite, said he didn't want to criticize his neighbors but that member states need to accept that the only way that they're going to win this war on terror is to work jointly and pool intelligence that's gathered.",
        "But what are some the differences here?",
        "I mean, when you look at these EU member states, are some countries actually better at sharing intelligence information than others?",
        "Certainly that's the case.",
        "The Austrian interior minister, for example, noted that the bloc's so-called jihadist databank - that in this databank, 90 percent of the information was being provided by five countries.",
        "And you have to remember that there are 28 countries in the European Union.",
        "And amazingly enough, one of the countries that's noted for not being so cooperative is Belgium.",
        "But that also may have to do more with the fragmented makeup of the society - you know, the fact that their - you have people here who speak so many different languages rather than some sort of intentional refusal to cooperate.",

        "When you compare that to all of New York City, which has 8.4 million people, there is one police force there."
