        "Well, it was very interesting today.",
        "His defense attorney delayed or adjourned a meeting that was going to decide whether he would be held another month in custody in Belgium and said Abdeslam has decided not to fight extradition, that he wants to go back to France, his native country and explain himself to authorities.",

        "And it was really little things.",
        "Like, I remember really not liking the way she laughed, and that was sort of the \"\"in\"\" that I took to bully her.",
        "I started ganging up on her with other girls to make fun of her, and it all I remember looking back at it and realizing how suddenly it had flipped, and for no apparent reason.",
        "After I started avoiding her and making fun of her, I joined a clique of another - girls who were more popular.",
        "And the next year she transferred schools and honestly, I don't know if that was why she transferred schools.",

        "You know, what if it's something that she's dealt with and moved past to the point where we can be friends now?",

        "Well, I think one of the things that's the most confusing is what you hear with the caller, which is that it just happens.",
        "Or one of the things I think is most surprising, especially for the parents' point of view, is that bullies often think they're in the right.",
        "It's the way the caller described, or it's this person was really annoying me and so it just got under my skin, or they did something to me, so I have to do something back to them.",
        "Now, I work with thousands and thousands of boys and girls, and very rarely, like very rarely, does a bully say, oh, absolutely, I was completely I just did it for absolutely no reason, especially in the moment when you're doing this."

        "So when we heard from the school that they didn't catch it on the camera, well, one of the things that's really a problem for the targets is it's almost as if, if the authorities don't see it be it parents, coaches, whatever then it doesn't exist.",
