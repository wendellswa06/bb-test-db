        "And let me say, I think that you saw in both calls, both psychologists said it's your greatest gift, these experiences, your greatest gift and your greatest liability, that you take it with you into the workplace, and you are able to use it as a touchstone for you don't want it to happen, or it has control over you and that you aren't actually you lose out in the process because you are so, you have not been able to let go - that's the way you dominate other people.",

        "I mean, here's what I think.",
        "I think, you know, to a certain extent - I am certainly not somebody who says, you know, never, ever, ever fight or physically fight.",
        "What I think is, you've got to say to the kids, look, if you fight, one of the annoying things about physically fighting is that the school or the you know, whoever whatever organization you're part of, is not going to really see the arguments, the merit of your argument because they're going to be so focused on blaming you, basically, for fighting.",
        "They're not going to say, well, why?",
        "Why were you in this situation?",
        "The deal was brokered by Egypt and independent Palestinian groups.",
        "It calls for the formation of an interim government that will prepare for parliamentary and presidential elections within a year.",
        "And so the merits of your argument get lost in the process.",
        "So if you actually want to solve the problem in a long-term basis, because you can't really fight your way, physically fight your way through all of these kinds of experiences.",
        "I'm not going to take away from what the dad just said about the with the son, but I just think that we have to put it into the context of, if you want to solve the problem, and you want the other people around you to understand why you're doing what you're doing, then don't wait until you have to fight.",

        "And I found myself getting a little bit more popular, and it was almost immediately that I started bullying myself, that, you know, I had gone for years of torment, I guess you'd say, and immediately I started finding anyone I could find to make fun of - once I found myself in this more popular clique - and try to make them feel bad.",
        "And when I called in, the screener had asked me if I'd ever apologized for that.",
        "And I can picture it so clearly in my mind.",
        "It must've been probably late 10th or 11th grade, you know, once - I guess - I'd established myself as being - not popular by any means, but certainly not where I was in middle school, that I felt so bad about a specific girl.",

        "I think it's a pretty good bet that it meant a lot to her.",

        "It's fluid.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So the way they behave in real life is exactly the way they're going to behave in virtual life.",

        "They don't see it that way.",
        "And so we've got - when kids say, well, that's just normal, that's what we do, I think that's also a reflection of the fluidity between the two.",
        "But adults' responsibility is to say, just because it's normal, i.e. something you see every day, doesn't make it right.",
        "So I'm going to actually be able to say this to you to say, you know what, if you participate in any way with humiliating or demeaning other people - and this includes forwarding, because nobody talks about forwarding as a contributing factor to this, to these dynamics, that forwarding information that's humiliating, or pictures, is just as if you are contributing to the humiliation of other people.",
        "And parents have to be able to hold their kids accountable for that.",
        "I used to be a bully.",
        "But the way I would do it was, I never had to do anything myself.",
        "In middle school, I was rather small, overweight, kind of the kid that you expect to be bullied.",
        "But I was great with social norms, social graces, being able to talk to kids, that I would find the proverbial goon squad.",
        "I would find a couple kids, maybe a little bit slower, ones with bad self-esteem but have ones that were big, strong, muscular, the kind of defensive tackle football player body type, and build up their self-esteem.",
