        "If the agency has a presidentially nominated and Senate confirmed director with its own budget and it is not subject to the authority of some other agency, we'll look very closely at that option.",
        "It can be in another agency, but not under it, says Mierzwinski.",
        "And he says the consumer guardian would have to have authority over all financial products.",
        "But drafts circulating in the Senate suggest it might not have full authority over institutions like payday lenders, who give short-term loans to consumers with effective annual interest rates of 300 percent or more.",
        "That's simply unbelievable that payday lenders, rent-to-own stores, debt collectors and others that are part of the system that really is unfair to consumers in a lot of ways, wouldn't be covered by a new agency, even though no federal regulator covers them now.",
        "Payday lenders have mounted a big campaign in the past few years to protect their business from federal regulation.",
        "Both Democrats and Republicans on the Banking Committee have taken tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from the industry.",
