        "Last week, Israel bombed a clearly marked United Nations compound, killing four UN observers.",
        "During this 19 day old war, there have been numerous other incidents in which the Israeli air force says it targeted Hezbollah but ended up killing women and children.",
        "The rising Lebanese civilian death toll has some analysts questioning the intelligence used in Israeli military planning and targeting in south Lebanon.",

        "But that's why some say they were a bit confused and even disappointed that more 2020 presidential candidates did not show up to talk to them here at Netroots.",
        "Only four candidates came to the annual progressive convention - New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, former Obama Housing Secretary Julian Castro, governor of Washington state Jay Inslee and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.",
        "I was most impressed with Elizabeth Warren because she's been so consistent.",
        "That's Sabiha Basrai from Oakland, Calif.",

        "But most mosquitoes don't live very long in the field anyway.",
        "So, those guys that are two weeks old, those are old mosquitoes.",
        "And it's one of the great ironies of diseases like malaria that most mosquitoes don't live long enough to transmit the disease.",
        "They don't?",
        "No.",
        "So, most mosquitoes have a very hard life in the field.",
        "They have a hard time from predators - spiders, birds, that sort of thing - as well as very difficult environmental conditions and the risk of taking a blood feed on people, where they get slapped and so forth.",
        "So, most mosquitoes actually die pretty fast.",
        "They may die - 10 or 20 percent of them are dead every day.",
        "And so, you don't get too many mosquitoes that live two weeks or more, enough to transmit diseases like dengue or malaria.",
        "So, if you can get those older ones, you've really cut off a large reservoir?",
        "That's right.",
        "So, the idea is that instead of targeting the mosquitoes themselves, what we can do is target the dangerous mosquitoes, and those are the ones that are two weeks or so old."

        "Has anybody ever tried this idea out?",
        "So, there's been no attempt at doing this in the field yet, but there are various techniques being developed in an attempt to take out, disproportionately, the older mosquitoes.",
        "But these are so far working in the laboratory.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And how do you go about infecting a large number of mosquitoes out there in the wild?",
        "Well, so, what Scott O'Neill's group in Queensland has done is to adapt a bacterial line which will kill old mosquitoes.",
        "And they've managed to adapt it to the mosquito which transmits dengue.",
        "The way they have envisaged doing this is that one would infect very large numbers of females with the bacteria in the laboratory and then release those females.",
        "They would mate with wild-type females and spread the bacteria through the mosquito population.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And so, how would you disseminate it to begin with?",
        "Well, that is a bit - that is a technical challenge.",
        "No question of that.",
        "It would take very good mosquito-rearing facilities.",
        "And remember, mosquitoes are only breeding when they are fed blood, so they need a large amount of blood going into an insectary to develop millions of mosquitoes for release.",
        "But technically, that is possible and people have achieved numbers certainly in the hundreds of thousands.",
        "So, it's feasible to do this.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And how does the bacteria spread through the population once you release the infected mosquitoes?",
        "Is it by mating or…?",
        "Yeah, that's the really neat thing about this bacteria.",
        "So, it isn't like a regular disease like we get, like flu or something.",
        "This disease is transmitted from mother to offspring and only from mother to offspring.",
        "So, the tricky thing then is how do you get a disease, which is only transmitted to a mother's offspring, to spread through a population?",
        "And what this bacteria has done which is really neat is to evolve a trick whereby if infected males mate with uninfected females, those uninfected females don't produce any progeny.",
        "So, the infected females always reproduce infected offspring, whereas the infected males stop uninfected females from reproducing at all.",
        "And so, that tips the balance in favor of the bacteria.",
        "So, the bacteria can spread through the population because of its very bad effects on the uninfected females.",
        "How soon before you can try this out?",
        "Well, this is going to be an interesting issue, I think.",
        "The - there are two sides to this.",
        "One is the science, which is the sort of things where we can do more experiments in the laboratory.",
        "And I know Scott O'Neill's group in Queensland is doing some of these to try and work out some of the technical problems.",
        "And then the other side of it is the regulatory issues.",
        "When will it be possible to release mosquitoes infected with the bacteria in the field?",
        "And that's going to be much trickier.",
        "It would be possible in principle to try this experimentally on contained populations in the wild like, for example, on islands.",
        "And there's a lot of talk of that at the moment."
