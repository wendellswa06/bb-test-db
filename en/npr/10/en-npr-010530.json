        "Hey, Ira.",
        "How you doing?",
        "Hi, there.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "I have two questions.",
        "One is - is there a possibility this bacterium could species-hop and cause problems for other organisms?",
        "And my second question is, if we do - if this does work, will this decimate mosquito populations and cause ecosystem collapses?",
        "And I'll take my questions off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "OK.",
        "Yeah, are there unintended consequences?",
        "OK.",
        "Well, on the first issue of the species-hop, it is possible, in principle, that these things could jump into other mosquito species or other insects.",
        "They came originally from fruit flies and it is possible, in principle, that they could do that.",
        "And historically, I mean in evolutionary time, these Wolbachia have jumped around different insect lineages.",
        "They are, nonetheless, very tricky to get into mosquitoes and these jumps to do happen rarely, so it seems to me that's less of an issue.",
        "Now, the question of whether or not they would decimate mosquito populations and lead to ecosystem collapses is a really interesting one.",
        "In fact, because they only kill the old mosquitoes, there's going to be a very large number of mosquitoes still around.",
        "And so, unlike other ways of controlling mosquitoes, like with insecticides for example, where total decimation happens, killing only the old ones actually will have probably very little impact on mosquito populations and, as a result, won't lead, or it shouldn't lead, to any of the sort of theoretical possibilities that your caller's raising there.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "I mentioned before the break about the possibility of a schedule for testing this out.",
        "You talked about the scientific hurdles.",
        "But even more problematic, I guess, would be any of the political or cultural hurdles."

        "That's right.",
        "I think that's true for a very large number of different control measures that people are trying to throw at dengue and malaria now, that using anything which is going to be, you know, rather radical changes to current practice is going to be a difficult issue to get past regulatory authorities.",
        "And I think some of the science that can be done can be done to look at reassuring or looking to get the evidence for or against particular risks factors, like the possibility of species jump and so forth.",
        "But at the end of the day, it's going to have to be done on some sort of semi-natural population - in cages, large cages outdoors - and then eventually on some restricted islands - populations restricted by - in space, perhaps on islands and so forth.",

        "We found it first in Southern California and we watched it spread to Canada within 10 years.",
        "So, I'm a theoretician working on the O'Neill project and have been doing experimental work on this for 20 years.",
        "And you noticed it killing mosquitoes all this time?",
        "We studied in drosiphila simulans, a sister species to drosophila melanogaster, the fly that comes to your rotten bananas in your kitchen."

        "Mm hmm.",
        "I was talking about - with Dr. Read about the possibility of when this might be tried in public.",
        "What are your thoughts on that?",
        "Well, I know - well, I'm working with Scott, so the cages have just been completed in Cairns, these very large field cages.",
        "And those field releases are - the releases into those cages are happening this month.",
        "And where?",
        "It was chosen because the Australian government is also supporting the project as long - as well the Gates foundation, because dengue is becoming increasingly a problem in Queensland.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So, I was just there a month ago, and the day I arrived to work on the design of the experiment in the cage, a dengue outbreak was declared in Cairns.",

        "Because in that situation, you want to know well, if things are going to spread and if they're killing the old mosquitoes, at one point are they going to have a good impact on the disease?",
        "I mean, the question is not can you kill old mosquitoes?",
        "It's can you kill enough of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes to have an impact on population health - human population health?",
        "And that's going to be tricky to demonstrate, because you need a very widespread release in order to make that happen, so that there's enough people around with dengue to see an impact.",
        "That is going to be a big challenge.",
