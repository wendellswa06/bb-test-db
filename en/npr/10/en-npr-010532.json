        "Okay, so that's one thing.",
        "And I think you mentioned two things forcing the war to the forefront for Congress.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "The other thing is, of course, politics.",
        "The House Republican leaders have tried to avoid talking about Iraq through recent months, because there hasn't been much good to say about it, since the elections last winter.",
        "Now, with a shot of good news out of Baghdad last week, they feel this is a good moment for a declaration of support for the President and the troops, and by extension a declaration of support for the war policy itself.",
        "So later this week, probably Thursday, the House is going to debate and vote on a resolution doing just that.",
        "And that, that's going to be a vote of record.",
        "Isn't it?",
        "That's going to be an interesting choice for Democrats.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's more or less the point.",
        "If you're a member who opposes the war, and thinks it was a mistake, and there was an AP poll last week that says about nearly 60% of the country thinks that, your only choice - your only chance to show that opposition will be to vote for immediate withdrawal.",
        "Cut and run.",
        "But if you do that, of course, the argument is going to come right back, well, you're not supporting the troops, and that we have American military forces over there and we've got to help out our guys.",
        "Right?",
        "I mean, this is not an attractive alternative for the Democrats.",
        "Yes.",
        "In fact, what this resolution is about is partly to bolster the President at tough time, but it's also to put the Democrats on the spot, whether they're already in Congress, or whether they're running for Congress as Democrats this fall.",
        "Well, some of them just might take that chance to say okay, I'm against the war.",
        "This could develop.",
        "It is always possible that more of the Democrats will decide that it's time to be four square about opposition to the war rather than trying to find some sort of a moderate position that supports the troops but not necessarily the President's policies.",

        "After 66 years of selfless bravery and heroic action, he spent part of the time frozen in an iceberg, Captain America is no more, at least, for now.",

        "Of course, his real name, his secret identity was Steve Rogers and he was killed as he was being brought into federal court in New York in an effort to force him to reveal that name.",
        "It's a much more complicated story.",
        "But that certainly is the simple version.",
        "I think what people should remember is is that Steve Rogers was this skinny kid, who grew up in the streets of New York, who volunteered for the super soldier program during the war effort, and became Captain America, who became an inspiration to men and women and children to be the best hero that you could be.",
        "It's not known precisely how many of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims are Shia.",
        "The Shia are a minority, comprising between 10 to 15 percent of the Muslim population, certainly fewer than 200 million all told.",
        "The Shia are concentrated in Iran and in southern Iraq and southern Lebanon.",
        "But there are significant Shiite communities in Saudi Arabia and Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and India as well.",

        "There's definitely an emerging struggle between Sunni and Shia to define not only the pattern of local politics, but also the relationship between the Islamic world and the West.",
        "One other factor about the Shiites bears mentioning, according to Yitzhak Nakash, author of the \"\"The Shi'is of Iraq."
