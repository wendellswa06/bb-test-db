        "Number one, a person such as myself who for whom abortion is an issue might be prone not to give to Komen on the basis of that, even though a small amount of it everybody says, a sliver of the Komen money went to Planned Parenthood.",
        "And of Planned Parenthood's screening money, apparently only a sliver of it came from Komen.",
        "So when you listen to Nancy Brinker - and the one thing that she said over and over again last week was that the real reason or the main reason or maybe one of the two reasons that Komen was changing its grant structure or its criteria is because she said that - and just a little transcript, I've watched and re-watched her interview with Andrea Mitchell, and she said our job is to translate cancer therapy into usable types of therapies that can be accessible for most people.",
        "We need to translate care into usable clinical care in the communities.",

        "There was another explanation as well, and that there were new rules that barred any contributions to organizations under investigations, including congressional investigations.",
        "And that seemed to cover - a lot of people said they only covered one group, the Planned Parenthood.",

        "Well, I would have to say most of the media, if not - if the vast majority of media attention last week was on the explanation B, the investigations, and, well, what about asking the second level and the third level of questions about the grant-making procedure and whether Komen was spending its money wisely, whether it was a good steward of its donors' money and continuing the grant-making through Planned Parenthood when Planned Parenthood did some kind of screening - I don't know what that is - and then if somebody needed a mammogram, would refer them on to somebody else for a mammogram.",

        "Abortion is a very, very small percentage of its activity.",
        "As a young college student with no insurance, the only way I ever saw a gynecologist was through Planned Parenthood.",
        "This is a public health service, not an abortion mill.",
        "In fact, Planned Parenthood prevents thousands of abortions every day by providing free birth control.",
        "And they are also a very large provider of abortion.",
        "Well, I would honor Planned Parenthood for its work that it does in so many different areas.",
        "And insofar as what slice of what Planned Parenthood does - I'm looking at a little fact box in my own newspaper, Neal, and it says, abortions make up three percent of its services in 2010.",
        "OK, three percent of its services.",
        "Does that mean of every 100 people walking in, only three got abortions?",
        "I don't know.",
        "And here's another one.",
        "It says Planned Parenthood says abortion services made up less than 15 percent of its annual revenue.",
        "A lot of different ways you can slice it and dice it.",
        "OK.",
        "Let's even stipulate that abortions, perhaps, aren't as numerous as - aren't as numerous as services provided in all different ways.",
        "Why does Planned Parenthood persist in cementing its abortion business so tightly to the other services it provides, and then play the victim when half of the population, the half of the population for whom abortion is a big deal, shudders in disgust at the thought of so many babies being aborted every year?",
        "I don't know why, again, why it needs to tether the abortion part of its business as closely as it does to everything else it does considering the explosiveness of the issue for so many people.",

        "I have two girlfriends who actually have had breast cancer.",
        "One of them passed away this time last year, and the other one has survived it.",
        "And I find the argument that Susan Komen people are putting out very dishonest.",
        "I think that this is just a cover for giving in to right-wing political issues and that if they really care about saving lives, then they're going to spend money on screening, even if Planned Parenthood is the one that's providing the screening.",
        "Planned Parenthood does provide more than abortions.",
        "In fact, there's 50 million Americans that have no health insurance.",
        "Many of those are women.",
        "Many of those are women who have children, and their only place where they can go and get a mammogram, which is life-saving political - life-saving medical procedure is at Planned Parenthood.",
        "And so if the Komen Foundation is really committed to saving women's lives and not committed to getting involved in a political debate, then it will continue to fund organizations like Planned Parenthood and all organizations that provide preventive care for women.",
        "So I'm urging California women, don't send your money to Susan Komen.",
        "I actually did some research on it, and I saw that the CEO makes $500,000 a year, which I think is a huge amount of money.",
