        "Well, people don't get put up by the party, they run because they want to.",
        "In at least two instances, in Ohio and Pennsylvania, there were contested primaries for these seats.",
        "And so it wasn't a matter that somebody came along and tapped Ken Blackwell on the shoulder and said, Ken, we want to put you up for governor.",
        "Ken has been trying for years to get the opportunity to run for governor and actually stepped aside so that Taft could do it some years ago.",
        "And he's got a very long history as somebody who has either been mayor of Cincinnati or a candidate for Congress or an appointed official or an elected statewide official in Ohio.",
        "The same is not true of Lynn Swann.",
        "Lynn Swann has not held any previous political office.",
        "He was an appointee.",
        "He was appointed to head, I think, the president's Commission on Physical Fitness and did that very, very well.",
        "And recently, certainly in the '04 election, was very involved, heavily involved on behalf of President Bush.",
        "And he's somebody who had clearly indicated that he was very interested in running for higher office.",
        "Always tough to start at the top as governor, because that's a tough seat and the question becomes: What background do you have to do it?",
        "Now others have done it before.",
        "Ronald Reagan certainly did in California.",
        "Arnold Schwarzenegger as well.",
        "So it's not impossible that somebody like a Lynn Swann could be governor of Pennsylvania, but he's really drowning by virtue of the money disparity.",
        "Okay.",
        "But, Joe, the party did reach out to Michael Steele.",
        "I mean that has to be said.",
        "He was lieutenant governor; he was well positioned.",
        "Assuming that Robert Ehrlich, as governor, continues to be successful in his bid for reelection, he would have been then well positioned to run for governor.",
        "So he was recruited to run.",
        "Well, he's somebody - before that, he was the state Republican chairman.",
        "So he's somebody who had been involved in politics and clearly wanted to have the opportunity to run at some point.",
        "And he was somebody that was recruited for that Senate seat.",
        "It was an open Senate seat.",
        "He had a Senator stepping down from his long-time held seat, and so it was an open seat.",
        "And he's really running an excellent campaign.",
        "I mean right now we don't yet know what African-American voters in the state will do.",
        "Remember, he's the guy in 2002, when brought onboard as the Republican running mate in that governor's race, helped tip the balance in favor of the Republican and it really changed things in Maryland, which is a heavily, as we know, Democratic state.",
        "Joe, I want to go to a caller in a moment.",
        "But as to Prof. Walters' point, I mean if I could amplify it a bit, the kind of article of faith over the last couple of years is that the Republican party has reached out to black candidates not because they expected black folks to actually vote Republican but in part to appeal to independent white or to progressive whites, and also to change the historical image of the party as being hostile to African-Americans in the post civil rights era.",
        "So that's in part Prof. Walters' point, that it really wasn't about these guys winning; it was really about making a larger point.",
        "Is it your view that that is not true, if indeed it ever was true, that it's no longer true?",
        "That it really is because the party believes in these folks themselves, for themselves, and thinks their chances are viable.",
        "The party believes in them.",
        "Obviously, they have differing chances of being elected in November, but the party believes in them."

        "The party also has been, you're right - everybody's right in saying that there's been a definitive move on the part of the party to reach out to African-American voters and to say to African-American voters: Take a look at the Republican Party and what we stand for; and don't suppose that because you've been Democrat in the past that you necessarily agree with Democrats on all the issues.",
        "If you're somebody who has socially conservative beliefs because of your faith, if you're somebody who has fiscally conservative beliefs because you're in business, you might find that you really are more of a Republican than you are a Democrat, so you ought to look at our candidates.",
        "And these three black Republican candidates are also very different in terms of how they stand on a wide range of issues.",
        "But they really mirror the diversity that exists in the party.",
        "It's a big tent.",
        "Yes, hello.",
        "In looking at the Ohio gubernatorial race as an independent voter, the Republican Party, at least as far as I am sitting here in northeast Ohio, is seen as a party of scandal and corruption.",
        "Ken Blackwell is seen as an extremist, even to many Republicans.",
        "He's the kind of candidate who likes to wear his faith on his sleeve, which appeals to many voters.",
        "But at the same time, he's now running against an ordained Methodist minister.",
        "So he has got - pretty much that is cancelled out.",
        "But Mr. Blackwell is a candidate who just has flawed ideas, and people are seeing right through these ideas.",
        "It has nothing to do, absolutely nothing to do, with his race at all.",
        "And if that comes in to play, I think it's going to be an act of desperation on the Blackwell camp.",
        "But I think that most people in Ohio look at his conflict of interest as secretary of state and as the Ohio chair of the Bush reelection campaign.",
        "In light of all the flaws that happened in Ohio, it's just not seen very favorable by people.",
        "And they see him as very inept.",
        "Leo, thank you for calling.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Joe Watkins, the caller raises an interesting point about the outreach to social conservatives and the role - and I'm interested in your view of whether in part some of these African-Americans, not Ken Blackwell in particular - is their campaign more about social conservatives than reaching out to African-Americans?",
        "What's your take on that?",
        "Well, Ken has been successful certainly in getting a number of socially conservative ministers to come out on his behalf, both white and black ministers to come out on his behalf.",
        "And they've rallied very strongly around him because Ken has been so outspoken in terms of his position on abortion and the state constitutional amendment barring gay marriage.",
        "And so from that standpoint, you have to give Ken Blackwell credit for being a straight shooter.",
        "I mean he says what he thinks.",
        "Whether it's popular or not is what it is.",
        "But he says what he thinks and he's not afraid to shy away from the tougher issues.",
        "And I think that for a lot of Ohio voters that's going to be something that pushes them over the top to support him, because they don't want to hear somebody who says what they want them to say, but they would rather have somebody in office who's a straight shooter."

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "But, Joe Watkins, could you talk to us about whether - I mean the caller also said that he thinks if Ken Blackwell references race, then that would be an act of desperation.",
        "But I have to say that it is an intriguing question.",
        "I mean how race plays a role in these conversations, in Maryland for example.",
        "I mean I think it's fair to say that Michael Steele has picked up support from unusual places.",
        "A very prominent African-American lawyer, Billy Murphy, is supporting him.",
        "A relative of one of the candidates bested in the Democratic primary is supporting Michael Steele in part, they say, because they don't feel that the Democratic Party has taken the black vote seriously and they want to send a message.",
        "So my question to Joe Watkins, and I also would like to hear from the rest of panel, is is ethnicity a part of this?",
        "I mean are these candidates - how do they walk the line on ethnic appeal?",
        "Is being black part of their message?",
        "Well, I think for Ken Blackwell that race is not really something that he wants to hold as a centerpiece of his campaign.",
        "And it really shouldn't make a difference, I think he would say, if he was here to defend himself.",
        "On the part of Michael Steele, I think race in the state of Maryland plays a big role, because African-American Democrats - and not just voters, but leaders, elected officials and the sons of elected officials, such as the son of Kweisi Mfume, who lost in the Democratic primary to Cardin - are saying that they feel that the Democratic Party has been taking them for granted for a long time.",
        "And remember, there's some teeth to this here because this is the same thing that black Democrats in Maryland said in 2002, and that's the reason why so many of them switched and voted for the Republicans in the 2002 governor's race.",
        "So it's very, very possible that a guy like Michael Steele, without making race the centerpiece of his campaign, may benefit from the fact that a lot of black Democrats feel like they've been taken for granted by the party.",
        "Prof.",
        "Ron Walters, do you think that's true?",
        "Well, I think that's certainly true.",
        "I think that when you go back to the 2002 race in Baltimore you had a very prominent black politician, Clarence Mitchell IV, actually come out for Bob Ehrlich.",
        "And of course Bob Ehrlich got 45,000 votes out of Prince George's County, which is very unusual.",
        "So there was some alienation there.",
        "And just a point of clarification that Prince George's County is a majority black jurisdiction in Maryland; very middle class, very affluent, high degree of education."

        "Absolutely.",
        "A majority blacks.",
        "It is the most affluent black county in the country and predominately black.",
        "And so that was really very significant for him to get that many votes out of Prince George's County.",
        "I think that, yes, when you look at the situation in Ohio or Pennsylvania, it is pretty much the same thing because you're talking about Republicans trying to make an appeal on the basis of race, hoping to build some sort of a base.",
        "In the 2004 election, what you've got here is there were a significant number of black churches that came out and voted for the president, and that was a very critical base to his carrying Ohio.",
        "So there's no question in my mind that when one looks at the faith-based programs, and there is a political line which runs down through them which appeals to the churches and to some of the ministers there, that some of the black churches - the more conservative and angelical black churches - have played a political role in the Republican Party.",
        "I agree with Joe completely.",
        "On this fact, though, I don't think that Ken Blackwell in Ohio is running on race.",
        "He's a conservative.",
        "He's been elected statewide.",
        "I think if he loses - and I think he will lose - it's not because of race either.",
        "Because there's scandals in the Republican Party in Ohio and they've had 16 years of rule, which people are tired of.",
        "In Pennsylvania, I'm not convinced that they picked Lynn Swann because he's black.",
        "I'm convinced that they picked him because he's a celebrity and a very popular celebrity, and they thought they may counteract Ed Rendell.",
        "In Maryland, though, I will say that race is a very big point, obviously for the reason that Ron just said, is that African-Americans do feel disenchanted.",
        "They felt disenchanted in the 2000 governor's race and they think that Michael Steele may be the way to deal with that.",
        "We're down to our last couple of seconds.",
        "So, Ken, I want to give you last word.",
        "What's the Democratic Party's response to this?",
        "Well, I think these are three completely different cases.",
        "But, you know, they'll just say this is not rhetoric and it's not - don't look at rhetoric, don't look at window dressing.",
        "Look what the parties stand for.",
        "And the Democrats will say that the Democratic Party is the party that has done more, and clearly has done more for African-Americans.",
        "Republicans will say that Democrats have taken the black vote for granted and it's about time that African-American voters looked at the two parties.",
        "But again, for the Republican Party, they have to make more than just the rhetoric for them to be taken seriously on November 7.",
        "Is part of the appeal of Lynn Swann that he - because he was a former football player did he have resources of his own to put into the campaign?"
