        "That's correct.",
        "He even wanted her wedding ring, which she refused to turn over.",
        "He did take the rest of her jewelry, and he held it, in effect, hostage for a month until she came up with the money to pay for the overdue oil bill.",
        "Now the system, as you describe it, seems not only (unintelligible) the debt collectors, not only is it sometimes aggressive and sometimes dubious tactics, but the way you're describing it is the courts aid and abet.",
        "This is certainly true.",
        "We found in great detail in Massachusetts in many courthouses, the debtors come in not knowing the rules.",
        "They often, most often, owe the money.",
        "The debt collectors are always represented by lawyers, and their - the relationships between the court officials, the court clerks who hear the cases, and the debt collection lawyers are so cordial that if a debt collection lawyer doesn't show up, the clerk sometimes appoints another lawyer to take his place even though the case should be dismissed.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "They don't know the court rules.",
        "And many times they don't even show up and the debt collectors get automatic default judgments, which in Massachusetts are good for 20 years, and they grow at the rate of 12 percent a year, which is pretty good return on your money.",
        "You also describe a system - you say people don't show up for their hearings - well, partly because the instructions are in very small print on the back of the piece of paper they get - but often these debt collection agencies manage to send the summons to the court hearing to the wrong address, to an old address, and then - but somehow when they get the collection, when they get the authorization to collect, they manage to find the car.",

        "Sure, Tony.",
        "Second-generation discrimination - actually the idea of second-generation discrimination, I think, arose in the area of education.",
        "But in terms of workplace discrimination what that has come to mean is the use of certain patterns or corporate structures that have the effect of excluding or prejudicing non-dominant ethnicities or racial groups.",
        "And so whereas we may no longer be seeing what we would call first-generation discrimination, that would a hanging a noose in the plant or the use of the racial epithets in the workplace, we're seeing a more subtle form of discrimination that's having equally pernicious effect, that's really prejudicing racial groups.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "When you take a telephoto lens and you look at that, what you find is that tens of millions of people are deeply in debt in that even those who maintain the minimum monthly payment, but many, many people who are not in the top quintile of the economy are carrying large credit card debt, and if one single thing goes wrong in the family - a job loss, a divorce, or anything like that - people are unable to pay these debts.",
