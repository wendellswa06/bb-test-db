        "That's correct.",

        "Well, first of all, obviously, by the time the debt was received by those agencies that were working, or purchased by those agencies that were working, they had been sold at least once or twice prior to that.",
        "It had been worked by two collection agencies before that, plus the original creditor.",
        "So you have to realize that this was the fifth or sixth agency that was asking these people for the money.",

        "And by the time they got around to using these aggressive tactics, I mean, they were forcing the issue to be a priority is really what it amounts to.",
        "So these are people, you know, legitimately pursing deadbeats.",
        "Mm, yes.",
        "I mean, like I said, I don't necessarily agree with the tactics used there.",

        "I was involved in one case where we took someone's car, but it was a doctor.",
