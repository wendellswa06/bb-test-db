        "Well, I doubt that many debt collectors thought that our series focused in the right place.",
        "They would like us to focus on those debt collection agencies which, as we noted, do the job properly and legally.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, as I think Mr. Duffey knows, is that the number of complaints to the Federal Trade Commission has gone up ten-fold since 1998 about debt collectors.",
        "It is by far the largest single cause of complaints about anything in the marketplace.",
        "The - your caller - the caller from Utah talked about being harassed for a debt she didn't owe.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "What often happens - debt collectors who try to collect from people like this, once they're convinced that the person doesn't owe the debt, they turn around and resell it to someone else who then tries to collect it from - this woman may hear again from someone else.",
        "And there's a serious problem within the industry.",
        "There are twice as many people collecting debts today as there were 10 years ago.",
        "There are - last year alone, $66 billion in bank credit card debt was sold off to debt collectors.",
        "That's an enormous amount of money, a huge number of people chasing it, and if you say only one or two or three percent of the people being chased get run over or stomped on unfairly, that amounts to millions of people.",
        "This is not a small number, and it's a serious problem.",
        "The trade organization for the debt collection industry is concerned about it.",
        "They have FOIA'd(ph) or sent a public records request for the Federal Trade Commission for all the records of the complaints.",
        "FOIA is...",
        "So it's not an issue that people in the industry, I think, should pretend doesn't exist.",
        "FOIA is the Freedom of Information Act.",
        "Peter Duffey, I'll get your response to that.",
        "Sure, I'd be happy to.",
        "The number of complaints has increased dramatically.",
        "I think that there were over 66,000 last year.",
        "Also, a large number of those complaints are illegitimate.",
        "And the reason for that is because a lot of consumers are ill informed as to what their rights actually are, and they'll file a complaint that is based on rights that they believe that they have that they don't."

        "I follow the regulations to the T.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And by the time it gets to my office, you're looking at about two years delinquency at this point.",

        "...unable to pay.",
        "I guess it depends on which side you're on.",
        "It might add up to the same thing.",
        "I guess, but a lot of these cases are store cards.",
        "You know, you're in the mall, and, you know, you see something you want and you know you don't have the money for it, but you go ahead and buy it anyway in hopes that you're going to have the money later.",
