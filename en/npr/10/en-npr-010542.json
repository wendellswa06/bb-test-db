        "And, Walter Robinson, I wanted to get back to a point we were talking about earlier in terms of the party that's supposed to be neutral in all of this, and that's the courts.",
        "At least in Massachusetts, according to the system you described, they seem to be on the agents' - the collection agents' side.",
        "That's correct, Neal, and it's not just in Massachusetts.",
        "In a number of states judges have begun to realize that, as we quoted one of the principle clerks here saying, that the courts have become a subsidiary of the debt collection business.",
        "The lawyers who represent the collectors know how to use the courts.",
        "The people who are being sued have no idea what their rights are, and there's nobody there to tell them their rights.",
        "And it's a huge imbalance.",
        "The Massachusetts court system is now beginning to deal with it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And judges in other states are urging reforms.",
        "Now, you talked to the judge who's in charge of the small claims courts in Massachusetts, where again, much of this happens, and she said she was astounded by some of the things that were going on.",
        "She was.",
        "This is an area of the courts that doesn't get as much attention.",
        "Obviously the criminal business in the local district courts is what gets attention.",
        "And among the things that happens is lawyers who sue people when they're not ready to take their case forward, they get automatic continuances.",
        "In Michigan, a judge has noted - and this is true everywhere - is the collection attorneys who buy these debts, whose companies buy these debts, only have in many cases computerized print-outs of the names of hundreds of people.",
        "And if they're actually asked to prove their case in court, most often they have to drop the case because they don't have the evidence that the person actually owes the debt.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, to help us sort through all of this, joining us now is Liz Pulliam Weston.",
        "She writes a regular column for MSN Money, and is also the author of Your Credit Score and Deal with Your Debt.",
        "She joins from NPR's bureau at NPR West in California.",

        "As you look at this, I mean, clearly, the first thing that a consumer needs to think about is not running up some debts.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But beyond that, what rights do you have when dealing with a collection agency?",
        "Well, as other people have said, they're outlined in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.",
        "And you can find that - a pretty good synopsis of it - at the Federal Trade Commission Web site.",
        "So if you just Google FTC and fair debt collection, you'll see a summary of the rights you have.",
        "And they limit when and how a debt collector can contact you.",
        "You do have the right to tell a debt collector to stop contacting you.",
        "If you send them a letter and say stop contacting me about this debt, then they need to stop.",
        "The only way they can contact you again is if they intend to take a specific action.",
        "Unfortunately like, you know, that can include suing you.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I also wanted to make a point about the statute of limitations, because in many states you have to show up in court to assert that the statute of limitations has run out.",
        "And I've heard from a number of people that some collection agencies, knowing that the debt is too old to sue, sue anyway because they assume the people won't show up and get a judgment.",
        "And that goes on their credit report.",
        "So that's something that you have to go to court and assert.",
        "You can't just assume that, you know, the judge will know and throw the case out.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Walter Robinson, the way you described it in Massachusetts, 80 percent of the cases people don't show up, guilty (unintelligible).",
        "That's true.",
        "That's true.",
        "When you find yourself in this situation, Liz, can you call the police for help?",
        "A lawyer?",
        "Well, you probably can handle - if it's a simple case of mistaken identity, like what happened to Karen, and that's very obvious, you know, sending a letter saying I don't owe this debt, stop contacting me, mention the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, sometimes, many times that will get the harassment to stop, but not always."

        "Yeah.",
        "It's very common.",
        "As soon as you fall behind on your debt the credit card company's going to ratchet up your interest rate to reflect the, you know, greater risk that you're going to default.",
        "You might want to consider looking for a legitimate credit counseling firm.",
        "Now, this industry has gotten a really bad rap recently because of some bad actors, but there are legitimate credit counselors.",
        "And they have debt repayment plans that will allow you to get your interest rate reduced, put you on a payment plan, and possibly get you back on your feet.",
        "The other alternative, unfortunately, is bankruptcy.",
        "If you cannot pay your bills, if you cannot pay back what you owe within three to five years, you might want to consider, you know, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.",

        "When seizures are involved, people end up paying far more than their original debt in terms of paying the fees for the constable who's sent out to pick up the car and the towing fee and the storage fee at the lot.",
        "It's pretty extraordinary.",
        "If somebody defaults on a thousand dollar credit card bill, the rate that Liz was mentioning that kicks in is now over 30 percent annual interest rate.",
        "Then you get to court, there are fees added.",
        "And a thousand dollar debt quickly becomes a two thousand dollar debt.",
        "And then the constable shows up with a tow truck.",
        "The constable wants six hundred to nine hundred dollars just for rapping on your door with a nightstick at midnight.",
        "And the tow truck, that's another two or three hundred dollars.",
        "And people really get hit pretty hard by this.",
        "But one of the reasons - and we haven't touched on this - is there's been an explosion of credit card debt.",
        "And one of the reasons for that is the banks have offered more and more credit to people who are much more likely to default, people in lower income brackets who don't have a history of credit."
