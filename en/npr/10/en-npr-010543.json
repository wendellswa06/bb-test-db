        "Absolutely the same?",
        "Yes.",
        "Here's another question.",
        "Looking at the longer-term impact of the work discrimination cases like this one, once a case has been decided, and let's say it was decided in the favor of the plaintiffs just for argument's sake, do courts have the authority to order a company to change its organizational policy?",
        "And does that ever happen?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And if it doesn't happen through the court system, there have been a number of cases where there have been settlements where diversity task forces were put together and very real changes were made to company practices.",
        "For instance, my firm was involved in the Texaco case, and that was probably the first case where really serious, programmatic changes to a company were brought about by a class-action case.",
        "Let's go back to the basics of this particular lawsuit, and perhaps it would be beneficial for the audience to hear from you.",
        "Specifically, what did Bank of America do to these individuals that they consider discriminatory?",
        "Can you give us an example of something that they actually did or did not do?",
        "Well, there are a number of disparities that our clients faced vis-a-vis their Caucasian counterparts, including lack of resources, one of the client was entitled to a promotion and didn't get it.",
        "But basically the one thing that all five - and it's important to note that these people worked in different markets and not on the same office.",
        "We have clients who worked in West Palm Beach.",
        "We have clients who worked in Fort Lauderdale, St. Louis and Atlanta.",
        "All had a very similar experience, essentially the same experience, which is when they would be put with a Caucasian partner, whether it a premier bank or a financial adviser who had a great deal of business in certain neighborhoods, high net worth neighborhoods, they would only be, and I think the complaint uses the word parked.",
        "They'd just be there for - you know, put with that partner, with that banker for just a month or two and then immediately moved over to be partnered with an African-American banker or financial adviser.",
        "And then together, this partnership would only be assigned neighborhoods that were high minority and low-net worth neighborhoods.",
        "And when they would ask, can we please be assigned to different accounts in other neighborhoods, they were told it's our belief that our clients in these neighborhoods are more comfortable with someone of their own race.",
        "When does an action of a company go from being simply unfair to being illegal with regard to how it treats its employees?",
        "Well, when it violates the equal employment laws of this country, and there's a long history of cases in federal court that are somewhat similar to the situation here, where a company says we think the client or customer is more comfortable with someone of their own gender or someone of their own race.",
        "And the best example of that is there were series of cases in the 1980s involving female stewardesses, and there was actually proof that male passengers - and at that time, most of the airline passengers were male - preferred to have female stewardesses waiting on them instead of male stewards.",
        "And the courts came down very firmly against that kind of preference."
