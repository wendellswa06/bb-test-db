        "And even then there were no punishments until 2004, and those punishments were very weak.",

        "Congress had these hearings in 2005 where heroes like Mark McGwire refused to answer questions and Sammy Sosa denied using steroids, and you had Rafael Palmeiro who wagged his finger and denied everything.",
        "And then a few months later he tested positive for steroids.",
        "So all that bad press led baseball officials and the union to agree to stricter testing.",
        "Now a first offense gives you a 50 game suspension and there's a three strikes and you're out policy.",
        "So if you test three times, you're suspended from baseball altogether.",

        "The union is a very strong union in America and they are - they've been opposed to this testing for a long time.",
        "It really took Congress to get involved before the union would agree to any of this testing.",
        "But Bud Selig, he appointed Mitchell, it's someone he's worked with before.",
