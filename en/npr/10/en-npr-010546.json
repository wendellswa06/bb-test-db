        "It was an agrarian, populistic movement that believed that not only was the little man getting screwed economically, but he was getting screwed politically.",
        "You heard him say populist.",
        "One reason we use that word now to describe the sort of uprisings that support candidates ranging from Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump is because people used that word then.",
        "There was a populist party, or people's party, in 1896.",
        "It united with the Democratic Party behind a candidate named William Jennings Bryan who attacked the power of big money.",
        "He gives a famous speech at the Democratic convention that literally makes him the nominee.",
        "And at the end of the speech, he finishes it by saying, you shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold.",

        "His book is called \"\"The Triumph Of William McKinley.\"\" It focuses on the Republican who actually won the election, though he is less well-known today.",
        "History gets McKinley wrong and gets the 1896 election wrong.",
        "And the more I read on it, the more amazed I was at who McKinley was and how he comported himself.",
        "Now, when you hear Karl Rove talk about 1896, you are, of course, also hearing a modern-day political strategist.",
        "Rove did much to direct the election of President George W.",

        "Ethiopia also has security concerns in the region because it borders Somalia and the population is mainly ethnic Somali.",
        "The chairman of the ONLF, the Ogaden National Liberation Front, Mohamed Omar Osman(ph) says the rebels have their own cause, not linked to Somalia and a fighting force that the Ethiopian army can't easily defeat.",
        "(Through translator) When you compare it to the Ethiopian army, it's very small, but it is enough to harass them (unintelligible) and do their bad business peacefully and they're helping us get more and more every day because they are harassing our population so much.",
