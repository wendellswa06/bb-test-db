        "Everybody went to Des Moines, Iowa, to write that his campaign was over and instead walked away saying, this guy's let it loose and going.",
        "The interesting question will be this - in politics, we ofttimes learn more about how people handle themselves in adversity than we do when they're on top.",
        "And Jeb is in the barrel right now.",
        "Everybody gets to go through the barrel.",
        "And the question is, how is he going to be when he comes out the other end?",
        "It's going to be really interesting to watch.",
        "Karl Rove is the author of \"\"The Triumph of William McKinley: Why The Election Of 1896 Still Matters.\"\" Pleasure talking with you.",
        "Thanks.",

        "Presidential candidates have been sending a lot of emails lately asking for money.",
        "We're going to focus on the Democrats for the moment.",
        "From Hillary Clinton's campaign, one email was a challenge to prove her detractors wrong.",

        "She raised less than she did in the previous reporting period.",
        "What can you tell us about where these donations came from - big donors, small donors?",
        "Well, for the Sanders campaign, very much from small donors.",
        "The 1 million online contributions they were bragging about in the email - that's kind of the epitome of what their campaign is about.",
        "The Clinton campaign, on the other hand, is - you know, it has a big online operation.",
        "They're doing a lot of online fundraising.",
        "But they also have her on a really heavy schedule of traditional fundraising things - $2,700 admission receptions, stuff like that.",

        "She's calling for the U.S.",

        "intends to do next.",
        "I want to ask you about a letter that on January 16th I, along with 21 of my colleagues, sent to President Bush asking for an explanation of what plan B steps he was considering with respect to Darfur, including possible punitive military action such as a no-fly zone or blockade of Port Sudan.",

        "would send its own troops to enforce a no fly zone or a blockade?",
        "Well, my guess is she thinks that's probably pretty far off.",
        "But I do think that by staking out of position early in the campaign on Darfur, she's letting everyone know, and perhaps particularly the African-American community, that Africa is important to her.",
        "And clearly, the African-American base is very important to any Democratic candidate.",
        "And with Barack Obama also in the race, one thing this does, it sends a signal to African-Americans that basically I'm on your side.",
        "Dr.",
        "Berry, what do you think?",
        "Well, I think it does more than that.",
        "Because the Darfur issue is very hot with the Hollywood crowd and the big funders in the party, even more than just strictly the African-American community and its politics.",
        "And we often are very blasé about Africa anyway.",
        "But I think that it signals that - it also, she remembers how Bill Clinton didn't do anything about Rwanda, and the genocide there, and how much regret that they have all expressed.",
        "But I also think there is a hope that Bush will do something about the problem of Darfur and the problem of Iraq before January 2009, which is what we're looking at almost two years from now.",
        "A lot of people can get killed between now and then."

        "And she's only talking about aircraft being deployed in the no-fly zone.",
        "She's not talking about American troops actually going there, and I think the American people are not really in favor of ground forces from the United States getting involved in something else.",

        "You can't tie the two together, however, because the Iraq situation is very different.",
        "We are responsible directly for going there with no good reason and creating all the tensions, and if genocide results, it is entirely in our laps as opposed to what's going on Darfur.",

        "I think that the - at least it seems to me - well, first of all, I applaud the senator for trying to restore a certain amount of idealism about American foreign policy after the mess we have made in Iraq, because it has set us back in terms of the way that we see ourselves.",
        "And I think Mary's quite right when we talk about what we could do in Darfur.",
        "And what I think that the senator is suggesting is that we take a more aggressive role in trying to work with other countries, with the African Union, with the United Nations.",
        "And in fact, you know, the government, the president, our current president has not - I mean, he has done some things but he has not raised it to the level of visibility that he could.",
        "I think the key thing, two things that have to happen in for this crisis to be solved.",
        "One of them is what President Carter said recently, and that is that there has to be a settlement between the two parties before any - before the United States or any of the African Union forces and any of the troops, the international forces, any military forces at all will have any effect.",
        "And the second thing is that notice that this was the first time that Darfur was mentioned at the Davos World Economic Policy Forum.",
        "And that's an indication that perhaps, maybe that business interests of the world are going to pay some attention to this part of Africa, which it has not yet.",
        "So without the business interest being brought forth, I don't see how much can actually be brought to bear here.",
        "Well, I think if they're pressed they might down the road.",
        "Not as of yet, but if they're pressed certainly in the debates, they may.",
        "One thing I wanted to mention, though, in this context is that just about a month ago the United States did send an AC-130 Gunship to Somalia, neighboring Somalia, in the hunt for some suspected al-Qaida terrorists and dozens of people were killed.",
        "And so it is not unknown for the United States to use its military power in Africa.",
        "And certainly this was the first time last month - I'm speaking of since '93 with the famous Black Hawk Down incident, which in a sense soured the United States on interfering in Africa until last month.",
