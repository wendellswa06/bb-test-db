        "I would just go to say that all of what Joe just said about the comparison between using military force in Somalia and so maybe we can do it here, it also means that we will think that - it assumes that we think that genocide is at least as important to get rid of as terrorism because of facts on the ground.",
        "Is that an assumption we can make?",
        "Our history so far, in terms of Africa, if Rwanda is any example -and we hope it's a bad example - is that we really don't care that much.",
        "But I basically think Senator Clinton is right that these things are to get settled now, instead of what we're into is a mode where we going to have to wait and let everything happen and keep getting worse until January 2009.",

        "They wrote her a letter asking to be delivered through the embassy asking her to come to visit.",

        "So it seems unlikely that she'll be visiting any time soon.",
        "But, you know, what do you think of that strategy, Joe?",
        "Well, I think it really points to how desperate, unfortunately, some African countries are for international attention.",
        "I think that if you have to kind of grab on to an American entertainer in order to draw attention to your small West African country it shows just how far off the radar screen you are for most Americans.",
        "And so I frankly see it as a desperate act to get attention."

        "I just think that if people are going to have their DNA tested, and if they are entertainers and big shots and they have money and they're proud that they're from this particular place in Africa, maybe they should help the poor people over there rather than just saying isn't it great, I'm from whatever tribe it is.",

        "And so there are certainly nothing wrong and there certainly it is perfectly okay for African countries to do the same thing.",
        "I think the difference between countries like Israel and Ireland, for example, is that they do it much more systematically and that the people in this country who are of Irish descent or who will have links to Israel also are much better organized to help their homelands than African-Americans by and large are.",
        "But Nat hasn't had a chance to -",
        "Michel, no, I've got to say this.",
        "That there's a whole field of African diasporic studies in universities and colleges, and research going on and courses that tie together the Caribbean, Africa and the United States and the African-American experience, so that in the sense - and people go to Africa for conferences and all that and the Caribbean.",
        "So it does fit in systematically with that notion."
