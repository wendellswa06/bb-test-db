        "Indeed.",
        "In a way, it follows the demographic shift taking place in our country.",
        "The gravitational focus of our demography is moving very, very rapidly away from the Northeast and from those traditional states into the West, into the Southwest.",
        "If you look at the census data just released last week, Nevada is now one of the fastest growing states in the country.",
        "And the whole country really is moving, demographically speaking, and we will see a new gravitational center that will be much, much more based in the West, in the Southwest.",

        "It's a population with a growing share of Hispanic voters.",
        "So this will be, in a way, the story of the country moving forward.",
        "Interestingly enough, Callie, one of the complaints from those who ran for the office of president is that often they believed that Iowa and New Hampshire had too much power.",
        "The momentum swing did not allow those that did not do well in that - in those primaries and the straw vote could not often go on to states that they may have been able to garner more support and more votes in.",

        "Those states have had way too much power, and in this day and time - as Marcelo has pointed out - it doesn't reflect a majority of the population.",
        "So it's crazy now in 2006, 2007, 2008 to be thinking about just Iowa, New Hampshire making the determination about who will be the leaders or the possible potential presidential candidates.",
        "What I think distresses me, though, is I think that I'm not certain that adding these two states is going to make a huge difference.",
        "For me, this is like a band-aid on an already broken system, because you're going to end up having narrowed the whole field very early in the game.",

        "It's just really hard if you're a candidate trying to garner some popular support in other ways.",
        "It's like these machines have complete control and the people are left out of it.",
        "Now having said that, it is important to have a Nevada and a South Carolina because those are the two new additions.",
        "But I think what's going to happen is they're going to end up being in the same way kind of powerful in their own way, and I'm not sure we'll still get down to the folks who are bubbling up -who should be bubbling up from the bottom.",
        "Robert George, so important to those on the Democratic National Committee who are pushing this that they are suggesting that there will be sanctions put in place for candidates who campaign in any state that refuses to follow the 2008 calendar of the primaries and caucuses there.",
        "That was approved on Friday.",
        "Now, we should not that all of this is not official, has not gone into place, will not go into place yet.",
        "But, again, for the DNC to suggest that any candidate who campaigns in a state and not abide by the new calendar will be stripped at the party convention of delegates, one in that state, that's pretty harsh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think that - I mean I think that seems to be a little bit of overkill.",
        "I can understand why they want to try and, you know, shake up the map, if you will.",
        "But I'm not so sure, particularly when you call yourself the Democratic Party - making these kind of autocratic moves seems to go against the name of the party itself.",
        "One thing I will say, though, specifically for the - in the context of the Democrats in the way this map plays out, Callie said it was going to, in a sense, prevent different candidates from bubbling up.",
        "Actually, I think this actually creates an interesting dynamic given how Hillary Clinton is still perceived as the frontrunner."

        "And so his cash on hand is usually very low.",
        "And Hillary Clinton has spent a lot of money as well.",
        "She's only $7 million ahead of Bernie Sanders in cash on hand because it takes a lot of money to create a field organization that can go the long-term, and that's what she's built so far.",
