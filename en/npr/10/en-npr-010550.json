        "Secretary Shulkin favors using some private care to shore up the VA, but several White House advisers are pushing for much greater privatization of VA care.",
        "Some of them are linked to a veterans advocacy group supported by the conservative Koch brothers, Concerned Veterans for America.",
        "Dan Caldwell is with CVA.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "I have no reason to believe otherwise.",
        "As we've said many times before, if somebody no longer has the confidence of the president, you guys will know.",

        "But first, several publications are reporting that the photographs everyone in Washington has been looking for, exist.",
        "They're photos of President Bush meeting at the White House with the now infamous lobbyist Jack Abramoff.",
        "In response a White House spokesman told CBS today, quote, \"\"I don't think that would be fair to jump to any conclusions just because the President took a picture with somebody.\"\" Joining us to talk about the White House-Abramoff connection is John Dickerson.",

        "Reporters have looked at them, but we haven't seen them.",
        "So all we know is that there are pictures where President Bush and Jack Abramoff are in the same frame and now we're all trying to figure out what that means.",
        "The White House has been really skittish about talking about Abramoff and his connections with the White House.",
        "They said he came to some holiday parties.",
        "These pictures suggest, at least, that he was involved in a slightly more intimate relationship with the President and so it's just another turn in trying to get the White House to come clean about exactly what Abramoff did when he was at the White House and who he talked to.",
        "Well, of course, people all over Washington have pictures of themselves with the President, it doesn't necessarily mean anything.",
        "MR.",
        "DICKERSON: Oh, that's exactly right.",
        "In fact, it's a tradition to have these kinds of relatively meaningless photos with the President and the President takes thousands of these in a year.",
        "At any party, at any meeting, there's always a photographer and if you meet with the President you get a picture a few weeks later.",
        "And so often he's shaking hands with people in pictures and he has no idea who they are or certainly doesn't remember them after he leaves the room.",
        "So a simple picture doesn't matter.",
        "What matters in this case is that the White House has sort of tried to say that, well Abramoff just came to a few holiday parties.",
        "In addition to that, they've decided not to release the list of people he met with when he came to the White House.",
        "He was in the business of getting special favors for his clients.",
        "He met with people in the White House and people want to know well what special favors was he asking for and the White House won't say yet.",
        "And what is the reason that they give for not revealing all the details that they may have about these meetings?",
        "MR.",
        "DICKERSON: Well, they kind of shimmy when they try and give a reason.",
        "They, the spokesman Scott McClellan has said, well we don't want to go on a fishing expedition when members of the press have asked who in the White House Abramoff met with.",
        "It doesn't seem like a fishing expedition to me exactly, but then they also say, well it's not our policy to talk about staff meetings."

        "The policy that under girds that is one essentially that says staffers at the White House should be allowed to do their job without always having to worry about it getting out into the press.",
        "That policy's been upheld by the courts, but in this case it's a very specific one person and that person is now an admitted felon.",
        "It seems to me the White House has an obligation to come forward and say who he met with.",
        "And we do know that Abramoff raised at least a hundred thousand dollars for President Bush's reelection campaign and that's not a small amount of money.",

        "All we have so far is that he went to the White House, had some meetings, and now there are these pictures.",
        "And arguably the White House could be in a very strong position to say, here's who he met with and yes he had these pictures taken, but despite the fact that he gave all of this money he didn't get anything for it.",
        "And in fact it could be, if you look at in one way, it could be a very strong story for the White House.",
        "So, by stonewalling in effect it makes them look more suspicious than if they had come clean, is what you're saying?",

        "We know that Iowa and New Hampshire received a lot of attention for potential candidates who had to spend a disproportionate and disordinate amount of time in these two areas.",
        "We just saw recently a poll that suggested that perhaps Hillary Clinton's polarizing effect is lessening over the course of the last couple of years.",
        "This does allow these candidates to broaden their scope and talk to a few more people and not be as concentrated in an area that, as you have so astutely suggested, is lessening and lessening in importance by virtue of the number of people who live in these areas.",
        "We'll see more baskets and the candidates will have to put their eggs strategically in a way, hopefully, that will be more balanced of the diversity of the country and more balanced of the distribution of power, demographic, economic, regional, in the United States.",
        "Callie, the idea of being able to broaden the scope - some suggest, though, that will not be helpful.",
        "The idea that you're splitting your time, losing some of the campaign time to travel in the like.",
        "Some people like the idea that even with this concentration, you are more apt to talk substantively about the issues because you spent more time in one place, therefore receiving that coverage.",
        "I don't know if it truly works that way, but that's the argument."

        "Chances are, you know, this unknown doesn't happen in today's world.",
        "You have to be a known commodity pretty much going in already.",
        "Well, yeah.",

        "Or actually, frankly, they were probably raising the money even before then.",
        "So that's one aspect of it.",
        "The other aspect of it that we have more news resources out there now.",
        "It's not just the broadcast networks, obviously; it's the cable stations, it's the Internet and so forth.",
        "And the debates that are fueled on the Internet just make more politicians known.",
        "You know, it might have been, you know, in 1976, nobody would have known, say, if a Bill Richardson, for example, who had been an ambassador in the Clinton administration.",
        "Now he is a known quantity because of all the news outlets out there.",
        "Marcelo, does this, in fact, though, bring power at least to the issues of black and brown people by virtue of the fact that because these will be early on in the race, you're going to have to talk about issues of import to these communities?",
        "Up front, I think that that will be the interesting issue to watch.",
        "In other words, how the early issues get framed and how having a different audience that you're dealing with might affect the kinds of concerns that bubble to the top.",
        "But I think the money issue is a fundamental issue.",
        "And I think the enduring questions that we're going to see addressed are really going to focus on Iraq, they're going to focus on the economy, they're going to focus on jobs.",
        "And these are national issues.",

        "Because as soon as you, you know, manage to stamp out one over here, it's like Whack-A-Mole - you stamp out one and you toss one athlete out, then there're like two or three others who figure out another way to game the system.",
        "Callie, what of the idea that this is just the evolution of sport?",
        "And we should note with Marion Jones, she has continued to deny - and this is not the first accusation of her and we should note this is an actual test - but there have been accusations of her using performance-enhancing drugs over the years.",
        "She has continued to deny that.",
        "But one of the interesting notes is when you go from generation to generation as the world evolves, some people say that sport doesn't want to, i.e. you used to lift free weights and then it went to nautilus machines and then there are all kinds of water weight build-up programs now and things of that nature.",
        "What's the difference if, in fact, you are admitting to these performance-enhancing drugs and police them in some respects, as Robert suggested, with medical supervision and the like?",
