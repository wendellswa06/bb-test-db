        "So to claim that the Muslims have not been doing this--actually, the Muslims have been blackmailed over and over again to continue to apologize for the acts of those terrorists, and that is unfair.",

        "It is an insult and an aggression against Islam as much as it is against the United Kingdom, and I believe it is repugnant by Islamic principles.",
        "And it is very counterproductive and stupid from the logistical point of view, because these kinds of acts never result in helping anybody's cause.",
        "But on the contrary, it diminishes the cause of Islam, and it allows people to be repulsed by Islam and encourage its enemies.",
        "So I think that the people who do these things are not only doing things against non-Islamic countries, but against Islam in general and the Muslim communities everywhere in the world.",

        "But at the same time, it is the responsibility of the Muslims to stand up, speak it clearly and denounce acts that are, A, un-Islamic, B, they are done in the name of Islam and, B, they are very counterproductive and inimical to the interests, the name and the life of Muslims everywhere.",
        "Here's an e-mail we have from Gregory Rich(ph): `I often hear members of the Islamic community say these extremists are pursuing a political rather than a religious agenda.",

        "If these attacks are politically motivated, what is the objective?'",
        "I don't mean for either of you to speak for al-Qaeda, but, Azzam Tamimi or Mahmood Thamer, do you have opinions on that?",
