        "And just one point, if you don't mind.",
        "I don't think that anything the Americans--there was anything the American Muslims could do to prevent 9/11, because the perpetrators simply were not homegrown; they came from outside.",
        "And when they come from outside, what can you do?",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is Mahmood Thamer talking.",
        "Yes.",
        "I completely agree with this.",
        "But I would also add that although the Muslim communities in the United States could not have done anything to prevent the 9/11 attack, but I believe all of us, including the Muslims, have a responsibility to stand up and speak clearly against extremism.",
        "And I think that this is in our own interests, in the interest of the Muslims, as well as the interest of all the groups in the United States and everywhere.",
        "Extremism does not help anybody anywhere.",
        "And whatever goal any group has, this is not the kind of tactic which will help you to reach that goal.",

        "This is Makzoud(ph) in Fairfax, Virginia.",
        "Hello.",
        "My question for Mr. Azzami is that there's--a dangerous movement is going on in the United States, and that's people taking the face value, the word of Koran by face value, which says anybody who is non-believer, anybody who is not believing in your religion should be killed and should be destroyed and they are infidel.",
        "And if this is interpreted right or wrong, how can we help educating people in the United States that this is not real Islam?",
        "I take my answer off the air.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "Azzam Tamimi.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thank you very much for the question.",
        "The Koran very clearly states that those who do not fight you and remove you from your land or oppress you, God does not forbid you from being friendly to them and from coexisting with them, etc. God prevents you from conceding to those who drive you out of your land and seek to kill you, so there is a distinction between the two.",
        "When I live in Britain as a British citizen, or when my fellow Muslims in America live as American Muslims with their rights preserved and respected, the first part of the verse applies and then--and what we are commended to do is to be friendly to everybody and to be law-abiding.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I would like to add to that very important question, and that is clearly, the Koran says that there is no compulsion in religion.",
        "There is no coercion in matters of faith.",
        "And the idea that anybody who disagrees with you should be eliminated is a very strange idea and interpretation of the Koran.",
        "And the whole history of Islam speaks for its tolerance and acceptance of people at a time when the tolerance and acceptance of people other than your faith was not known.",
        "The churches and the synagogues have flourished in Muslim countries for a century and--for a millennium and a half, at a time when the Muslims had the absolute power to crush these religious minorities living within the Muslim body.",
        "But they did not do it not because they were Jeffersonian in thinking, but because the Koran tells them that they cannot--they should not and they cannot coerce people in matters regarding their faith."

        "Right.",
        "And I think this kind of reminder of the history of Islam and the meaning of the Koran should be clearly enunciated by all of us, the Muslims, so that this strange interpretation that, you know, he who disagrees with you should have his head cut off--this is something which is a strange interpretation.",
        "It is not the kind of practice that the Muslims have done throughout the ages.",
        "And as a matter of fact, these people who say these things not only consider the non-Muslims infidels, but the Muslims infidels, and that they are--and that they belong to the extremely minute segment to which they belong.",

        "I mean, after all it is 428 pages without the appendices and notes.",
        "Certainly I know that very few American Muslims have read the report, and so my philosophy is that if they're not gonna come to the report, I'm gonna take the report to them, to their mosques, teach them about what the 9-11 Commission has found with regards to the foundation of al-Qaeda and the history of al-Qaeda's attacks on the United States.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "What reaction do you--have you been hearing from the Muslim community, particularly over the past couple of days, since the attacks in London?",
        "Well, a few things.",
        "First of all, shock, because any time you see an attack on a target that so many of us use, a mass transit target, it's just shocking to think that the next attack could be right here in Chicago.",

        "People are resigned to the fact that we are caught up--we're caught in the middle of a large struggle that we really don't have any control over.",
        "On the one hand, our government is pursuing policies that have angered many in the Muslim world, and then on the other hand, al-Qaeda is attacking American targets in retaliation, and we as the little guy on the ground in the United States often feel like there is nothing that we can do to help make the situation any better.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And if people come together, if public opinion is enlightened about the impact of foreign policy on world safety and security, then people can come together and pressure government to change policy.",
        "That's the key: change policy.",
        "Would you agree with that, Kamran Memon?",
        "Well, you know, certainly one part of what we need to do here in the American Muslim community is to encourage Muslims to do whatever they can to help protect our country, and if that means encouraging them to lobby for a foreign policy that exposes the United States less to hostility in the Muslim world, then we certainly have a responsibility to protect our country in that way.",
