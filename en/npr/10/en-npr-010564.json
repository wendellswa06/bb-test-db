        "It was all based around foraging and proteins that are untraditional to how we've been conditioned to eat but are very traditional to cultures around the world, so insects, crickets, jack rabbit, aloe, jellyfish, succulents, ice plants - things like that, so not really steak and mashed potatoes.",
        "No. And the jack rabbit that we mentioned.",
        "So he started complaining, after a few years, of his memory starting to slip; and remembering where he had placed objects; and maybe trying to think of an individual word that he was trying to come up with.",

        "David, tell me about him.",
        "Yeah, that was really enlightening because we've been conditioned to believe that we have to eat, let's say, even 8 ounces to 24 ounces of meat, especially when we consider steak or a big pork roast or anything like that.",
        "But literally, we ate about 1 ounce of dried, cured jack rabbit.",
        "It was almost like jerky in a sense, but that was served with this beautiful melon - summer melon and herbs and a little bit of oil.",
        "And I mean, I got to tell you the truth.",
        "It filled me up more than eating a steak.",
        "And it fills you up in a very different way.",
        "Eating like that makes you feel a lot more nimble...",

        "...And a lot more connected to the Earth.",
        "The basic idea here, which you alluded to, is Americans have - most of us have grown up on a diet that comes from three animals - from a cow, from a chicken, from a pig - and that there's a whole lot of other stuff out there that might be better for our bodies and better for the planet.",
        "So why aren't we learning different ways to cook and eat?",
        "I think it's been designed for us.",
        "I'm not a scientist, and I'm sure you got a lot of scientists on NPR that can either back me up or put me down, but I don't think our bodies are designed to eat pigs, chickens and cows at the rate that we're eating them.",
        "I want to ask you about another thing that you explore, which is the power of cooking to save people, to rehabilitate people on the margins of society."
