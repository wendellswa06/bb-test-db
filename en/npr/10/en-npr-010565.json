        "But it was one of those things that was just another reminder to me of this connection that we had had.",
        "And at the time, it just seemed like a very generous gift that touched me.",
        "And what I didn't realize at the time was that that was, I think, a farewell gift or a bit of a parting gift from him - because I did not see him again.",
        "And the next that I had heard of him was from an emergency phone call from his wife, about a month later.",
        "And she called, needing to be seen - she's also my patient - and she had to come in and talk to me with - how to deal with the fact that her husband had committed suicide.",

        "And certainly, I felt guilt; you know, that if I'd have done something differently then, you know, maybe this wouldn't have happened.",

        "The second step, Miller says, is asking patients if they have guns in the house, or access to guns.",
        "That's because if someone tries to commit suicide without using a gun, they probably won't succeed.",
        "The likelihood of their dying is, you know, of an order of magnitude lower.",
        "Instead of there being a 90-plus percent chance of death, there's a greater than 90 percent chance that they'll live.",

        "Miller says there are lots of reasons family doctors avoid bringing up guns with their patients, even ones who are depressed - everything from not wanting to offend someone to simply being too busy, making sure they're checking off all the screenings and tests that are proven to extend their patient's lives - like asking about smoking and diet and exercise.",

That's not the answer, but I say that they will have to find a way to go with this, because if they don't, they are going to lose some thing like $1 billion a year, which is money that even if Arab states will come and try to help them, I don't see how they are going to collect such sum every year the next four years.",
