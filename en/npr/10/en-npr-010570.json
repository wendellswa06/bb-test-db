        "So you're talking about the Joker, and the reason I really like the Joker is that he's just a character that changes over time and so different writers can use him in such a way that they can just drape new ideas over the character.",
        "Like, I guess - Hank, is the gentleman's name?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Was saying, the characters change quite a bit.",
        "One thing that I'd recommend reading is \"\"Arkham Asylum\"\" by the writer, Grant Morrison, and he puts forward the idea that the Joker is just more evolved than other people.",
        "He is more mentally capable of dealing with the sort of chaos that is being created in modern society and so he's actually just ahead of us.",
        "Arkham Asylum, by the way, is located in Gotham and it's where the arch-villains are kept under the care of Scarecrow, also an arch-villain.",
        "But go ahead.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Arkham Asylum is a great Gothic mental hospital on the edge of town.",
        "The Arkham Asylum graphic novel was really, you know, it came out in the late '80s and it really was terrifying.",
        "It was one of those comic books that you didn't really want to sleep in the same room with.",
        "It was painted.",
        "It wasn't drawn in a traditional comic book fashion and the Joker in it is really terrifying.",
        "And it was all leading, I think, to this point, to when you put the Joker on the big screen now, he really has to be - you know, this is a world that has seem Hannibal Lecter and any number of serial killers every night on \"\"CSI,\"\" you know.",
        "It just takes more to take us to that horrible place.",
        "Chris, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Let's see if we can go now to Zach(ph), and Zach with us from Provo, Utah.",

        "Hi.",
        "The reason why I think this Joker, especially in this film, in Heath Ledger's performance is so interesting is because I think he embodies this sort of recognition that the philosophers, I think, have grappled with for a long time, that what do you define morality and goodness as, you know, and is it just a socially constructed thing that falls apart once society falls apart?",
        "You know, I think he embodies, especially now with terrorism and then our government trying to be good but we're doing all these things that we see as wrong, you know, there's a lot of questions about what's moral, what's good, what's the cost?",
        "And I think he embodies that sense of - you know, he's not interested in winning, either.",
        "He doesn't care.",
        "He doesn't want to win.",
        "He just wants to disrupt.",
        "And observe.",
        "He likes to watch.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He likes to see what people do when they're pressed to the limits.",
        "And one terrific thing about this film without spoiling it is, you know, there's a wonderful scene where everybody has to - Joker wants to put everybody in a situation where they have to make a terrible decision.",
        "Zach, your terrible decision was apparently to call us.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I just think - there's a Nora Smith character called Defender's Wolf(ph), they just sort of - it's like endrophy(ph), it just eats everything and destroys everything, and this character reminds me of that.",
        "It actually also reminds me of Cormac McCartney's writing in \"\"No Country For Old Men.",
        "Oh, yeah."

        "That same - it's the same as Anton Chigurh, it's how humans trying to exist in the world and trying to be good and survive, deal with unbelievable chaos.",
        "I see that part, but this - those were sort of elemental characters and the Joker is - well, he is not so much elemental as carried away with himself and with his strange mission in life.",
        "Well, and his strangeness.",
        "And one thing that everyone who's done either a graphic novel or a movie about the Joker in the last 20 years has picked up on is the Joker loves the media and he is a media creation.",
        "And you know, one thing I like about this new Batman movie is that they sort of dispensed with the origin story of the Joker, which always involved him falling in a vat of chemicals or being permanently altered.",
        "This guy just wears make up, you know, and that's almost more twisted than having a reason why you are white and your hair is green and your smile is plastered on your face.",
        "It's not a revenge.",
        "He's just - you know, again, he's just messed up and he craves media attention at the same time, which just makes him perfect.",
        "Perfect for an actor, too.",
        "Anyway, Zach, thank you very much.",
        "You're welcome.",

        "Great.",
        "I wanted to talk real quick about Alan Moore's \"\"The Killing Joke,\"\" which I think is my favorite portrayal of the Joker if for no other reason than even though the Joker admits that the back story presented in that comic may or may not be true, it presents us with sort of a simultaneously sympathetic and extremely terrifying character.",
        "And that is very rarely done with the Joker, I think.",
        "I love \"\"The Killing Joke,\"\" too, and in my piece in the Post which ran a week ago, I opened with the scene where Batman thinks he's talking to the Joker and says, where is this all going, what is it between you and me, I think we're going to kill each other one day and I'm here to try to avoid that.",
        "And the funny part about that is that he discovers that it's a Joker impostor in the cell and that the Joker is actually out in the world.",
        "And you know, \"\"The Killing Joke\"\" is great because the Joker winds up, you know, getting the you-know-what kicked out of him by Batman and he seems to love it.",
        "There's this whole sadomasochistic element to Batman and the Joker.",
        "Hit the Joker, he loves it.",
        "He loves being beat up by Batman.",
        "And Batman loves to do it.",
        "Oh, of course.",
        "And it just had a wavy, windy sort of look to it that I liked and I just said, well, this is - I'll start here.",
        "Doug, thanks very much for the caller.",
        "Alan Moore, by the way, the author of among many other things, of \"\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\"\" and many other wonderful comics.",

        "We're talking about his piece, \"\"The Joker's Onto Us.\"\" What does it all mean when Batman's enemy is more interesting than the Dark Knight himself?",

        "Hi.",
        "I just wanted to say that this Joker, in particular, was my favorite because he truly, truly represented the wild card.",
        "Every time someone thought they had the better hand or the upper hand and it was all over, he would just blow them away in this one.",
        "I agree.",
        "I agree.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But I did see the movie a couple of weeks in advance and I came away kind of worried about the movie's plot but totally over the top in love with Heath Ledger's performance as this Joker, and also the way that Joker is written.",
        "It gets to everything you're talking about.",
        "Definitely.",
        "Definitely he will be missed and it's sad to say that he won't be coming back as the Joker, regardless of what the plot had in mind for him.",
        "Yep.",
        "Erica, let me ask you and Hank, as well, since we know that Heath Ledger is not coming back to play anybody, does that not add a certain resonance to his performance as the Joker?",
        "Oh, I think so.",
        "I think it's a Jim Morrison kind of quality that, you know, you sell more of records or tickets or whatever because people are drawn into - in a very macabre way but also in a very respectful way, this idea that a creepy thing is made more unsettling by the end of Heath Ledger.",
        "And Erica, how did it play into your ways you watched the movie?"
