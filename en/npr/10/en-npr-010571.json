        "I haven't done much else, no. I want to bring up two kind of antithetical points between Batman and the Joker, the first being that they are both free for very different reasons.",
        "Bruce Wayne is free because he has everything.",
        "He's a multi-billionaire and he has the resources to take off as much time as he wants and he can have any equipment he needs, et cetera.",
        "The Joker is free because he has nothing and he has absolutely nothing to lose.",
        "There's no loved ones, he has no house, no property, what are you going to take from him?",
        "There's a wonderful scene in the film where Batman is trying to interrogate the Joker and the Joker would love for Batman to just kill him because that would prove that Batman was not infallible.",
        "So I really like that antithesis.",
        "And the other was between Batman and Joker again.",
        "Batman lives his life, especially in this most recent series of Batman movies we've seen, according to a very strict moral code and rules and ethics and the way things should be done.",
        "And Joker, by comparison, has absolutely no rules and will break a rule simply for the sake of demonstrating that it doesn't really exist.",
        "So I think those two elements really help to give the Batman and Joker a really dynamic field of play.",
        "I would only quibble with one thing, Tony, and that's the Joker having nothing to lose.",
        "He is so often, in all of these stories, going back to the Bob Cain days, so frustrated when he is captured and held, usually in Arkham Asylum, and that is intolerable to him and that is what he is at risk.",
        "That's what he puts at risk.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I agree that what's alluring in this movie is that the Joker has a lot less to lose.",
        "And that's again by getting rid of so much - this new Batman series gets rid of so much of the folderal(ph) that got us to this point.",
        "I mean, you know, the Joker used to show up in green and purple helicopters and I mean - so he obviously had a job or some resources.",

        "And what does it say, finally, Hank Stuever, about this franchise, which has died and been revived any number of times, and in its darkest, I think it's fair to say, maybe except for that cartoon version, the darkest version yet seems to be doing so extraordinarily well?",
        "The consumer has spoken.",
        "And when - and you know, you think that there's not a whole lot of people out there thinking about what the next Batman movie should be from a consumer perspective, but if you look at the fact that 150,000 people are going to Comic-Con this week, there are a lot of people out there thinking about Batman movies.",

        "He spoke about his fight with the diseases back in 2000, and about getting more funding for cancer research in general.",
        "One of the problems has been is that people lobby for disease specific kind of causes.",
        "And they're all well intentioned, but they've done that at the expense of trying to get the pie bigger for all of cancers.",
        "So, it's something that a lot of people are going to work on this presidential year, because we've got - we have two men, both of whom have lost siblings to cancer.",
        "Both Vice President Gore and Governor Bush lost siblings to cancer.",
        "So, I know that they're emotionally committed, we've got to get them significantly committed.",

        "Hamilton was the architect of the campaign.",
        "In 1972, when Jody and Hamilton and Governor Carter were in Miami, to our first Democratic convention that nominated George McGovern, we looked around and saw what the political landscape was and it got in Hamilton's mind that if these guys could do it, Jimmy could do it.",
        "President - Governor Carter.",

        "And, he laid out what the political landscape was, it was after Watergate, it was during Watergate, and it was after, during the Vietnam War.",
        "And he spotted what the need was for the next campaign.",
        "And Governor Carter, who couldn't run for reelection, Hamilton suggested that he run for president.",
        "And, you know, put your money where your mouth is, or put your mouth where you is - he was challenged to show him how.",
        "And it was Hamilton that wrote an 80-page book.",

        "What it was, that memo, I went back and read some of it just in the past hours.",
        "And it is eerily prescient in terms of the judgments about where the country was and where it was likely to be at that point four years down the road, and how closely the inherent qualities of a man like Governor Jimmy Carter match with where the country was likely to be.",
        "It really is, I think, a work of political genius.",
