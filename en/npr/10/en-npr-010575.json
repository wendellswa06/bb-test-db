        "Ms. Sarah writes, your guest speaker talked to the possibility of South Africans resenting Oprah for building a school for their kids.",
        "I'm not sure if people really resent Oprah, but it is possible that there are some cultural gaps between the rules and regulations at the school and the social norms that may be difficult for the community and families to adjust to.",
        "And on Monday's bloggers' roundtable, we discussed a news that was found hanging around the neck of Tupac Shakur's memorial statue in Stone Mountain, Georgia.",

        "It is quite inaccurate to characterize the community as you did as the location of the clan or clan influence.",
        "Well, Earnest, we did not point that Stone Mountain as the location of the clan.",
        "But according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, several clan groups operate in the region.",
