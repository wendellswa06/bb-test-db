        "So the focus now is on the moderate wing of the party.",
        "Names to listen for - Dean Heller of Nevada, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two senators who have been really skeptical about what this bill does.",
        "And their votes are now necessary.",
        "And now, they haven't spoken yet, but Dean Heller was really strong in saying the previous bill was terrible for Nevada.",
        "Does this bill seem to address the things he said was wrong with the last one?",
        "Well, the key sticking point is Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid.",
        "I mean, that is really the issue here.",
        "Aside from what the bill does to the individual market, it is a radical reshaping of the medical - Medicaid program.",
        "And that is an issue for senators that might just be too much for them to accept, particularly as a lot of their governors, like Brian Sandoval of Nevada, have come out against this bill.",
        "And a lot of Republican governors, and Democrats for that matter, don't want to be on the other side of their governors if they're in the same party.",

        "And it took off, and it's been some of the greatest funk ever recorded.",
