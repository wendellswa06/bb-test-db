        "She was attacked by her housemate, and all of her friends couldn't process it.",
        "It was totally bizarre.",
        "It was like this guy who had always been, like, a little weird, a little creepy did this horrible, horrible thing.",

        "It's a play on \"\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\"\" - that story, right?",

        "I don't want to spoil the story, but what's really incredible about it - most true crime pieces that you read, if they've gotten written, they've gotten written 'cause someone got caught.",

        "Yikes.",
        "OK, the second story you brought is from an Australian publication The Monthly.",

        "Oh, Helen Garner.",
        "Helen Garner is the best, and The Monthly is also a fantastic publication.",
        "It's a totally independent magazine in Australia that does all kinds of great work.",
        "This essay is about Helen Garner deciding that she is fed up with not saying anything when people say stupid things to her about being old.",
        "It's going to resonate with anyone who's, say, over the age of 65.",
        "But I actually think it's just going to resonate with anybody 'cause what she does is basically the thing that we all wish we could do, which is when someone says something dumb and insulting to us, she doesn't stand for it.",
        "And that essay sort of takes you through her snapping.",
        "And then you expect her to sort of have some remorse.",
        "She's kind of like biting people's heads off and telling them exactly what she thinks, but she has no remorse.",
        "And we should say, it's not just insults; it's, like, condescension, like, people speaking slowly to her, kind of like, ma'am, are you OK, like (laughter)..."

        "Like, there's so much work that goes into running this restaurant, and at the end of the day, they really don't make very much.",
