        "OK.",
        "So you're saying that neither side is really acting like it's ready to stop fighting, in a grand sense, but there may be some opportunities for some smaller agreements.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And if this conference opens, it will open with very low expectations, because most of the diplomatic firepower has been spent on just getting everybody there.",
        "These talks are supposed to produce a transitional government by mutual consent of the opposition and the regime.",
        "That, at this point, is a very tall order.",
        "The Syrian opposition is a shaky coalition.",
        "They're divided over attending the conference.",
        "What they're afraid of is being drawn into a long process that keeps Assad in power.",
        "The Syrian regime comes to the table in a much stronger position.",
        "They're backed by Russia and Iran.",
        "Both those countries have contributed arms and advisers to the fight against the opposition.",
        "Both the Russians and the U.S.",
        "back this diplomatic track, and they do have some objectives, and they are: to end the violence in Syria, preserve the unity of the Syrian state - so you don't have chaos - and eliminate radical Islamist groups.",
        "But there's no clear plan on how you do that, and that will be a long process.",
        "One final question, very briefly, Deborah Amos: You said that the rebels fighting on the ground are somewhat different than the opposition in suits who will attend the peace conference.",
        "Do the guys at the peace conference even have the authority to make peace if it were available?",
        "That is a tough call.",
        "The rebels control the ground.",
        "Most of them do not agree with a political opposition going to Geneva, and they've been very strident in saying that.",
        "And that puts enormous pressure on the political opposition.",
        "They have to deliver in Geneva, otherwise, they lose all credibility.",

        "stepping away from its leading role in Afghanistan.",
        "So this trip in particular, I'm going to be focusing on the next generation - those 20 and 30-something Afghans - who've lived their entire lives in times of war and occupation.",
        "And I'm going to be asking them what they think the future holds for them and for their country.",

        "So I think there's pressure on him to win, to do well for the home people and do things for the community and somehow help Detroit win a championship, another championship, and maybe erase that cloud in Ann Arbor.",

        "Now, if I had the sweet deal that Clemens has, I'd go home too.",
        "Man, what a deal he got.",

        "So are the mighty Yankees that desperate that they would just do anything to get Roger Clemens back?",
        "As Dwayne Thomas said, apparently.",

        "You know, that has not been the big thing about Clemens.",

        "Here's a guy - I wanted to make mention of this - here's a guy who is one of the good guys.",
