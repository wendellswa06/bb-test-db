        "We're going to begin today by focusing on Syria, where the regime's army, backed by Russia and Iran, is on the verge of retaking the province of Idlib.",
        "Idlib is the last major province where rebels are still standing.",
        "And, according to the U.N., it's where some 1.4 million civilians have fled seeking refuge from the conflict.",
        "Hiba Aljazzar is one of them.",
        "We heard from her on this program back in March.",
        "She's a 24-year-old laboratory analyst who spent months under siege in eastern Ghouta before she finally made it to Idlib.",

        "The conflict there has gone on for, what, seven - the war has - as it's understood to have been a war - has been going on for seven years now.",
        "So, in that time, there have been many, many battles, but this one is considered critical, and why is that?",
        "It's basically the endgame for Syria.",
        "It's the one part of the country that remains effectively an opposition stronghold, and it is very important for the Syrian regime and its backers to recapture it so they can claim that after seven grinding years of war, they have finally won back with the military offensive the last known pocket of opposition resistance in the country.",
        "This is the place that - Idlib is where, as we heard earlier, about - what?",
        "- 1.4, 1.5 million people are internally displaced from other government assaults.",
        "What are those people going to do?",
        "Yeah, you're right.",
        "Look.",
        "This is the part of the country where people who have fled a regime, Russian-led offensive, over the last three years in particular have ended up.",
        "Some of them have refused to come to terms with the Syrian government and the so-called reconciliation deals, which did amount to starvation surrender sieges.",
        "And they have - rather than hand themselves over, they agreed to be exiled.",
        "So right throughout the province - it's a densely packed corner of northwestern Syria where most of these people are at odds with the Syrian regime - now, where are they going to run to now?",
        "The U.N.",
        "has put forward an option of humanitarian corridors being opened up into regime territory.",
        "But everybody we speak to say the regime are the organization that we ran from.",
        "We are not going to cross the border back into Syrian government territory and risk detention, risk some form of retribution, especially in this current environment of total impunity."
