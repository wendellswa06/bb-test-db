        "I think, from what we can tell - and we've been speaking to a lot of civilians inside the province - they are hoping that these - a Turkish zone of influence inside of Syria, which is to the east of where they are now, will be opened.",
        "If the Turks handed that over to internally displaced people, where are they going to go after that?",
        "And that's their fear.",
        "It's their fear that they will lose any traction or influence that they have in the north of the country if they allow this area to be filled with refugees.",
        "But, at the end of the day, if a large-scale offensive is launched, and people are going to start moving - and they will - I do suspect that there'll be enormous pressure under the Turks to accept internally displaced people and exiles in their own country - in some cases, for a third or fourth time - to be allowed into the Syria that they control, which is just south of the Turkish border.",
        "So what is the endgame here for the Syrian regime?",
        "They retake this territory - let's say they do that.",
        "Then what?",
        "Well, this is the thing.",
        "In some ways, when the Syrian regime is able to claim, nominally at least, that they have recaptured all of the country except for the northeast, where there is a nominal Islamic State presence, what sort of Syria will emerge from the ruins of this catastrophic war?",
        "It's a fact that Russia and Iran have led the way in terms of clawing back Assad's position right across the country, especially since September, October 2015, which is the first time the Russian Air Force became involved to the extent that they are.",
        "And ever since then, they've doubled down.",
        "But both of those allies have invested billions of dollars of treasure and lots of blood of their own people as well in securing Assad.",
        "What are they going to want in terms of the national character?",
        "Who gets to define it?",
        "A Syria within the model that we're looking at with two allies who have invested so much is not going to be sovereign.",
        "It may notionally be so.",
        "It may be that Russia and Iran will allow the perception to be entrenched.",
        "But right through Damascus, right through the hearts of power, there is a significant influence being exerted by both sides, and they will want to define the terms of reconstruction, to define the terms of governance in many ways.",
        "And also, fundamentally, who gets to define the national character after so many years of war?",
        "And those questions are yet to be answered.",
        "That's Martin Chulov of The Guardian.",
        "He's been covering the conflict in Syria since it began.",
        "We reached him in Beirut.",
        "Martin, thanks so much for talking with us.",

        "Los Angeles artist Ed Ruscha made his name in the 1960s by taking pictures of gas stations, apartment houses, vacant lots - in other words, L.A.'s most run-of-the-mill non-landmarks.",
        "As photographs, they may seem unremarkable, yet they're considered among the 20th century's most enduring images and have been exhibited in museums around the world.",
        "On the 50th anniversary of Ruscha's first photo series, Carolina Miranda paid the artist a visit in his Los Angeles studio.",
        "For a seminal work of art, \"\"Twentysix Gasoline Stations\"\" doesn't look like much.",
        "It's a small, thin paperback book resembling an old industrial manual - just 26 black-and-white photos of gas stations that Ed Ruscha self-published in 1963 at the age of 26."

        "If I showed the book to somebody who worked at a gas station, they might be genuinely interested in it and saying, oh yeah, I remember that place out on the highway.",

        "One critic described the book as doomed to oblivion.",
        "The Library of Congress refused to put it in its stacks.",

        "Are you putting us on?",
        "(Chuckling)",
        "Those photos have since been shown in museums around the world, and they are now on view at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.",
        "Virginia Heckert helped organize the exhibition.",
        "At that time, the idea of an artist book was a meticulously crafted, limited edition, expensive work that would wind up in a private collection or institution.",
        "Ruscha, however, got a commercial printer to mass-produce 400 copies, which he sold at $3 a pop.",
        "Heckert says the crude, almost anonymous quality of Ruscha's pictures represented a shift from the highly personalized art of the 1940s and '50s.",
        "They're all reactions to the chest-thumping, soul-baring Abstract Expressionists and the drama and emotion of creating paintings that are very physical.",
        "But the photos, nonetheless, provide a glimpse into where the artists was coming from.",
        "The son of an insurance auditor, Ruscha was raised in Oklahoma City but moved to L.A.",
        "in 1956.",
        "The gas stations he photographed all sat on Route 66, the highway he rode on his regular visits home.",
        "I just had a personal connection to that span of mileage between Oklahoma and California and it just kind of spoke to me.",
        "So did the stark black and white cinematography of John Ford's 1940 film adaptation of \"\"The Grapes of Wrath,\"\" which told the story of Oklahoma migrants fleeing the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.",
        "They traveled Route 66 too."
