        "Well, this is--certainly would get a lot of promotion for a designer given that the idea behind this, as I understand it, is that the folks that work at McDonald's wouldn't just be wearing the uniforms behind the counter, but they'd be happy to wear them outside, thus advertising McDonald's wherever they went.",
        "Well, I think if people don't mind selling, like, a french fry when they go to the mall, that could happen.",
