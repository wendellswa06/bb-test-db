        "Indeed, the president wants it known that this long labor of bipartisanship is little more than a series of suggestions that he will consider along with a lot of other suggestions.",
        "The commission's assertion that the Bush policy on Iraq is not working is not likely to endear the report to the president, but is likely to get a warmer reception from Congress, Democrat and Republican alike, because of his emphasis on redeployment of combat troops.",
