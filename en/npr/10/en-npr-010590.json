        "My cold fingers brushed her warm fingers.",
        "She slipped a quarter through the slot beneath the screen window and began her slow walk back up the block.",
        "She may have been spending some of her summer vacation visiting a relative or a friend, but to someone who spent his days in the snowball stand, she was exotic.",
        "And when she stopped coming, it was as though she'd vanished.",
        "Forty years later that girl visits my memories, her face half-obscured by a frozen mound of tutti-frutti while behind her summer people come and go at the A&P now for lemons, now for avocados, now for ice cream.",

        "One of his major sources of income is moose hunts - or rather, he says it used to be.",
        "I'd normally take, oh, at least five moose hunters probably.",

        "And at $5,000 per guided moose hunt, his business has suffered.",
        "In northwest Wyoming, where Meyer lives and operates, there's been a drop for other outfitters too.",

        "That's Matt Kauffman, a zoologist at the University of Wyoming.",
        "Over the last decade, Kauffman says, the moose population has dropped by about 30 percent, which has had a big impact on the state's 300 outfitters who specialize in moose hunts.",
        "There are two things that Wyoming moose are experiencing that are truly regional, and that's the expansion of wolves and grizzlies and this 10-year drought that we've been in.",
        "Kauffman says it's impossible to say what portion of moose losses comes from predators and what comes from drought.",
        "But he does say the 10-year drought leads to another possible factor: disease.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ELECTRIC SAW)",
        "Today, game and fish wildlife biologist John Henningsen is using an electric saw on a moosehead to check for a parasite called elaeophora, or more colloquially, brain worm.",
        "The brain worm can cause blindness and death in moose, and Henningsen says the leading theory for why the parasite is spreading is horseflies.",
        "Whether it's just by the number of horseflies that are alive or the length of the season that they're operating in.",
        "When we have hotter, drier conditions, horseflies actually do better.",
        "And those increases in temperature have led scientists to look for reasons why.",
        "Bryan Shuman teaches geology and geophysics at the University of Wyoming.",
        "He says over the last 30 years, average temperatures in the state have risen up to three degrees and attributes it to this: greenhouse gases caused by the burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of forests.",
        "I tried to put everything on the table, look at all the possible things - solar variability, ocean variability, natural cycles in the Earth's system.",
        "And what it came down to was that there was no way I could explain the most recent episode of more frequent, warm years without including greenhouses gases."

        "According to Shuman, when the average temperature in Wyoming goes up a degree, the average rainfall decreases by three inches, which has adverse effects on food and habitat for moose, and of course hunting outfitters like Fritz Meyer.",
        "It's the sportsmen and everybody that's taking the brunt of the rap on this, because there's just not the animals out there for them to harvest that there should be.",
        "Meyer may not have the ability to prevent climate change himself or singlehandedly control the predator population, but he's adapting to the decline in moose by diversify his big game business, adding things like summer camping trips for families.",
