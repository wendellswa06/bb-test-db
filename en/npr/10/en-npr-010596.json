        "And so resilience is a piece of the equation that we have to deal with in addition to looking more carefully at the science.",

        "I've heard him mention it more, I think, recently, including in the clip we just heard.",
        "Well, it's been a toxic issue for him, and what - we saw what happened in the first six months of his presidency, where he actually went out on a limb on this and actually forced a number of the House Democrats to walk out on the limb with him, and that limb snapped.",
        "So I think he's going to be a little bit cautious in how he approaches this.",
        "I would suggest that what he really needs to do is to enlist the support of people like Jeff Flake and a few others in the Republican Party to try to make this a bipartisan issue rather than a Democratic issue.",
        "The number of physicists in Congress doubled, from one to two.",
        "Should we be celebrating this fact?",
        "Well, the number went up, and a couple years ago it went down.",
        "We used to have three.",

        "What about the space program?",
        "What should we expect to see there?",
        "That's one of the most difficult ones, because it is an extremely expensive program, and quite frankly over the last dozen years, NASA has not done itself a great deal of good in the way it has put together its strategic plan.",
        "So I think we're going to have to wait and see on that.",
        "Perhaps if NASA gets its act better together, we'll get a real direction that we need.",

        "Yes, I have a question for the gentleman.",
        "Obama was promising to hire 100,000 science and math teachers, but my question is we have to go back and see where our science education, especially in high school, goes wrong.",
        "I mean, we have to learn from our curriculum, maybe see how other countries are doing it.",
        "We have huge universities here, and we have to find out a way how to make science and math very interesting for our young kids so that problems like climate change can only be tackled if you have enough educated manpower.",
        "So the basics is science and math is still we are lagging behind, and we have to find a solution for that in order to tackle any problems, including environment.",
        "Thank you for your comment.",
        "What about that, science education?",
        "What's the state of that?",
        "Very serious issue.",
        "I mean, just as the gentleman pointed out, we have a very leaky pipeline.",
        "And we can go back to the early education issues.",
        "When we look in high school, though, and I'll take physics as a good example, when we look at high school physics teachers, it's actually less than one-third of them have had physics education.",
        "So they're teaching students starting off with their own deficiencies.",
        "This is not the way to educate a scientifically literate electorate of the future.",
        "Well, let's talk about the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, as even the administration now refers to it.",

        "Thank you.",

        "But how are you doing?",
        "As long as the president is in the White House, he's not going to sign a bill that abolishes it, and nor will the Senate go along with it.",
        "There are a couple of interesting things about that, that legislation, and that is many of the benefits really don't become apparent to the public until 2014.",
        "And so a lot of the criticism that we've seen, although I have to say that Governor Romney pointed out that there were certain features of that legislation that he liked, he liked the issue that you could not be denied coverage for a pre-existing condition.",
        "He liked the, sort of the extension of COBRA to 26 years and so forth.",
        "I think as these things kick in, the public becomes more knowledgeable about it, we'll have probably a better informed debate, and then we'll see where it goes.",
        "Has the Obama administration favored any certain types of research over the last four years, and would you expect this to continue going forward?",
        "There's always a split between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to research.",
        "Both parties historically have been supportive of science.",
        "The Democrats tend to favor things in more technologically based things that have a payoff in the near term.",
        "And Republicans take the approach that that's the kind of thing that industry ought to do, and you shouldn't - they call that picking winners and losers, but I think people in the - who do science policy as I do, we regard applied research as just as important.",
        "It is what we call the valley of death because nobody really wants to do it.",
        "The valley of death, really?",
        "The valley of death.",
        "We do a great job with discovery, and that's the long-term early-stage research, and industry does an outstanding job with taking discoveries that have already gone through the applied process, where they have things that they can package, they do the development, and they market, and they do a great job with that, but nobody really pays close attention to the applied research that can have a time horizon of 10 years.",
        "And that's what we call the valley of death.",
