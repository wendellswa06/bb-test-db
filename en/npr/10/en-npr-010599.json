        "Well, I think if you had picked one word, Rachel, about this entire project, it would be unexpected.",
        "In the spring of 2006, I read an article in The Economist talking about how hunting and guns was such enormous business.",
        "And I was really struck by the extraordinary size and scope of the gun business, and I thought it could be potentially an interesting subject.",

        "You know, everything from a bride holding a pistol or an elderly woman with this huge smile on her face, and she's surrounded by stuffed animals, and there she is holding a revolver.",
        "And you didn't just photograph these women.",
        "You did, as you mentioned, you had to talk with them.",
        "Well, the text actually evolved halfway through the project because when anyone looks at a portrait, they project onto that picture.",
        "Now, you add a gun into the picture and a woman and there's even more projection that happens.",
        "So the narratives were added halfway through the project, and I think that it was really important because it provided a context, the history and the achievement of these women.",
        "When you talked with these women and learned their stories, which ones really stuck with you?",
        "There were certain ones that I thought were really amusing.",
        "One woman, Jenny in New York, she said, I can't imagine my life before firearms.",

        "And then you read her text, and I love it because she talks about, well, I'm 5'2\"\" and weigh 110 pounds and going up the mountains with a .375 rifle got a little heavy, so I started investigating hunting handguns.",
        "Well, I now shoot with a .454 Casull hunting handgun.",
        "That gun has so much recoil most men can't shoot it.",
        "So speaking of the gender roles in gun ownership, how many of the women that you spoke with got into guns because of a man in their life?",
        "Quite a few.",
        "I would say 75 percent, probably, it was their dads that taught them to how to shoot.",
        "And then you got husbands or boyfriends.",
        "In the narratives, only one woman talks about going out and shooting with her mom.",
        "And, you know, that's this incongruous idea again that, you know, we don't often think of women and their kids and firearms all being part of the same dynamic.",
        "I wonder how many of the women that you talked with discussed how owning a gun affected their families.",
        "Well, what I learned, which was really interesting, from the book is how important the activity of shooting and hunting is as a family activity.",
        "And I also realized that if you or I had grown up in a different region of the country, odds are we would have had our hunting tags by the time we were 12.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I turned that down, but I did happen to grow up in Idaho in a part of the country where people carried guns, and it was kind of part of growing up.",
        "We took guns out to shoot at aluminum cans.",
        "We didn't ever shoot at anything that was living.",

        "You know, interesting, there's one woman, though, in your book who talks about getting a gun to protect her family.",
        "Tell me about her.",
        "She has a job as a 911 dispatcher.",
        "And when you get people who have witnessed people who have been victims of crimes, they have a very different relationship.",
        "When I first started the project, most of the women I photographed were either hunters or competitive shooters.",
        "And then as the project evolved, I started photographing law enforcement, women who collected guns, and then women who had guns for self-defense.",
        "And many people comment when they see, for example, pictures of the children, let's say, with the mother and the gun, will say, what a sad commentary that is on our culture that a woman would feel the need to have a gun in order to feel safe and protect herself and her family.",
        "And exactly, you talk about how one could say that this is a sad kind of commentary.",
        "On the other hand, there is a sense of empowerment in these photographs.",
        "Were you trying to get at something political in this book?"
