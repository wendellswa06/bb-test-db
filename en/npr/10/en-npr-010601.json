        "By protecting special tax rates for Wall Street investors and opposing the Buffett Rule, Romney's plan looks out for people just like him.",
        "To underscore that point, Senate Democrats next week will force their GOP colleagues to vote on bringing up a bill to implement the Buffett Rule.",
        "Majority Whip Dick Durbin says that bill raises a larger question.",
        "And basically, it's going to be a question for the Senate answer for the American people.",

        "The Romney campaign put out a statement yesterday accusing Democrats of promoting what it called the Obama Rule, raising taxes so that government can grow.",
        "Romney advocates lower tax rates for everyone, including the very wealthy.",

        "I think at a time when so many Americans are out of work and when the growth records are dismal, growth ought to be the top priority in every policy discussion, not necessarily these narrow measures of fairness.",
        "Others says real deficit reduction would require a much higher minimum tax rate for the wealthy, as has been the case in the past.",

        "We will pay all legitimate claims for losses and damages caused by the spill.",
        "Those are not just words.",
        "We've already paid out more than $95 million, and we've announced an independent claims facility, headed by Ken Feinberg, to ensure the process is as fair, transparent and rapid as possible.",
        "But in a clear departure from much of the rhetoric about BP's response, Congressman Joe Barton of Texas blasted Hayward's reparations agreement with the White House with an apology of his own.",
        "I'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday.",
        "I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, in this case a $20 billion shakedown.",
        "That $20 billion came out of yesterday's White House meeting between President Obama and BP officials, who agreed to put the money into an escrow fund to pay the claims of Gulf residents hurt by the leak.",
        "But questions remain whether this will satisfy a still-skeptical public or the people affected along the Gulf Coast.",
        "It isn't clear yet, for example, who will get paid, how much and when, which are additional questions to be sorted out.",

        "Would you say that we have learned anything new from the hearings so far today, or is this primarily political theater?",

        "Well, it's a little of both.",
        "I think it's a lot of political theater.",
        "This was kind of this - when a corporation commits the kind of damage that BP did, they can expect to be subject to the kind of laceration that BP's CEO Tony Hayward got today.",
        "I think that we didn't necessarily learn anything new.",
        "BP is clearly trying to send a message of contrition and responsibility and accountability, just like the chairman of the board did yesterday at the White House, that they're going to pay every claim and they're going to restore the Gulf.",
        "Of course, Joe Barton really gave the president and the Democrats a big, gift-wrapped present today.",
        "He kind of fulfilled every stereotype of Republicans being in the pocket of big oil.",
        "And ever since then, the White House has been demanding that other Republicans repudiate his remarks, and they have been, by the dozens - starting with the minority leader in the House, John Boehner.",
        "A number of people have been talking on the Hill about not just Barton, but about this - about BP and what they did, what they didn't do.",
        "For example, we have Henry Waxman on tape.",
        "Here he is.",
        "I'm just amazed at this testimony.",
        "Mr. Hayward, you're not taking responsibility.",

        "I find that - I find that irresponsible.",
        "So it makes it hard, Mara, does it not, to sort of figure out who's telling the truth.",
        "You have the chairman, the CEO of BP, saying we're going to pay and we're going to do everything that we need to do.",
        "And then we have people like Waxman saying, look.",
        "You're not even doing the little bit you were supposed to have been doing.",
        "Well, what Waxman's talking about is that they're not taking responsibility for what went wrong that caused the explosion.",
        "The safety record of BP was horrendous, and it was detailed at the hearing today how many safety violations they had, how much worse they were than other oil companies.",
        "Look, BP is under investigation by the Justice Department.",
        "It's going to be paying a tremendous number of claims, not just for people who had economic damage from the spill, but also for violating all sorts of environmental rules and other regulations.",
        "So I think both of those things can be true at the same time.",
        "We still might not have a completely clear picture of exactly what went wrong, how much of it was BP's fault, how much of it was the government's fault for not forcing BP to actually come up with safety plans and demonstrate it could actually perform them."

        "So there's been a lot of damning information that's come out at the hearings.",
        "But at the same time, you've got what's happening at the White House, which is kind of my bailiwick, where the president is moving to try to actually enact a plan, to show that the government can do something to help people down there.",
        "Now, I know that you're at the White House and not at the hearings themselves, but there is another clip I'd like to play for you and get you to analyze it for us.",

        "It seems that all of this boils down to an issue of credibility.",
        "Obviously, the president's credibility is on the line with how he is or is not dealing with this.",
        "BP's credibility is on the line.",
        "And now you have members of Congress trying to jump into the fray to establish their own credibility, which makes it, I suppose to a certain extent, a little confusing for us to follow."

        "Well, it's confusing, but I think the American people have a pretty clear idea of who's the villain here.",

        "And I think that's the indictment.",
        "That's the bill of particulars that's being built bit by bit by people like John Dingle, who is an expert at this kind of a congressional investigation, how you kind of build a case.",

        "We had a number of recommendations.",
        "We determined a good deal about the causation, determined that it wasn't a question of the captain having drinks.",
