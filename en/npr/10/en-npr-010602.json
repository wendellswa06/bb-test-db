        "But the subsequent payout by Exxon, it's not exactly how much they paid.",
        "It's probably a little bit beyond $4 billion, between four and $5 billion.",
        "But when you talk to people in Alaska now or then, 10 years afterwards, they would say the money that was paid out was really very insufficient to take care of the life of the communities, which in many cases had really been crushed, that natural systems and ecosystem services, which had been destroyed - and so, you know, this is hard to estimate, but I've heard again and again, you know, 10 percent maybe is what Exxon paid out of what we really lost.",
        "And that is sobering, and it's likely to be similarly difficult to get the full grasp on prices in the Gulf.",
        "One of the things that you write about, and I'd like to get you to explain this, as well, is something called the reopener provisions, which you say stem from the oil spill at Exxon Valdez, and it has particular importance to what is occurring in the Gulf right now.",
        "What is that?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "In that case, it was criminal.",
        "And reopeners are used in other areas of law, but I think this is the first time there was such a reopener in an environmental catastrophe.",
        "There was a criminal settlement with the governments for $900 million in criminal restitution.",
        "There were also some criminal penalties.",
        "And remember, no one died in Alaska.",
        "So there were no manslaughter penalties.",
        "So, $900 million.",
        "But we knew that it was not foreseeable what the consequences would be of a spill of that magnitude in an environment which was sensitive, but not fully known.",
        "So the state put in - this was not something that the commission did -put in a reopener clause, which said within 15 years, the state of Alaska - or the federal government, but the state of Alaska, primarily -could file a claim for up to $100 million more, reopening the original settlement so as to take account of harms that were not fully foreseen back in 1990.",
        "That precedent was a major one, but I think you can see its logic.",
        "And my guess is that that precedent from the Exxon Valdez will be seen again in the Gulf and perhaps not just in criminal but in civil settlements, as well.",
        "That would be an interesting development, certainly, and one that I would imagine that BP's CEO Hayward is completely aware of as he says things like we are going to take care of this.",
        "Don't worry about it.",
        "We're going to talk more about how much BP should pay in a moment.",
        "In fact, we're going to be getting calls from you, as well.",

        "They've canceled their dividend to stockholders this year and promised to pay every legitimate damage claim that's filed.",

        "That's right.",

        "I wonder whether or not let me come back to you, Professor Plater, whether you agree with the assessment that this is not about punishing anyone, as Alex is suggesting.",
        "Some people would say, yes it is about punishing BP, and they want them to pay through the nose.",
        "Well, actually, I think that that's certainly part of it.",

        "It really confuses me that Hayward is, you know, saying that getting BP to start paying for the damages is amounting to a shakedown.",

        "The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed by Congress.",
        "It accepted some of the recommendations from the commission in Alaska.",
        "It watered down some of the others.",
        "But it made a basic change because it made it clear that companies would have expedited liability in certain regards, although in the non-statutory area, which is where most of the litigation in Exxon Valdez took place, it dragged on and on and on.",
        "So some of the structure for improved response was passed after the Exxon Valdez so that it won't be quite so primitive as it has been in the Exxon Valdez case thereafter.",

        "But as a political matter, it may be pushing it to even talk about 30 percent.",
        "Well, let me see if I can get an answer for you.",
        "Thank you very much for the call, Glen.",
        "This seems to be in an area, Alex, where you have written about, in terms of what the long-term ramifications of the spill are and how, in your view, we should move towards prevention.",
        "Yeah, let me make a couple of points.",
        "On Exxon Valdez, I don't want to get in too much of an argument with Zygmunt, but the an Anchorage jury, an Alaska jury, awarded $287 million in that case.",
        "That was the Alaska jury who had all the facts under their control.",
        "So we shouldn't jump to this idea that Exxon did not pay.",
        "They certainly paid what the jury awarded, plus some.",
        "On the compensation fund, the $20 billion, I think that's a very good sign.",
        "It's much more than was legally required by BP, and I think there is room there for a deal in that I was pleased to see that Feinberg, who ran the 9/11 Compensation Fund, is going to be in charge of that."
