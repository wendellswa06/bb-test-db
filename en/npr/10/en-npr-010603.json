        "What made that 9/11 Compensation Fund work especially well, is that people who were paid out of that fund opted out of the tort system.",
        "So we removed a lot of lawyers, we removed a lot of fees, and we made it possible for a lot more of the money to go directly to the people who were injured, rather than being wasted in court processes.",
        "I think Alex is agreeing with me that this is a very substantial innovation.",
        "There were not just one jury, there were 15 or 16 juries that decided those cases.",
        "But it dragged on.",
        "And this is going to expedite the resolution in getting money to people.",
        "We are in agreement with that point.",
        "It's a big number, and it will expedite things, and I'm hoping that we can keep the cost low by keeping the lawyers out of the system.",
        "Let me share some emails that we've been getting from our listeners.",
        "Here's one from Tom(ph) in Fairbanks, Alaska.",
        "Exxon spent over a decade appealing the $5 billion jury award from 1994, eventually getting it cut to $500 million.",
        "Many who, quote, won had long since lost their businesses or died.",
        "Has BP promised not to spend years in appeals?",
        "It was certainly worthwhile for Exxon, on top of the much reduced award, they had use of the money during the appeals.",
        "I don't know if either of you has the answer to that, but let me read a couple more emails before you comment.",
        "Here's another from Maria(ph) in Minneapolis: I hope we can hold BP's feet to the fire, but I am enough of a realist to know that we will end up paying for the losses.",
        "As much as it will hurt and anger us, what other choice do we have?",
        "Do we let our Gulf Coast die because BP can't or won't pay?",
        "And here's yet another from Charles(ph) in Sunnyvale, California.",

        "The settlement amount would represent a buyout of each business.",
        "Let me ask you both to comment on whether you think that there is -there could ever be a finite amount of money that could be set aside and paid to people that would make them feel whole again.",

        "And they're going to be much faster from this fund than they would be from a courtroom full of lawyers.",
        "I should note, also, Tom talked about punitive damages being strung out and strung out the Supreme Court quite actively turned rightward to cut back on the ability of people to get punitive damages to compensate for those intangible harms and for wrongful action.",
        "But I understand that was the common law decision by the court and that Congress could rescind that very quickly so that there will be a higher scope of recovery for people who are injured than existed back to the Exxon Valdez.",
        "But Professor Plater, I thought I heard you say - and correct me if I did not hear you say this - that there was not a risk involved.",

        "But those people would have said, you cannot go forward with a mile-deep drilling that has never been drilled that far - that deeply before without the most careful worst-case scenario and a contingency plan.",
        "Glenn was talking about the need for a practical contingency plan in Alaska.",
        "We saw that the contingency plans were science fiction.",
        "And what we've discovered in the Gulf is that when Mr. Obama tried to use it, it was fiction.",
        "It had been created over the years by the industry and the agencies as fiction.",
        "We could do better if there were citizen watchdogs institutionally in the process.",
        "And I think there was no way there would have been permission to go forward in this place at that depth with the geology shifting down there and so much gas pressure.",
        "It just never would have happened.",
        "I want to come back to that point, to the both of you, and talk about what the differences are today versus what happened in the Exxon Valdez situation.",
