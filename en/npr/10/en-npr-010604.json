        "There is a pleasant economic surprise from Europe today.",
        "For the last year and a half, the news from Europe has been really bleak; unemployment above 20 percent in a number of countries and no growth.",
        "Well, today, new data showed that the eurozone economy actually grew in the second quarter by three-tenths of a percent.",
        "As NPR's John Ydstie reports, though, that doesn't mean tough times are over.",
        "Generally, it was northern European countries that saw the most growth in April, May and June.",
        "For instance, Germany grew seven-tenths of a percent and France grew by five-tenths of a percent.",
        "Portugal, one of the southern eurozone countries that's faced the deepest crisis, surprised everyone and grew 1.1 percent in the second quarter.",
        "Economist Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says he was surprised by the growth.",
        "But he says, it doesn't much change Europe's underlying problems.",
        "Southern Europe has very high unemployment, has a lot of debt - a lot of which is bad debt and real estate is still crumbling.",
        "Those fundamentals don't change.",
        "They're eased slightly if growth improves.",
        "And it'd be great if growth improves more but it doesn't change the underlying fundamental.",
        "Remember, says Posen, in countries like Spain and Greece, roughly one in every five workers can't find a job, and youth unemployment is even higher.",
        "And their lack of work experience could slow Europe's ability to grow for a long time.",
        "While today's growth numbers don't change the underlying problems, they do re-enforce that the global financial threat that Europe once posed continues to recede.",
        "This news on growth says, OK, we're in a stable situation; that the bottom isn't completely falling out.",
        "But again, this is just sort of a minor reinforcement to the pattern that was already there, which is Europe is going to struggle along for the foreseeable future.",
        "Posen, who served on the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee from 2009 to 2012, says there is some danger that the better than expected growth could lull politicians in the eurozone into some complacency.",
        "In the weak economies of southern Europe, that could mean a pullback from the needed labor reforms, for instance.",
        "In the stronger northern countries, it could undermine the will to provide aid to the southern countries - after all, if growth is improving, the argument for additional aid is weakened.",
        "John Ydstie, NPR News, Washington."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF A CROWD)",
        "Every weekday, more than half a million commuters pass through the warren of underground tracks, tunnels, and passageways that is Penn Station.",
        "Here's what a few of them have to say about it.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Welcome to Madison Square Garden, the world's most famous arena.",

        "Michael Kimmelman is architecture critic for The New York Times.",
        "And therefore, any real changes can only happen if Madison Square Garden is moved.",
        "Kimmelman and other critics of Madison Square Garden think the time to talk about moving the arena is now.",
        "The Garden's original permit expired earlier this year; normally that would be a formality for a major business like The Madison Square Garden Company, which also owns several local sports teams and music venues.",
        "But earlier this year, the local community board voted unanimously to deny the Garden's request to extend the permit in perpetuity.",
        "Instead, the board recommended extending it for only 10 years."

        "A big part of Monday's meeting, says Orszag, is letting a lot of different voices be heard.",
        "One of those voices will belong to Republican Senator Judd Gregg, the same Judd Gregg who recently withdrew his nomination as commerce secretary.",
        "But he's also a leader on budget issues and he calls the deficit problem a long-term fiscal tsunami.",
        "Our kids are suddenly going to get a country that's not affordable unless we do something substantive about the cost of entitlements.",
        "We're looking at spending under the entitlement programs jumping to almost 30 percent of GDP, which would basically absorb almost all the savings that most Americans would have.",
        "Nobody would be able to afford a house or buy a car or send their kid to college.",

        "Besides Congressional committee chairman and ranking Republicans, there will be liberal economists, labor leaders, and well-known fiscal hawks, and that makes some on the left very nervous.",

        "Its effect is to raise the anxiety of the working population for whom Social Security and Medicare represent an increasingly important part of their long-term future.",
        "The politics of this are daunting because the solution inevitably requires someone to pay more and someone to get less, and interest groups will line up to fight every change.",
        "Former Congressional Budget Office director Robert Reischauer is pessimistic.",
        "This is going to be the hardest thing we have ever tried to do, and it probably won't be successful unless there's some convincing external force, a gun in our hand; interest rates rising rather significantly because foreigners won't lend us the resources we need.",
        "I'm skeptical that our political system right now is frightened enough about the long-run consequences of our current fiscal path that it can galvanize itself into action."
