        "John Reich heads the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans.",
        "Beginning about the 15th of September and continuing everyday until through yesterday, the bank experienced a serious run on deposits totaling about $16.7 billion dollars over that nine-day period.",
        "What suddenly caused WaMu's customers to begin pulling so much money out of the bank isn't clear.",
        "But it undoubtedly had a lot to do with the constant stream of bad news from Wall Street and the slow decline of economic growth.",

        "The demise of WaMu is a story of stunning miscalculation by the company's management and a relentless thirst for profits.",
        "Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics says WaMu used to be a pretty conservative institution but a couple of years ago, it changed its strategy.",
        "It decided to walk away from safe mortgages and instead to double down into higher risk ones.",
        "That proved a fatal mistake.",
        "Petrou says WaMu began offering no-documentation loans and loans that gave borrowers a lot of leeway about when they'd make payments.",
        "She says the company was drawn into the subprime business because of the huge profits that could be made.",
        "Unfortunately, it got in just as subprime was peaking.",
        "By this summer, WaMu was on the FDIC's list of troubled banks and regulators forced out its CEO and replaced him with someone else.",

        "Petrou says it can still make a lot of money selling credit cards and mortgages.",
