        "Is it really as serious as the governor said, babies are suffering at the expense of endangered species or our folks just unable to water their lawns and take long showers?",
        "Perhaps, it is an emergency, but I simply could not discern this from the story.",
        "The goal must always be to pass a sentence that fits the crime.",
        "And the concern of some of us is that, because these cases are being rushed through en masse, and courts are sitting sometimes 24 hours a day, three days at a time, is that people are not being justly sentenced.",
        "They're being unjustly sentenced.",
        "They're being given sentences that are too heavy for the crime.",
        "You know, in retrospect, you know, there certainly are some things that may be important in terms of trying to understand what led him to what he ultimately did.",
        "But if you have red flags that are pretty common, then they don't - they're not all that helpful in terms of trying to assess potential threat.",

        "Well, one of the most interesting things is the way they keep insisting on calling this insurance.",
        "And when you really get down to it, what they did was they placed a bet or wager.",
        "Derivatives are bets.",
        "That's not a metaphor.",
        "They're literally bets.",
        "Now, bets can be used for insurance.",
        "For example, if you own a house and you buy fire insurance, you're basically just betting with the insurance company that your house will burn down.",
        "But if your house burns down, of course, you win the bet, but you lose your house.",
        "The bet functions as a form of insurance.",
        "The problem is that betting can also be used to speculate and to try and make money by predicting what's going to happen to things that you don't necessarily own.",
        "And it looks very much like that's essentially what JPMorgan was doing.",
        "But they bet wrong and then they decided they'd bet wrong and bet anyway and again ended up betting.",
        "It was if they bet on the Yankees, then bet on the Red Sox and then bet on the Yankees again.",
        "Right.",
        "And in the gambling business, we call that hedging a bet.",
        "It's like you bet on one horse in the Kentucky Derby to win and then just in case, you get a couple of bets to show or to place.",
        "But that doesn't change the fundamental character of what's going on, which is that JPMorgan was trying to use the derivatives markets, not to reduce risks generally, but to try and reap profits.",
        "Well, if, in fact, JPMorgan Chase was betting in the many billions and ended up losing $2 billion, does that mean that somewhere there are winners who bet the right way and collectively they've made $2 billion.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Whenever anyone loses a ton of money on derivatives, there's someone somewhere who made a ton of money on derivatives.",
        "The problem with derivatives isn't necessarily that some people win and some people lose.",
        "The problem is when you've got a lot of people betting and gambling that way, what you have is sudden institutional failures when bets go bad.",
        "What would be a legitimate hedge that isn't a speculative bet?",
        "The classic example of what's called commercial hedging is, say you're an airline and you're worried about jet fuel prices going up.",
        "If you were to buy derivatives on jet fuel prices, that exactly counterbalanced the jet fuel that you expect you're going to have to buy.",
        "That would be a true hedge, a true insurance contract.",
        "And by the way, this hedging insurance distinction, Wall Street will tell you it's impossible to make it.",
        "But, in fact, the insurance industry's been making this distinction for hundreds of years.",
        "There have been people trying to buy insurance on things they don't own for a long time.",
        "And the law has figured out a way to separate the wheat from the chaff.",
        "But doesn't this become more complicated when people are not just investing in commodities or not just investing in corporations, but in indices on where somebody's composite of what a zillion corporate obligations might yield, where that index stands from day to day?"
