        "And if you would, take us back to, well, it was a day in 2004, the day that your husband, John Edwards, and Senator John Kerry conceded the presidential race.",
        "I had suspicions at that time already that a lump that I'd found in my breast during the campaign was going to turn out to be cancer, but we, immediately after Senator Kerry did his concession speech, we went to Mass General Hospital and had a biopsy done and found out that, in fact, it was.",
        "We then, of course, had to return to our home in Washington, D.C., that night and on the way made the decision that we would, in fact, go public with this.",
        "I was going to lose my hair.",
        "I wasn't much of a public figure, but I was enough of one that my losing my hair was going to mean that it was going to be a harder secret to keep.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I went ahead and said just go ahead and do this.",
        "I actually didn't think of my place in a long string of people, known and unknown, who had this disease.",
        "I since think of myself very much that way, and that we sort of hold each other's hands in this long chain.",
        "And my being public sort of allowed people to reach out to somebody, and I did get those hands reaching out to me, largely people who suffer from cancer.",
        "I sort of feel like this is a tribute to the people who came before me, and who reached their hands to me, both by participating in research and being strong themselves.",
        "And then I have an obligation now to do that for my brothers and sisters, as well.",
        "But was there a moment when you said, look, can't I keep this private?",
        "Honestly, there wasn't.",
        "I mean, I guess I grew up in a household that was a very open household, and John and I have always had a very open home, where we have very few secrets from anyone.",
        "We always say there's a bunch of 28-year-old boys running around, who've seen me in every nightgown I own.",
        "So I wasn't particularly private to begin with, and politics kind of cures you a little bit of that anyway.",
        "People want to peer in your closets, and you sort of make a bargain that you're going to let them.",
        "And this - you know, there was in it also the possibility of a teachable moment, and just tell people not to make the mistakes I made, to go ahead and have their mammograms in a timely way and do their monthly self-exams.",
        "And in fact, one of the first emails I got was from a woman who had gone and gotten herself checked immediately after hearing of me and found, in fact, that she did have a cancerous tumor, and she was already getting treatment.",
        "So whatever else, whatever the bad sides were, I have this woman's life as a reason to have made the public statement.",
        "I guess, simple coincidence that it was in Massachusetts General, the same hospital where Senator Kennedy is.",
        "And now, we're hoping for the best.",
        "It broke my heart because he - as it does with anybody, but in particular, when you see somebody who is so vital, who embraces life in the huge way that he does, it just seemed - and in particular all he's been through, this seemed so grossly unfair.",
        "On the other hand, this is an equal-opportunity disease.",
        "It doesn't really care, you know, how much you have to live for or how much fight you have in you."

        "It can strike anybody, and this time, it struck somebody who, I would think, in the ten days before that, I testified on the new cancer bill that he is introducing in the Senate with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican from Texas.",
        "So it was almost a cruel irony in addition.",
        "It was hard not to look back at that hearing.",
        "I spoke; with my panel was Lance Armstrong, who had testicular cancer that spread to his brain, and me, with breast cancer that's spread to my bones, and Steve Case, whose brother died, in fact, of a brain tumor.",
        "Let's see if we can get some listeners involved in the conversation.",
        "Our guest, of course, is Elizabeth Edwards.",

        "Hi.",
        "I had diagnosed in April, three years ago, grade-four glioblastoma, was given no time to live.",
        "But my work is as a healer, and a whole lot of people knew about it and started praying for me.",
        "And I'll tell you, that's so significant.",
        "So I'm thinking, the more people that know about it the better.",
        "It's over three years.",
        "I do have some challenges with my balance and stuff, but I don't have any more glioma.",
        "So that people can recover.",
        "That brings up all those things, oh, God, what if I'm wrong, you know?",
        "But anybody who has a history of cancer, it makes your stomach go wiggly.",
        "But you know, I have a healthy background.",
        "I don't know if - well, one of my girls is a colonel in the Army, and she said, well, mom, I guess it wasn't your day to die.",
        "So I guess, you know, if it's Ted Kennedy's day to die, it'll be his day to die.",
        "But I'm telling you, the more prayers that we can send to people with cancer, it absolutely makes a difference.",
        "That's why I'm well, I swear.",
        "Elizabeth Edwards, that kind of support, I know, has flowed to you as well.",
        "It has, and I'd like to say I think attitude is everything, as Kathy said.",
        "But I actually think that people with great fighting attitudes die of these diseases all the time, and I don't want to say, oh, they died because they didn't have enough fight in them.",
        "I think they did.",
        "It's just the disease is sometimes stronger than any person could possibly be.",
        "I'm glad that was not the case with Kathy.",
        "I hope it is not the case with Senator Kennedy.",
        "But I did feel that the fight was made easier because I felt I had a huge safety net of people who were ready to catch me in the bad moments.",
        "And I think that did allow me an additional level of strength because the treatments for these things are debilitating and difficult.",
        "About the same time I was getting my treatment, Melissa Etheridge was also getting treated for breast cancer, and she stopped her chemotherapy midway because it was so debilitating.",
        "So having the strength to continue, even when your body is telling you, we've had enough.",
        "I mean, those medicines they put in you, if you were just normally handling them, you would put on gloves they're so toxic.",
        "And yet, they put them straight into your veins.",
        "So this is a difficult process, and I certainly hope that treatment is available to him, even if it's difficult because all of our thoughts and prayers will get him just so far.",
        "And then we have to hope that the medicine is stronger than the disease.",
