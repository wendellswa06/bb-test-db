        "I wonder, do doctors see an upturn in people making appointments to have their colons checked or their prostates when they hear that a famous person has colon cancer or prostate cancer?",
        "Well, it's funny you asked.",
        "There actually are a few studies of this.",
        "After Betty Ford was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1974, we had what was called the famous Betty Ford blip, where numbers of women who'd never had mammograms went for the first time, and the rates of breast cancer actually went up as a result.",
        "Another celebrity who fostered cancer awareness is Katie Couric whose husband died of colon cancer.",
        "And she became a strong advocate for colonoscopy.",
        "And rates of colonoscopy went up dramatically also after she went public with that whole story.",
        "And we admire people like that and certainly, like Elizabeth Edwards.",
        "At the same time, you feel for some of these people who may want to keep this private.",
        "These are awful moments.",
        "It's very interesting.",
        "When I was listening to Elizabeth Edwards talk, she used the word obligation.",
        "And one can have nothing but admiration for what she's done with respect to cancer, and I think she's done a tremendous service.",
        "But you feel almost a little regret that someone in the public eye feels obliged to do that, because it wasn't so long ago that even famous people were able to keep these diagnoses pretty private and deal with them themselves, without sort of the constant public scrutiny.",
        "But over the last 20, 30, 40 years, the tables have really turned and now, if you're famous and you get diagnosed, it's almost impossible to keep things secret.",
        "And to see, as we saw with Senator Kennedy, I mean, it must have been terrible for his family to see his diagnosis being debated on television.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "I mean, you can imagine being someone given this tremendously difficult diagnosis.",
        "That's bad enough.",
        "And then, right, you turn on the TV, and you turn on Sanjay Gupta, who's obviously doing a very good job, as well, and there's a simulation of Ted Kennedy's brain and the tumor, and you're sitting in the room with him.",
        "It definitely can be very, very jarring.",
        "And it almost raises the question, have we almost gone too far in the other direction and is there a way to sort of pull back a little bit and try to restore some of the dignity and privacy for these folks?",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "One final question, Dr. Lerner, and that is, sometimes, somebody with the same disease as a famous person might see the treatment that that, you know, actor or politician is getting and, say, you know, be a little resentful.",
        "Yeah, I'm learning about this wonderful treatment that I can't afford.",
        "When you realize, one, you don't have to go to school, and two, you get to play in this world that is all yours - it's all yours; the snow is there just for you.",
        "And you can see that expression in Peter's face.",
        "Here's an email we have from John in Mount Horeb, Wisconsin.",
        "My grandfather died of a glioma when he was 60, and my father died of a nearly identical tumor in 2005 at age 74.",
        "Both during my father's treatment and after his death, his doctors were very tight lipped about his prognosis, the nature of his tumor, whether I might be at an increased risk of a similar tumor later in my life.",
        "My only guess as to why his doctors were not forthcoming with any of this information was they didn't want to open themselves up to possible lawsuits if they proved to be wrong.",
        "By following the coverage of Senator Kennedy's unfortunate illness, I've learned more about the condition in two days than I did in years of pressing my father's doctors for information.",
        "Well, that's a great point.",
        "I mean, this is the real upside of these public diagnoses, and that couldn't have been stated any more clearly.",
        "When you hear about diseases, they sort of carry this mystery.",
        "There's question that people have about them, and boom, here's someone with this disease.",
        "You get sort of a tutorial on newspapers, on television, on the Internet, and you really have this enormous opportunity as someone interested in the disease to learn about it."

        "I would add, also, in this particular case, medicine was very, very different in the earlier years.",
        "And often times, cancer diagnoses were not discussed, even within families, a lot.",
        "So it probably wasn't just a concern about lawsuits but also the era itself.",
        "Doctors were much more tight lipped than they are now.",
        "It also occurs to me that, I guess, if you heard that Humphrey Bogart had lung cancer, and you had lung cancer, well, you may not have known anybody else who had lung cancer in 1954 or whatever it was.",
        "These days, with the Internet, there are support groups out there for every disease, and people who are diagnosed with something can get in touch with hundreds, thousands of other people with the same condition.",
        "That's very true.",
        "And you know, as with everything, it's a double-edged sword.",
        "You know, I think it's an enormous help for people.",
        "Indeed, my own patients, I often suggest that they go on the Internet and look at support groups, in part because sometimes people in the support groups know more than I do about a particular disease because they're up on all the research.",
        "The downside, of course, of this public information is that sometimes misleading facts can be put into play.",
        "And sometimes people get the wrong impression about specific diseases and treatments because the information really isn't filtered in any manner.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line.",
        "And this is Jim, Jim with us from Minneapolis.",
        "Thanks for having me on the air.",
        "I've kind of taken a very public road with my cancer.",
        "I happen to have a - I've been living for 10 years with a brain tumor.",
        "It's similar to Senator Kennedy's and had five reoccurrences.",
        "And when I was diagnosed, I thought I was going to die immediately.",
        "And I've been thankful, have been in several clinical trials, taken several emerging drugs off label, and am doing great today.",
        "I've set up websites, jimsjourney.com, to help people in the similar diagnosis.",
        "And then in 2004, I biked from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., with Lance Armstrong as a member of the Tour of Hope National Team to promote clinical trials.",
        "Enough people don't know that they're a viable option, and they've saved my life several times and to let people know there is tremendous hope.",
        "And going public, I think what you're telling us Jim is, in a way, it saved your life.",
        "It has saved my life, and it continues to.",
        "I mean, in this recurrence right now, I'm on a new drug called Avastin.",
        "And years before, I've taken new emerging treatments that I would not have, you know, maybe learned about had I not been aggressive in learning about my disease and really finding the best options and treatment options.",
        "And that's what people really have to do when they're diagnosed.",
        "So I've tried to share the learning that I've had.",
        "So many people came out of the woodwork and said hey, I've got a brain tumor, my cousin, my somebody and said here's what we've learned and have hope, and call on us for anything.",
        "I've just tried to pay back and be a resource for others starting this journey.",
        "Well, have hope.",
        "Well, Dr. Lerner, that's an important lesson.",
        "It is a very important lesson.",
        "And there are a couple of points I think that Jim's story underscores.",
        "One is that, even if you get the diagnosis of brain cancer, even a glioma, different gliomas act very, very differently.",
        "And a treatment that works for a given person may not work for another person.",
        "That was sort of the point that Elizabeth Edwards was making before.",
        "So, getting the information out there through a website, as was suggested, is really, really important.",
        "Whether that particular journey is going to work for you is very much another story.",
        "The other point that's worth mentioning, as Elizabeth Edwards also said, is the people we're not hearing from today, unfortunately, are some who haven't done as well as some of the people here.",
        "So it's very, very important to get this information out there but also to be realistic that, in some cases, things are going to be very helpful, but for other people, unfortunately, they're not going to work as well."

        "She insisted on not telling even members of our own family.",
        "She kept how bad her status was from us up until the very end.",
        "And it made it really difficult to deal with it for me and my brother, and it made it really difficult for us to even keep the family informed when she died.",

        "Did she ever tell you, Crash, why she wanted to keep it private?",

        "I think things, again, have changed in the last several decades, to the point where, in part because so many cancer patients, whether famous or not, are out there going on walkathons and climbing mountains and all that stuff, people are much, much more comfortable talking about cancer today.",
        "But there's still a segment of people for whom this is a devastating piece of news, and the way they deal with it is working it out themselves within a closed circle of people and keeping things private.",
        "And I think we really, really have to respect that, even though, as Crash suggested, it can sometimes be very difficult for the family.",
        "I think it's also important to realize that, when people are faced with these sort of diseases, depression can become a real issue, and people can isolate themselves.",
