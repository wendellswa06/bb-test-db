        "I'm not trying to say that the Afghan war was totally winnable, that the strategy was right, but if you accept that the president made a decision to send more troops and to fight the war a certain way, his commanders should have then directed those troops to the most critical of areas, and instead what I found was that his effort was plagued by tribalism, not Afghan tribalism, Neal, tribalism at the Pentagon.",
        "This is going to be a three-ring circus.",
        "Because there were people who were dedicated to the counterinsurgency policy, and these include David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, who preceded him as the commander in Afghanistan.",
        "There are people who were then saying no, no, no, we have to deal with counterterrorism, and their spokesman was the vice president of the United States, Joe Biden.",
        "There was an interesting character, though, who you write about a lot, Kael Wilson(ph) - Weston, excuse me, and I hope I'm pronouncing his first name right, but he is a State Department advisor to the Marines down there in Helmand who's saying wait a minute, we don't need a surge of 40,000 people, we need a commitment over time.",
        "We need to be able to tell the Afghans we're going to be here for some period of time even if that means fewer people now.",
        "Yes, and this is why I made Kael Weston a big part of this book.",
        "He's a heroic young American who spent seven years of his life working for the State Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, probably more time in the war zones than any other foreign service officers.",
        "And he supported the initial deployment of troops in Afghanistan, but he came to believe that the surge that Obama would approve later in 2009 was a bad idea.",
        "And you put your finger on it.",
        "He didn't believe that Americans should pack up and go home.",
        "I know a lot of people out there today feel that way.",
        "He didn't believe that, nor did he believe in a go-big approach, in a surge, sock them with everything you've got.",
        "What he thought the Afghans needed and what the Americans needed to do was a more modest go-along strategy to demonstrate to the Afghans a long-term American commitment, to help them with basic security, with some basic assistance to improve their lives but to have the Afghans really do the hard work over time.",
        "And he felt that that would also be the best possible strategy to try to then bring elements of the Taliban to a negotiating table if they saw that the Americans weren't going to leave right away.",
        "Instead he felt we did the wrong thing by sending more forces there for a short period of time.",
        "And that's sort of a nuanced argument here, and that's why this book is a little different than a lot of others that have been written.",
        "It's not a polemic that says let's all pack up and leave, but it's not a sort of hey, hey, everything's going great, let's stay there.",
        "And that's why Kael Weston in my mind was such a compelling figure.",
        "And indeed since you wrote the book, the United States has negotiated an agreement to stay for a decade or so in Afghanistan but at greatly reduced levels and with, we're told, very little of a combat role.",
        "So we want to hear from those of you who have been to Afghanistan, NGOs but obviously most of you in uniform at one time or another.",

        "I think a lot of what we've been trying to do over the past couple years in trying to build sort of a model government there, trying to create local governments and provincial governments, quite frankly that was a little too ambitious, particularly for a country that lacks the resources that Afghanistan does.",
        "Now the focus really is on trying to just have a good enough army and an army that can protect the country and protect its people.",

        "An before long, there was a very vicious, personal fight between members of the National Security Council and the State Department, and it sort of overshadowed what was supposed to be the common purpose of trying to come up with a strategy to get to peace talks to try to end this fighting.",

        "There is still a lot of infighting going on, but after Holbrooke's death, the White House dropped a lot of its objections to sort of policies that Holbrooke was trying to push forward, which suggests to me that their issue really wasn't the substance of the policies, it was who was behind them."
