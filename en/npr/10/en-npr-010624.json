        "They see us heading for the exits, and they realize: Why should we negotiate with them now?",
        "We would have had a better shot at this earlier on, if we hadn't been consumed by infighting over here.",
        "And ultimately, this did a disservice to our men and women in uniform.",
        "And early on, you're talking a lot about the Obama administration, and indeed, Mr. Obama has taken this war on.",
        "As Obama's war, you talk about some of the - whether that's valid or not later in the book.",
        "But, anyway, there were so many opportunities lost in the previous administration, and there is a chapter - I know next to nothing about agricultural policy.",

        "I garden a little bit, but, you know, believe me, a chapter on agricultural policy in the Bush administration moved me almost to tears.",

        "The amount of money we were wasting, hundreds of millions of dollars thrown away, giving Afghans things that they would just take to Pakistan and sell, focusing in on programs that didn't really improve the lives of Afghans, that in fact in some cases had blowback effects and helped to increase poppy production and smuggling and corruption.",
        "So, yes, there are no heroes here.",
        "I'm not trying to suggest that that the Obama administration bears even more responsibility.",
        "You've got - you had two administrations in Washington, both of whom had made their shares of errors in managing the Afghan war, although I do focus a lot on the current administration because they came in - this book really starts in 2009.",
        "They came in promising a smarter war, a better war.",
        "This was supposed to be the team of guys who were going to properly resource Afghanistan after years of strategic drift, you know, taking resources out of Iraq, focusing on Afghanistan.",
        "The problem was you had a Pentagon that sent troops to the wrong places.",
        "You had a State Department that promised a surge of civilians to work with those troops, but the surge came too slowly.",
        "Most of those people were stuck in Kabul.",
        "And on the reconstruction front, the Bushies made a mess of it, but the new team wound up putting way too much money in.",
        "We went from starving Afghanistan to literally turning a fire hose of aid on the country, more than they could reasonably absorb, you know, try to pour $4 billion a year in.",

        "And I wanted to observe that I entirely agree with the caller - with the guest, and I want to say also that there's a financial aspect to this as well as the military aspect that the huge sums of money that have flooded the country from the United States in particular, both through aid and through military contracting, has thrown fuel on the fire of the corruption problem and has also distorted the economy in a way that has really minimized growth that could have happened.",

        "But, you know, and then the caller made a very other good point.",
        "As we reduce these aid budgets, which are inevitably happening over the next couple of years, we may well be causing, you know, a real economic crash.",
        "You have people who are used to certain levels of income.",

        "They're very clean.",
        "Our economic forecasts are for continued growth over the next decade.",
        "Really the critical factor is going to be consistency of aid in the longer term, number one, and how that money is spent, number two.",
        "If it's spent in the way it's spent now by many donors, especially the U.S., where it's direct implementation in the field by U.S.",
        "contractors where 90 percent of the money goes back to the states, it's not worth it.",
