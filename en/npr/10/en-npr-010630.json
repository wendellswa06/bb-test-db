        "And by extension, it involves the media, all of which has been a regular feature of this campaign.",
        "So even before this latest episode, we had gathered our regular panel of newsroom decision-makers that we've been speaking with throughout this unique political cycle to hear about the decisions they've made and will have to make going forward.",
        "Joining us from Philadelphia member station WHYY was Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for the Huffington Post - that's a progressive online publication - Susan Glasser, editor of Politico, David Brody, chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network - which is popular with evangelicals - and our own Michael Oreskes, senior vice president of news and the editorial director here at NPR.",
        "We've put this group together because they represent print and broadcast and so-called legacy media and new media, and also media geared toward specific audiences.",
        "And I started by asking Ryan Grim about how he saw his news organization's role in covering the campaign so far.",
        "I mean, at the Huffington Post, we've done everything we can throughout the campaign to try to resist normalizing this candidate and to show that he's an extremist and he's kind of a unique threat to democracy, which is actually - that's a phrase that the Washington Post editorial board remarkably used I believe a week ago.",
        "Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention, President Obama went so far as to warn about tyranny.",

        "But for too long, the media kind of allowed him to be treated as somebody who is a normal part of the process.",
        "Michael, what do you say about this?",
        "I know that you were particularly impressed with a piece by the New York Times public editor, Liz Spayd, where she says that readers who say they're not conservatives have complained that the Times is biased against the Republican nominee, and that she says that the perception that the paper has a liberal bent is very dangerous and can't continue.",
        "But she also says it's kind of reflective of really a bigger problem, that people are increasingly turning to news sources with a definite liberal or conservative bent and that's really what they're seeking.",
        "What's - first of all, what's your takeaway on the question I ask?",

        "So there's a whole question about that.",
        "There's no question we have a crucial role now, and that crucial role is providing to all of the citizens of the country the information that they need to make sound decisions.",
        "In my view, which is, you know, not the universal view among journalists, our role is not to lean into or away from any particular candidate, but to lean very hard into full-throated information - to reveal whatever needs to be revealed, to explain what needs to be explained.",
        "And one of the reasons I thought that Liz Spayd's column was so important was it really highlighted the dangers of taking sides because once you start partisanizing (ph) your journalism, that's something that can last way beyond any one season.",
        "And one of the real tragedies of this election year would be if, in the end, the legacy of Donald Trump was to drive journalism even further into its corners.",
        "Well, you know, David, you play an interesting role because you actually do something that Liz Spayd has criticized in the sense that you both report on the candidates, but you also write opinion columns.",
        "For example, you had a column scolding people for feeling that they could judge Donald Trump's - the depth of his faith, you know, for example.",
