        "That's correct.",
        "This is a ship that originally left Lisbon in Portugal, went around the Cape in order to get to Mozambique and picked up nearly 500 enslaved Africans on 1794 and was on its way back to Brazil when it was caught in a bad storm and it was sank.",
        "And what happened was that about sort of the crew and half of the enslaved were taken and were rescued, but about 200 Africans perished in the shipwreck.",

        "And these were iron blocks.",

        "You would expect chains or something like that.",

        "You'll find some of that.",
        "The hardest thing to find is wood from the hull of the ship.",
        "And that's what we're hoping to continue to find because that obviously would be the sort of wood that actually the slaves touched every day.",
        "I gather that there was some effort made to save the slaves.",
        "They only managed to save about half of them, but why?",
        "Because the slaves were property, and they were very valuable.",
        "And so we think of the slave trade as what it is, millions of people, one of the greatest horrible migrations in history.",
        "But the reality is that these were people with families, with hopes, with expectations.",
        "And in some ways, part of the goal of a museum like the Smithsonian is to sort of give people their humanity back.",
        "What actually will make it to the exhibit?",
        "I mean, how much will this resemble a ship for a museumgoer?",
        "There was never any desire to try to make it look like a complete ship.",
        "And so what I really hope will happen is that we would just take a few pieces - a piece of ballast, a slave shackle, a piece of wood - and use those as iconic pieces that really would allow you to think about, to remember, to mourn, to humanize those people that were lost.",
        "So it really is more evocative than a kind of formal museum exhibition."
