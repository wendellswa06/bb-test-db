        "Today's sanctions really represent a very, very strong stand against the actions that Iran has been taking and make it very clear that the deal that they struck private - previously was not in the best interests of this country, and that President Trump is going to do everything he can to make sure that Iran has stayed in check.",
        "The sanctions were put in place to respond to Iran's ballistic missile test on Sunday which prompted the White House to put Iran, quote, \"\"on notice.\"\" Today the Treasury Department added 25 individuals and companies in Iran, China, the UAE and Lebanon to a blacklist that was created years ago.",

        "But Matthew Levitt, a former Treasury Department official, says it is Iran that has been acting more aggressively since it agreed to the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - or JCPOA - and he thinks the sanctions make sense.",
        "You need to be careful how you use these tools, but I don't think that this is going to undermine the JCPOA.",
        "And I don't think that our allies are going to take issue with this so long as these designations continue to be based on facts, evidence-based, with good press releases underscoring why these activities were targeted.",
        "Levitt, who's with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, says other countries may not follow suit, but international banks pay attention to Treasury Department lists and could cut their ties.",

        "In fact, Lyerly says, bed rest can cause harm.",
        "The thought has been how could it be bad to have a woman stay in bed for a bit?",
        "It doesn't seem like a dangerous intervention in the same way we think about surgeries or medications.",
        "But, in fact, it is and can be very dangerous.",
        "Lying in bed can cause blood clots, which are potentially fatal.",
