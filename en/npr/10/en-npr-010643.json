        "But it will cost about $8 million to build new walls when the rest of the site is torn down, and to bring in electricity, plumbing and heat.",
        "It'll be worth it, says Mike Montgomery, a consultant for the effort.",
        "This was an integrated, unionized plant where men and women both worked in manufacturing jobs doing equal pay for equal work in the 1940s when that was absolutely not the norm in American industry.",

        "This happened in her early 30s.",
        "But it really made things that didn't matter matter to her.",
        "And she's spent a lot of time, you know, working on that part of herself - of stopping the accumulation - and exactly that of sort of studying what the Buddha said in the sense of, like, how do we let things go?",

        "I could not put it any more eloquently than what Ellen just said.",
        "And I think what's so important and beautiful about all of these movements right now is that we are facilitating the kind of change not only for women in the workplace and in the entertainment business and changing the power dynamics so that there are more women in positions of power who are actually the ones saying, yes, we're going to make a movie that has a different type of ending - but that we're actually changing, you know, the cliches about how women are perceived onscreen and what our value is to stories that are about us.",
        "And I think it's so much - it's so very important to create stories and films and, even in television and even in theater - in new works that feel different and feel truer to the experience of all women.",
        "And that's one of the great things that I see - is just so many women working right now to create more powerful works for ourselves."
