        "Yes, and the city if the Taliban took over, they would have a springboard to take over the rest of the country, just like they did in the 1990s.",
        "So you would think that the planners at the Pentagon, our top commanders, would dispatch most of those forces to help safeguard Kandahar.",
        "Instead, we sent them to another province, to neighboring Helmand province.",
        "Now Helmand is a bad place.",
        "There were a lot of bad guys there.",
        "There was a lot of poppy being grown there, poppy which produces opium, which helps to fuel the Taliban.",
        "But it was less strategically important.",
        "Why?",
        "Why did we send the bulk of that first wave to the other place?",
        "Well, it all goes back to World War II.",
        "Marines fighting on Pacific islands felt that they didn't get enough air cover from Navy planes, and so in the wake of all of that, in Vietnam and in Iraq and now in Afghanistan, the Marines have insisted on essentially bringing their own helicopters, their own logistics units.",
        "They want to fight as a unified taskforce.",
        "That's - you know, there's a rationale for that, Neal.",
        "I'm not...",
        "They're constructed like that.",
        "Yes, but what it meant was that in an environment where we were fighting with our NATO partners, where the Marines would have to work closely with the U.S.",
        "Army, the only place they could get where they could have their own sort of patch of the sandbox, so to speak, was in Helmand, in a part of the country that was home to about one percent of the population.",
        "If our strategy was to be protecting the good people from the bad people, we should have been near the biggest city in the south.",
        "Instead, we were off in a sparsely populated desert.",
        "And I argue in this book, based on a lot of interviews with senior commanders and others, that this was a fundamental mistake.",
        "I'm not trying to say that the Afghan war was totally winnable, that the strategy was right, but if you accept that the president made a decision to send more troops and to fight the war a certain way, his commanders should have then directed those troops to the most critical of areas, and instead what I found was that his effort was plagued by tribalism, not Afghan tribalism, Neal, tribalism at the Pentagon.",
        "Because there were people who were dedicated to the counterinsurgency policy, and these include David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, who preceded him as the commander in Afghanistan.",
        "There are people who were then saying no, no, no, we have to deal with counterterrorism, and their spokesman was the vice president of the United States, Joe Biden.",
        "There was an interesting character, though, who you write about a lot, Kael Wilson(ph) - Weston, excuse me, and I hope I'm pronouncing his first name right, but he is a State Department advisor to the Marines down there in Helmand who's saying wait a minute, we don't need a surge of 40,000 people, we need a commitment over time.",
        "We need to be able to tell the Afghans we're going to be here for some period of time even if that means fewer people now."

        "Yes, and this is why I made Kael Weston a big part of this book.",
        "He's a heroic young American who spent seven years of his life working for the State Department in Iraq and Afghanistan, probably more time in the war zones than any other foreign service officers.",
        "And he supported the initial deployment of troops in Afghanistan, but he came to believe that the surge that Obama would approve later in 2009 was a bad idea.",
        "And you put your finger on it.",
        "He didn't believe that Americans should pack up and go home.",
        "I know a lot of people out there today feel that way.",
        "He didn't believe that, nor did he believe in a go-big approach, in a surge, sock them with everything you've got.",
        "What he thought the Afghans needed and what the Americans needed to do was a more modest go-along strategy to demonstrate to the Afghans a long-term American commitment, to help them with basic security, with some basic assistance to improve their lives but to have the Afghans really do the hard work over time.",
        "And he felt that that would also be the best possible strategy to try to then bring elements of the Taliban to a negotiating table if they saw that the Americans weren't going to leave right away.",
        "Instead he felt we did the wrong thing by sending more forces there for a short period of time.",
        "And that's sort of a nuanced argument here, and that's why this book is a little different than a lot of others that have been written.",
        "It's not a polemic that says let's all pack up and leave, but it's not a sort of hey, hey, everything's going great, let's stay there.",

        "intelligence gathering was on just the bad guys: Who are we going to kill; who are we going to capture?",
        "It hasn't been until recent years that there has been this shift, largely started by General McChrystal.",
        "I have to say Kyle's unit, the second unit he was with, the 10th Mountain Division in southern Afghanistan, really, I think, did an excellent job of what it was assigned to do in terms of beating back the insurgents, trying to rebuild some institutions of governance.",
        "And they had - I'm not going to say her name on air, but a phenomenal intelligence officer at that division level fusing everything together and actually had a remarkable view of all these tribal linkages.",
        "But it's too - it was too late, at least in my view.",

        "I think a lot of what we've been trying to do over the past couple years in trying to build sort of a model government there, trying to create local governments and provincial governments, quite frankly that was a little too ambitious, particularly for a country that lacks the resources that Afghanistan does.",
        "Now the focus really is on trying to just have a good enough army and an army that can protect the country and protect its people.",

        "Yeah, it does, but I mean it's like - General McChrystal actually gave a speech in 2009, it completely agrees with how the complexities of the politics - you can actually look it up on YouTube, it was - actually I want to say given a year before he was replaced with Petraeus.",
