        "Exactly.",
        "It's a great point the caller makes, and what I spell out - this is sort of a remarkable story that I was blown away as I started to uncover it.",
        "You would think as we're sending more troops in there, as the United States is increasing its leverage in Afghanistan, that we would start to work with alacrity to try to find a way to negotiate with some elements of the Taliban.",
        "I don't think a grand deal was possible, but you could cleave off groups here and there because ultimately you're not going to kill every last single - the way this is going to end is through some sort of accommodation between rival factions in Afghan society.",
        "But what happened?",
        "Yes, Neal, this tribalism, but in Washington, between the State Department and the White House.",
        "Soon after Obama took office, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appointed Richard Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat who died in late 2010, as the point man for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
        "But his principal responsibility was going to be to look at trying to peace talks.",
        "He had ended the fighting in the Balkans through the Dayton Accords.",
        "He had served in the Paris peace talks to try to end the Vietnam, a man with great experience.",
        "But he was also a larger-than-life figure with many flaws, rubbed people the wrong way, including a lot of members of President Obama's White House team.",
        "An before long, there was a very vicious, personal fight between members of the National Security Council and the State Department, and it sort of overshadowed what was supposed to be the common purpose of trying to come up with a strategy to get to peace talks to try to end this fighting.",
        "Instead, for more than a year, these various factions in Washington spent more time essentially fighting with one another, often very childishly.",
        "And you would think, and thanks very much for the call, Dan, you would think that that might have been resolved with, sadly, the death of Richard Holbrooke, but it hasn't.",
        "They are still working at cross-purposes.",
        "There is still a lot of infighting going on, but after Holbrooke's death, the White House dropped a lot of its objections to sort of policies that Holbrooke was trying to push forward, which suggests to me that their issue really wasn't the substance of the policies, it was who was behind them.",
        "But unfortunately, Neal, it's sort of too late.",
        "We're bringing troops home.",
        "And so if you're trying to negotiate with somebody, do you negotiate when you're putting in more resources or when you're pulling them out?",
        "The Taliban aren't stupid.",
        "They see us heading for the exits, and they realize: Why should we negotiate with them now?",
        "We would have had a better shot at this earlier on, if we hadn't been consumed by infighting over here.",
        "And ultimately, this did a disservice to our men and women in uniform."

        "And early on, you're talking a lot about the Obama administration, and indeed, Mr. Obama has taken this war on.",
        "As Obama's war, you talk about some of the - whether that's valid or not later in the book.",
        "But, anyway, there were so many opportunities lost in the previous administration, and there is a chapter - I know next to nothing about agricultural policy.",
        "I've grown up in and around the city of New York.",
        "I've lived in London and Washington.",
        "I garden a little bit, but, you know, believe me, a chapter on agricultural policy in the Bush administration moved me almost to tears.",
        "It is heartbreaking.",
        "The amount of money we were wasting, hundreds of millions of dollars thrown away, giving Afghans things that they would just take to Pakistan and sell, focusing in on programs that didn't really improve the lives of Afghans, that in fact in some cases had blowback effects and helped to increase poppy production and smuggling and corruption.",
        "So, yes, there are no heroes here.",
        "I'm not trying to suggest that that the Obama administration bears even more responsibility.",
        "You've got - you had two administrations in Washington, both of whom had made their shares of errors in managing the Afghan war, although I do focus a lot on the current administration because they came in - this book really starts in 2009.",
        "They came in promising a smarter war, a better war.",
        "This was supposed to be the team of guys who were going to properly resource Afghanistan after years of strategic drift, you know, taking resources out of Iraq, focusing on Afghanistan.",

        "But I'm the decider.",
        "The problem was you had a Pentagon that sent troops to the wrong places.",
        "You had a State Department that promised a surge of civilians to work with those troops, but the surge came too slowly.",
        "Most of those people were stuck in Kabul.",
        "And on the reconstruction front, the Bushies made a mess of it, but the new team wound up putting way too much money in.",
        "We went from starving Afghanistan to literally turning a fire hose of aid on the country, more than they could reasonably absorb, you know, try to pour $4 billion a year in.",
        "It just - it fueled many of the problems we're trying to stop, like corruption.",
        "We made those problems worse by the amount of money we threw into the country.",

        "I'm an American citizen paid by an international organization, but I've been working directly in the ministry.",
        "And I wanted to observe that I entirely agree with the caller - with the guest, and I want to say also that there's a financial aspect to this as well as the military aspect that the huge sums of money that have flooded the country from the United States in particular, both through aid and through military contracting, has thrown fuel on the fire of the corruption problem and has also distorted the economy in a way that has really minimized growth that could have happened.",
        "I mean, ironically, a lot less money much better spent would have done far more good than the fire hose that was mentioned.",
        "Secondly...",

        "It's one of the poorest countries on the face of the Earth.",
        "What then becomes of all of that?",
        "But, you know, and then the caller made a very other good point.",
        "As we reduce these aid budgets, which are inevitably happening over the next couple of years, we may well be causing, you know, a real economic crash.",
        "You have people who are used to certain levels of income.",
        "You have a bubble economy that's really built up in Kabul and other cities.",
        "As that money stops flowing in, you could well see, you know, the Afghan equivalent of a recession.",

        "Yes.",
        "One more quick point, Phil.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Sure.",

        "They're very clean.",
        "Our economic forecasts are for continued growth over the next decade.",
        "Really the critical factor is going to be consistency of aid in the longer term, number one, and how that money is spent, number two.",
        "If it's spent in the way it's spent now by many donors, especially the U.S., where it's direct implementation in the field by U.S.",
        "contractors where 90 percent of the money goes back to the states, it's not worth it.",
