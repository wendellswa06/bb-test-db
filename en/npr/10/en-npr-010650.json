        "That's an anti-Bruning ad.",

        "No, the candidate who played it nice got the votes.",
        "Right.",
        "The problem, of course, is that Stenberg had run for the Senate three times already and lost every time.",
        "He was not - he was kind of like old news.",
        "As you say, as you've pointed out, Bruning had a, you know, a questionable record, questionable record, had some ethics problems.",
        "And we saw - we've seen this before.",
        "Quickly going back to Illinois, 1992, Senator Alan Dixon was being attacked by his rival, his chief rival, and a third candidate, Carol Moseley Braun, wound up winning the primary because the other two beat each other up so much.",
        "And that's what happened in Nebraska yesterday.",
        "Two other primaries yesterday.",
        "Any surprises?",
        "No, that would be Idaho and Oregon, just congressional seats up for grabs, nothing to report.",
        "In the meantime, one of the - well, I guess in Highlander terms, in the end there can only be one that's presidential.",
        "Ron Paul pulled out of the presidential stakes, and Mitt Romney is left alone.",
        "Well, he didn't really pull out.",
        "What he - and the media seemed to report that he did pull out, but what he actually did, he told his supporters that he will not go into the 11 states that have not voted yet, but they will fight, continue to fight for delegates in the states that have already voted.",
        "And we've seen in Nevada, in Maine, perhaps this weekend in Minnesota, that a lot of Ron Paul supporters are taking over delegate spots.",
        "Now, remember, he has not won a primary or a caucus all year long, and yet his delegates are doing very well, thank you very much, at the state convention.",
        "We'll be talking more about that later, but Ron Paul no longer campaigning actively for the presidential nomination.",
        "In the meantime, there was - this is graduation season, commencement season, and both the major party political candidates, the expected Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, was at - this is Liberty University.",
        "Jerry Falwell established that, and this was where he was addressing some people, the evangelical community that he expects to be part of his electoral base.",
        "People of different faiths, like yours and mine, sometimes will wonder where we can meet in common purpose, when there are so many differences in creed and theology.",
        "Surely the answer is that we can meet in service, in shared moral convictions about our nation stemming from a common worldview."

        "Well, here's the story.",
        "I mean, obviously that he's had a lot of problems with evangelical voters.",
        "We saw that during the caucuses and the primaries.",
        "But when it comes down to Mitt Romney versus Barack Obama, evangelical conservatives have really only one place to go, and you'll see that more and more supporters from that point of view are backing Mitt Romney.",
        "Particularly as gay marriage becomes an issue again, and again, more about that a little later in the program.",
        "In the meantime, President Obama went to what I guess can be regarded as his political base.",
        "He addressed the graduates at Barnard College in New York and talked about women and their role in politics.",
        "One reason we're actually refighting long-settled battles over women's rights is because women occupy fewer than one in five seats in Congress.",
        "Now, I'm not saying that the only way to achieve success is by climbing to the top of the corporate ladder or running for office, although let's face it, Congress would get a lot more done if you did.",
        "And that a predictable applause line.",
        "True, but of course if President Obama really cared about women in higher office, he would have let Hillary Clinton win the nomination in 2008.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "But obviously, look, the Democratic Party is trying to make the point that the Republican Party has this, quote, war on women, and this is part of the Obama campaign strategy."
