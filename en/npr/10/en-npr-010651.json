        "Well, that's exactly right, and obviously the Obama campaign realizes that for all the talk that Mitt Romney is talking about his business acumen, what he did at Bain Capital with the buying of companies, laying off workers, you know, buying and selling companies, what side is Mitt Romney really on, that's the Obama campaign commercial.",
