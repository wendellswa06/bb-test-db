        "We have almost a third Republicans, a third Democrats and one-third independent voters.",
        "And I think those independents are, at least what I hear, is they're probably leaning towards Obama right now.",

        "Earlier this month, Paul supporters took a majority of the delegate slots in Nevada and Maine despite the fact that Mitt Romney won the primaries in both those states.",
        "Former Nevada Governor Bob List was set to serve as a Republican delegate for Romney at the GOP convention in Tampa, a slot that went instead to a Ron Paul supporter.",
        "And Governor List joins us now by phone from Las Vegas.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Yeah, nice to join you, thank you.",
        "So what happened?",
        "Well, the Ron Paul people showed up, and the Romney people did not.",
        "There were a total of - for example from Clark County, which is the Las Vegas area, which is the largest proportion of the state, the delegates from Clark County were entitled to have 2,900 in number, and only about 1,500 showed up, and most of them were Ron Paul people.",
        "And so they simply took control of the convention and elected their people to be delegates.",
        "One thing I would point out that - just for clarity is that I will continue to serve as national committeeman until the end of the convention.",
        "So I will be a delegate.",
        "Oh, so you will be at Tampa, forgive me."

        "I will be a delegate, but actually there are only going to be I think six delegates who are Romney people personally, out of the total of 28 delegates.",
        "So the Ron Paul people will be out in force.",
        "Doesn't that tend to subvert the purpose of the primary election or the caucus?",
        "Yeah, caucuses are what we have here, and it truly does.",
        "But, you know, the lesson is that the campaign has to educate the people that are chosen at the caucus to move forward to the county convention, then to the state convention.",
        "And if they don't, they're just - they're going to lose their position.",
        "And it's a little confusing at times, I guess, for people to understand it, but the way it works simply is that at the caucus, you take a vote at each caucus around the state on who they favor for president.",
        "And of course Romney won a little over 50 percent of the total vote.",
        "And had those people then gone on and shown up, showed up at the county convention and showed up at the state convention, they would have continued to dominate.",
        "But they didn't.",
        "And Ron Paul people, who only had 19 percent at the caucus, were motivated and driven, and they came out and took control, and of course the majority rules.",
        "They won it fair and square.",
        "Ken?",
        "Governor List, so the Ron Paul delegates who have been elected to the state convention are pledged to vote for Romney at the national convention on the first ballot.",
        "They say if it goes to a second ballot, then they could choose whoever they want, presumably Ron Paul.",
        "First of all, nobody thinks the convention is going to a second ballot.",

        "What's their aim?",

        "They want to be noticed.",
        "They want to feel that they're playing a part.",

        "They'll probably get, I'd say, a fair amount media attention at the convention.",
        "They'll speak out and express themselves.",
        "But in the long run, obviously Romney is going to win it on the first ballot.",
        "And the Ron Paul people, hopefully, will then come alongside as we move toward November.",
        "Given the fact that Nevada is a swing state, both parties are actively trying to win the state, is there a chasm between Romney and Paul supporters that could hurt the party's unity for November?",
        "Well, there's certainly a bit of a chasm.",
        "Some of the Ron Paul people are, you know, expressing the thought that Romney is equivalent to Obama, which I think is certainly far from being accurate.",
        "And I think as the election comes along, the chasm will begin to close because certainly the Romney campaign, the Republican Party, is going to point out the significant differences and the fact that that Romney is far more conservative - certainly in a fiscal sense and in a social sense - than Mr. Obama.",
        "And in the end I think they'll be on board."

        "Is there a lack of enthusiasm, a lack of organization?",
        "What?",
        "I think there's a certain lack of organization, there's no question about it.",
        "And now, with the Ron Paul people having captured control of the state party, there's - we have a bit of a dysfunctional apparatus from a party standpoint, because they've never run anything like this before and probably are not going to be as effective as would have otherwise been the case on behalf of Romney.",
        "So there's a lot of work to be done in the state of Nevada.",
        "What practical difference does that make?",
        "Well, it's all about, as we know, getting - identifying potential voters that are not registered, getting them registered and then getting them out to the polls on Election Day.",
        "And so it's a matter of grassroots organization and, you know, boots on the ground to motivate people to turn out and vote.",

        "Well, hopefully they'll be organizing in the short term for the election of Mitt Romney because they - while they might have a broader agenda long term, it's certainly isn't going to be well-served by the continuation of the Obama policies.",
        "I think they honestly believe that some day they will be a majority of - in their thinking - of the party on a national level.",
        "At least that's their stated objective.",
        "And of course they have a long way to go to reach that point.",
        "They had - I think they had also hoped that they would get five states in which a majority of the delegates were - to the national convention - were Ron Paul supporters, so that they could actually put his name in nomination.",
        "That is required under the rule - that is, to have those five states joined together in order to qualify to nominate their candidate.",
        "I don't believe they've reached that goal at this stage.",
        "And whether they're still pursuing that, I guess, is an open question.",
        "But they have both the short-term and long-term goals, and they are, to a large extent, quite libertarian in their thinking.",
        "They're very independent.",

        "Ken?",
        "Governor List, if Ron Paul had won the caucuses in February and Mitt Romney elected delegates to the state convention, I would suspect that the Ron Paul people would be up in arms, but it seems like the Romney people are not contesting this or upset even.",
        "Well, they don't have a position to contest it.",
        "They simply didn't do their job in showing up.",
        "They've closed their headquarters in Nevada after the caucus.",
        "I think that was ill-advised.",
        "They moved their staff onto another state after the caucuses and simply didn't follow through and organize like they should have.",
        "And I think they've learned a lesson.",
        "They take Nevada seriously, of course, as a bellwether, a swing state, a battleground state.",
        "And so I think that there's been a serious wakeup call.",
        "And fortunately it's come early enough that there's plenty of time to correct it."
