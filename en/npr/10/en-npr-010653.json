        "Why don't we start with how much access to these loans figure in decision-making by students and their parents about where to go to college?",
        "I'm not sure that actually plays much of a role.",
        "I think the decisions are made prior to looking at the funding, this is what we are going to do.",

        "...or UCLA...",

        "The Stafford loans that they've been talking about in the news these days, those loans only offer a maximum undergraduate level education of $23,000.",
        "So you could be talking about less than one year at one of the private schools you mentioned.",
        "So they're probably going to end up taking a look at other loans.",
        "Oftentimes, there's the parent-plus loans, which are already at a higher interest rate of 7.9 percent.",
        "And that's the loan that is on the parent, whereas the Stafford loan, that is the one that the student has themselves."

        "And the student loans, how easy are they to get, and then how easy are these other loans to get?",
        "Surprisingly easy to get student loans of some sort or another.",
        "Remember, it's not the strangest thing to imagine that the academic institutions who want the students to come, want them to pay the tuition, they actually do a great deal of helping in students finding the loans that are going to suit them best.",
        "And at the end of the day, if they can't get federally funded loans with federal aid, you have institutional loans directly from the school themselves, or some sort of outsourced institution.",
        "We might want to remind people that student loans - inexpensive student loans came about as a way of encouraging students to go to college and making college affordable...",

        "And there's a time that I look back on - with some of the greatest music made in hip-hop, it has definitely changed.",
