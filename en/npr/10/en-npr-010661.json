        "Thank you so much.",
        "Thanks for having us.",
        "And I'm Steve Inskeep.",
        "We know who voters supported on Super Tuesday.",
        "Now here's our chance to ask why.",
        "NPR's Juan Williams has been analyzing the results for us throughout this morning.",
        "And Juan, let's focus on the Republican side and a couple of important states.",
        "First, California.",
        "We know the results, John McCain won.",
        "It was a state that Mitt Romney really wanted to win.",
        "Now, what did some voters tell pollsters on their way out of the voting places?",
        "Pretty interesting, Steve.",
        "If you look at the numbers here, over the last three days John McCain really came on strong.",
        "I suppose that was helped along by endorsements coming from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as the likes of Jack Kemp and Rudy Giuliani.",
        "But if you ask voters, for example, about the Bush administration - and about 58 percent of the California Republicans said they had a positive feeling about the Bush administration - McCain won that about 39 to 33.",
        "So it's pretty close, but still a win.",
        "But they had a negative perception of President Bush's administration - and 42 percent of California Republicans said they did - then it was overwhelming for John McCain, 42 to 27.",
        "The only category of Republicans who really favored Mitt Romney described themselves as very conservative.",
        "Even if it was just somewhat conservative, it went overwhelmingly for John McCain.",
        "One last point here, Steve.",
        "If you ask Republicans in California which of the candidates shared their values, they said by 35 to 27, Romney over McCain.",
        "But when it came to the best chance to win in November, 68 percent said John McCain would be that candidate for the Republicans.",
        "We should point out for those who haven't been following this closely that many conservatives have said their suspicious of John McCain, Rush Limbaugh and other talk show hosts have been campaigning against him, but you're saying that even if voters agree with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, they felt that McCain was their best chance to win?",
        "The best chance to win.",
        "This is really become a determinative fact, a strong argument for John McCain.",
        "We saw this in Florida, we saw it in South Carolina, and now we're seeing it very large in California, a state that's, you know, it's different west coast and all.",
        "I mean, for example, on an issue like illegal immigration, it's a big issue in California.",
        "People who said they want to deport all illegal aliens said, oh yeah, Mitt Romney's our guy, like 40 to 29.",
        "But when it comes to offering citizenship or temporary work status, there you see a 20-point margin for John McCain.",
        "So it's on these issues, Steve, where you see McCain, you know, sometimes is out of step with the Republican base.",
        "But when it comes to the winning in November, they're saying overwhelmingly, 68 percent.",
        "That's, there's no margin of error there, Steve.",
        "Let's check in briefly with another state, Tennessee.",
        "And there we know the result, Mike Huckabee defeated both McCain and Mitt Romney, and what did voters say there?",
        "Well, this was a pretty close race because Huckabee gets 34 to McCain's 31, Romney trails with 24.",
        "Over the last day, Huckabee was coming on strong.",
        "But in the last three days it was really a Romney and McCain surge, and they split that vote.",
        "Republicans, people who are self-identified as Republicans were 37 percent for Huckabee, 31 percent for McCain.",
        "Only 25 percent for Romney, very disappointing for him.",
        "And among people who were very conservative in self-identification, 40 percent for Huckabee.",
        "Now, we come back to something we saw in California, Steve.",
        "If you ask people about shared values with the candidates, Huckabee won 49 percent of those votes.",
        "But when you ask them, who is the Republican who can win in November?",
        "Fifty-eight percent, Steve, said John McCain.",
        "Among born-again, white Evangelicals, 42 percent for Huckabee, but 29 percent for McCain.",
        "Mitt Romney, only 19 percent.",
        "So you can see even on an issue like the economy, Huckabee and a McCain split, but Romney, who would hope that issue would carry him to victory, only 17 percent."

        "Deeper problems for Toyota, but what about for Japan?",
        "Toyota is the country's biggest automaker, and its biggest market is right here in the United States.",
        "Robert Madsen, a Japan scholar at the MIT Center for International Studies, says the Toyota crisis is just a tiny piece of what he calls much bigger problems for Japan's economy.",
        "And what are they?",

        "Peak to trough, Japan's GDP probably fell by seven or seven and a half percent, which makes it...",
        "Fell by seven or seven and a half percent.",
        "Yeah, which makes it three times as bad as what's happening to the United States right now.",
        "Now, the 1990s in Japan has, of course, been called the lost decade.",
        "This was an extended period of economic stagnation, right?",
        "yes.",
        "But my understanding is that Japan managed to crawl out of it around 2002.",
        "What I don't understand is: Why is what is happening now hitting Japan harder than here in the United States if other countries, like European countries, for example, seem to be weathering the crisis better?",
        "This is a very broad question.",
        "Those of us who kind of grew up after World War II are used to a situation globally where there's more demand than supply.",
        "And that means that people bid up prices of goods and services.",
        "Inflation is a problem."

        "There was too little demand for goods and services.",
        "Prices tended to fall.",
        "And frankly, Japan resembles that sort of 19th century economic problem.",
        "There's too much savings in Japan.",
        "Exactly.",
        "What happened was the savings rate in Japan was very high in the 1980s, and it did not come down.",
        "And of course, if people don't spend, economies shrink.",
        "So what happened in the 1990s was Japan had no alternative but to increase government spending very dramatically.",

        "And so, by inducing these arrhythmias, you can induce the heart attack.",
        "It's very logical that if you reduce the stress and increase your laughter, so to speak, you - and the evidence is there, we've documented it as well as others - that you lower your stress hormones that are responsible for inducing some of those heart attacks.",
        "And In your most recent study, just of 14 people, you showed that laughter had similar effect as regular exercise.",

        "And in a study that we just did not too long ago and presented, actually, on Tuesday at the experimental biology meetings 2010 in Anaheim, California, we showed that the response of the appetite hormones is very similar with the use of mirthful laughter as it is with - to exercise.",

        "We showed, through the 1990s, that the immune system is actually enhanced -various components of the immune system are enhanced.",
        "That's - the same thing happens with exercise, by the way.",
        "That's why individuals who exercise on a regular basis have a lower propensity to infections and cancers.",
