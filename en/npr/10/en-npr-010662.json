        "I guess I just - I sort of fell in love with this woman, Karen, that I played.",
        "And it kind of brings back memories, brings back memories of when we were making the picture and trying to find these little delicate moments that Rodrigo had written.",
        "Rodrigo, how much rope did you give Annette Bening?",
        "Was Karen the sort of fully-formed character in your mind, very specific idea of how she would look and act and move and interact?",
        "Or did you essentially present the character and let Annette inhabit it as she would?",
        "You know, I always think of the script as a contract.",
        "I think it's important to sit down with the actor and agree on the fundamental, you know, on the fundamentals of the script and the fundamentals of the story so that you avoid surprises like in the middle of the set, you know, disagreeing as to how the story should end, et cetera.",
        "But beyond that, you know, I don't.",

        "When I read it initially, and as I discussed it with Rodrigo a little bit, I just felt that was so important that at the beginning of the story that you're watching a woman that's getting it wrong.",
        "There's something in her that I felt like I'd seen a lot around me or we see around us all the time that we bump up against somebody in our lives whether they're at work, or maybe you see them in the grocery store or wherever but the person clearly has issues.",

        "The good part for me and the necessary part, in a way, I think, in order to really fall in love with her, was she ends up in middle age finding a way to get over things and dump some of her baggage and find some peace.",
