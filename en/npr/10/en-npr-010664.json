        "Yeah, it's kind of a long link.",
        "Now, as you mentioned, from 2002 to 2007, the country got out of its mess a little bit, but that wasn't because of anything which happened within Japan.",
        "That was because of the surge in growth in the United States and in China.",
        "In other words, we were buying more Japanese products.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now, the problem is that when the subprime crisis triggered this global financial meltdown, Japan lost that external demand.",
        "Foreigners weren't buying Japanese goods and services anymore.",
        "So the country fell right back into its 1990s illness.",
        "Now, in other parts of the world, there are decision being taken or that were taken that are having ripple effects not only here in the U.S.",
        "but also in Japan, and I'm thinking about what's happening in Europe right now.",
        "Can you explain the connection between what's happening in Europe and the consequences, the potential consequences, for us here in the U.S.",
        "and people in Japan?",
        "What you're alluding to, I think, is the Greek crisis, where the Greek government has a massive national debt, not massive by Japanese standards, but massive, and the deficit is huge, and creditors are starting to say I'm not going to lend to you.",
        "So what's happening is the Greek government could conceivably default and may have to leave the Euro.",
        "If that were to happen, in fact if we get anywhere near that, you would see financial pressures mount on other countries that have big debts and deficits like Spain, Portugal, Ireland."

        "Now, to that extent, investors are going to say I don't really trust the Euro because the thing could fall apart.",
        "They will therefore take their investment money, put it into the dollar or the yen, which are perceived as the two safe haven currencies.",
        "That would push up the value of the yen and the dollar, make it much more difficult for exporters in both countries to earn money.",
        "So is Japan of the 1990s or even Japan of today a cautionary tale for the United States?",
        "Yes, Japan is very much a cautionary tale.",
        "The problem is we don't know what it means.",
        "We have two different economies, the U.S.",
        "and Japan, that have experienced similar problems, had have responded in dissimilar ways.",
        "So far, the U.S.",
        "response appears to have been better, but we don't really have an example of aggressive government action actually solving the problem.",
        "So I would say that right now, we can't say whether or not we've done much better than Japan.",

        "Well, I would want to say that because we're finite, and we all have a limited starting point, it's not a question of whether we have faith; it's what we have faith in.",
        "And so, Christopher, I think, has faith in the role of scientific inquiry, rational inquiry.",
        "He has faith in that process.",
        "And without assuming that process, he can't demonstrate the need for using that process.",
        "In short, he has faith or confidence in - that that is going to be better than the alternative.",

        "Oh, certainly.",

        "No.",

        "I could have a light show inside my skull, behind my eyes and between my ears.",
        "But that subjective reality is worthless, ultimately, unless there's a correspondence between what I'm experiencing subjectively and an objective reality out there.",

        "That force would be the dialectic, which in reason doubts science and inquiry.",
        "I thought you were going to ask about another kind of force.",
        "I mean, I think that there is in us, equally innate, a desire for the numinous and the transcendent.",
        "So you might say the ecstatic, the things that express themselves in the form of music, love, art, architecture and so forth.",
        "And religion can claim a great deal of credit in, so to speak, stirring and cultivating that impulse, but I think that impulse is with us whether we believe it's a supernatural one or not.",
        "I think a great cultural task is actually to come to terms with our need for the transcendent, for the numinous, without prostrating ourselves before gods that we've, ourselves, made."
