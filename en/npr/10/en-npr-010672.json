        "Well, we just purchased the home in February, and we had the storm shelter company install it the day after we closed because we wanted to make sure to get it in.",
        "And it only took about four hours for them to install it.",
        "That's interesting, so it's not a gigantic inconvenience to you structurally to have it put in.",
        "No, no, the house is all finished.",
        "It just takes about four hours, and it's ready to use.",
        "All right, Graham, thanks very much for your call from Yukon, Oklahoma.",
        "And I want to see if we can go back to Larry Tanner, who is the manager of the Debris Impact Test Facility, who studies these things.",

        "What's your story in regard to shelters?",
        "Hi, I was - I live in Oklahoma City, and I was recently in the tornado.",
        "My parents live about two miles from where the tornado hit, and I was at school.",
        "I teach at a community college.",
        "And they were with my two-year-old daughter in the hall and with no storm shelter.",
        "And I was watching it on television and it was just absolutely harrowing.",
        "It was coming straight for our house.",
        "So you're in it, and you're watching it come at you.",
        "Yes, I was in Midwest City, and it was very close to Midwest City also.",
        "So it was - there were several circulations at the time.",
        "But yeah, it was - I think it was the scariest thing I've experienced thus far as a parent.",
        "And so after that my mom just said I can't go through this again, I just - we have to get a storm shelter.",
        "So...",
        "And Kristen, why wasn't there one before?",
        "And I'm not asking that in a critical way.",
        "I'm asking that as, you know, I'm sitting in Washington, D.C., and then I see what happens and a kind of thought crosses your mind, well, why doesn't everybody have one already?",
        "There's got to be reasons.",
        "What are the reasons for that?",
        "Well, there are a couple of reasons.",
        "One of the first reasons is that rarely homes are built with basements in Oklahoma City.",
        "So - and they're - I think it has to do with the water level.",
        "So there's - it's hard to get underground.",
        "And I think that we're sort of immune to it, in a way.",
        "There are tornado watches, tornado warnings all the time, and I think until the 1999 tornado, I mean we just sort of ignored it a lot of times because it just happens so often."

        "We also have them built out of different construction types, from concrete to steel.",
        "And just depending on where a person lives at, that kind of determines what equipment we can and cannot use and install the various shelters that we have.",
        "And we like to try to go out and meet with the client, survey the land and then talk with them and see what their needs are and then try to fulfill that for them.",
        "So I heard a price tag of $3,200, and my sense was that that person was talking about a shelter that would hold a family of four or five people.",
        "What do you think that they're talking about?",
        "Is that obviously something prefabricated, he had it sunk in his garage?",
        "Is it a fiberglass product normally or...",
        "It would probably be a steel - they make a steel, and they do make steel fiberglass shelters also.",
        "That would - but that - for that price range that would probably be a steel in-ground storm shelter up in the Oklahoma area.",
        "Oh, you mean as a sort of Cold War bomb shelter..."

        "I do want to ask you a different question.",
        "Why do people hold off, do you think, on making this investment?",
        "I just think it's one of those items, sir, that is out of sight, out of mind, and then one day when day when they see the devastation and destruction, the injuries and the death, then people just wake up and decide, you know, we really need to invest in one and have it done.",
        "It's - but it's just one of those products that, you know, if it isn't on the news, it's just out - you know, they put it on the back burner.",
        "We've had several clients call us that have told us in the last 10 days that they've been paying to call us for the last three to six months, and now they're doing it.",
        "We've had clients that we've seen two years ago call us back.",
        "Are the shelters themselves always safe?",
        "I mean I'm imagining people think in terms - I'm going to go down there for 15 minutes, maybe an hour, until everything blows over.",
        "But if you're in a shelter and debris ends up being on top of you, are you safe if you're trapped inside a shelter?",
        "Well, most all the storm shelters, especially if they've been approved and tested at Texas Tech Wind Engineering, they're required to have X amount of square inch of ventilation per the size of the shelter.",
        "And unless it's just really covered up, and it would have to be, you know, compounded covered up, such as dirt impact on top, you're going to have enough ventilation in there.",
        "Any good storm shelter company is going to really put more ventilation than is the actual requirement on there.",
        "But I would - you know, we have in-ground steel and in-ground concrete both, but our in-ground concrete is built in such a way where it's half above-ground and half below-ground.",
        "And we cover over the top of it, you know, with backfilled dirt, just sort of a mound over the top.",
        "But our door is on a 45-degree angle.",
        "You know, so in the event that there is debris on top of it, you would use a floor jack to - and a couple braces, you know, to jack the door up to try to let air inflow in and the same thing for the in-ground steel shelters.",
        "You can use a come-along...",
        "Bill, can I ask you to hold on for just a second because we need to take a break?",
        "And I'm going to come back to you, and Larry Tanner is joining us again.",

        "Today Sooners around the states are warily once again eyeing the weather reports because meteorologists are tracking some storms that could develop later today.",
        "They're predicted to deliver winds up to 80 miles an hour and hail the size of tennis balls.",
        "There is in the forecast mention of another possible tornado, and if it materializes, it could send residents right back down into their storm shelters.",
        "And that's what we're talking about, storm shelters.",

        "He is the manager of the Debris Impact Test Facility at the Wind Science and Engineering Research Center at Texas Tech University.",
        "Larry, thanks for your patience.",
        "You were with us earlier, and we had a little bit of communication problem.",
        "But you were talking about the - really the requirements of a shelter, what it needs to stand up to, and that's what you test.",
        "I'm also interested to hear from you about really the challenges of the terrain itself and the soil itself, because we understand that in Moore, Oklahoma, the soil is not terribly conducive to placing a shelter underground.",
        "And I want to understand what that's about.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, you can have rocky soils, you can have expansion soils, you can have a high water table, all of which pretty well rule out any kind of underground excavation for a shelter.",
        "So that leaves you with the, you know, the aboveground safe room concept.",
        "And we, you know, we've seen a number of those this investigation, and folks in those shelters were quite safe, and the shelter performed admirable, even though their houses didn't.",
        "So it sounds as though this is not - this is not a technological challenge, that the manufacturers and the people who install, like Bill Stegman, they're - they have the product that's needed, it hits the standards.",
        "Yes, the thing is, the thing is that these shelters need to be tested because first of all the door is the most vulnerable, and, you know, that's - you open that door in the middle of a storm or get it knocked open by flying debris, then the occupant extremely danger.",
        "We also test doors for below-ground shelters because we see, we see doors that are blown off of below-ground shelters.",
        "We see below-ground shelters that only have one lock, and the FEMA and ICC 500 standard requires a minimum of two locks at the conclusion of the testing but recommends the use of three locks for all shelter doors.",
        "That way you've got some redundancy if you lose one."

        "Sure.",
        "I wanted to, you know, mention that my family and I are all from Oklahoma, I grew up here.",

        "We have all lived in Oklahoma our entire lives, and I've never lived in a home that had a shelter.",
        "...against nuclear attack.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And I think the point should be made that for a lot of families who are poor and in these more rural areas, you know, $3,000 is a lot of money, and that's one of the cheapest shelters, and those are the ones that go usually in the garage and are kind of frightening because they're sort of right by your house, so the possibility of having debris trap you in the shelter is very, very likely.",
        "But the cost, you know, $3,000 is really something that's - you know, it's not possible, it's prohibitive for a lot of families who have incomes that are, you know, $24,000 a year or less.",
        "So, you know, that's one point, but then another thing that I also wanted to mention is my family right now, we live in a rental home.",
        "And it doesn't have shelter.",
        "In fact, I know a lot of homes that are rented that don't have shelters, and the landlords are not really very perceptive because of the cost of installing the shelter.",
        "They're not particularly perceptive to putting one in.",
        "But it puts a lot of families who don't own their homes, you know, in danger.",
        "Public - a lot of public facilities here in Oklahoma also don't have underground shelters.",
        "I work for the University of Oklahoma, and though we have some buildings that have underground areas, basement-type, you know, underground areas, there's not an underground shelter on campus.",
        "My son's daycare doesn't; a lot of the schools don't.",
        "So this is - I mean, this is really a conversation that needs to be had, so I really appreciate that you're focusing on it today.",
