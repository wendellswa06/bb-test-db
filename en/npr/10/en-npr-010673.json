        "In terms of after a disaster like this, is there often a discussion?",
        "Does the discussion take place about whether building codes and construction regulation should require, require shelters be included in new construction?",
        "I know that the mayor of Moore, Mayor Glenn Lewis, said he's going to seek a mandate that all new homes in Moore would have to have underground storm shelters, and we have an estimate that that'll add $4,000 to the price.",
        "Does this conversation tend to come and go with the level of disaster?",
        "Well yes, it does, you know, out of sight, out of mind does take place.",
        "It will occur probably six months from this disaster.",
        "But in answer to your caller, the 2015 International Building Code will require shelters in schools and in public buildings.",
        "That will be a requirement, you know, throughout, you know, the tornado regions.",
        "Now municipalities can have the, you know, the authority to keep that verbiage in the codes or to modify that verbiage in the codes.",
        "So that's, you know, not only states' rights, but it's also city rights and taxpayer rights.",
        "But certainly, you know, these public places and schools, you know, need to have shelters because, you know, our children are the future of our families and our country.",
        "Bill Stegman, again you're south, you're in Dallas, Texas, but also a tornado-prone area, and you make your living installing shelters.",
        "And Larry Tanner was just talking about what I guess we would call a communal shelter, a shelter large enough to service a school or maybe a nursing home or something like that.",
        "And I'm curious to know: Is that the trend?",
        "Is there a trend more towards building shelters for full neighborhoods or for large groups of people as opposed to the house-by-house-by-house shelter?",
        "I'm aware of a few towns here in Texas that have built community shelters, more out in the rural area.",
        "I haven't personally received very many calls from municipalities or cities requesting any info on that.",
        "We have recently built one for a school district where they were going to put in their computer systems.",
        "So in the event, you know, that something's going to happen today, I guess they wouldn't be totally dysfunctional there.",
        "But I do believe that that is going to be the trend, more so coming down the line from here."

        "She says: I was skeptical when my mother decided to have an in-ground shelter installed last spring.",
        "As a 35-year resident of Oklahoma City, she had an increasing fear that the storms and tornadoes were becoming more violent and more frequent.",
        "After seeking shelter in our subterranean structure three times last week, I am now a believer.",
        "I find that interesting because her mother is older and, you know, on this coast, on the East Coast, when we have people who live down by the beaches and hurricanes come in, it's often the older people who won't - who don't see the threat.",
        "And here, Stephanie's mom, who is older, is beginning to become more concerned about the threat.",
        "And Jane Lawton - I'm sorry.",
        "Jane of Lawton, Oklahoma, she says: Lawton is 90 miles from Oklahoma City.",
        "We installed a shelter two years ago, and a few weeks ago, when circulatory winds passed right over our house, they went downstairs.",

        "Sometimes - pardon me.",
        "Sometimes it can, depending on what type of soil conditions and foundation conditions you're working with.",
        "Sometimes, it can take 10 hours to do that very same one here in Dallas, Texas, and sometimes two days.",
        "But we have a large rock problem here.",
        "And then also, in our area here, most of the homes are built with post-tension cabling.",

        "So when they go to refinance or rebuild, they can add that storm shelter on.",

        "But there's no great conversation here about installing shelters.",

        "Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.",
        "But where do you draw the line on deciding whether you're at risk for this?",
        "Well, virtually any place east of the Rocky Mountains is susceptible to tornadoes.",
