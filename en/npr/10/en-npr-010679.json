        "And the father, Big Nate as he's called, he is somebody who escaped that life and tried to raise a family that would avoid some of the problems that he had when he was a kid.",
        "Yes.",
        "And he and his wife, Trina, thought they were doing everything that they could to protect themselves from the violence that is so prevalent in their neighborhood.",
        "They were a family that had endured, as you said Nate had this, you know, hard background and changed his life, became a deacon.",
        "They felt they needed to get their kids in church.",
        "Trina, who came from - whose family is from Alabama, felt the best way to raise their family is good, you know, with good Southern tradition.",
        "They all went to church together.",
        "They took trips together.",
        "They were a family that believed that if they did all the right things that it would all work out for them.",
        "But sometimes, especially when you live in a neighborhood that is prone to this sort of brazen and random violence, you can't escape the gun violence.",
        "It finds you.",
        "Akilah Johnson, there are other places in Boston that are at least as poverty stricken as Geneva-Bowdoin.",
        "There are other places that have the same kind of ethnic - why is this neighborhood in particular so vulnerable to gun violence?",
        "I mean that's a great question.",
        "It's the why that kind of drove the program, and it's the project.",
        "And it's the why that - we have lots of theories, and residents and, you know, community workers and youth workers have theories as to the why.",
        "But I don't necessarily know that we found hard and fast answers to the why, to be very honest.",
        "You know, there is an issue of complacency amongst some community organizations, you know, we found in our reporting and through going through the archives of previous stories, where once something works and you flood a community with resources and you flood it with attention and you flood it with a certain amount of physical activity and intensity, it's hard to kind of keep that same level and that same threshold of attention up.",
        "And so once things start to, you know, get better or improve or work to some extent, a certain amount of complacency sets in from what we found from previously.",
        "Then there's...",
        "There's a story - I just wanted to illustrate that there's a story you tell about one of your 68 blocks as a notorious place for abandoned houses and crack houses, that sort of thing.",
        "And there was enormous effort from the city and from private developers to bring it up, to improve it.",
        "And then by the time you are reporting there, it's fallen back into its old ways.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So one of the other reporters in the project spend a lot of time on Hendry Street, and it was an effort where the - that is a street where the city took an enormous effort and paid an enormous amount of attention to - as well some community organizations, you know, buying up houses that had been problem houses and rehabbing them and redeveloping them and getting rid of problem tenants and problem landlords.",
        "And things have gotten so much better.",
        "And then there was a bit of backsliding that happened.",
        "And so while we were there this summer, it was an effort to climb back up that hill and right some of those wrongs that had started to take hold again.",
        "And actually after the series ran and was published, just within the past maybe week or so there was an announcement by federal authorities that there had been this huge raid on several gangs in Dorchester, one of them being some folks that lived on Hendry Street that had been causing quite a bit of problems for resident there, as the series had deemed one house in particular the Cancer House, and they were able to shut that down, get rid of the problem tenants.",
        "And with them, you know, they were running drug operations, gun operations, from that house.",
        "And so it's not that we propagated that.",
        "But that just kind of shows that cycle, that ebb and flow of attention and lack thereof, and how things can flare up and fall back as a city and neighborhoods try and combat this problem.",
        "And Meghan Irons, tell us about some of these gangs, the kids who are - members say these aren't gangs.",
        "These are my friends, my ciphers."

        "But there are people who are working tirelessly to ensuring that this community remains safe, that young men who are involved in gangs are given opportunities so they can get off gangs, that families are sending their children to school and college and that this is a viable and thriving community but for the fact that there are streets that plague this neighborhood and kill so many kids and destroy the reputation of this neighborhood.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "That's a perfect answer.",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, it's very hard for people to pick out who is a gang member and who isn't a gang member.",
        "Some of the signs are very obvious (unintelligible) you might have a group of kids living on a particular street who claim that street, represent the name, wear a certain color, take on a certain, you know, sports - the jerseys and hats from certain sports teams.",
        "But sometimes - the street gangs in Boston are just your son having to make a decision on his way from home to school whether or not he's going to fight through the already established gang members who are on the street, who are trying to rob him, who are asking him where are you from, not necessarily meaning where do you live, but what street you represent, what street gang do you represent?",
        "And that boy, you know, maybe at age 13 or 12, begins to decide how is he going to protect himself from home to school.",
        "And what we found in some of the young men that we spoke with, they've had to make these decisions to fight with their fists at first and then to arm themselves with knives at first - second, and then to perhaps get a gun, because they feel no one else is going to protect them.",
        "They're not protected, they feel, by their parents, who don't understand the world they live in.",
        "And then are protected by the authorities, who don't get them.",
        "And so they feel like whatever beefs, whatever disputes that they are having, they have to settle it themselves.",
        "It's a decision - excuse me - that they make on their way to age 18.",
        "And by that time it's too late.",
        "You know, they're either dead or in prison.",
        "Akilah Johnson, you spent time with another family named - no relation - Johnson.",
        "And there were two boys in that family who had made those decisions.",
        "Yes.",
        "And you know, like Meghan said, it's one of those situations where you have a family and you have parents who feel like they're doing all the right things.",
        "You know, Theresa Johnson is a single mother and she's a school secretary and she did everything she could to kind of make sure her kids stayed on a straight and narrow.",
        "She - to some extent she raised on the same way she was raised, you know, strict.",
        "There were punishments for back talk and bad grades.",
        "Homework was a necessity.",
        "She tried to get them involved in after-school programs and, you know, activities to occupy their time, yet and still her sons chose to - as one of them told me - she has two sons in the street life.",
        "And not only are they in the street life, but they happen to represent rival hoods, as they call them here.",
        "You know, the streets - gangs here are often represent - are represented by streets, and the streets - the young folks on the street call hoods, not like your whole neighborhood, but your street is a hood.",
        "And so they're from rival hoods.",
        "And one represents a housing - a public housing complex where they never lived.",
        "He used to play basketball nearby and kind of knew a guy and then just started to hanging out over there, and another one started representing a street that at one point in time they live on.",
        "So it kind of goes to this concept like Meghan mentioned, of, you know, where you're from, where you represent is not necessarily a place where you live, but it's a group of people and a group of individuals with whom you identify.",
        "And then their mother has to make choices: Will she allow guns in the house?",
        "Will she allow drugs in the house?",
        "Will she allow ultimately her sons in the house?"

        "So it's a tough place to be and, you know, just kind of that concept of, will I love you to death?",
        "And by the end of the summer, she had made up her mind that no, she won't love her sons to death, and she had ultimately given them an ultimatum, especially her oldest son, who is awaiting trial on gun charges.",

        "It's like they're operating on very different - in a very different universe.",
        "And we should not go away with the impression that everybody there is involved in gangs and this is - there are wonderful people, you write about.",
        "There's an institution that's attempted to be revived, a community garden.",
        "Even that provides tension, but it also does a lot of good.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "I think that was, you know, that's one of the things we wanted to show, and that's one of the things - you know, hindsight is 20/20 - that we maybe want to show more of, is that there are a lot of people in the neighborhood who are living their lives, who are doing - who are raising families, who are going to work, who aren't involved in gangs or drug activity.",
