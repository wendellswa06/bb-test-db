        "I think that your writing is incredibly vivid in terms of depicting the kind of emotions you can have as a parent in very quiet moments.",
        "And over the years, had you collected kind of notes or scraps of writing, things that you thought one day might be stories that kind of contributed to this?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was at home for a number of years as an at-home father.",
        "I think the whole process of being at home with the kids and all that hair brushing and all of the little needs - I had to wait a few years before I could process it all and have enough distance to see what was really going on at the time or at least to imagine what was going on at the time.",
        "And we should say the plot of this story is this child is running down a hill and running very quickly, and the parent is following.",
        "And you feel that terror of, like, the kid is exuberant and enjoying this run (laughter).",
        "And you're...",
        "Right.",
        "...Just like, this is going to a dangerous place; please stop - and all the emotions you feel when your child is kind of teetering on the edge of danger.",
        "Yeah, and how much discipline do I give?",
        "How much freedom do I give?",
        "What happens if I don't give them enough freedom to learn what they need to learn and how to navigate the world and all of those complex things that are going on in a parent's mind at the minute-by-minute, you know, on-the-ground parenting thing?",
        "When you look back at that now, when you were writing these stories, how did it affect the way you thought about your own parents, your own father?",
        "Well, my father died about three years ago, and then my mother died in October.",
        "Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.",
        "Thank you.",
        "When my father died, I felt this grief but also this release as a storyteller to maybe go into material that covered the parenting ground.",
        "And so I think part of the fact that I'm going back to the parenting - you know, to being a younger parent is that my father died.",
        "And then you - everything shifts, and you reassess everything from a totally new perspective, and you realize that your parents, for all of their faults, did this incredible job in just getting you through to where you are now."

        "The story has nothing to do with that really, but I took that energy - that narrative energy, and I used it to write a story.",

        "Once that's done, The New Academy will dissolve.",
        "Because we all love the Nobel prize.",
        "It is the Swedish Academy that isn't coping very well with this Nobel Prize.",
        "For his part, journalist and author Andrew Brown thinks the Swedish Royal Court may just take the power to award the literature prize away from this current Swedish Academy.",

        "So, the CEXC team gets a hold of one of these things, what can they do with it?",

        "Right.",
        "There's a couple of steps.",
        "First is just to get some basic dimensions, even sort of height and weight can actually give clues to who's making the things.",
        "Then they dust the thing for fingerprints just like you'd see on CSI.",
        "They take samples of the explosives inside and test the chemistry.",
        "And then they open up the circuitry that might be used to trigger the bombs, and see if there's a bomb maker's fingerprint in that - a metaphorical fingerprint, not a literal one.",
        "And very often, there is.",
        "And then what are they able to do with the evidence they find?",
        "Can they then go out and bust the guys who made these IEDs?",
        "They can sure try.",
        "In some cases, they are successful.",
        "Sort of parallel to this effort, there's an attempt by the U.S.",
        "military to really create a kind of census throughout Iraq that's based largely on fingerprints, on irises, and on facial recognition.",
        "And so, in many parts of the country, you now need a badge to move around.",
        "And in order to get that badge, you need to get your fingerprints taken or get your iris scanned.",
        "And so, sometimes they are able to match the fingerprints on a bomb to the fingerprints that have to be taken for these badges."
