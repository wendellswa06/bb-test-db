        "And I should've said before I began reading that, of course, I'm reading it in my English accent that I'm stuck with, but really to really hear that lovely sonorousness of those sentences and those descriptions, you need Colin's own voice with his good Irish accent.",
        "The Irishness is there in the way the sentences are put together, but I can't give that proper expression.",

        "I don't know if it's exactly feminism, but that is a very interesting way of thinking about it because it's certainly true that if anybody is stuck in these stories, helpless in various cycles of doomed violence or just a kind of fatalism, it's the boys.",
        "It's the boys and the men.",

        "But another thing, in that funniness, there's a kind of generosity, I think.",
        "So that most of these stories, no matter how - you know, what deadly paths the protagonist seems set upon or what a mess they're making, actually the humor of it enjoys them.",
        "It actually likes these people.",
