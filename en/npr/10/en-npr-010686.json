        "But as NPR's Julie Rovner reports, there are some who think he never flipped at all.",
        "One thing is clear: Romney's public position on abortion has certainly changed.",
        "Back in 1994, when he was running unsuccessfully for the Senate against the late Edward Kennedy, here's what Romney said.",

        "There's a sort of cat-and-mouse game that goes on between the bomb makers and bomb planters and the U.S.",
        "military.",
        "The latest twist is that the mobile phone-triggered bombs, the radio-controlled bombs have been largely neutralized by the military even though, in the past, they'd killed hundreds of soldiers.",
        "The military's installed a set of radio frequency jammers onto their vehicles that basically blocks the signal before it can reach the bomb.",
        "So those bombs have been stopped, which sounds like great news, but there's been a rather unfortunate consequence - which is that the bombers have gone low tech and are now setting their explosives off with command wires, sort of hair-thin copper wires that can stretch as long as a kilometer.",
        "And those low-tech approaches to setting off bombs have actually made it more difficult to stop them because there's no simple toy you can use to sort of block the signal.",

        "So are President Trump's legal problems about to multiply?",

        "He is not technically a cooperating witness, according to his plea agreement.",
        "But his lawyer Lanny Davis was on our air yesterday saying he has a whole lot to say to state and federal prosecutors, including to the special counsel Robert Mueller.",
        "So square that for me.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Cohen himself, and through his representatives, very much including Lanny Davis, has - is just trying to make it as clear as he possibly could that if Mueller wants to cut a deal, he'll cut a deal.",
        "They keep talking about, you know, the story he has to tell.",
        "And it does seem like he was involved in a lot of Trump's business - obviously, these payments that are at the heart of the legal proceedings that just wrapped up earlier this week.",
        "But, you know, his involvement goes much deeper than that.",
        "And they're very much trying to make a deal with Mueller, but so far, it seems to be the Mueller team that's not biting on that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And we should say Cohen knows a lot about a lot when it comes to Donald Trump.",
        "And actually, this morning, he's been subpoenaed in New York state in what sounds like a separate probe of the Trump Foundation.",
        "I'm sure we'll be following that.",
        "But let's focus on the payments.",
        "I mean, Cohen says that during that campaign, Trump directed him to pay off two women who say they had affairs with the president.",
        "He denies that.",
        "It was in an effort to preserve his chances of winning the election.",
        "Could prosecutors make a case that Trump broke the law?",
        "And do we know whether, even if they had the evidence, they would indict a sitting president?",
        "Those are two really good questions, obviously.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Probably, they would not indict a sitting president.",
        "That's not - you know, the Supreme Court hasn't said, for example, that that can't be done, but it is the internal Justice Department position not to indict a sitting president.",
        "So in order to challenge that, you'd probably really need to see extraordinary circumstances, even more extraordinary than this.",
        "That said, if you just sort of set that aside and think about this more hypothetically, I guess, yes, I think that's why that statement by Cohen that he did this at the president's direction really took - caught people off guard, seemed so significant, because it does - practically speaking, it does implicate the president.",
        "And then that opens up sort of new questions about whether, legally speaking, that could ever implicate the president.",
        "Some have suggested that maybe it's possible to indict a sitting president but hold off on the trial till the president is out of office.",
        "Is that an option that's come up?",
        "It is an option.",

        "A word that a lot of Democratic lawmakers don't want to discuss at all right now, but I think there are some voters out there who are putting pressure on them.",
        "Let me just turn briefly to Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman.",
        "He, of course, was just convicted of eight crimes tied to financial fraud.",
        "One juror on this trial told Fox that they would've convicted him on all 18 counts if not for one holdout juror.",
        "So could there be a retrial here?",
        "Well, he's already coming up on a new trial on different charges in Washington.",
        "And Manafort just really seems to have put all of his cards in the hope-for-a-pardon basket rather than try to win in court."

        "Well, I think the major issue with the NIH proposal is it lays out some informed-consent standards that are both different than some of those really intense self-regulatory standards and also different than the federal regulations that many institutions actually have been using to make sure these are ethical.",
        "So that really has two kinds of implications.",
        "There's sort of a formal aspect to the guidance, which says everything's got to be documented in a certain way.",
        "So despite, say, global diversity, and there's at least maybe 800-plus lines around the world, things have got to be documented just our way.",
        "And if they're not documented in the past, you can't use them.",
        "Exactly.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And some of the documentation relates to things like IVF clinics.",
        "You know, for example, that they have a certain policy on protecting people from the influence of researchers.",
        "There's no question that keeping people front and center, patient care first for IVF clinics, is what has to happen.",
        "But many of these clinics wouldn't have had occasion to put in their consent forms something like that because they're just separate.",
        "So what you're saying is that all these embryos in these in-vitro fertilization clinics may be off-limits because the people who donated them never signed these consent forms.",
        "Well, they've signed, you know, a different and appropriate consent form, but this new, formal requirement with some of these new, additional elements would be problematic.",
        "I want to emphasize that, you know, there's been a tremendous effort over the last eight years.",
        "It's involved self-regulatory bodies, it's involved institutional review boards, which are the ethical bodies designated, you know, under federal law to make sure that human protection, human subjects are protected in research, tremendous effort - and also, of course, a tremendous effort at public engagement.",
        "You know, media involvement has been critical.",
        "So this is not an area where we're talking about, you know, grandfathering in or protecting unethical lines.",
        "We're talking about lines where they have met federal regulations, been extensively reviewed, but unfortunately, due to some new formal requirements and a couple new pretty debatable substantive ones, as well, they would not be eligible.",
        "So it's as if the last eight years of, you know, science and ethics, self-regulation and public engagement in this, donor intentions, all that just disappears.",
        "Wow, that's something that no one expected."
