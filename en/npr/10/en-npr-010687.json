        "So it's as if the last eight years just didn't exist.",
        "Is there any chance - now this is open for public review, and I would imagine people like you and people who want to maybe change these guidelines now have a chance to comment on this.",
        "That's right.",

        "First of all, these ethically derived lines, where there's been ethical review and high standards according to core principles, those should be grandfathered to mean donor intentions and, you know, to respect the IRB and so-on regulatory process that has occurred, to make sure they don't go to waste.",
        "It's also critical, by the way, for the global nature of this research.",
        "We can't expect every country to have done things just our way.",
        "That's one thing.",
        "The second is there's a couple elements - like directed donation, and people shouldn't benefit from any downstream patents - that are new and interesting ideas, but they're very debatable.",
        "And for those two, I think that it's really critical that they be subject to more examination in exactly the way that's occurred before.",
        "That means media discussion of it, which has again been very critical to public engagement in this policy.",
        "They are not straightforward.",
        "There's arguments both ways.",
        "So that's - a couple of these really need more discussion.",
        "You know, what's at stake there is really how we do ethics.",
        "Does ethics belong to somebody else, or does ethics belong, in a sense, to a combination of that kind of discipline and us, and those ones need some discussion.",
        "And you're looking for that discussion now.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think with respect to those two, that really should happen.",
        "The third thing is there is this formulistic element that says everything in this certain form.",
        "We know - I think the president is reminding us constantly that we are citizens of the world, and so there needs to be some ability to look at the other ways that different countries document things and the different ways that people historically have done so very legitimately and very ethically."
