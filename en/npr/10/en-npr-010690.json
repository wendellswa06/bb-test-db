        "In Massachusetts, when he was running as governor, I think - very liberal state, a state that was pro-choice - he was playing to the audience.",
        "And here again, he made promises to the pro-choice community that he did not keep.",
        "That includes his 2005 veto of a bill to provide the so-called morning-after pill to rape victims - legislation that was signed, ironically, by other governors who also ended up in this year's GOP presidential field, including Utah's Jon Huntsman.",
        "Still, Romney has always carefully parsed his position on abortion.",
        "Like many Catholic Democrats, he said he was personally opposed, while allowing others to make the choice for themselves.",
        "Now, he appears to have reversed that latter part.",

        "Romney is now the only major candidate who declined to sign.",
        "His campaign said at the time the pledge would limit who he could appoint to some key positions in his administration.",
        "Dannenfelser says Romney still has more work to do to convince doubters that he'll need to win the Republican nomination.",
        "Honestly, anyone can wear the sticker that says pro-life.",
