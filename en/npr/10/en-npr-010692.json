        "I was in Oakland at a, you know, town meeting, and there was a big discussion about three strikes.",

        "I say that that's one person's opinion.",
        "But I think that if you talk to people across the board, I think that, by and large, a majority of people, especially when you're talking about African-Americans who live in the inner city, whose kids feel disenfranchised and feel that they have to turn to the corners - I'm not making an excuse for him, because I had some times coming up where it was rough and I didn't make that choice to turn to the corners -but to people who feel as if they are caught in a three strikes law or in a net that will turn them into a permanent underclass, then they are, by and large, by the majority going to disagree with that sentiment."

        "Well, you know, what these disparities come down to is a very simple thing.",
        "There really needs to be written a book called \"\"The New Black History.\"\" And whatever you think about these disparities, there is a guiding notion in a lot of people's mind that if you could roll the tape back to 1986, what happened is that a bunch of overweight, suburban, barbequing, middle-aged white people cooked up some laws to get as many black men into prison as possible by making crack cocaine more prosecutable than powdered cocaine.",
        "And that is simply a myth.",
        "If you did roll the tape back, what you would see is people of the Maxine Waters-type, concerned black people who were every bit as much behind that legislation and in some cases more than the white people -many of whom really didn't care.",
        "The idea was exactly as you say, to help black communities where this particular kind of cocaine was a serious problem.",
        "Now nobody expected the result to be precisely what it is today, but the institution of those laws had nothing to do with racism.",

        "It was scaring people in the neighborhoods, black people.",
