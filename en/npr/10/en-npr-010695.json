        "Hi, hello.",
        "I was - actually followed the events pretty closely when I was here in Tallahassee and I do agree that the movie did a good job within two hours.",
        "But supposedly HBO was supposed to be nonpartisan, but I felt there was a couple examples where they kind of leaned a little bit toward the Gore party to show that there the underdog.",
        "Basically whenever they showed a ballot, I think it was at, at least a dozen.",
        "It would almost always say it was a ballot for Gore and never once did I hear them say that it was a ballot for Bush.",
        "It's when they were counting the disputed ballots and the dimpled chads and that sort of thing.",
        "Do you agree Ben Ginsberg?",
        "Yeah, I think that was part of the movie.",
        "I think that the charters on the Democratic side were developed much more fully than the characters on the Republican side.",
        "I think there was no mention of the media recounts that took place after the election, and a point of fact confirmed that under either the rules the Gore team requested or the Florida Supreme Court rules, that George Bush still would have won in Florida.",
        "But it was great to see that Dan Rather describe somebody as mad as a wet rooster.",
        "What do you think, Mitch Berger?",
        "Did the film lean to the Democrats?",
        "Well, I think that I think the facts leaned to the Democrats...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So it portrayed that, but in terms of the statewide recount that occurred afterwards, as HBO has posted on its website, if you counted lawful votes, Gore won.",
        "There's no question that, if you are limited to the way we had to proceed, as - because of the state election laws, Gore would have lost if you only looked at the three or four counties.",
        "But if you counted lawful votes statewide, Gore would have won.",
        "Tom, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Sure.",
        "There are a couple of people who were upset with their characterizations, beginning with then Secretary of State Katherine Harris, and here's a scene of Laura Dern portraying her as the Florida secretary of state."

        "(As Katherine Harris) I have been reading my Bible quite a bit here lately and I have the feeling, this unusually strong kinship with Queen Esther.",
        "You recall Queen Esther, she was willing to sacrifice herself to save the lovely Jewish people.",
        "And that's exactly what I'm doing right now.",
        "Do you think Laura Dern got that right, Ben Ginsberg?",
        "I certainly was not there to ever hear Katherine Harris say something like that and in fact had no contact with her at all during the recount.",
        "So it was a very amusing performance that certainly everyone has enjoyed tremendously.",
        "We're talking with Ben Ginsberg, who was on the Gore team - excuse me, on the Bush team - Bush-Cheney team in Tallahassee in Florida during the recount.",
        "And of course, with Mitchell Berger, who was on the Democratic side in that contest.",
        "And you're listening to Talk of the nation from NPR News.",
        "There are also characterizations of the two leaders of the two various teams, and they are the former secretaries of state, James Baker on the Republican side and Warren Christopher on the Democrat side.",

        "It ain't going to get more political than this.",
        "(As Warren Christopher) We want to proceed as if this is a proper legal process, not a political street fight.",
        "And I'm told, Ben Ginsburg, that in fact, James Baker was so pleased with this film that he's had a screening of it for his friends and family down in Texas.",

        "Look.",
        "He did have a screening of it.",
        "Secretary Baker was certainly our leader in Florida.",
        "I think, as with all of us, there was some degree of composition in all the characters, but Secretary Baker, he did indeed have a screening at his library at Rice University.",
        "And I'm told, Mitchell Berger, that Warren Christopher was rather more upset with his portrayal as somebody who wanted to take the high road and not engage in a fight.",
        "Well, I think that that's one of the parts that the movie kind of leaves compressed, from the Democratic point of view, a little bit too rapidly.",
        "I think both Ron Klain and Warren Christopher wanted to engage in the high road initially, but the movie sort of - but not quite - captured that after George Bush sued in federal court on Saturday morning after the election, after Volusia County sued to have its votes counted.",
        "And after Vice President Gore's call for a statewide recount, which was not in the movie, happened, that's when, on the Democratic side, you saw the transition from what I'll call the Warren Christopher view to the Michael Whouley view, and Ron Klain became the character that transformed from the Warren Christopher view to the Michael Whouley view, and that sort of was in the movie.",
        "But having lived it closer, I kind of saw that transformation occur during that week.",
        "So Warren Christopher definitely did not want to engage in a street fight for the presidency.",
        "There's no doubt about that.",
        "He wanted to find a consensual way to resolve the problem.",
        "And Ron Klain initially was of that view.",
        "But as those other three events occurred during that first week, that's when that transformation occurred in Ron Klain, and he did emerge with a battlefield commission, as they say, and did lead us quite well after that.",
        "Ben Ginsberg, some of us back here in Washington were following things pretty closely as well.",
        "I, as it turned out, broadcast of a lot of these events live, the Florida Supreme Court hearings and those moments where the clerk came out and read the pronouncements of the Florida supreme Court, and to tell you the truth, I had totally forgotten about that, and it was flashing back in my mind very heavily as I saw the film last night.",
        "Was there stuff in that film you didn't know, or that you'd forgotten?",
        "There wasn't so much that I had forgotten.",
        "I think that those...",
        "Pretty vivid in your mind?",
        "Pretty vivid memories.",
        "I think one of the things that I found most striking about the movie - and it's really an omission that is probably my biggest objection to it - is the notion that somehow the Democrats were playing this very pure game at first.",
        "Within the first couple of days, they had decided they were only going to count votes in the four most Democratic counties in the state.",
        "Three of the four had partisan Democratic election boards on them."

        "So to the extent that the Democrats thought they were trying to, indeed, count all the votes, they were only trying to count some of the votes.",
        "They tried to exclude the absentee ballots, all the absentee ballots in two Republican counties, Martin and Seminole, and of course, there was the famous incident about trying to exclude the overseas military ballots, all three instances directly contradicting the count-all-the-votes mantra that they were spouting at the time.",
        "And Mitchell Berger, let me ask you, and I know you'll want to come back out hat, but nevertheless, were there any scenes there that were hard to watch?",
        "I think, certainly, the riot in Dade County, certainly the scene where the spokesperson for the Florida Supreme Court is deciding whether or not to put a bulletproof vest on to come out to announce the court's pronouncement.",
        "These are things that actually did happen and things that we must all think about, as to why Warren Christopher did not want to have a street fight for the presidency, and instead, wanted us to try to obtain a higher plane in terms of how to do this.",
        "With respect to our desire to count all the votes, we did want to do that.",
        "The election machine, as the movie depicted, was not in our favor to do that, and as said in the movie, in order to request 67 counties to count the votes, it would not have occurred without some consensus by the deadline that we were all acing.",
