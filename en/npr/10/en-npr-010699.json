        "You know, he's a great follower of throwing dice to determine the order in which things would happen and what people would be wearing and so on.",
        "So he was giving - he gave me freedom to not always make friends, to myself first, but maybe even to a critic.",
        "That was something that he understood about chance and, I daresay larger, unities - without being too cosmic here - larger unities in creation that the artist is able to step into when they get out of the way with their opinions and their taste.",
