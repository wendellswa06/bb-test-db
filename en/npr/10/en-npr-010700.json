        "Could that procedure make these creatures more human in some way, and would that change how we should think about them?",

        "And what is the goal?",
        "There's a lot we still need to find out about the basic behavior of cells, the cell biology, right down at the submolecular level, finding out basically how these things work in mammals and in particular in our closest related mammals, like other primates.",
        "Then, as we look forward to perhaps using stem cell or other cellular treatments in the treatment of diseases like Alzheimer's, we might want to be able to test potential treatments in other animals before we go to human trials.",
        "So that might be another motivation to go forward.",
        "These are neural stem cells developing human brain cells.",

        "People will guarantee you that the monkeys won't start quoting Shakespeare or writing or talking.",

        "What we can't rule out, though, is that there might be some changes which would have an effect.",
        "So consider, just for example, how rich our social lives are and how much that impacts on our own welfare.",
        "Now we know that other primates have very complex social interactions, as well.",
        "If you start putting human neural cells into the brains of other primates, we could find that it changes the way they're able to interact or the kind of social needs they may have in a way that makes them completely unable to get sort of social interactions from each other or even from ourselves.",
        "So they'd be in this kind of horrible between land.",
        "So that's just one example of something which doesn't remotely come close to thinking like us, which is what none of us expect, but nevertheless can make important changes in what it's like to be that animal in a way that makes it able to suffer in new and different ways that we should be concerned about.",
