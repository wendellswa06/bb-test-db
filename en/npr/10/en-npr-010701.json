        "It's part of, I think, a change in the way the movie industry is organized, that the big studios are more and more interested in kind of blockbuster, mass entertainment, and the kind of the A pictures, the prestige pictures that the studios used to put out now become the duty of the specialty division, which can make them for a little less money and then can sort of reap the awards and the prestige at the end of the year.",
