        "But you're right.",
        "Little Miss Sunshine\"\" is probably just in terms of box office performance, not in terms of raw gross, but just in terms of being a fairly small movie that took a long time to get made, made by two first-time directors, the husband and wife Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.",
        "It was picked up by Fox Searchlight at Sundance a year ago.",
        "It was the most money ever paid for a Sundance acquisition - $10.5 million - and then has gone on to be quite a hit.",
        "It was sort of the big surprise sleeper hit of the summer, and it just sort of kept going and generated a lot of critical good will.",
        "And audiences really liked it, and I think it was, you know, a smart, well-written, well-directed comedy with a handful of nice performances.",

        "And since there are five nominees, you need, you know, 20 percent plus one vote to win Best Picture.",
        "So without a kind of a clear, dominating favorite, it, you know, something can squeak by on a very narrow margin.",

        "It came up late; it got an enormous amount of critical support, showed up on a lot of 10 Best lists, and has had, I think, terrific word of mouth among moviegoers.",
