        "He did not answer that directly, instead saying it needs study.",
        "He says the US is committed to developing new cleaner technologies and promoting nuclear power.",
        "He said, `You can be good for the air and for the water and good for business and trade and economic growth at the same time.",
        "He did not say what he would do to join in on Tony Blair's call for a serious international approach to this.",
        "And recall that well before the president angered many Europeans on Iraq, he angered them with his environmental policies right as soon as he took office.",
        "And, finally, Don, the so-called Downing Street memo that was written by a British national security aide back in July of 2002, before the war began.",
        "That memo said that intelligence and facts were being fixed to support the policy of a military overthrow of Saddam Hussein.",
        "Right.",
        "The memo has been getting more and more attention since it was first printed in The Times of London about six weeks ago.",
        "Critics of the president and of Blair say it is a key piece of evidence saying that the intent was always war.",
        "The denials today were, though, really similar to what we've heard from President Bush in the past, who at one point today said, `The world is better off with Saddam Hussein out of power.",
        "So the memo is getting talked about, but, again, the reaction from the White House and from Blair is very, very much like what we have heard them say in the past.",
        "NPR's Don Gonyea.",
        "Don, thanks very much.",

        "My fear of fire always starts growing in the spring, when green weeds unfold around the house.",
        "By summer, the grass is dry, the days are heavy and hot, and a persistent haze of smoke makes distant fires feel much too close.",
        "My neighbor doesn't reassure me, yup, he'll occasionally say by way of greeting, this place is going to burn this year.",
        "He's skinny, profane and excitable, and I'm never sure if he's just cultivating an explosive image, or if he really might blow someday.",
        "On summer nights, I walk with my husband along the irrigation canal, its water too far from our house for comfort.",
        "We look across the valley of the hillside that burned 10 years ago; a fire that left two friends with nothing, but the Volkswagen bus they escaped in."

        "He loved the men he worked with.",
        "But he saw something that shocked him, which was the fact that the US Army was racially segregated as a matter of policy, and he could not believe that the Army that was liberating Europe from the Nazis had apartheid.",
        "Now we should also say the cases that came up were actually cases committed by GIs against the French civilians.",
        "That's correct.",
        "There are many cases in my book, but the two that struck Guilloux particularly were the case of an African-American truck driver who fired a shot through a door not knowing who was behind the door and killed a French peasant.",
        "He was condemned to death and hanged in the village--hanged publicly in the village where the crime took place.",
        "This, remember, was 10 years after the US had abolished public hanging.",
        "The second case that Guilloux concentrates on in a novel he later wrote about his experience was the case of a white Ranger officer who killed a French Resistance fighter in a bar--killed him, you know, right to his face.",
        "And with an ingenious defense arguing that this Resistance fighter was a spy, Whittington was acquitted.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And in--how did Guilloux get interested in this?",

        "He was the official interpreter in these courts-martial.",
        "His job was to translate the testimony of civilian witnesses, and the cases haunted him for 20 years.",
        "He had a lot of trouble writing the novel about it because he was in such conflict.",
        "He loved the officers and he found the system brutal.",
        "Let's talk about the similarities, 'cause you draw both similarities and discrepancies between the two cases, differences.",
        "What are the similarities between the case of James Hendricks, the African-American truck driver, and George Whittington?",
        "First of all, what happened in the case--lead us up to that moment when James Hendricks shot at this door and killed the French farmer.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, James Hendricks had been in a very brutal training camp in Mississippi; was shipped over to Europe.",
        "He was drinking cognac with the guys.",
        "He went out; he knocked on some farmhouse doors.",
        "Knocked on one door; they wouldn't let him in.",
        "He fired his rifle through the door.",
        "We don't know why.",
        "We can't know his intentions.",
        "And the man was standing behind the door and the bullet hit him and killed him.",
        "But part of the case was that there was an intention on his part to rape some--the women who were there as well.",
        "After the door came open, he panicked.",
        "He chased the widow of this deceased man across the street.",
        "He assaulted her.",
        "He did not finish the rape; he tried to assault her.",
        "So that added up to felony murder, which was a capital offense.",
        "If he hadn't assaulted Naomi Bineau(ph), I think there would have been an argument for manslaughter."

        "And part of what the black GI had going against him, which you just alluded to, was the fact that he didn't have a very good defense.",
        "I mean, he had a very inexperienced defense lawyer.",
        "It was common practice, and this was one of the things that was reformed after World War II.",

        "His defense counsel had been to law school.",
        "He wasn't a member of the bar; he had no criminal experience.",
        "So later on the interpreter wrote a novel about this.",
        "With a funny title.",
        "He gave his novel a title in English, which is very rare in France; he called it \"\"OK, Joe,\"\" and he--Louis Guilloux is a writer who's really brilliant at representing voices, and he loved the way the GIs talked.",

        "Now this is not a part of the history of the liberation of France that's very well-known.",
        "How did you stumble upon this in the first place?",
        "Well, I was finishing a book called \"\"The Collaborator,\"\" about a French Fascist who was tried and executed by de Gaulle's liberation government.",
