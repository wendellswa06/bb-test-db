        "And back in the Victorian Age, it was often documented in photographs.",
        "And that scene and many others like it showing med students from 1880 through the 1930s gathered around their flesh-torn cadavers for a photo are - they're all pulled together in a new book that's hard to take your eyes off of.",
        "And joining me now to talk more about is one of the coauthors, James Edmonson.",
        "He's chief curator at the Dittrick Medical History Center and Museum College of Arts and Sciences.",
        "That's at Case Western Reserve University's Allen Memorial Medical Library.",
        "He's coauthor of a new book called \"\"Dissection: Photographs of a Rite of Passage in American Medicine 1880-1930.\"\" He joins us by phone from Cleveland.",

        "These are amazing photographs.",
        "I concur completely.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "To tell the truth, we've always had a few of these photos floating around our place and most other medical museums archives.",
        "But about 10 years ago, I got a call from a collector in Youngstown who said he collected these things.",
        "And I was intrigued and invited him to bring his collection here.",
        "It's about an hour's drive, not too far.",
        "And he brought them in and he laid out on the table about 75 of these photos.",
        "And I thought, oh, boy.",
        "What's going on here?",
        "Wow.",
        "You see one or two in isolation, you might assume it was a student gag or prank, but you see 75 or 100 or them, and you realize this constitutes a separate form - a genre, if you will - of medical portraiture that was really very much more widespread then I'd ever suspected.",
        "Yeah, because they are all posed, almost identically, around this wooden or some sort of dissecting table with a cadaver laid open in various positions, right?",
        "And they're all proud, and there are actually little slogans on the table."

        "Often their names, their states that they hail from and so forth.",
        "It's possible to look back in medical iconography and find the precedence for these images.",
        "You can go back to the first medical book with a woodcut print in it.",
        "It has an anatomy lesson in it.",
        "That's the \"\"Fasciculus Medicinae\"\" by Ketham in 1491.",
        "And, of course, Vesalius' magnificent \"\"On the Fabric of the Human Body,\"\" which first appeared in 1543, has a photo of an anatomy scene.",
        "And he's figured front and center, dissecting a cadaver.",
        "So the iconographic precedents are there, but the proliferation of photography is what really amazed us.",
        "It's quite interesting.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "There was a time when Kodak marketed its cameras, fully loaded with film, you'd buy a camera, shoot the film, send the camera and film back to the company.",

        "So you can generate your own postcards to stick in the mail.",
        "And you show that in the book, that there are all these postcards that people were sending of cadavers.",
        "And they have frankings and stamps marks and inscriptions on - to show that they indeed did go through the mail.",

        "Is there still this kind of culture around today?",
        "Well, there's a couple of profound watersheds or changes in medical education.",
        "And the one that affects this genre of photography is the Willed Body Programs.",
        "Before 1960, there was no way to get a body easily, and in many states there weren't laws to regularize the supply of bodies until the 20th century.",
        "But that got ironed out, ultimately.",
        "But still, there was a shortage of bodies for cadavers in classes.",
        "And so they implemented a willed body program, under which middle-class, probably middle-class people were asked to donate their bodies to science, to be used by medical students in an anatomy class.",
        "And when you do that, you've got to give people the assurances the dead body's going to be dealt with dignity and respect and honor.",
        "And so the word went out in Cleveland.",
        "This happened in about 1950.",
        "It happened elsewhere across the country, contemporaneously.",
        "Word came out.",
        "No more funny stuff, no more photography.",
