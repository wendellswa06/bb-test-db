        "INDIA.ARIE: Oh, that's a big question.",
        "I think it's twofold.",
        "I think one, sad to say, but I feel like the popular culture of young people, I don't know that they think this way.",
        "And I don't know if is - what comes first, the chicken or the egg, if it's because this is popular culture, so young kids think that way, or if it's because just it's what their generation is doing, and so the music reflects it.",
        "I don't know.",
        "I have an opinion.",
        "I'm not sure.",
        "I don't know if I want to say that.",
        "I'm not as clear enough - I'm not clear enough on that opinion about the chicken or the egg to say on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "But I know that those two elements exist, of course.",
        "There was a time, not so long ago - and you were part of it - music would lead, as well.",
        "INDIA.ARIE: Yes, music would lead.",
        "It would lead the culture.",
        "And I wonder - you might be right.",
        "It might be the music leading the culture, because then people emulate what they see on TV, and they want to look like their favorite artists.",
        "And - but then - but it's a shame, too, because the other aspect is that commercially, just what makes money, you know, all the big companies are followers.",
        "They're followers.",
        "So whatever is the hot thing, then they want another thing like that.",
        "And then it ends up being this self-multiplying thing, you know, self-multiplying.",
        "And so I think the way that people can bring more positivity, to answer the end of Kemit's question, in my opinion you just have to make the music, make the music and work as hard as you can to get it out there.",
        "I don't know what else to say, really.",
        "But, you know, with the social network, there's always a way to get your music out.",
        "And I also feel like - and I think Stevie Wonder is the master of this - making the message catchy and make it jam and make people want to dance to it, and so the message gets into their subconscious.",
        "I think that's an important element of it, too, today.",
        "I mean, I make much more gentle music.",
        "I'm kind of like a folk singer mixed with soul.",
        "But I feel like if you really are a lover of hip-hop music, make the beat banging as possible, and then put the message in so that people get the honey with the medicine.",
        "But I'm not a big - I'm kind of sad about the state of music right now, kind of sad.",
        "And some of it I find a bit embarrassing.",
        "Like what?",
        "INDIA.ARIE: Just the way that our young - black America in particular, the way we talk about sex, the way we talk about it.",
        "Because, I mean, you know, it's a fine subject matter.",
        "But the way that we're doing it right now and the way that we're dressing it right now and the way that we're holding our faces on TV and things that we - I mean, I say in our, because I'm young black America.",
        "I'm not trying to, you know, distance myself from it, but it makes me - some of it is embarrassing.",
        "Because there was some stuff that was like kind of on the edge, you know, maybe 10 years ago, and it was like oh, edgy, you know, like \"\"The Thong Song\"\" or something like that.",
        "It was, like, whoa.",
        "And now it's just like everything laid out, and, I mean, this..."

        "And then here you come with a song that says it, and then we're, like, yeah, we're jamming to it.",

        "Everything else was not leading where I wanted to go.",
        "And I - it got worse and worse, and I woke up one day and realized that - so when I decided to take a break from the music industry, it was in late 2009.",
        "And this was - this lesson was reflecting that same lesson again: Can you say no?",
        "Do you know how to let go of something, even when you're afraid, but you know it's the right thing to let go of?",
        "You know, that.",
        "And as soon as I had that clarity, I just knew I had to shelve it.",

        "You know, for me, he was my friend, and I didn't think about the - I mean, I thought about the political part.",
        "I knew I was going to have to answer to that if the album came out.",
        "But I didn't think of it that way.",
        "I just thought this is my friend, and I stand behind him, and I'm going to let the love speak for itself when they see us onstage and hear our music.",
        "But then our friendship started to really deteriorate, and I was like, well, what's left?",
        "There is nothing left to do because, you know, we were going to be on tour together, be working together for years, because you promote an album for a couple of years."

        "It is about hair, you know, on a certain level, but on a deeper level, like what you and your sister found out, it's about dogmatic self-definition and on the other hand self-definition and not allowing anyone to define you based on their parameters, you know?",
