        "Since then, more and more healthy products aimed at kids have started appearing on the shelves.",

        "And now in order to get to the next level, Dunn has another idea.",
        "He wants to give kids their own go-to destination in the grocery store, their own section really filled entirely with products that are healthy and presented in funky ways.",
        "He's been working with retailers - including Walmart and Giant Eagle - to reorganize their produce aisles.",

        "Not really kid anymore, but he's lasered in on the latest version of baby carrots.",
        "It's not just bag of carrots, nope.",
        "They come with a little pouch of colorful, chili-lime seasoning that you can shake onto the carrots.",
        "They're spicy, crunchy and have that flavor that sticks to your fingers.",
        "Not quite Doritos, but close.",
        "Middle schooler Alex Goley gets it.",
        "They kind of taste better than, like, any other vegetable.",
        "Alex's mom, Rhonda Goley, says bringing junk-food tactics to the healthy stuff makes sense.",
        "Absolutely, because I think it's something that just kind of adds a little more fun to eating it.",
        "David Just of Cornell University, who studies what motivates people to eat better, agrees.",
        "Despite concerns about marketing to kids, this combination of making healthy products fun and bringing them all together is spot on.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think the kid-friendly stacking stations are an absolutely fascinating concept.",
        "It's what the cereal aisles and candy shelves have been doing for decades, but...",
        "This is a tactic and a tool that really hasn't been used to promote healthier foods."

        "And your experience as you've gotten involved in broader approaches with other families and other sufferers is that indeed, you say epilepsy, but one person's epilepsy does not seem to bear, often, very much relation to another's.",
        "No, that's true.",
        "And, you know, I think it was just today or yesterday that Prince came out and talked about having epilepsy as a child.",
        "And certainly, there are many people who have achieved remarkable things living with epilepsy.",
        "But as you pointed out in the introduction, it's been true for 30 years that one-third of those with epilepsy, over a million people in the U.S., have had to live with uncontrolled seizures and that the side effects from the existing drugs, which include fatigue and cognitive effects, are still very severe, and that people have not been willing to talk about epilepsy.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, I think there's a historic stigma which, you know, goes back to the perhaps understandable reactions people historically had to seeing somebody experience a seizure.",
        "It was not understood, I think, until recent centuries well that a seizure is really just excessive electrical activity in the brain, much like a migraine.",
        "And not being taken over by the devil.",
        "It's been seen both as a manifestation of godliness, and it's been seen too often as a sort of a negative sign.",
        "But scary either way.",
        "How does your daughter deal with preparing to have seizures every day?",
        "Well, she doesn't really get to prepare.",

        "Yesterday she tried, but really could not eat dinner.",
        "The day before, she had six hours of sort of unrelenting seizures with barely a break.",
        "And yet she'll get through that or get halfway through that and crack a joke halfway through, and persevere with her objective.",
        "So, you know, there are people who have tremendous strength and positive frames of mind who manage to live with epilepsy.",
        "Does she go to school?",
