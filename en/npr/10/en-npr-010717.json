        "Correct.",
        "And how is she doing?",

        "She has been an incredible trooper and has a remarkable spirit, but her seizure control is terribly disappointing.",
        "She has waves of small seizures throughout the day.",
        "And at times, in the late afternoon and early evening, they can really consume much of her life.",
        "And although they're not major convulsive seizures usually, and they can be, they're more staring and blinking seizures, they really just interrupt her life.",
        "And she also does have the more major seizures, as well.",
        "So it speaks to the need in the United States for more recognition, for more research and for a cure.",

        "They help control the symptoms that are there, but they in no way treat the underlying brain process that leads to epilepsy.",
        "We're fortunate that the majority of children who have epilepsy outgrow it, but many of them have seizures that are not controlled, like Sylvie's, and many others continue to have seizures all the way through adulthood.",
        "And is there any prospect of something that is beyond control and, as you suggest, even a third of people are not susceptible to control, and even those controls, the side effects can be terrible."

        "Well, there are some alternative therapeutic options, surgery being one for the group of people whose seizures come from a relatively restricted region of the brain, and that region can be safely removed, in which the benefits clearly outweigh the potential harms.",
        "But apart from that relatively small group - as Warren said, maybe a million people with poorly controlled epilepsy in the United States - probably no more than 50 to 70,000 are good candidates for surgery now.",
        "So for the majority of people, we don't have great options.",

        "Hi, yes.",
        "I'm calling - I have a son who was diagnosed with absence seizures or petit mal seizures at age five, and he's now 12, medicated and well-controlled.",
        "And our experience has been simply that while the representation of epilepsy as an issue is - focuses on the very severe cases, which really deserve a lot of attention, and yet there's probably a large number of people like ourselves who have medicated, controlled epilepsy conditions in the family.",
        "And we've never been able to connect with or find much support for that kind of milder situation.",
        "And it's just interesting that, you know, as a parent, you're very alarmed, and yet when you go and seek out information, you find even-more-alarming cases than your own.",
        "But the community of people who are just living with it quietly, and it's an issue, there's concerns about it, we don't feel - I haven't been able to find much connection or support for that situation.",
        "And have you been to epilepsy.com?",
        "I was just looking at it for the first time now, and I do see some information.",
        "But I'm thinking more about how to, you know, meet - so my child can meet other kids who have to deal with what is basically a how-do-I-take-my-medication-every-day challenge and how do I tell other people that I have this mild condition - you know, making that sort of social connection so that he can integrate it into his own life.",
        "Warren Lammert, any advice for Mike?",
        "Well, I would say that the epilepsy.com community embraces people who are living successfully with epilepsy and facing those kinds of issues, and I think connections can be made there, and those kinds of issues are explored.",
        "I understand very much where you're coming from, and you know, two-thirds of people on the flip side of people with epilepsy are controlled by the existing meds, although they do have side effects.",
        "And it's very important for those people to find that support.",
        "Mike, good luck."

        "Is it something with his food?",
        "And we got a few results there, but they didn't help his seizures.",
        "And finally my husband said, can you measure his brain neurotransmitters?",
        "I think it's something happening in the brain.",
        "And the doctor shrugged and said we can do a spinal tap.",
        "And we said let's do that.",
        "They sent it out to a specialized lab now that is, I guess, in Atlanta that's doing neurotransmitter research.",
        "They found my son was low in dopamine, and we have started him on dopamine, which is not an anti-epileptic drug.",
        "It has controlled his seizures more than anything.",

        "Let's bring in Dr. Devinsky.",
        "Is this a case of misdiagnosis or mistreatment?",
        "I'm not saying mistreatment - incorrect treatment, or is this something that could help other people?",
        "Well, it's a fascinating case.",
        "There are some rare metabolic disorders, some diagnosed only by spinal tap that can be identified.",
        "And currently, I think the caller raises a fascinating issue in that neurotransmitters can't be directly measured."
