        "The spinal fluid measures the metabolites of the neurotransmitter activity in the brain and the spinal cord, and there can be deficiencies or excesses of certain neurotransmitters that can be balanced.",
        "It is, however, relatively rare in epilepsy, but I think it's an area where we certainly need more research and, in specific cases, potentially more treatment.",
        "And it's helping in your case, Theresa.",
        "Yes.",
        "In fact, the hospital we go to, the metabolic neurologist and the epileptologist were on the same floor.",
        "So they were able to call in the epileptologist, and he looked at my son and said: If I didn't know your parents, I wouldn't know you were the same child.",
        "Well, I'm glad it's working out.",
        "And may I add one more thing?",
        "If you could do it quickly, please.",

        "You're welcome.",
        "The doctor has recommended this for some people with intractable seizures.",
        "He's done spinal taps on two dozen, and we know of one child who has been helped by just changing his diet as a result of the spinal tap, and he's seizure-free.",
        "So we thought we'd give that encouragement to others.",
        "Theresa, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it."

        "We were advised by her neurologist not to inform the school or her teacher that she has epilepsy because they would most likely treat her differently.",
        "We're comfortable with not telling the school, but find it sad in this day and age that epilepsy is not understood more.",
        "And Warren Lammert, this falls into your area.",
        "Again, every parents has to make their own decision, but is this a wise course, and can schools be educated?",
        "Well, I think, again, it is very much an individual decision, but the fact that people are hesitant to talk about epilepsy I think is part of the problem and something that we're trying to fight back against and overcome.",
        "Epilepsy is simply a disorder of the brain that reflects excess electrical activity, much like many heart attacks reflect problems with electrical activity in the heart.",
        "And I think to the degree that people are willing to talk about and get out in front with epilepsy, I think we can see people live much better, happier lives.",

        "It is a challenge, and they have to be prepared and personally ready to take that on.",

        "Devinsky, can you help us out here?",
        "Yeah, so you've covered a lot of ground.",
        "Just briefly, I think inflammation is an exciting area of research.",
        "It's an area where we in epilepsy have not felt it's been relevant, and I think there is accumulating animal data and evidence from human cases that inflammation can contribute, and essentially you touched on some of this.",
        "When you have seizures, you may trigger inflammation.",
        "The inflammation may lead to more seizures, and you essentially get a positive feedback loop, and so you need to block that inflammatory cycle.",
        "Is this relevant to a tiny group of people with refractory epilepsy?",
        "Definitely.",
        "Is it more relevant also, to a lesser degree, to a broader group of people with epilepsy?",
        "Quite possibly.",
        "So that's an important area of research.",
        "You also asked about the amino acids.",
        "Again, these become some of the most difficult things.",
        "All the alternative therapies, whether it's accupuncture, osteopathic therapy, chiropractic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, amino acids, Chinese herbal medications - hundreds, literally, of alternative therapies, none are proven.",
        "And it just - in medicine, of course, we have this very dangerous thing where doctors are biased, patients are biased, therapists are biased, parents are biased.",
        "So without double-blind studies, we just have to be very humble."
