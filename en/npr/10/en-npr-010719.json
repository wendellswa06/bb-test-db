        "And I think the diagnosis and recognition of seizures in epilepsy is something that has not been as well-covered in medical school and residency programs as it should be, and I think it is a challenge for the future.",

        "Complex partial seizures are probably the most common type of seizures in adult.",
        "They are essentially staring spells or periods with impaired responsiveness.",
        "Sometimes other individuals don't recognize them.",
        "They think the person is just taking a moment to themselves.",
        "They typically last 20 seconds to a few minutes.",
        "There's no loss of consciousness, no falling, but some mild confusion.",
        "There may be partial responsiveness or no responsiveness.",
        "And it is a very significant problem because as an adult, you can't drive with these seizures, and they can also affect employment.",
        "So they're an important problem.",
        "They make up a huge percentage of every neurologist and epilepsy specialist's practice.",

        "They have started a new venture called Bridges TV, an American-Muslim TV channel.",
        "I got a phone call in my home in Morgantown, West Virginia, a few years ago asking for a donation, and I agreed to give it even though I don't usually donate to causes.",
        "And I did it because there was a need for American-Muslim identity put out there in the media.",
        "And so, they were a big couple and then sadly, what happened was over the last few years - we have at least documentation for - Aasiya was living a private life of hell at home.",
        "She was living under the threat of violence and sometimes violence from her husband.",
        "This was a secret in the community - except some people did know about it in the Rochester Muslim community, where Muzzammil Hassan had had a first marriage and then a second marriage that had been marked with domestic violence, and then it culminated in February with her death.",
        "Wow.",
        "Is there - did she seek help?",
        "Was she able - did she have any place to go to get help?",
        "Yeah, you know, I have in front of me, you know, a police report from Texas, where Muzzammil Hassan's family lived, and they were on a visit there in 2007.",
        "She walked into the police station with a protective order from New York.",
        "She'd gotten three protective orders before that one that she was carrying, and she wanted to know if the Texas police could enforce this protective order.",
        "The police officer tried to take notes on her case.",
        "She was there with her brother-in-law and she said, why are you taking notes?",
        "He said, I'm obligated, because she had shown him bruises that she had on her body.",
        "And she said, oh no, and literally, the police officer said, fled the station with the police officer saying, please wait.",
        "So, their documentation is that indeed, she'd gone through the police system, there were many cases where the local police in New York State had responded to calls for help.",
        "And ironically and interestingly, the protective order that she had said that her husband, Muzzammil Hassan, had to get counseling and anger-management classes from Catholic charities in upstate New York.",
        "So if the system was turned on by this event, if the protective orders were issued, if things happened, what went wrong?",
        "I think what went wrong is that this conspiracy of silence that you, you know, made me think about at the introduction is what, in fact, crippled and possibly paralyzed her from leaving this marriage and leaving the danger that she faced in this marriage.",
        "There is so much pressure on women not only in the Muslim community, but in so many communities, to tough it out, to stick around.",
        "And in this situation, there was this issue of the public face that needed to be protected, and there was that possibility of public shame if it became known that there was this issue of violence in the home.",
        "New York Times is liberal.",
        "Well, it was the bed.",
        "You know, in the video - there's a video of it on YouTube, and you had less than two feet from the top of the mattress to the ceiling.",
