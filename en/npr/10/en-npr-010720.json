        "So this is good, perhaps, for people who, as you said, want to make it, haven't made it yet, are sacrificing for some dream.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I wouldn't call it even sacrificing, because for me, you know, when - it was about, you know, wanting the experience of living in Manhattan, wanting to be near the theater and the museums and the park and the people.",

        "You do that in New York.",
        "So we're - Capitol Hill is - it's a very populated, eclectic mix of housing styles, and a range of people living there.",
        "But you can't just move in and tear down whatever you want and put up whatever you want.",
        "There's zoning standards, and there's development standards, you see.",
        "So what's been happening is that these micro-housing units have been skirting the zoning laws because they've been basically misrepresenting themselves to the city for what they are.",
        "So we went back to the city, and we said we want a moratorium on these kinds of developments until you can clean up the development language and get all of these buildings built in the same way that other apartment buildings are being built in.",
        "Then we can move forward with a conversation.",
        "But it's just anarchy right now.",
        "There's dozens of these buildings popping up all over the neighborhood, and they're not falling into the zoning laws.",
        "And how is that?",
        "How are they able to skirt the zoning laws?",
        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "I would agree that, that it definitely appeals to, you know, individuals or couples, sometimes small families, there are a number of small families who live in 200 square feet, and also older people as, you know, they're growing older, mother-in-law apartments, things like that.",
        "Well, they're misrepresenting themselves to the city, and this really has come out to be a fact based on some dogged questions by City Councilmember Tom Rasmussen in particular, and a few other councilmembers.",
        "Because of the way the zoning laws are written in Seattle, they only count a dwelling unit if it has a kitchen with a stove in it."

        "So one stove, one kitchen, that's a dwelling unit.",
        "But then there's up to seven apartments, separate leases, can use that one kitchen, and those seven units are just still counted as one unit because of the kitchen.",
        "And this was done to encourage people to do some communal living in some of the larger, older homes in our neighborhood.",
        "But developers have said well, if seven units and one kitchen is one unit, then 49 units and, you know, seven kitchens is seven units.",
        "So they went to the city and got approval for developing a seven-unit apartment, or seven-unit townhouse.",
        "And then the next thing you know, 49 or 56 or whatever people are moving in right next door to a small, little single-family home in a block of single-family homes.",
        "So this misrepresentation has really put a bad taste in people's mouth for micro-housing, which is unfortunate.",
        "It should be an option.",
        "But it can't be done like this.",
        "There needs to be fair standards.",
        "These buildings need to go through a design review process, because a lot of the buildings in our neighborhood are historic, 1900s homes, and people are particular about how things look.",
        "And all the other apartment buildings have to go through design review.",
        "So should these buildings.",
        "They need to come to the same standards.",
        "And there's - frankly, there's some safety violations going on in these buildings, too, because the city thinks it's only seven units, but it's 50.",

        "And that worked for them.",
        "I also lived in a men's co-op, which was in an old 1920s sorority house.",
        "And there were up to 50 of us sharing a common kitchen.",
        "And one of the things we have lost in the United States is a sense of community.",
        "And one of the things that, in a very small way, these pods with a shared kitchen can do is help restore, on a very small level, the kind of community that we need to restore to rebuild the social fabric in our cities that are going to help - and it's going to help things like gun violence and crime and the sense of alienation that many of us feel when we're locked off in our own separate, little zones - whether they're single-family residences or apartments, and I've lived in all of the above.",
        "However, I also acknowledge the - your fellow from Seattle who just spoke.",
        "The zoning regulations and developer behaviors need to be transparent and accountable, and the zoning regulations do need to clearly state what is required for the good of the public.",
        "I go along with that need entirely, but not on a NIMBY basis - which I don't think is what he has in mind - so that we know what we're going to get, and that the full impact of these housing developments are accounted for, and developers cannot hide behind the numbers, which developers love to do, because they're greedy.",
        "All right, John, thank you so much for the call.",
        "Felice Cohen, you don't live in the micro-apartment anymore.",
        "Would you move back to such a place?",
        "I don't know.",

        "I think, you know, now, I've just fallen in love with my little apartment that's just a little bigger.",
        "It's just under 500 square feet."

        "And granted, we were looking at specifically stand-alone tiny houses, but I think micro-dwellings in general actually really enhance communities and makes them more diverse and allow for different socioeconomic background to kind of all inhabit one place, not to mention all the benefits that they provide to, you know, individuals.",
