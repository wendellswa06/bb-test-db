        "Welcome.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So your organization started a program called Making Room that deals with micro-housing.",
        "How did this come about?",
        "It really came about not so much because we were starting with the idea of creating micro-units but rather because we were looking at the data that really describes our population in New York and in America more broadly.",
        "And in New York there's a significant single-person population, and about a third of our housing units are occupied by a single person living alone.",
        "In Manhattan that number is closer to half.",
        "And we saw this increase in the single-people population coming into our housing market who are forced almost exclusively to seek housing in the informal housing market, and that housing market in fact has many of the problems that Jeffrey Cook was talking about in Seattle, and in fact in New York it's pretty extreme.",
        "And this market is unregulated, people often don't have the legal right to be in that apartment.",
        "They can also put themselves at risk of fire safety and other concerns.",
        "So clearly there was a need, but the population didn't have enough choices in the housing market to find legal, safe housing.",
        "So we began to look at alternatives, and one of them certainly was a smaller unit that was not permitted under our existing zoning and building code.",
        "So your idea was we'll make it legal and we'll control it?",
        "Exactly, regulate it, make it safe, make it legal, bring it into the light of day and really put more choice out there.",
        "And for us it's not just about micro-units, it's also about looking at how to make safe and legal basement apartments that can be converted and be fire-safe as well as creating units for single people to share, because as the caller spoke about, that sense of community, that also comes from single people sharing.",
        "And we're seeing more of a trend of that in New York as well.",
        "And we think that there should be more choices for people."

        "I mean, do you see it as part of the future for Seattle at large?",
        "And where does that kind of development stand?",
        "Right, well, I will return to my first point, which is that this needs to be done through legal standards, and there is a process for how to do it.",

        "In Seattle, these places, a lot of them are under 200 square feet.",
        "So they are very small.",
        "They're starting at about 600 and going up to $700 and above.",
        "So they're not necessarily all that affordable.",
        "And they're really only for some people.",
        "They're for singles; you cannot have even a single mother with a child in them.",

        "If you're in a wheelchair, there's not a lot of units available for you.",
        "So it's a very specific kind of person who can and will live in these, which is great, but we want variety in our neighborhood.",
        "We want to make sure that we're not losing our older homes where seven different people are renting a room in an older home, tearing that out and then putting in a place where only, you know, 49 young people can live, or 50 or 60.",
        "That's what's happening.",

        "Hi there.",
        "Yes, I am a property owner in Capitol Hill, Seattle, and also a former urban planning professor.",
        "And I generally support micro-housing.",
        "I think it's an excellent land use, and it's basically the opposite of sprawl.",
        "If you look at the demographics, people - the largest growing sector of households are single-person households, and a lot of those currently are occupying two-bedroom or larger condos, houses, et cetera.",
        "And this really is just about choice.",
        "You know, I think that those who want to live in it should be able to if that's what they want to do.",
        "But I think one unresolved question that could make these a lot more acceptable to the neighbors would be, where are these folks going to park?",
        "Because they tend to be young professionals who have good incomes.",
        "They're going to want to have cars.",
        "They may not even use them every day.",
        "And I'm wondering, has anybody looked at, you know, how do you deal with the parking issues in a dense urban environment, and is there a way to have them park offsite, have them park their cars three blocks away so that when they're going out of town they've got a place to go, but they're not going to use their car every day because they're living in a dense urban environment."

        "Jerilyn Perine in New York City, I'm imagining a lot of people in your micro-housing units don't have cars there in the city.",
        "But are there other impacts that you have to gauge when you're packing so many more people into the same amount of space?",
        "Well, yes, of course.",
        "I mean, you know, you always have to look at the specific context for any building, but again, if you take the New York example, this population is already here.",
        "And so it's not like you're going to be increasing the population by creating these units.",
        "The population is here, but they are turning to an informal and often illegal housing market to obtain it.",
        "And so we just want those people to have a choice to be housed more reasonably.",
        "You always have to look at questions of location, and, you know, parking is a good point.",
        "That's not a big issue, particularly for the adAPT pilot that Mayor Bloomberg is now doing with a developer in Manhattan, because you don't really need to have a car in Manhattan.",
        "And for the most part, in fact, we're finding this population is not a big apartment - not a big parking user.",
        "The other thing to remember about issues like parking for people who are calling in from other cities is that, in fact, in a place like New York, there's no regulation.",
        "You could have a single-family home, and you could have five cars.",
        "And so there's nothing that is regulating that, either.",
        "So the single population is here.",
        "They're here to stay.",
        "And I should point out that New York is actually 17th on the list of cities with a proportion of single-person households.",
        "So, in fact, this isn't just sort of a New York idea.",
        "Seattle and D.C.",
        "are way up on top.",
        "But a lot of cities that you might not imagine have a higher proportion of single-person households than New York, like Nashville and Milwaukee.",
        "So this is an American issue.",
        "You actually see this same population trend happening in Europe, and it's here to stay.",
        "And so we have to think about a single population and how best to house them and how to give them the greatest choice and the greatest amount of mobility.",
        "All right.",
