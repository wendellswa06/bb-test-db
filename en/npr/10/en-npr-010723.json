        "Yeah.",

        "It's a very complicated issue of having to deal with relationship between an abuser and a victim.",

        "I came from rural West Virginia myself.",
        "And in West Virginia, they had to pass a law that said that men would lose their license for their guns if they didn't, you know, stay out of domestic violence court.",

        "I have not counseled people in this kind of circumstances, but I would like to say that violence against women, 90 percent of the people who are victim of domestic violence are women, 90 percent.",
        "But this - we have men who come and complain of violence against them from women.",
        "But the fact that majority of the victims of domestic violence are women make this issue - it, you know, looks like the one gender have committed more abuse against the other.",
        "Many people come to me and said, how about men, always they talk about violence against women.",
        "And I do address that issue, and I say and I acknowledge that some men have been abused by women, but majority of the abuse is abuse or violence against women.",
        "OK.",
        "But one of the things that we're starting to learn now from research that's happening around the country, and a lot of college professors are taking it up, is that domestic abuse happens at about the same rates in heterosexual relationships, and in gay and lesbian relationships.",
        "So, you know, within the - whatever percentage of a population that happens to be gay or lesbian, we know that this is happening at the same rates.",
        "And it's about power and control, not necessarily about gender roles.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Each year, we'd rotate what subject would give up a day of classes, you know, teaching in their classrooms to allow the speaker to come in.",
        "So, for example, one week, all the science classes in the eight grade would instead spend the 45- or 50-minute class talking about dating violence and relationship violence.",
        "And, you know, it's even important to start in elementary school, but you do it at a different angle.",
        "But by the time kids are in middle school, they're definitely dating, and they need to be aware of the signs and they need to, exactly as your guest said, talk to somebody.",
        "And being a counselor, that was something that I talked openly about so that kids would know that it was something that they could talk about.",
        "And, you know, train them in how important it is to either come with a kid that you, as another kid, are worried about, or sneak in to the guidance counselor, tell the counselor that you're worried about kid X and either ask for anonymity or not, as you will.",
