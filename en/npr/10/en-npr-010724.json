        "So, you deal in your column with the nature of the substance.",
        "How do you - I mean, how do you describe relations, and is there anybody actually addressing this problem in a way that, you know, ordinary people can come to grips with?",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "As a white man, I usually find my problem is when I try and bring up this conversation with race, it doesn't become a dialogue.",
        "It becomes more of people telling me how I should feel and how I should interact with other races, pointing out things that, you know, institutional racism in the past or current, you know, perpetuated by white males.",
        "I've a difficulty in making it a dialogue, making it a two-way conversation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I feel more boxed in and trapped.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Well, there's two questions there, but I'm not exactly sure that a lot of the diversity training that I've been a part of is helpful in the sense that it helps us to explore our own biases and prejudices and how we've come to those and how we might be able to overcome them.",
        "You know, a lot of what we hear, when we hear discussions about race, is more of an educational dialogue, where people are basically being taught sensitivity training.",
        "And that may be very helpful particularly in workplaces.",
        "But that doesn't get to the root cause of why the bias makes this within you in the first place.",
        "And I think that that is where the conversation becomes very helpful.",
        "That is the conversation that I am talking about in my piece.",
        "You know, I think that people have to start to say, I would like to have a conversation with you; I fully understand that some parts of this you may find offensive.",
        "Right.",
        "But the only reason that I am willing to engage in it is because I want to explore whatever biases I may have and figure out ways to get over them.",
        "Well, that's the question, then.",
        "Do you think that there are ways to get over them?",
        "I absolutely do.",
        "I mean, there was one intriguing little study that I put in the piece about, you know, researchers were able to diminish the implicit racial bias that many whites had by teaching them to differentiate between black people's faces, basically teach - showing that - you know, getting people to treat individuals as individuals helps a lot.",
        "And I think that's where this sort of conversation becomes immensely powerful, is when you can decouple this notion of, you know, everyone behaving in a certain way or that this individual has to answer for everyone who looks like them, that even in light of statistics, which are powerful, quite frankly, and you can't completely dismiss them; if you have higher crime rates in a community, on some level, there is a logical human response that you may not - you may feel afraid of a certain community.",
        "I mean, there is a certain level on which that racist bias is rooted in a statistical truth."

        "Like I was saying, I'm from South Bend, Indiana, northern Indiana town, Midwestern, so not a lot of cultural diversity around here.",
        "So, most of my friends I associate with are white.",
        "And I find that discussing race is difficult not because, you know, maybe they don't understand or maybe they're not receptive to it; it's that they're hypersensitive.",
        "Any time any discussion of race is bought up or any time I would even make the comment that I kind of long to be around more black people, I wish more black people would be, you know, into the things that I'm into, they kind of shut it down by saying, well, we're your friends; it doesn't matter that you're black to us, and you know, it doesn't matter to you that I'm white; you know, we like what we like, and we like you, so why does that make a difference?",
        "And it's kind of, you know, the whole colorblind argument that they throw.",
        "So, any time there's any kind of discussion of race, it's kind of shut down, and to me, that - I feel that that's not acknowledging who I am.",
        "I'm black; I'm an African-American female; it's a part of me; it is my life.",
        "I have experiences that I would like to, you know, discuss, share, and I feel like it's denied for the sake of being \"\"colorblind,\"\" quote/unquote.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "So, Charles Blow, is Angela's description the kind of thing that people - that you think would be useful for people to say to the - I mean, like in Angela's case, say to her friends, look, it does matter?",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, one thing that she touches on is - and that I try to get at in the piece - is that a couple of studies have shown that whites are very, very reluctant to engage in any race-related conversation because they fear that they will say something that will have them be pegged as prejudiced.",
        "And that is such a strong reaction that one scientist using brain scans and tests following just a basic conversation between whites and people of other races found that they were cognitively and emotionally exhausted just after having a conversation, not even about race, with a person of that race.",
        "Right.",
        "So, you start from that; you have to understand that that's happening.",
        "But second, it was, you know - what she was describing is the perfect opportunity for someone to have a discussion because, you know - my first question, you know, that I would like to have had her white friend to ask is, so why is it so important for you to be around other black people, and what does - what difference would that make for you as a person?",
        "And just..."

        "So - but why do we do that?",
        "And you know, that can be just a jumping off point for, you know, some interesting dialogue.",
        "And if someone finds something offensive, my suggestion to them is always to say, do you understand how someone including me could find that to be offensive?",
        "And then get the caller to explore why people - why that person might be taking offense, if indeed they are.",
        "And that just opens more conversation and keeps going down, you know, drilling down, to why we hold the beliefs that we believe.",
        "And I think keeping it on this very personal level is the most constructive kind of conversation we can have.",
        "Angela, thanks so much for kicking off the discussion.",

        "OK.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, Kyle, I think, if I'm hearing you right, it's what Charles Blow is referring to when he says it's a difficult conversation to have.",
        "Am I right there, Charles?",
        "I think you're right.",
        "And I think the caller taps into, you know, another kind of strand of this conversation that I think we should be aware of.",
        "I think this idea of addressing historical bias and institutional racism is such an academic conversation that it's not really the most engaging and useful way for individuals, one on one, to have a conversation about race.",
        "Also, if you come to the conversation prepared to defend your position, you've already lost the conversation, because then it becomes, you know, almost a legal, kind of courtroom dynamic, where you show some proof and I show some proof and I'm trying to convince you that I'm right and you're trying to convince me that you're right.",
        "It would be much better if the caller's - the people that the caller are trying to engage in, if he - you know, he is a making a step forward and I - you know, if he is saying, I would like to have a conversation with you about race because I would like to explore biases that I may have and that you may have so that we can both figure out ways to get beyond those biases, and start with questions like - I mean, I was preparing, when you guys called to have me on the show, a blog post, because a lot of people call and say, I think it's important, but how do I start this conversation?",
        "I just really need basic, you know, questions to start a conversation.",
        "And I think a lot of those start with, you know, getting people to figure out why they believe what they believe."

        "So, even if you say, for instance, you know, (unintelligible) have one poll that I think it was, like, something like 30 percent of whites say that they experience racial discrimination from blacks.",
        "Do - you know, ask your - the person you're speaking with.",
        "Do - why do you think that as many white people say this?",
        "Do you believe it to be true?",
        "Do you think that this gets enough talking time in the debate about race?",

        "I think it's important that people keep in mind that not all white people don't care and want to understand, but are just afraid to ask.",
        "I mean, is she getting at the heart of the problem here, that there is this fear that's so prevalent?",
        "Well, one part of one problem, which is that, you know, there are some blacks who want it both ways.",
        "They want to talk about race all the time, but when - and they want you to have an open and honest conversation about it, but take immediate offense to things that they hear that they think - that they don't agree with and they think maybe a racial bias or racism coming from the person they're speaking to.",

        "Right.",
        "And there is no getting past that.",
        "And in fact, I - you know, I kind of strongly urge people not to have this conversation at work.",
        "I mean, our work rules have built in environment that if you say some of the things that would be frank and honest conversation, you know, that could be making a hostile work environment.",
        "I mean, you kind of have to, I think, start with the people closest to you - your neighbors, the people who would be least likely to judge and to jump to conclusions about your motives - and start there and re-branch this conversation off from that point.",
        "But you can't have it both ways.",
        "If you are not - if - people have to be able to reveal a prejudice without being reviled for that prejudice, because if, you know, like they say, if their heart is in the right place, if they're trying to reveal it in order to figure out a way to get past it, then that's an honorable thing for anyone to do and we have to be able to allow people to do that.",
