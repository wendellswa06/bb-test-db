        "Well you pay attention, Farai, and also, a lot of people think, oh they are going to lay off, you know, these people, they are going to lay off these people but I'm safe because my boss likes me.",
        "Heck, your boss might not be safe.",
        "So if you're in a company if your seen a round or two of layoffs, you better start looking.",
        "Now, let's talk about unemployment.",
        "Very practical issue.",
        "There are unemployment benefits.",
        "Explain what they are and how do you qualify and sign up.",
        "If you've worked for at least a year you will qualify for unemployment benefits.",
        "You do go, you go to your state, every state has an office of employment security and that's where you sign up.",
        "You, depending on the state you may have a waiting period.",
        "Unemployment benefit is 26 weeks.",
        "There is legislation, that the White House opposes, that would extend unemployment benefits in high unemployment states by an additional 13 to 26 weeks.",
        "That's legislation that's pending but hasn't been passed.",
        "But it's 26 weeks right now and the weekly amount can be as little as 50 to 75 dollars and in certain states as much as two or 300 hundred dollars a week.",
        "Now tell us a little bit about the, how basically you continue your benefits, because isn't there a requirement that you're looking and/or a requirement that you haven't worked certain days of a week and things like that?",
        "Well you have to, but you have to show that your looking for work, so you have to report to your unemployment office with some periodicity, maybe weekly, in some states it may be more, you know, monthly.",
        "They generally ask you to keep a record, so you have to say, I went to this establishment, I interviewed.",
        "They also, these departments of employment services tend to have job registers, so they may ask you, have you got out on a job register?",
        "Now they may not tend to be as strict as they might be, because they don't have a lot of people to follow up with people, but the intention in giving you unemployment benefits is not just to give you a paid vacation.",
        "The intention is to help you while you're looking for a job.",
        "So let's talk about severance.",
        "It's different from unemployment.",
        "Severance is something that your job may or may not give you.",
        "What are the circumstances in general under which you will get severance.",
        "It really depends if you're a long-term employee and it's a mass layoff, they're laying off 500, 600 people.",
        "You might get so many dollars or so many weeks of pay for the number of weeks that you worked there, so if you worked there 10 years you may get 10 or 20, some multiple of 10 weeks.",
        "But it really depends on the company.",
        "And if a company is doing layoffs because they are in bad shape, they might not.",
        "My advice to people is just to always ask and always negotiate.",
        "Make sure that you're in negotiating mode.",
        "Negotiate other things as well.",
        "Large companies, you might be able to negotiate the date that you leave.",
        "You want to make sure you know what's going to happen with your accumulated sick and vacation pay.",
        "Can you take that, how much of that are you going to be able to keep and how much of it goes away.",
        "You might want to negotiate things like whether or not you can keep your email and for how long, so that you can at least send out emails letting people know, you know, where you are.",
        "Some companies provide you with outplacement services.",
        "Usually these are larger companies but when you are given that pink slip, basically ask for - ask for the moon.",
        "You are probably not going to get it, but ask.",
        "Be clear, the company doesn't owe you anything, but no company wants to feel, especially with longer term employees, that they are not being compassionate.",
        "So rely on human resources to perhaps offer you a compassion option by asking for what you need.",
        "I have a friend who was fired during maternity leave recently...",
        "Ouch."

        "They may have survivors' guilt, but you have to be willing and able to understand how big of an impact this job had on your life.",
        "Some of the people you worked with were not your friends, they were your associates, get over it.",
        "Some of them are friends and you will have plenty to talk to them about even though you are not working with them, but the point is to keep yourself fully engaged.",
        "What about communities?",
        "You know, if, several people lose their job on one block or dozens of people have lost their jobs in a neighborhood what can happen?",
        "Well, it's a morale buster to see other people around you losing their jobs.",
        "To see - and it also is an economic strain on communities.",
        "People start borrowing from each other.",
        "Think about a family where two or three people lose jobs.",
        "Immediately those people have jobs think, I've got to help my brother, my sister out, and that creates some kinds of tensions.",
        "When do you get repaid?",
        "How are your economics?",
        "So, this joblessness is not an individual thing it really does affect communities, families, churches, neighborhoods.",
        "People have an impulse to help, the first one in a group that gets laid off, but when you look up and half the group or a third of the group is laid off it really becomes something of a strain."
