        "You're listening to NPR News.",
        "We have a portrait this morning of the public face of Iran.",
        "Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is one of the authors of a nuclear deal with world powers.",
        "It remains in place despite President Trump's campaign promise to scrap it.",
        "Zarif was in New York this week just as President Trump affirmed Iran has been honoring the multilateral deal.",
        "Hours later, the United States also imposed new sanctions on Iran.",
        "Amid all of this, the foreign minister sat down with American reporters who have specialized in Iran.",
        "And Steve, you went up to New York to sit in on this meeting.",
        "What did you take from it?",
        "Well, it's a spirited talk.",
        "We talked for about an hour and a half.",
        "It was mostly, although not entirely, on the record with a person who is well-chosen, if you want a foreign minister who can in some way speak to or relate to the United States.",
        "He's U.S.-educated.",
        "He doesn't just know English, he knows American English.",
        "He speaks the idiom.",
        "And he's a mild mannered-looking person, whatever the regime he may represent.",
        "He's got a tightly cropped beard, going gray.",
        "He's got glasses.",
        "He smiles a lot.",
        "He defended his country a lot, as you would expect, and expressed plenty of distaste for the new administration here in the United States.",
        "One of the things he said, by the way, was the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia seemed to be running many things in Washington right now, suggesting that the Saudis, Iran's rivals in the Persian Gulf, have too much influence here in Washington.",
        "Well, that speaks to the distrust.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, he can't like the idea of what seems like some mixed messages.",
        "I mean, the Trump administration admitting that Iran is following the rules of that nuclear deal but then imposing economic sanctions on some individual Iranians.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But this he shrugged off - or tried to shrug off.",
        "And it's worth noting, by the way, the same thing would happen in President Obama's time.",
        "There would be new targeted sanctions showing U.S.",
        "distaste for Iran, disapproval of Iran at the very moment of some diplomatic advance between the two countries.",
        "And Zarif talked a little bit about this.",
        "Let's listen."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "It has become now a rather tired routine that each time they want to certify or raise some of the sanctions, they make sure that they do something negative.",
        "And Zarif insisted, as Iranians often do, David, that the sanctions don't really influence them.",
        "You can make up your own mind.",
        "Sanctions were part of the diplomatic game leading up to the nuclear deal.",
        "He made it clear that he does not think that President Trump really knows his way around the Middle East.",
        "Well, isn't it worth asking the same question about Iran, if they know their way around?",
        "I mean, they've been supporting Syria's Bashar al-Assad with a lot of Iranians killed.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They think it's in their interest, but it's clearly awkward.",
        "And here's just one reason it's so awkward, David.",
        "Reporters made sure to raise this.",
        "Iran is firmly opposed to chemical weapons.",
        "They have a reason because chemical weapons actually were used on Iran in the 1980s by Iraq.",
        "And here's their friend Bashar al-Assad, who's repeatedly been found using chemical weapons.",
        "This was maybe the most heated moment in our whole talk because Iran's foreign minister, when asked about this, started questioning whether Assad has really used chemical weapons or at least whether he really used them on his own people last spring.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "Look at the surroundings.",
        "Chemical weapons were used a day after President Trump announced that the removal of Bashar al-Assad was no longer a priority.",
        "Why in the world would Bashar al-Assad use chemical weapons under those circumstances?",
        "Give the man a little bit of common sense.",
        "Oh, this prompted a lot of questions.",
        "One of the reporters in the room noted that it would be unwise to use Assad and common sense in the same sentence.",
        "(Laughter) Interesting.",
        "All of the talk today is about an amendment by Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Utah's Mike Lee.",
        "Their amendment to the bill would essentially let insurance companies sell any health insurance plan they would like to offer, as long as they also offer one plan that is compliant with all of the mandates outlined in Obamacare."

        "They see this as the compromise to the path forward.",

        "I think the reason is that it is the necessary ingredient to getting the votes that we have to have to follow through on our commitment to repeal Obamacare.",
        "I believe we can get there.",
        "It remains challenging.",
        "More work remains to be done.",
        "But there is a path forward.",
        "There's a huge amount of caution with this, obviously.",
        "Without a CBO score, not enough senators have said they will support it.",
        "And even without the CBO score, key senators like Susan Collins of Maine have already said the Cruz-Lee amendment is still not enough to get her on board.",
        "And if the Senate cannot get enough support for an updated version of this bill, where does the health care debate go from here?",
        "You know, if they want to pass legislation that would affect the individual market, it would mean that Republicans have to then turn to Democrats to get the votes.",
        "Some Republicans are already talking about that.",
        "Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters today he's already talking to Democrats about a health care proposal that he could unveil as soon as this week.",
        "He would not offer any details on it, try as we might.",
        "But it is certainly a recognition that there is still a deep sense of skepticism among Republicans that they're ultimately going to be able to pass a health care bill on Republican votes alone.",
        "NPR's Susan Davis, thanks a lot.",
        "You bet.",
        "As the Senate continues its work repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, we want to help answer your questions about how it might affect you and your family.",

        "Very good to have you on the program today.",
        "Delighted to be here.",
        "And, we have to begin, I guess, by pointing out that British and American laws are quite different in this respect.",
        "If Abu Hamza had been tried in a United States Court, are there any equivalent crimes?",
        "He probably would not be a subject to conviction in the United States because f the protections of the First Amendment.",
        "Under American constitutional law, at the present time, an individual could not be prosecuted for giving speeches that lead other persons to engage in unlawful conduct, unless the speaker expressly advocates unlawful conduct and unless that conduct is likely to follow imminently from the speech.",
        "So...yes, go on.",
        "I was just going to say, is there any example you can give us of somebody who was convicted under that law in this country?",
        "There has not, to my knowledge, been anyone convicted in those circumstances.",
        "The type of situation it envisions would be a mob, in which someone gets up on a soapbox and says, \"\"Hang that guy\"\", and the mob then goes ahead and hangs him.",
        "But that's the kind of paradigm of what, under American constitutional law today, would allow the punishment of the speaker.",
        "Otherwise, the basic premise is that the person to be punished is the one who's, commits the crime, not the one who engages in the speech.",
        "So in one legal concept, you're punishing what happens, and in another, you're punishing what somebody says should happen.",
        "Precisely.",
        "And in the United States we have a long history of trying to make sense out of this issue.",
        "In World War I, for example, the government prosecuted several thousand individuals who dissented against the war or the draft on the premise that, by criticizing the war and the draft, their speech had the effect of causing people to become disaffected with the government's policies.",
        "And if they were disaffected, they were more likely to refuse induction into the Army, or to desert, or to act in an insubordinate manner.",
        "And during World War I those people were prosecuted and convicted, and the Supreme Court upheld the convictions on the grounds that they had, through their speech, caused other people to engage in this unlawful conduct."

        "So, what's happened in the United States over the last 75 years, is that, as we've had experience with prosecutions of individuals for speech that has allegedly caused others to engage in crime, is that we recognized that it's very difficult to preserve a robust freedom of expression while at the same time holding people responsible for the acts of others.",
        "So, under First Amendment law today, the situations in which an individual could be punished are very narrowly defined.",
        "And, I guess the example everybody hears is yelling \"\"fire\"\" in a crowded theater, as somebody's saying, that's an example of where speech is not free.",
        "Would that be criminal if somebody was hurt in the ensuing stampede?",
        "Actually, the important part of that hypothetical, which was offered originally by Justice Holmes, is a false cry of \"\"fire\"\" in a crowded theater.",
        "A true cry of \"\"fire\"\" in a crowded theater obviously would not be punishable, even though it created an immediate harm to people who were injured in the panic to get out of the theater.",
        "And in this part that I want to play next, you're going to hear Zarif with the writer Barbara Slavin.",
        "And she points out that President Trump's statement saying that Assad was not going to be overthrown might be the very reason that Assad would feel comfortable using chemical weapons.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "Believe me, he is not crazy.",
        "To use chemical weapons the day after - why would he use chemical weapons the day after President Trump - I mean, just...",
        "He felt empowered to get away with whatever he wanted.",
        "Come on.",
        "Come on.",
        "Now later, Iran's foreign minister did admit that Syria has used chemical weapons but in the past, he insisted, and he blamed, quote, \"\"rogue elements."
