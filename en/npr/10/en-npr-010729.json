        "At one point he said, well, Americans have refused to release Iranians, too, which suggests there's some kind of trade going on.",

        "If a customer doesn't have enough money in their account, the charge will simply be declined.",
        "But as NPR's Tamara Keith reports, banks will still find ways to make money.",
        "Twenty billion dollars is a lot of money to leave on the table.",
        "That's how much banks made last year on overdraft fees on debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals.",
        "And while Bank of America may have chosen to forego some of those fees, other banks are working on ways to get their customers to opt in.",

        "As it stands now, 57 percent of people say they plan to opt out.",
        "That's according to a survey conducted by Act On Marketing.",
        "Gary Gablehouse says Act On is helping banks develop strategies for getting their customers to opt in.",
        "There could actually be a net increase of fees to a bank because you made it up on volume because you robbed the customers from the banks that are doing it wrong.",
        "Gablehouse says there are some customers out there who really like overdraft protection, who want to be able to buy a sandwich even though they have no money in the bank, and are willing to pay a $30 fee to avoid the embarrassment of being turned down at the check stand.",
        "Greg McBride with BankRate.com says most overdraft fees are paid by relatively few people.",
        "It is a mistake that anybody could make, but the key is to only make it once if you're going to make it.",
        "And the fact was that 14 percent of customers were generating 93 percent of the overdraft revenue.",
        "Indirectly, those frequent overdrafters probably helped pay for the rest of us to enjoy things like free checking.",
        "And going forward, McBride says that free checking is going to be harder to come by.",
        "There are always going to be unintended consequences.",
        "If you're one of those 75 percent of people who never overdraws your account, the fact that this may curtail the availability of free checking could prove to be an inconvenience to you.",

        "They are businesses, after all.",
        "Scott Talbott from the Financial Services Roundtable prefers to put it a little differently.",
        "It's not so much a one-to-one connection between, oh, we've lost revenue here, we need to make it up someplace else.",
        "Rather, banks will seek to find that mix of goods and services that their customers need.",
        "And, of course, there could be fees associated with that.",
        "It's an open question whether a year from now consumers will be saying thank goodness we got rid of those onerous overdraft fees or whether we'll fondly reflect on the good old days when there were fewer fees and easier access to free checking."

        "As long as the actor is thought to have sufficient opportunity to make an independent decision about whether to commit a criminal act or not, the law will essentially say, punish the actor, don't punish the speaker."

        "I think when you're getting to that point where you're talking about assassinating leaders, killing civilians, and carrying out acts of violence, that that absolutely cannot be tolerated.",

        "Well, I think that the rule that exists currently in the United States is not one that a person would come to easily or intuitively.",
        "It really is the result of the pragmatic understanding of what has happened in our own history with abuses of prosecutions of individuals on the claim that they were causing unlawful acts.",
        "So, the second era in American history when this problem became acute was during the Cold War, when the government prosecuted individuals, and where state and local governments and private entities persecuted individuals because they were members of the communist party.",
        "And the argument that was made there was that the communist party and its member advocated the violent overthrow of government, and indeed, one could find that kind of rhetoric within much of the communist discourse.",
        "And so what happened there is that speech that was offensive to people, primarily because the ideas they found odious was being punished on the excuse of the fact that the speech included these exhortations to overthrow; even though there was no serious possibility of such acts taking place, and even though there was no real fear that public expressions of the incitement were going to cause unlawful acts in fact.",
        "So the difficulties are separating the dislike for the substantive ideas that a person is expressing with the ability to use, as a pretext, the illegal advocacy as a way of punishing those persons.",
        "So the law we have in the United States is really the product of those two episodes; the World War I episode when individuals were being punished simply for criticizing the government, and then the solution, it was thought, was, okay, let's only punish people if they expressly advocate unlawful conduct, but then we have the second period, during he communist era, in which individuals were expressly advocating violent overthrow of the government, but in fact there was no harm directly associated with it.",
        "And so we saw lots of people being prosecuted in otherwise disadvantaged even though the speech really wasn't dangerous.",
        "So the current rule in the United States is really the result of those experiences.",
        "And the question that we have to ask today is, if this type of situation arose in the United States, if we had speakers like Abu Hamza in the United States and there were terrorist acts that we believed were traceable to that type of speech, should we change those standards, because they were overly protective or speech?",
        "Or, we have to be careful, are we really just angry at them for holding offensive opinions, and we're using the excuse of their advocating jihad as the justification for shutting them down, when our real reason for doing so is simply that we find them offensive?",
        "Those are very difficult problems in constitutional law, and of course since Britain does not have a written constitution, most of these questions don't arise at all under English law.",
