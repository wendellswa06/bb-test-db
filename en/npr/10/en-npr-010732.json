        "And one of the things that I found out - I worked on as a principal, was understanding that the parents of those children who seem to be not performing and who may come from a more impoverished background, oftentimes feel as if they are disenfranchised from the school, that perhaps as kids themselves they were unsuccessful as students or maybe even manifested with behavior problems.",
        "So one of the tasks I put before myself, and oftentimes before my teachers, was to try to figure out a way to break down the barriers and embrace the parents - kind of get them where they are.",
        "So a couple of strategies were things like making sure that before there's a conflict or an issue of performance that seems to be - would be an emotional time for the parent and the child, try to find a commonality in terms of interest or in terms of our personal histories and open up to that parent a little bit so that it's not just the...",
        "It's not just in a crisis where you're reaching out to them.",
        "And Dave, I think when we hear phone calls like you, I think teachers should get campaign ribbons, like they do in the military, so you'd be able to say ooh, five years in - wow, but anyway.",
        "Amy Wilkins, let's have your response, reaching out to parents.",
        "Dave is exactly right.",
        "And, you know, there are two strategies that we've seen work a lot.",
        "Dave is absolutely right that often the parents of poor kids did not themselves have good experiences in school.",
        "So school is not a comfortable place to come back to.",
        "And so we have to figure out ways to make schools more comfortable.",
        "One is catching kids being good, right.",
        "I mean, we - too often the calls from school are about kids, you know, getting into trouble.",
        "It's great when schools call home and say do you know what your kid did today, he/she did something absolutely fabulous.",
        "And that's a way to start building connections with parents."

        "The other is a really simple thing, is when you do parent-teacher meetings, or you do events at school in the evening, make sure there's child care for the younger sisters and brothers.",
        "Make sure - and meals really help.",
        "You know, you've got a working mom who's trying to figure out how to get to the PTA meeting or how to get to the parent-teacher conference plus how to feed the child and the siblings, you know, really simple meals can help bring parents into schools.",
        "Dave, did you have that experience?",
        "Well, yes we had that experience.",
        "A couple of other things that we've tried to put together, one was kind of an easily accessible parent communication, a newsletter.",
        "And I may be a bit of, I don't know, an old-timer, but I didn't believe that the best way to do that was always electronically, that if we put a hard copy of a newsletter that not only covered activities in school but some parenting tips, volunteer opportunities, in the hands of the kids to take home, and we checked occasionally to make sure that parents got that, we didn't eliminate those people who may not have access to a computer, which many times, in my opinion, are those people who are of lesser income.",
        "And the other thing was to make sure that they knew that their presence on campus was welcome and that there were volunteer activities, whether they would like to do something with a small group of kids to reinforce some instruction or maybe just staple papers, that they were always welcome to be at school volunteering, and by doing that, kids would see that the school as a community was an important place and a safe place for their parents to be, and therefore, in my opinion, the kids felt safer, more comfortable and I think more willing to perform.",

        "Or a single parent who is working two jobs.",
        "Right.",
        "Why do we believe that that's OK?",
        "I mean, why - we can, and we've seen schools where they in fact do homework at school.",
        "Right, you have study hall in the library after school, and you make the librarian, you make high school students available to help with the homework."
