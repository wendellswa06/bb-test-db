        "Sure.",
        "You know, what I argued was that for the last decade or a bit longer, we have really discussed school improvement in this country almost entirely of the language of closing achievement gaps, that to be taken seriously by foundations or policymakers, it was essential that everything be framed in terms of closing achievement gaps between children of different ethnicities, between children of different incomes."

        "And I've argued that this has had some really unfortunate effects on the way that we've approached school improvement.",
        "Such as?",
        "Well, three in particular jump out.",
        "One is we have, I think unfortunately but very explicitly, tended to give folks the sense that outside of the schools that are failing, outside of these kids who are getting shortchanged, everything else is doing - everything else is reasonably OK, despite the fact, for instance, that when you look at the international assessments, we tend to lag the pack at the high end in very much the same way we do at the low end.",
        "Second, that children actually, based on how they're doing when they come to school and based on achievement, have really different needs.",
        "Kids from the bottom of the socioeconomic scale tend to come to school with vocabularies of about 5,000 words.",
        "Kids from more fortunate backgrounds tend to start school at age six with vocabularies of about 20,000 words.",
        "They're in a position to learn from different things, to benefit from different kinds of instruction, and yet when we look at the investment - in Investing in Innovation Fund created by ARRA, when we look at foundation priorities at federal programs, really everything is geared to trying to drive up proficiency for the worst-served kids.",
        "And I think this has particularly shortchanged us when it's come to issues like world language or advanced science.",
        "And third and perhaps most practically, we essentially dealt middle-class and suburban families out of school improvement.",
        "We have said that this isn't about your kid, that you're supposed to do it because it's the right thing.",
        "But at the end of the day, so many of the policies we talk about, like trying to identify effective teachers and move them into the worst-served schools, will essentially entail strip-mining those teachers out of middle-class and suburban schools.",
        "This is no way to build or sustain public support for improvement efforts.",
        "Yet there's no question that these gaps do exist.",
        "Sure they do, and they're going to exist in 3014 and in 5014.",
        "And we absolutely should make it - you know, one of our priorities should be trying to make sure that we're doing better by the worst-off kids.",
        "But the way we've tended to do this in education in the last half-century is we tend to have these wild swings of the pendulum from, in 1958, right after the Soviets launched Sputnik, we passed the National Defense Education Act, and it was all about foreign languages and science and gifted kids.",
        "So what we have here is cooked, dehydrated, insect larvae.",

        "And ever since that point, we have tended to kind of wildly swing back and forth.",
        "And right now, I think, we're unfortunately - we've been in a decade-long moment when we have systematically ignored the needs of kids - of high achievers.",
        "We've systematically pursued school reform in a way that has really caused suburban and middle-class families to find little of value to them and their children.",
        "And I think this is an unfortunate direction for school improvement.",
        "It seems counterintuitive to say that the poorest are falling further and further behind, and we've been focusing on a system that disadvantages the wealthiest.",
        "Sure, it does.",
        "I mean, one of the problems, for instance, is that we know that low-income children do poorly when they are in, you know, schools that are segregated by class.",
        "Unfortunately, when we have school reform strategies that are built entirely around relatively crude remedies, the way we're talking about using value-added assessments today to simplemindedly evaluate and reward teachers, when we look at NCLB-style accountability...",
        "That's No Child Left Behind, yeah.",
        "You know, the danger here is we make it really hard for folks to start coming up with creative ways to solve problems.",
        "Sure, I mean, I think it is - you know, one of the interesting things, of course, is that NCLB has, in significant ways, moved our attention to racial achievement gaps and away from income achievement gaps.",
        "And, you know, I think it should surprise no one to see that we've made modest but limited progress on the racial gap front the last decade, we have not made that same kind of progress on the income front.",
        "But I think at the end of the day, I don't think we're satisfied with any of these directions, with the progress on any of these scores.",
        "And, you know, partly, if you really want to build sustainable, broad-based improvement efforts in the U.S., the model that one goes with has historically been Social Security and Medicare, not Medicaid, and right now we're talking about school reform as a redistributive social program, and those tend not to succeed in the U.S.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think a couple of things about what Rick said.",
        "It seems to me that one of the most important forces in education over the last at least five years has been the move of the states, 44 of them, to raise their standards so that all kids graduate from high school college-ready.",
        "That's a clear acknowledgement that we are not doing well enough by any of our children and that even our middle-class and affluent children need to be challenged more.",
        "So Rick's analysis fails to sort of take this big move that is going to fundamentally change education in every classroom in most of the country into account in his analysis.",
        "The other thing that's disturbing to me about Rick's analysis is that he seems to sort of - he says when we deal with gaps by race and class that we are somehow, you know, forgetting the smart kids, as if there's no such thing as a smart kid of color, or there's no such thing as a smart poor kid.",
        "Where we in fact see the biggest achievement gaps in the country is at the top.",
        "We see too few kids of color at the advanced level, too few low-income kids at the advanced level.",
        "I don't think anybody who's concerned with closing the achievement gap is only talking about bringing the bottom up.",
        "We have to figure out, again, to get out of this mediocrity in international comparisons that Rick referred to, we have to raise all children, and we have to make sure that black kids, Latino kids, poor kids who have the ability to soar can indeed soar because there are many, many smart kids who are at the wrong end of the achievement gap only because of the circumstances of their schools not because of their abilities.",
        "But one of your suggestions is we reallocate teachers and put the best teachers in the schools that need them the most.",
        "Is that - he used the word strip-mining, and you might not agree with that, but isn't that taking the best teachers from some schools and moving them to others?",
        "Yeah, and what we've found, the school district that has done this kind of the most successfully is the Charlotte Mecklenburg School District, and you don't just sort of strip-mine the teachers out of there.",
        "You give teachers a choice, and essentially what it becomes is a value proposition, recognizing - and the teachers recognize this themselves, that educating the easiest-to-educate kids is not as much of a professional challenge, that you have to be up to a bigger professional challenge to go into a high-poverty, high-minority school and be truly successful.",
        "And so we have to change the incentive structure to make teachers who are up for a bigger challenge to reward them for that.",
        "Let's go back to the phones.",
        "This is Bailey(ph), Bailey with us from Phoenix.",
        "Hi, I'm a Montessori charter schoolteacher here in Phoenix, and I wanted to bring up the charter school system here in Arizona, as well as I know in Louisiana, has been a big help by raising academic standards.",
        "Charter schools, you know, have their own (technical difficulty) each school, so changes can actually be made faster within the school because you have such a small body overseeing it.",
        "I'm also at a Montessori school, which provides each child their level, whatever level that child's at is the level that I teach them.",
        "So the ones that are a little bit lower, I'm pushing up.",
        "The ones - I have a first-grader who's doing fractions and is getting into multiplication.",
        "So whatever their ability is is what I'm teaching them."
