        "But in this school, we will teach you really well.",

        "We can't do anything.",
        "Or worse, they say, oh, because this child comes from more challenging circumstances, we can't really expect her to learn algebra.",

        "But the point I'd like to bring up is the importance of early childhood education, especially in helping students who come from a background of poverty.",
        "You know, I was fortunate to grow up in a home with a Ph.D. and an M.D. as parents, and, you know, I was one of those kids who probably had a 25- or 30,000-word vocabulary when I showed up to school.",

        "And I've dealt with a lot of kids who come from poor backgrounds, and they come to school with a - what a psychologist friend of mine described as a poverty of thought.",
        "And that needs to be addressed at a very early level, because by the time they matriculate up to high school, they don't have the skill set that they need to be successful."

        "Programs like Head Start have been proven to be very effective.",
        "The critics have rightfully maintained that the effect of Head Start wear off over time because as the kids matriculate they don't continue to get the level of support that they got when they were younger.",
        "A lot of this has to do with the way that we fund public schools.",
        "And Mr. Hess made a good point that sometimes we're robbing from Peter to pay Paul, you know, shortchanging the gifted and talented kids in order to help the kids who don't have the kind of skill sets that they need.",
        "And this just points to the fact that we really need to better fund public education.",
        "I could go on for days about this, but I'd like to hear what you guys have to say.",
        "Better funding public education has not been seemingly a priority in many states over the past couple years.",
        "We do need to better fund public education but we also - and I want to be clear about the robbing Peter to pay Paul - in many states and in many school districts in this country, we have funding formulas that disadvantage high poverty schools, that disadvantage high poverty school districts.",
        "So we have to, you know, pouring more money through a formula that is unfair is not necessarily the right thing to do.",
        "We've got to level up these high poverty schools because, as you said, kids who go to Head Start get, you know, good support in the beginning.",
        "Then we put them in, you know, not so good public schools.",
        "And by third grade, the impact of Head Start begins to wane, and that kills me because they always, like, you know, they blame Head Start for that.",
        "But that's, like, blaming my gym that I'm getting fat when I stop going to the gym.",
        "But we've got to provide, you know, Head Start recognizes the fact that it takes more to educate poor kids.",
        "And if we could take that same ethic up through the public schools, we'd be a lot better off.",
        "Just wanted to follow that up, and this is an email from Barbara.",
        "It starts in infancy, she says.",
        "Why is nobody talking about the powerful research done by the Urban Child Institute in Memphis about brain development ages zero to three?",
        "Wouldn't our money be better spent focusing on teaching young mothers how to stimulate their children's brains as infants?",
        "And there's some really good work going on.",
        "And it, you know, the in-home visitors program, I think, one of the more famous ones is called HIPPY, that's built on an Israeli model, is doing some really nice work with low-income moms.",
        "There's some nice visiting nurse programs that are doing really wonderful work with low-income moms around the country.",
        "But what I think is sometimes too often, as a matter of fact, we say, well, if they didn't get, you know, the right stimulization - the stimulation zero to three, or if they didn't get Head Start, then we get them in public school, and we say they're lost causes.",

        "You want to taste them?",
        "No, not really.",
        "Okay, here, I will.",
        "You aren't a lost cause when you're four no matter what.",
        "I mean, you know, the best early childhood researchers say that human brains, children's brains are terribly resilient.",
        "If they weren't so resilient, the species wouldn't be as successful as we have been.",
        "And so while there's lots we can do before they get to school, we cannot allow what didn't happen before they get to school be an excuse for not doing well by them in school."
