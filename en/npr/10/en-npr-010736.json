        "It depends on how Netflix is classified - is it a traditional broadcaster, like a TV channel, or an online platform, like YouTube?",
        "But Netflix has raised eyebrows in Kenya among more than just moralizing bureaucrats.",

        "Well, one of the challenges with artificial arms is how do you tell them what to do.",
        "You lose your muscle and your bones, but the nerves are still there, and the nerves carry all the information, they carry the commands from the brain and they carry the sensation signals from the arm to the - back to the brain.",
        "So we've taken those nerves, which we're calling data cables, and moved them to spare muscle on the chest.",
        "The amputee - these amputees have no arms, so the muscles that used to go to it are not doing anything, and we've let these nerves grow in the new muscles on the chest and on the chest skin.",
        "So now, when the patient thinks close their hand, a piece of the chest muscle contracts.",
        "The brain doesn't know it's going to the wrong muscle, but a piece of the chest muscle contracts.",
        "We can pick up that signal and tell the artificial hand to close.",
        "In this way, we can control an arm in a much more natural and fluid way.",
        "And the flipside of it is that the hand sensation nerves grew into the chest skin, so now when you touch that chest skin, the patient feels as if you're touching the missing hand.",
        "And we at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago are very excited about this because this is a portal into the nervous system, the sensory nervous system, and our goal is to put sensors in a prosthetic hand, so that when it touches something, we can measure how hard it's touching and squeezing, and we can feed that information back to devices that we put over this new skin called tactors, so that the tactor presses on the skin and, thus, the amputee will touch something with their artificial hand and feel it in their own missing hand.",
        "And that would be a very powerful feedback for them.",
        "And it's also, you know, very powerful psychologically.",
        "You touch something and it feels like it's your own hand.",
        "Have you actually been able to create prosthesis that can actually feel these sensors yet?",
        "Yes, we've done early experiments in the lab where we've had sensors in the fingers and fed that information back onto the chest.",
        "And it's - I would say it's a crude sensation right now, but something's better than nothing, and we have a lot of room for improvement.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Also, if you're in the \"\"Second Life,\"\" you can find our folks at \"\"Second Life\"\" there in the SciLand in Science School.",
        "And a question from Lawrence(ph) in \"\"Second Life\"\" says, can the wire - the nerves detect heat, can they detect heat also?",
        "Yes.",
        "Actually, our patients are able to detect hot and cold within near normal levels as if it were in their missing hand.",
        "And the touch that they feel is very exquisite.",
        "They can feel, like, one gram of force pushing against the skin, and they feel it as if it's in their own hand.",

        "Yes, sir.",
        "So he thinks to move his elbow or move his hands or move his wrist and the sensors on the skin pick up the signals of the muscles.",
        "The muscles are actually acting like a biological amplifier, if you would, of the nerve signals.",
        "So we're getting lots of data that we can then process and use to control an artificial arm in a very natural way.",
        "Do the people find - you know, the people who you're testing this at on, do they find the sensation disconcerting that you could feel your missing arm by touching your chest?",
        "Well, I think it's a little bit different, and it was actually quite a surprise the first time it developed.",
        "But for the most part, patients have enjoyed it.",
        "They liked to be able to feel their missing arm, and no one has complained that it's uncomfortable.",
        "I think when it first started re-growing in, it was kind of sensitive for a little while, but that…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…even that sensitivity kind of went away, and it - and our patients have enjoyed having the sensation.",
        "Now, when you reroute the nerves to the chest, let's say, nerves from the hand, can you know which part of the hand shows up in which part of the chest?",
        "To some extent, yes.",
        "My colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, did the surgery, and there's four main nerves that go to your arm, and each of those nerves go to the sensation of different parts of your hand.",
        "For example, the median nerve innervates the thumb, first finger and second finger, so we can put that to one section.",

        "How are you?",

        "Well, that's an exciting possibility, and we're just starting to study the idea of creating a neural interface like this at the Rehab Institute of Chicago for people with lower limb loss and using powered artificial legs.",

        "And that's where you're headed, a new area now?",
        "Hey, I had a question for you.",
        "I am a below-elbow amputee and this happened back in 1998.",
        "And since then, I have had some really weird sensations, like below my elbow with some nerves, and I guess they call it phantom, I don't know, phantom pain or phantom feelings or something to that effect.",

        "And when they fit to this myoelectric arm, they were reading - I guess, they're taking readings from off of my stump.",

        "Oh, that's fine.",
        "So the prostheses that we're using now really are myoelectric prostheses in that they're using the muscle signals much like the one they tried with you.",
        "We do pretty well with the myoelectric prostheses in most people with below-the-elbow amputations because all the muscles that control the hand, or many of the muscles that control the hand, are still there in your residual limb up by your elbow, and we can use those signals to tell a hand to open and close in a natural way.",
        "Right now, our research is looking at helping people with higher level of amputations.",
        "So they've lost all those muscles and their amputation is above the shoulder…",
        "Yeah."
