        "Well, you know, the sense of touch is very important in our interactions, and there's nothing more wonderful than holding loved one's hand or picking up your child.",
        "The sense of touch that we get with this procedure is real as if it's touching a hand.",
        "But it's still, I'd say, kind of crude.",
        "My one patient describes it as, well, it feels like you're touching my hand, but I've got to stick glove on my hand.",
        "So it's not as exquisite a sensation as your real hand, but there is kind of a neat connection to the fact that it is going to hand sensation, which is what we use when we touch our loved ones most of the time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I think there's a potential to help with that part of the emotional adjustment, and emotional adjustment to amputation is a huge issue.",
        "Is it - is there a phantom pain?",
        "Is that gone?",
        "Well, phantom pain is a different phenomenon.",
        "It's more - something to do with the brain and having it signal sensation go away.",
        "The kind of brain does something that causes sensation and pain.",
        "Whereas, what we've done is provide a real sensation.",
        "I had hoped that it would help phantom limb sensation by giving the nerves something to do.",
        "But, in fact, we found - it really hasn't changed much.",
        "I've had patients who had severe phantom limb pain before this procedure and they've had it afterwards.",
        "And I've had patients with no phantom limb pain or sensation to speak up before this procedure and none after.",
        "So it doesn't seem to affect that much."

        "I mean, the signals could be hooked up to robotic arms anywhere, but for normal able-bodied people going to the muscle to get signals for control would be a step backwards.",
        "It's really - we'd want to use our hands and our fingers and thumbs…",

        "Well, to understand the case I think it's important to understand a little bit of the history.",
        "Back in 1999, under the Clinton administration, several environmental groups petitioned the EPA to consider regulating greenhouse gases as they were emitted from automobiles.",
        "And they argued, based on an EPA general council's opinion, at least in part, that greenhouse gases were pollutants and therefore the EPA was required to regulate the pollutant.",
        "EPA sat on the petition for a number of years and in 2003 they ultimately rejected the petition, saying that greenhouse gases were in fact not a pollutant.",
        "And even if they were, policy reasons suggested that discretion allowed the EPA to not regulate.",
        "After that, Massachusetts, twelve other states, several environmental groups - all brought an action in the D.C.",
        "circuit to challenge the EPA's decision.",
        "And so the EPA - so the suit is to force the EPA to regulate CO2 as it would what, nitrous oxide, particulates, other kinds of pollutants?",
        "In a sense, yes, but it's important I think to clarify - this came up in front of the Supreme Court - that is, what exactly the plaintiffs are asking for.",
        "The plaintiffs here are saying the decision was based on factors that EPA was not allowed to consider, and EPA was in error in saying that CP2 and other greenhouse gases weren't a pollutant.",
        "So if the petitioners win, all that means is the decision has to go back to EPA and EPA needs to consider the petition once again using the appropriate factors.",
        "Why was - why were only automobiles included?",
        "Why not factories, things like that?",
        "Well, there are actually other lawsuits pending and currently staid, for example in power plants.",
        "I think that the petitioners in this case focused on automobiles.",
        "Section 202 and 302 of the act specifically address automobiles and that allowed the petitioners a good target.",
        "Six percent of the world's greenhouse gases are admitted by U.S.",
        "automobiles.",
        "Can you tell from the questions asked in the Supreme Court by the Justices, this week, how they're leaning?",
        "Well, it's difficult.",
        "I think, from the questions, you can see that the court was split.",
        "There are three basic questions that come up.",
        "I think it's also important for listeners to understand - although the case is about greenhouse gases and climate change, when the case is sitting before the Supreme Court, that they ultimately have to decide is in many ways not an environmental case.",
        "And so, what the justices are facing is a question of whether or not you can even bring a case like this - if states have a right to bring a case like this - and then if so, whether these are pollutants."

        "The court split in fairly predictable ways on several of the questions.",
        "Several justices - maybe three or four - indicated they were very skeptical as to whether or not petitioners could even bring a case like this.",
        "On the issue of pollutants, I think it was a little less divisive.",
        "It looked like more justices were willing - very little time was spent arguing about whether or not CO2 and greenhouse gases would even be a pollutant.",
        "And then finally, in the question of whether or not EPA had to regulate, I think, again, you could see a split in the court.",
        "Several groups filed what are called friend of the court briefs, in this case.",
        "Those are sort of attachments to the case that argue in favor of one side or the other.",
