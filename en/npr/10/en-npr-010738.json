        "In the public - the broadcast TV media, they're a lot more on his side.",

        "I mean, he's clearly interested in what conservative media has to say.",
        "And, you know, he may not have spoken to Ann Coulter in over a year, but it's widely reported that he speaks with Sean Hannity very frequently.",
        "He regards Fox News hosts in particular as critical allies.",
        "And they had been critical of the compromise deal.",

        "A big review of the literature for the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, another review of the literature for the Center for Disease Control, Justice Stephen Breyer of the Supreme Court did sort of an amateur review of the literature and they all came to the same conclusion.",
        "It's very hard to tell the effect of gun control rules, that it's very hard to see measureable declines in violence and in gun violence.",
        "So I'm for them, but I don't think we should get our hopes up that they radically reduce violent crime and we shouldn't get our hopes up that they radically would prevent an event like we saw in Aurora.",
        "And E.J., you wrote this week that it's not enough for advocates of the sensible course on guns to think they're job is over if they write one impassioned column or make one strong statement after a mass killing and then move on to the latest campaign flap.",
