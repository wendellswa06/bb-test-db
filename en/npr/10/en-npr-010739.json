        "Well, I think it's partly not going anywhere politically because progressives, including, to some degree, President Obama, although at least he took a step forward in that New Orleans speech, have run away from it and haven't made the case.",
        "And to David's point, I don't think any of these - a lot of these studies aren't saying that gun control doesn't work.",
        "They are arguing that some of the evidence is mixed.",
        "But I don't know what study could refute this - that another study looked at gun violence in 23 of industrial countries.",
        "And 80 percent of the gun deaths are in one country, the United States of America.",
        "And you can't persuade me that our lax gun laws don't have something to do with that.",
        "Moreover, there are some very simple things that we know through common sense would make a difference if a shooter did not have a magazine with 100 rounds in it.",
        "He'd have to reload.",
        "If assault weapons were illegal, you would at least take an event like this and make it less lethal and we ought to at least try to do that.",
        "I also want to talk about the campaign trail this week.",
        "Mitt Romney visiting Europe, specifically London this week, and then going on to Poland and Israel, about showing himself as a statesman.",
        "And instead, the focus has been on his comments about the London Olympics and these are being described as gaffes.",
        "Romney also mentioned that he met with the head of MI6, which is another comment the British press seized on as a gaffe because you should never talk about meeting with MI6.",
        "What's going on here?",
        "I mean, is this trip doing what it's supposed to?",
        "Not exactly.",
        "You know, don't be a pundit, Mitt Romney.",
        "He told the truth that they were having some problems with security, but you're there to flatter people and so be nice to people.",
        "Go to Israel, flatter people.",
        "Go to Poland, flatter people.",
        "Don't say things that are true and troublesome.",
        "That's not your job right now.",

        "When I look at the Obama campaign, I basically see a campaign that is methodically unfolding a narrative that makes perfect sense.",
        "He cut jobs at Bain.",
        "He's going to cut Medicare if he gets to be president.",
        "That is an unfolding, coherent narrative.",
        "When I look at the Romney campaign, I see a bunch of people holding their powder and promising that somehow in the future they're going to start waging an effective campaign.",
        "I certainly don't see an effective campaign now.",
        "I don't know why he's there in the first place.",
        "Well, you know, one of my Twitter commenter's said, \"\"Calm down, everyone.",
        "Mitt isn't running for president of Europe.\"\" And, I mean, I don't know anybody on the Republican side who's looking for applause over there, right, E.J.?",
        "Well, if Obama had been running for president of Europe, he would have gotten 90 percent of the vote the last time.",
        "But I think when your trip's hashtags on Twitter include RomneyShambles and MittHitsTheFan, we know how this trip has gone.",
        "And I find it astonishing that he made these mistakes, but I actually agree with David.",
        "I think foreign policy is an Obama strongpoint and a Romney weak point."

        "Well I think part of the issue goes to the fact that Detroit feels like they are being asked - at this point, they would be asked to do more than others are being asked to do.",

        "But I think at this point, Detroit feels somewhat singled out.",
        "So we also just had a decision in California - a law that will require very dramatic reductions - and again, I think the car manufacturers feel like a lot of those reductions will have to come from them.",

        "They're not within the confines of the Clean Air Act.",
        "I do think if it goes back to EPA, if the court takes the positions I would like them to take, that will only prod Congress to move more quickly.",
        "I think at the end of the day, the likelihood that EPA - any EPA under any administration - is going to be making the final decisions about how much carbon we reduce over what timeframe is pretty unlikely.",
        "I think this is a big issue.",
        "This is a really big issue, and it's going to require congressional debate and ultimate decision.",
        "That goes back to something Michael said before, which was that the justices are not being asked to decide whether global warming is real or not, correct?",
        "That's correct.",
        "They're not getting into the science of global warning.",
        "No and in fact, there was an amusing exchange in the middle of the argument with Justice Scalia being confused over some terms and one of the lawyers trying to straighten it out - some scientific terms about the atmosphere - and justice Scalia saying: yeah, that's why I don't even want to be thinking about this.",
        "It is a very complicated issue, but that's - the science is not what is in front of the court right now.",
        "We have an unusual alignment of friends of the courts, of backing up on either side of the issue, don't we?",
        "We have.",
        "A lot of people got very interested in this case.",
        "It is the first time the Supreme Court has looked at this issue - the issue of climate change - and lots of people got organized on both sides and came in, including - you mentioned I am partners with Madeline Albright in a firm here in D.C.",
        "One of the justifications that the Bush administration gave for not wanting to regulate carbon was foreign policy, and she actually filed an amicus brief pointing out that that was not really appropriate - considering foreign policy was not really appropriate to this case.",
        "You also have companies that are lobbying one way or another - not the illegal sense - that are hoping that the Supreme Court does rule in favor of the states because then they would be in the business of selling pollution abatement equipment - sides you would never think would be on sides of issues."

        "And it looks to me there's a two-edged sword here.",
        "If the Supreme Court holds that the EPA does not have regulatory authority, that more or less bolsters the position of states like California that are trying to impose state-level limits.",
        "Whereas if the court decides that EPA has been given that authority, that regulatory authority might undermine the state level regulations.",
