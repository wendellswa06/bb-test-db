        "Well, I think if Massachusetts doesn't prevail in the standing argument - and I think I thought made a very compelling case, which is they have 200 miles of coastline that are being impacted by climate change, and therefore they have standing.",
        "They're being impacted, there's a damage that's occurring and there's a solution.",
        "And this is what, you know, standing requires are these two pieces.",
        "I think, as Michael just said, if for some reason the court goes down the path as saying that Massachusetts does not have standing, that has repercussions well beyond climate change.",
        "I mean every single time someone comes into the federal court system in an effort to say - air pollution, mercury, you know, pick your pollutant - is harming the citizens of my state, and that is a question now, not sort of a guarantee - the role of the federal courts in terms of helping states secure environmental protections from the federal government will be dramatically changed.",

        "The public should have access to EPA's information.",
        "And yes, a lot of it is available online, but not all of it.",
        "The libraries were a very important vehicle for making information available.",

        "What's the decision that you're handicapping?",
        "Wow, it's tough.",
        "I was in the courtroom and just watching the arguments, it was very, very hard to know.",
        "I mean, what I really hope is that it doesn't go down on some narrow legal grounds, but rather we get to the interpretation of the Clean Air Act and the justices find that it does allow EPA to make a decision on carbon.",
        "Michael, do you find disconcerting that the justices don't want to talk about science, that they may not be able to understand?",
        "Well, I actually think that the justices did talk about science, but it was all in the context of standing.",
        "Former Administrator Browner indicated that colloquy over whether or not it was the stratosphere or the troposphere.",
        "There were several questions with respect to whether or not the coastline was now being harmed, or if it would be in the future, and how certain that would be.",
        "They'd also asked about whether, given that this is only six percent of the world's greenhouse gases, even if the automobile manufacturers were required to put on..."
