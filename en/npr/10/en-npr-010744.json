        "Another indication that people are getting paid more is that average hourly earnings for all employees also rose.",
        "Let's talk about another factor here, Yuki Noguchi, because sometimes when the unemployment rate goes down, it may not be that more people are going back to work, it may be that people are going out of the labor force, and so the percentage seems to improve but things aren't really improving.",
        "Did that happen this time?",
        "We've got 2138 coming(ph) heading to 2.0."
