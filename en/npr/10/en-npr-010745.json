        "Are they in any position to handle issues like, well: Is there an Iraqi air force?",
        "No, there's not an Iraqi air force, and that's, in fact, one of the key issues that the Americans here want to focus on.",
        "General Austin has said that as far as internal security, the Iraqis are pretty close to being capable of taking care of that, but not external sovereignty.",
        "That is, not the borders and not the skies.",
        "And the last time I was here, Neal, it was last August, and they were talking about this, as well.",
        "It doesn't seem that they've made a great deal of progress since then.",
        "But General Austin told NPR recently that there's a whole series of key training missions that the United States wants to be involved in in order to build a long-term strategic relationship with Iraq, from the use of tanks to integrating weapons systems to integrating with air power to gaining a capacity, an early-warning capacity and an integrated air defense system.",
        "And all of that, U.S.",
        "military officials have said, takes years, not months.",

        "But this kind of integrated, long-term training, in order to build up the Iraqi military in such a way that the Iraqi military itself could defend the sovereignty of the country, that is defend the borders of Iraq and defend the skies over Iraq, it doesn't seem that the contractors are as well-placed to do that kind of integrated training as the Pentagon is.",
        "And that's the argument that General Austin has made and I think other military - high military officials in the United States are trying to make.",
        "What kind of political price would Prime Minister Maliki have to pay if he were to say, well, maybe the United States should stay on?",
        "That's a good question, and I think it's difficult to say at this point, Neal.",
        "But you have to realize that when the issue of the presence of U.S.",
        "troops in Iraq comes up, nearly everybody now says we want them out.",

        "troops out.",
        "Now, it's also a question as to how many U.S.",

        "I don't think - I don't think 50,000 is a number that's necessary.",
        "But perhaps in some thousands, American forces would have to stay in order to continue this kind of training if the Iraqi government wants to be trained by the United States.",
        "There's also another factor to add in, and that's the revolutions underway in the Middle East, elsewhere in the Middle East.",
        "Has that played into the situation there in Iraq at all?",

        "That's another good question.",
        "It certainly is playing into the internal situation now.",
        "In just the past 10 days, there have been three sets of demonstrations, quite small, quite modest and quite peaceful.",
        "But it sort of sent a shockwave through the Iraqi political establishment.",
        "The first demonstrations, which occurred last Friday, a week ago, a week prior, were met with violence by Iraqi internal security forces, and some people were actually killed in the violence.",
        "And these were relatively peaceful demonstrations.",
        "They held more demonstrations last Friday, and wisely, the Iraqi government held back.",
        "And then there were even smaller groups, a few hundred, in the center of Baghdad yesterday, that protested - they're protesting corruption on the part of the Iraqi government and the inability of the government to provide the necessary services, clean up the city, that is necessary.",
        "And it seems that this took Nouri al-Maliki's government by surprise, and now they're trying to figure out how to deal with it.",
        "And everybody realizes that this is inspired by, to some degree, the Arab revolt elsewhere in the Middle East and inspired by - but with an Iraqi twist to it, given the state of affairs in Iraq at this point, eight years after the U.S.",
