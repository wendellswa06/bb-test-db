        "embassy, and I don't think any other embassy comes even close to that.",
        "Many of those 17,000 will be the military/civilian contractors that you were referring to before, and you're going to have this bizarre situation where the State Department, in effect, is going to be running the military operations that previous were run by the Pentagon.",
        "Here's an email from Marion(ph), who writes: It is time for the USA to realize that our military is not wanted there and is considered at this point to be an anti-Islamic force, possibly spies for Israel.",

        "Well, your last emailer actually makes a point that I neglected to make before, and that is in replacing military people with former military people who are now civilian contractors, the price of poker goes up.",
        "Each of those men, on average, is paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $100,000 a year, which as most of your listeners probably know is somewhat in excess of what our men and women in uniform earn.",
        "Yet why keep them there either?",
        "The United States is not wanted, and priorities - there are priorities to spend that money at home.",

        "Well, I mean certainly those who believe that we have no role, never did have a role in Iraq, I guess you'd have to agree with them.",
        "I would make the point, A) whatever your feelings are or were about the initial invasion of Iraq and whether that was justified or whether it is - it was smart ever to get in there in the first place, the fact of the matter is now that we have an enormous amount both in blood and treasure invested in that country, and were we to pull out now, at a time of greater instability in that region than we have seen in many, many years - we don't know what's going to happen next in Egypt, we don't know what's going to happen in Bahrain, we don't know what's going to happen in Yemen or in Libya, and for us just to precipitously pull out, before the Iraqis are capable of taking care of their own security, I think would be very unwise.",

        "When the price of gasoline goes up, as it is going up right now, to $4 a gallon, if we were to leave before there is genuine stability in Iraq, if that area no longer had the oversight of American military, I think you could very easily see the price of oil go up to seven, eight, nine dollars a gallon.",
        "And the fact of the matter is then you would have all kinds of political yelling and screaming on Capitol Hill, all kinds of pressure being raised by the American public, which would not want to see that happen to its economy.",
        "The economic pressure that would flow out of the collapse of Iraq if that were to happen would be huge.",
        "We forget Iraq is, of course, a major oil producer in itself and could be an even more important oil producer in the future.",

        "So you know, you really need to look at not only not only is it going to be in our best interest to keep the area secure, like we have in Germany since World War II, and no one's complaining about that, but it will be in Iraqis' interests.",
        "We can provide them that airpower.",
        "We can provide them that security, and you know, maybe a little bit of money from leasing the space.",
        "Because the Republican Party - their whole history is just trying to restrict votes of African-Americans and minorities because those people vote against them.",

        "This ought to be - this needs to be a Pentagon operation, not a State Department operation.",
        "The first aircraft that are due to be delivered to Iraq are not scheduled to arrive for another two years, and only at that time will the United States be able to begin training not only Iraqi pilots but also Iraqi maintenance people, air traffic control people, all the people that would be necessary to run a successful air force.",

        "The fact is that Iraq has 550 billion barrels proven reserves.",
        "It is not number two or three.",
        "It is number one, because they figure Saudi Arabia - we figure Saudi Arabia has 200 billion barrels.",
