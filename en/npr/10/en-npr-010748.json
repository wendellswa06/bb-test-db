        "They'll have complete control of what goes on in their top-level domain.",
        "And that means, in those domains, there will be no SPAM, no phishing, no malware, none of the other evil things that are happening on the Internet today.",
        "So there's a big security benefit to having your own top level domain, particularly if counterfeiting has been an issue for you.",
        "LaPlante says the new top-level domains will also have a decluttering effect on the Web.",
        "Internet addresses keep getting longer and longer because they are so many dot-coms.",
        "These new suffixes, LaPlante says, will make addresses shorter and simpler for consumers to remember."
