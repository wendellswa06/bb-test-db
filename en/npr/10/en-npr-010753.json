        "The relationships between parents and children figure prominently in \"\"Ginger & Rosa,\"\" but Potter says the film's not really autobiographical.",
        "Rather, she wanted to dramatize the connection between the personal and the political.",

        "The crises closer to home in the film run from best friends Ginger and Rosa trying to figure out what to do with their lives to coping with their parents' separation and divorce.",

        "And despite claims that it's not autobiographical, Potter had Elle Fanning, who plays Ginger, dye her blonde hair red like Potter's.",
        "Fanning was 13 when she made the film, Potter's age at her first ban-the-bomb march.",
        "Fanning says she owes a lot to Potter sharing memories of life at that time and that age.",
        "She went on the marches when she was young, so she had a lot of pictures from that and, for sure, she drew on sort of experiences.",
        "And also, she was a teenage girl, so, you know, at one time, so she knows what that's like, to have a best friend and to have that sort of secret language, you know?",
        "And so she knows what it's like to grow up, sort of trying to find your way when you're young.",
        "But this film proceeds in a different way from Potter's past work.",
        "Orlando,\"\" for instance, featured actors talking straight into the camera.",
        "Potter's cross-cultural love story, \"\"Yes,\"\" had the actors delivering their lines in iambic pentameter, and \"\"Rage\"\" consisted entirely of dramatic monologues, staged to look like interviews on a cellphone camera.",
        "The film was even released on the iPhone.",
        "Potter says \"\"Ginger & Rosa's\"\" more conventional storytelling was a deliberate strategy.",
        "It's always a good principle to reinvent and to be prepared to throw away the things that you cling to as being your identity.",
        "And I don't just mean this in films.",
        "I mean this in life.",
        "You know, we're not a set of habits.",
        "And, I think, sometimes, to return to kind of first principles of pure intention and be prepared to throw away your signature, if you like, can be incredibly liberating.",
        "It's quite terrifying but very liberating too.",
        "And in that way, one finds new things to do, you know, not just falling back on old things."

        "And it was on Sally Potter's mind as she wrote the script for \"\"Ginger & Rosa.",
        "When my mother died in 2010, I remembered - in a way painfully - the struggles of her and the women of her generation and experienced them as these kind of silent partners in the beginning of the time of change in the '60s - women who, in many ways, were sacrificed for that change.",
