        "What do you say to that?",
        "I don't believe this is about protection of minorities because Russian troops march far from the borders of South Ossetia or Abkhazia, and there were no Georgian minorities there, so I think that was used as a pretext to attack Georgia and to teach Georgians a lesson and to teach all other post-Soviet republics a lesson.",

        "And it was unusual in that it went for a week.",
        "It was a pretty long court marshal, as these things go.",
        "And I think, you know, at the time it was hailed by women's advocates as, you know, an example of the Air Force taking sexual assault seriously.",
        "Because here you had a very powerful person with powerful friends in the chain of command who, nonetheless, had been brought up on charges and convicted.",
        "Now, the commander of the third Air Force, Lieutenant General Craig Franklin, has overturned that court's decision.",
        "Explain to us how he was able to do that and the reason he may have given for doing it.",

        "I mean, the fact that the court marshal, you know, it takes place within the chain of command and I'm wondering if this overturning of it has made a big difference.",
        "Well, I think previously the criticisms of how the military handles sexual assaults and the bias that has been alleged to be in the system has sort of focused on the lower level commanders, that they did not move forward with these cases, that they did not send them to court marshal or have them investigated.",
        "And so, last year, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta kicked the authority to do that up the chain of command to the colonel level, the 06 level."
