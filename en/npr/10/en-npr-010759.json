        "You know, you have these senators asking questions.",
        "Is there any sense that the military's going to rethink or review the way it handles these kind of cases?",
        "Well, they haven't really said a lot publicly.",
        "I think that, you know, if you have three senators calling for investigations and wanting answers, that they're probably going to have to deal with it somehow.",
        "I mean, the idea that the decisions about how sexual assaults are handled should not be with the chain of command, that's not new.",
        "But I've been told by, you know, legislators that they think that this will give added impetus to that, and that this case could be, as they call it, a tipping point.",
        "Well, Nancy, thank you so much for explaining the case to us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Nancy Montgomery is a reporter for Stars and Stripes.",

        "He thinks McCain is pushing on a string with his argument about experience which Shrum believes is no longer effective.",
        "Now, I know he's saying this because the Biden quote gave him the opportunity to do it.",
        "But if he's got any decent polling, he knows that after the first debate, Americans decided that Barack Obama was up to the challenge of being commander in chief."

        "(Soundbite of Republican campaign rally)",
        "Senator Obama is more interested in controlling who gets your piece of pie than he is in growing the pie.",
        "There's almost no foreign policy in the speech, partly because the economy is so dominant.",
        "But there's also very little about the war in Iraq, which is ironic, says Michael Gerson, since it's the issue McCain once thought would be the centerpiece of his campaign.",
        "Things getting so much better in Iraq has removed national security as a major debate in this election, which is really John McCain's strength.",
        "So, it's a strange thing that policies he wanted that improved the situation in Iraq pretty dramatically have actually undermined one of the key elements of his appeal.",
        "But another even more fundamental element of his appeal is intact: his biography.",
        "And that, Gerson says, is one of the most effective parts of McCain's speech.",
        "(Soundbite of Republican campaign rally)",
        "I've been fighting for this country since I was 17 years old, and I have the scars to prove it.",
        "(Soundbite of crowd ovation)",
        "The speech ends with a McCain strength.",
        "It talks about fighting and being a fighter.",
        "That's an appropriate message for someone who's behind in the election.",
        "It also fits McCain's biography in a lot of ways.",
        "The speech does not develop his autobiography.",
        "It doesn't talk about the prison.",
        "It doesn't, you know, deal with Vietnam.",
        "But this message of fighting - fighting for a new direction of our country, for the economy - these sort of things draw attention to McCain's biography in a positive way without him having to tell the story."
