        "Elephants eat trees.",
        "They don't eat parts of trees, they don't eat - they can eat a tree much like we would eat a cupcake.",
        "We reached Palmer on a cell phone at his research site in Kenya.",
        "That's where he goes to study a small African tree that has found a way to repel hungry elephants.",
        "Palmer says these trees ooze tasty sap that attracts nasty ants and then makes the ants even nastier.",
        "He says a single of these trees can hold 100,000 of the ants, which is very bad news for any elephant that decides to chow down on a branch.",
        "So imagine 100,000 ants streaming across the tree towards this point of disturbance.",
        "At some point, enough is enough and you're going to have a face covered in these biting, stinging ants.",
        "Palmer says he's watched these ants charge straight into an elephant's trunk, which is famously sensitive.",
        "Now, scientists call this kind of ant-tree alliance a mutualism, which has a kind of peaceful ring to it.",
        "But not in this case, according to Palmer.",
        "It's a co-evolutionary war.",
        "People think of mutualisms as are the friendly sort of situation where species are helping each other out but it - what really is a battlefield."

        "And on this particular battlefield, a tiny insect trumps the biggest land animal on earth.",
        "But that got Palmer wondering.",
        "What would happen to the ant-tree alliance if the common enemy - elephants - was gone?",
        "To find out, he put great big fences up around some of his trees, which are known locally as whistling thorns.",
        "And then he watched them for 10 years.",
        "Palmer expected these trees to flourish with no elephants around but no. Some of them grew half as fast as before and many died and all of them stopped producing that tasty sap.",
        "That drove off all the ants that had once guarded them from the elephants.",
        "These trees, in the absence of herbivores, decided, well, the herbivores are gone so it doesn't make a lot of sense to pay these ant- bodyguards, so let's reduce the salaries.",
        "In essence, they were paying these bodyguards.",
        "Palmer says the sap productions turned out to be a big mistake.",
        "That's because the guard ants were quickly replaced by other insects that attacked the trees, digging lots of ugly holes and tunnels.",
        "It's like the trees riddled with cancer or something, it's basically when you cut open a cross-section of a tree, it's all it is, is just this torn up inside with massive numbers of tunnels and dead branch systems everywhere.",
        "This is an experiment that shows just how powerful and complicated natural alliances can be, says Mark Bertness, a biologist with Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.",
        "But more importantly, he says, it shows that you never know what you are going to get when you mess with Mother Nature.",
        "This is a great example of how, without these mutualisms, the community collapses.",
        "Bertness says it's possible that similar collapses could take place in other parts of Africa, where elephant populations are now in trouble.",

        "Now a few Republicans, Bob Corker in the Senate, Michael Pence in the House, are reviving an old proposal and say they want to strike the unemployment part of the mandate and make clear that fighting inflation is Fed job number one.",

        "Why try to do this now?",
        "Well, it does seem kind of strange timing, with unemployment at 9.6 percent and not expected to fall anytime soon.",
        "The Republicans who are doing this are unhappy with the Fed's recent decision to buy $600 billion worth of Treasury bonds.",
        "The Fed justified that by saying unemployment was too low -unemployment was too high and inflation was too low.",
        "The Republicans say they are worried that the Fed is making a mistake here, is going to overdo it and create more inflation than it wants, so it wants to make clear that it expects the Fed to keep inflation low and let something else worry about unemployment."

        "Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan before him have always argued that the best way to get to maximum employment in the long run is to aim for price stability.",
        "But there are some academics and other analysts who say that at a time like this, when the Fed is experimenting so much and the markets are worried about the Fed overdoing it, that the markets would be calmer and maybe the bond market would be happier and long-term interest rates lower if people knew that the Fed had a clear mandate in the long run not to let inflation get out of control.",

        "Well, in a speech in Boston a couple of weeks ago, he defended the dual mandate.",
        "He said if the Fed aimed exclusively at keeping unemployment low, we'd get too much inflation, but if they aim exclusively at inflation, we'd have more and deeper recession.",
        "So he's in favor of keeping the mandate as it is.",
