        "Moreover, it can happen very fast; in just four years, or four generations.",

        "Berkeley says one way to save the good genes is to set up more marine reserves where fish are protected from nets, and he says that if there are some good news from David Conover's experiment, it is that it's still not clear if fishing can cause permanent evolutionary change.",
