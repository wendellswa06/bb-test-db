        "Well, I don't sit here as Dr. DuBois did because he went packing shortly after that, and he left the country and died abroad, having renounced his citizenship and so forth.",

        "Speaking of fighters, what if anything do we know about the actual fighting taking place between the Islamists and the forces of the transitional government?",
        "Well, it has been very difficult to confirm what's happening on the ground, but apart from its airpower, Ethiopia's also believed to have as many as 8,000 troops on the ground in Somalia fighting side by side with troops who are loyal to the transitional government.",
        "But it's important to remember that the seat of the transitional government at Baidoa is still surrounded by Islamist fighters, and the courts have called on Muslims worldwide to join the fight.",
        "They even vowed to hit Ethiopia's capital city, Addis Ababa.",
        "Now, these kinds of pronouncements as well as the reported presence of troops from Aratrea have only increased fears that this crisis could upset the entire region."
