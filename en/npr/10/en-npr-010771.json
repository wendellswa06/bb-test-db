        "The public realizes that motivations in science aren't necessarily pure.",
        "Americans are more likely to trust practitioners we come face-to-face with like doctors and dieticians and less likely to trust researchers such as nutrition scientists - you know, those people who seem to generate conflicting advice from one week to the next.",
        "One thing I think is striking is that when we ask people what factors move their trust, when they hear about scientific research where the data is openly available, they say that increases their trust.",
        "And a majority on the flip side say when they hear about industry funded research, that tends to decrease their trust.",
        "These issues are by no means unique to science.",
        "In fact, John Besley, who studies public opinion about science at Michigan State University, says there's a trend in the United States toward lower public trust in general.",
        "Science has actually stayed pretty stable as overall trust in other people has gone down.",
        "So it would be interesting to know a little bit more about how much these responses are really about scientists, versus how much are sort of a general distrust of everybody, sort of a general cynicism.",

        "When she was a young actress with no money, she posed nude under an assumed name for $50.",
        "After she became a star, Hefner bought the rights to those photos for $500 from a calendar company.",
        "That magazine became a bestseller, and it launched his media empire.",
        "Monroe never got another dime from the pictures.",
        "She's quoted as telling a close friend, \"\"I even had to buy a copy of the magazine to see myself in it.\"\" Hefner was a complicated figure.",
        "Some laud his support of civil rights or praised the way he changed America's view of sexuality.",
        "But as Suzanne Moore wrote in The Guardian, the fantasy that Hefner sold was not a fantasy of freedom for women but for men.",
        "At the end in his castle, he surrounded himself with young women who couldn't have friends come visit, who were given allowances only if they followed his rules.",
        "They were ornamental, and they served to burnish his image.",
        "Some women did choose to be a part of Hugh Hefner's mythmaking.",
        "Marilyn Monroe didn't get to make that choice in life or now in death.",
