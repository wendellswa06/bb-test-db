        "Yeah, he had a 10-point lead, and it's been pretty consistent, Ken.",
        "It goes - it shrinks a bit here and there.",
        "I still think it's probably closer to that 10-point lead, but if Republicans are more excited to come out for Mitt Romney, that can only help Josh Mandel, Sherrod Brown's challenger.",
        "And in the congressional seats, any races you're looking at with interest?",
        "No, the redistricting process really secured the seats either for the Democrats or for Republicans, in more cases the Republicans' cases.",
        "There's a few up in the northern part of the state that are more competitive, Betty Sutton and Jim Renacci, they're fighting off - fighting each other in northern Ohio.",
        "But here in central Ohio, the two Republicans are safe, and the new congressional district that was carved out is safe for the Democrat, most likely.",
        "And maybe 10 days ago Republicans were seriously worried.",
        "Do you get that same sense from Democrats now?",
        "I think, you know, talking to the Democrats, now this is not a scientific sample, surely, when we went to the OSU rally yesterday, they were still optimistic, but they were disappointed in the president's debate performance.",
        "I think they will be, as all the rest of us, watching the second debate and look for something better.",
        "If he has another poor performance in that debate, then I see Democrats getting really nervous.",
        "Ken?",

        "Barring a disaster by either candidate, I mean a complete disaster, I don't think it'll have much of an impact on the Ohio vote either way.",

        "And Ken, we'll be talking more about that vice presidential debate, but we want to hear from callers as well.",
        "What specific issue - this is their only one, so it's going to cover the entire gamut.",
        "So what specific issue would you like to hear them address?",
        "And the vice presidential debate, is it going to make a difference?",
        "Well, we always - we've talked about this for years, go back to 19 - whatever year, 1988, when Lloyd Bentsen allegedly wiped the floor with you're no - you're no Jack Kennedy, that line to Dan Quayle, everybody loved Bentsen's line, everybody laughed at Dan Quayle, and the Bush-Quayle ticket won 40 out of 50 states.",
        "But again, so it didn't really have that much of an effect, but it still can matter, it still can affect your candidacy, because a lot of people are talking about Joe Biden and Paul Ryan as perhaps 2016 presidential candidates.",
        "So there's a lot riding on that for them as well.",
        "And as they go into this, there seems to be a mismatch of experience.",
        "Joe Biden, of course, has been around the United States Senate seemingly forever, on the Foreign Relations Committee, and so has a lot of experience.",
        "Paul Ryan makes light of his own lack of experience in international affairs, for example.",
        "Right, and you remember the old famous Reagan line to Walter Mondale, I'm not going to make light of my - I'm not going to make my opponent's youth and experience.",
        "But this is nearly 28 years' difference in age between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, which is the greatest gap in vice presidential debate history.",
        "And you know, four years ago we all waited for Joe Biden to make the gaffe against Sarah Palin, but he was very calm.",
        "He was reserved.",
        "And he's very smart.",
        "People forget that while the media love to talk about him as a gaffe machine, and sometimes he can be a gaffe machine, he's also a very good debater.",
        "So Paul Ryan has a lot, you know, he's going to be up against a pretty tough opponent tomorrow night."

        "Exactly.",

        "I don't think Martha Raddatz of ABC News is going to put it quite that way, but the environment as an issue didn't come up in the first debate with the presidential candidates, Ken.",
        "No.",
        "And Margaret's question seems to be what I hear from a lot of Democrats.",

        "Yes.",
        "...in Romney's record responding to the 47 percent responding to, you know, alleged changes of positions on so many issues?",
        "Why didn't they do that during the debate?",
        "I expect the focus tomorrow really be on the Medicare issue, and I think both Ryan and Biden will welcome that.",
        "But, again, that's one of the issues that a lot of Democrats are rolling their eyes saying, why didn't it come up before?",
