        "Let me get Clarence in here.",
        "Clarence, you know, Jackson's comments were caught during this break on a show called \"\"Fox and Friends\"\" and then they were played Wednesday on the \"\"O'Reilly Factor\"\".",
        "Later in an interview with you, Bill O'Reilly revealed that Fox had more of Jackson's comments on tape and the network said the rest of the comments were even worse.",
        "So, do you have any idea what else Reverend Jackson said and if Fox is going to eventually play it and if so, when?",
        "No, I don't.",
        "In fact, I wasn't even given a transcript of the exact remarks before I went on the air contrary to what O'Reilly said.",
        "They were playing their cards so close to the vest.",
        "Frankly, I think if they had anything hotter than what they aired, they would be airing it now.",
        "O'Reilly's an old-time journalist before he became a Fox superstar.",
        "And you know, you go with the best stuff you've got.",
        "So, I personally don't think they've got anything else that matches his cutting remarks, as one of our Tribune headlines put it.",
        "Clarence first and then Troy.",
        "What is the say about the dialog about black discourse in America?",
        "What I mean by that is, we are all journalists and folks who are in the media.",
        "And there are always many media worlds.",
        "There is this sort of inside baseball political world of people who talk about people who talk about politics.",
        "There is general news, there is black-oriented news.",
        "And at this point, what I've noticed is that a lot of African-American discourse is leaking over understandably into general media.",
        "Do people really, kind of, really understand in a general audience, Clarence, do you think people who are not black and who are not kind of generally plugged into black issues, do they understand kind of the power struggle that is going on around here?",
        "No, I don't think they do and I think they're learning.",
        "I don't think black folks have really come to grips with it because we didn't have to.",
        "As my good friend, Jack White wrote in theroot.com, we now have the prospect of actually being able to fix this mess rather than just complain about it after years, meaning to actually make change in America.",
        "You know, you have an African-American in the White House who came from the streets and knows of these problems.",
        "That is a whole different debate than what we've had in the past.",
        "So, I think that you know, we in the black community have been very tolerant and very supportive of our leaders old and new.",
        "It's the media eye that is focused on one leader at a time and I think that really rankles Reverend Jackson.",
        "And he's not used to being out of the spotlight.",
        "Troy, do you think that this is a case of ego or is this a case where Reverend Jackson has made some legitimate points perhaps not in the most diplomatic way?",
        "I think there is a bit of an ego bruising.",
        "I think it is interesting.",
        "Jesse Jackson claims to have, you know, thrown his support behind the Obama campaign but I think he did it with a discerning eye.",
        "I think he did it at some distance for some time now.",
        "And I think that, you know, they've obviously crossed paths long before Senator Obama was pushed to the forefront of politics in this election cycle.",
        "But I think, you know, the point about, you know, responsibility with black fathers and in the community is - I think Obama's comments were similar to what Bill Cosby had to say.",
        "And I don't really think that Jesse's point in that regard, I don't think that Obama was talking down to black people.",
        "I think he was pointing out something that's been pointed out by many other people.",
        "It's not what we want to hear all the time but it's the truth.",
        "Before we leave this topic and move on, I'm just curious.",
        "At this point, just briefly, give me a sense of how this election rates and ranks, Clarence, in terms of the most fun you've had covering an election and the most unexpected twists and turns.",
        "Well, I got into this business as a teenager in the early '60s because I wanted to be an eyewitness to history and this is the kind of thing I've been living for, you know.",
        "Back in the early '60s, we saw the change that TV was beginning to make.",
        "Now, today, we see a real national conversation happening on race.",
        "And that means all of this stuff, these gaffes, these various (unintelligible) episodes, etcetera are being played out in this national conversation of the media including this radio network and all the other media that we have.",
        "And I think I see a social change going on similar to that which happened in the '60s.",
        "I hope to be able to witness as much of it as I can.",
        "Troy?",
        "I am so excited, I can't stand it.",
        "I think it's quite interesting.",
        "I remember being a young kid watching the Ronald Reagan campaign.",
        "I think it one of the - it was probably the Republican National Convention.",
        "And I was excited, not that I'm a Republican, but I happen to be excited about the process, and I have been ever since.",
        "This is probably the longest election - presidential election cycle that we've had.",
        "I think people are more engaged than they ever have been and we've got a lot of work to do when you think about only, you know, roughly half of the American population votes.",
        "There are a lot of people that are plugged in but there's still a lot of people that aren't.",
        "And I'm hoping that we get to the point where we do have a general sense that everybody is engaged in the process.",
        "And I think we'll have a better government and we'll elect the right people."

        "And that got kind of awkward but this is how protective families can be of their kids even - well, fully grown kid like Chelsea Clinton.",
        "I think this is an area of privacy that candidates are best left to keep, and I think the public goes along with it.",
        "Troy, do you think it's a good move that Senator Obama had the kids show their adorableness and says no more, or should he use them relentlessly from a campaign prospective?",
