        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I mean, one point that is often forgotten in this discussion - because in some reporting, it's been suggested that then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the guy who is now the pope was somehow the Vatican's point person on sex abuse for the entire arch of his 25-year career in Rome.",
        "And that's not really correct.",
        "In fact, he didn't get any direct responsibility for this until 2001, when Pope John Paul II put him and his office in charge of it.",
        "And by all accounts, it triggered what I have described - I mean, it's my language, not his - but what I've described as something of a conversion experience, because prior to 2001, in the very few public statements Cardinal Ratzinger had made about this crisis, he came off to be frank, as just another Roman cardinal in denial.",
        "But after 2001, when he actually had to sit down and read all the case files for every Catholic priest, everyone in the world who had credibly been accused of sexual abuse, he began to talk much more openly about what he described as filth in the Catholic Church and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers.",
        "And that has followed into his - flowed, rather, into his papacy, where we see him as the first pope to embrace a zero-tolerance policy on sex abuse, the first pope to meet with victims, the first pope to, in effect, break the Vatican's wall of silence on this issue.",
        "So, look.",
        "I mean, whether he has done enough, I think, is a matter of fair debate, but I think what is inarguably is that he has at least done something, and by something I mean considerably more than any of his predecessors ever have on this issue.",
        "And you also note - and I think any student of history would have to agree, the church's progress on almost any issue can be glacial to those of us on the outside.",
        "So there are certain logistical hurdles that you have to get over.",
        "But as far as the working side by side, once people, I think, knew who I am and they find out who other minorities and women are, it's really about doing a job and focusing on the mission.",
        "Now, are there things - tensions that we have to release by having diversity there?",
        "Yes.",

        "Well, yes, it is going to have an effect.",
