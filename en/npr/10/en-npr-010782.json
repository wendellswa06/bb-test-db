        "I think you can always find individual problems of abuse if you're looking around.",
        "But let me take a step back and say that I think from the beginning, what we now talk about is the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church has really been two interlocking, but distinct problems.",
        "There's the problem of priests who abused, and there's the problem of bishops who covered it up - that is, who should have known better and failed to act.",
        "Now, I think on that first problem - that is the need to adopt tough policies to try to prevent future acts of abuse - I think most people would give the Catholic Church, in general, and in this pope, in particular, fairly high marks.",
        "I mean, today, zero tolerance is more or less the official policy of the Catholic Church.",
        "Today, it is abundantly clear whether we're talking about Europe or North America or Africa or Latin America or wherever, it is abundantly clear that if a priest sexually abuses someone - and in particular, if he sexually abuses a minor child - that that priest is going to be immediately yanked out of the priesthood and he's also going to be turned over to the cops.",
        "So, in that sense, the church, I think, today is paying the price for failures in the past, as opposed to failures in the present.",
        "But the other piece of the puzzle is, of course, what about senior management that allowed this to happen?",
        "That is, what about bishops who just drop the ball?",
        "Who - and in some cases, who overtly try to cover this up rather than deal with the problem?",
        "There, I think, a lot of people would say that that is the big piece of unfinished business from this crisis.",
        "And it's not clear what new accountability measures the church might be able to adopt to give some teeth to the idea of accountability for bishops.",
        "And that, frankly, is what makes these revelations about the pope's track record both as archbishop in Munich from '77 to '82, and also as a Vatican official.",
        "It's what makes those revelations so explosive, because ultimately, what's at stake here is his moral authority to deal with this unfinished bit of business.",
        "Because what people will ask is: Is it credible to believe that Benedict can crack heads with other bishops if, at least prior to 2001, his own record really isn't any better?",
        "And that's the hard question the pope is going to have to answer.",
        "And any prospect that it's going to get any better next year?",
        "You're listening to NEWS & NOTES from NPR News.",
        "Well, just continuing along the lines of the question, just the case of Father Marcial, the cases we've heard about - North America and Europe, for the most part - are people concerned that there may be other shoes ready to drop in South America, in Asia, in Africa?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Look.",
        "I mean, this crisis today has broken in - it broke first, really, in Canada in the late '90s, then Australia, the States, Ireland, to some extent the U.K., now Germany and some other places in Europe.",
        "And now that's a lengthening list of countries, obviously.",
        "But, I mean, let's bear in mind that two-thirds of the 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world today live in the Southern Hemisphere - that is Latin American, African, Asia.",
        "By mid-century, that'll bee three-quarters."
