        "Basically speaking, I think if we adopt the premise that this problem probably is a global Catholic problem - that is, it's no more likely to flare up in North America or Europe than it is in Latin America or sub-Saharan African - then the truth is, there's probably at least two-thirds of the Catholic world where this crisis has not yet erupted, but where it very well could.",
        "And so if I were in senior leadership in the Catholic Church today, if somebody were trying to tell me that we're rounding a corner, that this story is almost over, I would be deeply skeptical of that.",
        "To your knowledge, are there efforts underway to, well, be a little more proactive this time around and unearth these problems before they come to light on their own?",
        "Neal, I think there are some bishops and some other church leaders who sort of on their own have taken it upon themselves to try to, in effect, to diffuse the bomb before it goes off - that is, who are well aware that this crisis could erupt in their zone of competence and who have tried to look into among their own, to establish what the record is, and to be transparent about it.",
        "And I certainly think anyone who has watched this crisis play out in other places ought to draw that conclusion, that it's far better for the church to get this out all at once and on its own terms rather than to suffer death by a thousand cuts.",
        "But, on the other hand, I can also say that there is no formal policy, either from the Vatican or anyplace else, that instructs bishops to do that.",
        "So I would say that at the moment, it's sort of catch-as-catch-can.",
        "Some people are trying to get ahead of the curve, and others are simply holding their breath, hoping this won't happen to them.",
        "John Allen of the National Catholic Reporter, also the author of \"\"The Rise of Benedict XVI.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "A comment, more so.",
        "As a 30-year-old male from the Midwest - in Tulsa, specifically - of mixed ethnic background, many of us - we applaud the pope for what he has done, but it's all relative, more or less.",
        "When an institution, for centuries, has moved at a snail's pace and you're going to tell me that slightly faster than that is all we can do right now, we take what we can, but at the same time you throw your hands up in arms.",
        "Because as your guest just said, this has not erupted throughout two-thirds of the known Catholic world.",
        "And we look at Ireland, how that has flared up recently in the past year.",
        "We just dont know when it's going to end, or if it's even started, to tell you the truth.",
        "There was - the pope did accept the resignation of one of the Irish bishops this past week.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "There are, basically speaking, now five Irish bishops who have offered their resignations in the wake of this crisis, two of which have been accepted, and the other three are sort of still waiting on the pope's desk for him to act.",
        "I mean, part of the problem here, Neal, is that on the one hand, it may well be the case that accountability is going to require more bishops to resign.",
        "On the other hand, there is a cultural and historical problem here, which is the Vatican never likes to see bishops step down under fire, because in their mind, thinking historically, this is an invitation for people to mount pressure campaigns to try to bring down bishops for various reasons.",
        "That makes them very uncomfortable, and this is what communist regimes try to do, and so on.",
        "And the Vatican, thinking globally and thinking historically, can't help flashing on those kinds of memories.",
        "In addition, the Vatican has a whole another understanding of what accountability means in a case like this, because their theological model for understanding a bishop is not that he is the CEO of a corporation, but he's the father of a family.",
        "And as we would say with regular human families, you know, when things get tough, you don't tell the father to walk away.",
        "You tell him to, you know, try to solve the problem.",
        "That's their understanding of what accountability means.",
        "And so there's a lot that has to be weighted through there.",
        "But at the end of the day, I would say that in the court of popular opinion, this business of how do you hold bishops accountable for their failures, that would be the single most important bit of unfinished business from this crisis.",
        "Mark, thanks very much for the call.",

        "And the bishop, you know, ignored the problem, transferred him, and did all the things that they do.",
        "But I believe that the bishops do need to be held accountable, because when I brought my case forward, when I made my accusations, the bishop and the lawyers denied everything.",
        "They said that I was making things up, I had false memories, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "And that went on for several, several months, until finally, the priest who molested me was put in front of a lie detector.",

        "He spent hours talking to the lie detector technician, confessing it all.",
        "And as it turned out, he had wanted to confess all along, but the lawyer and the bishop were sitting on him and insisting that what I was saying was all lies.",
