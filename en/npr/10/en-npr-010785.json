        "Hello.",
        "Hi, go ahead, please.",
        "I did work in the schools for several years, and it is surprise - it's not very surprising that we are in this situation.",
        "I'm sad to see that many students will be going through this shortage of money and like not having sports and other art programs.",
        "But when there was money, I saw a lot of wastage.",
        "We wasted a lot of money.",
        "So no wonder we are in this situation.",
        "And for example, what was money wasted on, in your opinion?",
        "A lot of supplies just thrown away, a lot of waste, lot of waste.",
        "I mean...",
        "That money, we would not be in this situation today if that money had been squirreled away for a rainy day?",
        "Right.",
        "Like many of us, you know, when we have money, we don't think that we should save it and put it away and not just keep spending, because I'm sure when there are budgets, people think, oh, if I don't spend it, I will not get it next year.",
        "So I better spend it now.",
        "And then we just overbudget ourselves, and we just hire more people, and then when there's no money, we just keep firing people.",
        "So it's just, you know, a sad situation.",
        "Sean Cavanagh, Sundia's got a point.",
        "Budgets, well, there's territoriality in budget spending as well.",
        "Yeah, and the sentiment, you know, she's voicing, you'll hear that from parents, from elected officials as well, that school spending for decades has risen pretty much steadily, and a lot of that money was poured into trying to keep class sizes low, but now schools, like everyone else, are trying to - having to make hard choices about where to spend funds.",
        "We're talking about what's changed at your school.",
        "Give us a call - principals, teachers, students, parents, 800-989-8255.",

        "Interesting, we talked earlier with Steve Ellis, the principal at a high school in Wilson, North Carolina.",
        "He said he'd considered charging students who wanted to play athletics.",
        "You wrote a story about one school that had to make that decision, $250 if you wanted to play football, for example.",
        "That's right, and that is not uncommon.",
        "It was $250 per student, per athlete.",
        "So if you're a multi-sport athlete, more importantly if you're a parent who's trying to pay for the multi-sport athlete, you may have to make some very hard decisions.",
        "And we hear of that all the time.",
        "Oftentimes, the costs aren't $250 per student, but even $50, $100 per student, that can be a heavy burden for a lot of families.",
        "And the boosters at school organize and try to ameliorate some of this, but some kids aren't going to be able to play.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "That's the worry among the coaches, among the administrators, among parents.",
        "Booster are rallying to try to do things like arrange transportation.",
        "They're holding fundraisers.",
        "They always hold fundraisers, but now they're doubling their efforts.",
        "So there's a limit to what they can do.",
        "And pretty much everyone in that community is saying we're reaching our limit.",
        "So now we're at the point where many of the burdens that school districts are facing are going to be passed on to households.",

        "And some of the changes that I've seen this year are because we lost our summer school program a couple years ago.",
        "So in my freshman and sophomore English classes, I'm seeing class sizes of 37 and 38, which, you know, I'm a - this is my 10th year teaching.",
        "So I can deal with that pretty well, but I imagine new teachers would have a problem with class size management.",
        "So not only am I seeing an increase in class size because we've lost teachers in my department but also because there's no other choice for remediation for these students who have failed their freshman and sophomore classes.",
        "I'm seeing juniors and seniors in my classes this year.",
        "So the knock-on effect of dropping summer school is you get a lot of kids who are repeating class.",
        "Exactly, and they have to do it during the regular school year.",
        "So it's sort of a - we're getting hit doubly by the lack of summer school and by the loss of teachers affecting class size.",
        "And Meredith, how does this affect morale?",
        "It's not good for morale, I can tell you that, especially since total, I have 176 students.",
        "And if you can imagine being an English teacher and assigning one essay, even if that essay is only two pages long, that's an enormous amount of extra work for me, and it's just - it's not good for working conditions.",

        "Sure, our secretary of education, Arne Duncan, among them.",
        "You know, Mr. Duncan has said that - he hasn't talked about class sizes going to 37 students per class, but he said that class sizes could rise modestly if you've got a very qualified teacher leading those classes, someone who can manage a class effectively, who knows content.",
        "And there are a lot of people who agree with him on that point.",
        "I - you know, it's funny.",
        "Most of the class size increases that I've been hearing of are more modest than what the caller was presenting, but we do hear cases of class sizes just spiking because of loss of personnel, and it's a challenge for teachers, and it's a cumulative effect, as she mentions.",
        "You also wrote another piece saying yes, senior teachers, but so many teachers are being reshuffled.",
        "If you taught second grade last year, you may be teaching third grade because that's where the hole is, and you could be shuffled around because nobody wants to fire anybody.",
        "That's right.",
        "The - one school superintendent in Pennsylvania referred to this process as checkerboarding, where you've got an opening that you can't fill.",
        "So you end up moving someone from your staff, say a counselor, to fill a teaching position.",

        "The third grade teacher is asked to become the sixth grade teacher.",
        "The sixth grade teacher may be asked to become a principal.",

        "Affluent districts have a distinct advantage over the poor districts.",
        "I recall up in Orinda, California, up in the northern part of the state, parents set up a private foundation to provide instruction that the state could not provide.",

        "Now, that's hard to defend at any time, particularly now.",
        "So when I say a silver lining, I think that the public has to understand that they have to support schools, but at the same time, they have to understand that teachers are not miracle workers, that schools at best only have students in the classroom, I believe it's 1,150 waking hours, as opposed to 4,700 waking hours in their home or in the neighborhood.",
        "As a result, it's very difficult to ask teachers and schools to produce the kind of results they want under the best of conditions, certainly not now.",
