        "In fact, I think the best way of looking at it is it's not how much money we provide schools.",
        "It's how well the money is spent.",
        "And, Sean Cavanagh, obviously, as schools' belts are tightening everywhere, this is increasingly important issue.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I imagine, if there is a silver lining to some of this, we're going to be seeing more scrutiny over budgets, more taxpayer accountability at the state and local level.",
        "And back to one point that Walt was making earlier about equity; one of the concerns during these tough budget times is when you're cutting state aid to school districts around a state, it's traditionally, in many states, the more tax-poor districts, without a lot of property tax value that are most dependent on state aid.",
        "And so, they're often the ones to suffer the most.",
        "So there are a lot of serious equity concerns, you know, during a recession, post-recession period like this one for school districts.",

        "And the basic instruction, the method of instruction has not changed, but new books have been bought by the school district or the school itself.",
