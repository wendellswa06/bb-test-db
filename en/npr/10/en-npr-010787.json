        "And believe it or not, when Bashir, the dictator, spoke, you know, these tens of thousands of people that were there actually cheered him.",
        "Many of these people must have lost family members at - you know, indirectly speaking at his hands, at the wars that he had prosecuted, and yet here they were cheering him.",
        "And I really couldn't understand it.",
        "I talked to a chief of the Anwak tribe that I met later that day, and he explained that there was a term in his language called gertong(ph), which meant that if you could - even after a brutal war, if you could reach an agreement with your enemy, and if the payoff was freedom, you could forgive him from then on.",
        "And that was definitely the spirit of the moment, but...",
        "But with some foreshadowing.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, in the weeks running up to the independence, Bashir, who is a past master at divide and rule, had actually moved troops into a disputed area on the new border, one that was to be - in the oil-rich area, precisely, along the new border, and had, you know, displaced 30,000 or 40,000 people, perhaps more.",
        "He had armed in the previous six months or so four to six militias, from breakaway groups of the Southern People's Liberation Army, Sudan People's Liberation Army, which was the new government in the South, and weakening, you know, government control or would-be government control, again, in the north and along the new border, and had also invaded two neighboring provinces where units of the Southern revolutionary force had remained behind, outside of the secession agreement.",
        "So he moved his troops in in order to shore up his control of the new border.",
        "But there he was on that day, with Hillary Clinton, you know, in the presence of Hillary Clinton and Ban Ki-moon and the great and good of the world and of Africa to say that, you know, he looked upon the South as brothers, and he looked forward to a wonderful future, you know, as a comrade with the past left behind.",
        "Well, even the new president of South Sudan, you write that he kind of said something in his speech about continuing to support rebels."

        "Yes, well, that's right.",
        "There was this nod to the comrades left behind in the north.",
        "It was all very, you know, ambiguous.",
        "But there was this sense that because they weren't part of the south or what has ever been considered part of the south, sort of armed branches of this rebel movement - which at one time and for many years fought for the unification of all of Sudan but ultimately brokered a deal for secession in the south - left behind, you know, extensive combat units in these neighboring provinces.",
        "And so Salva Kiir was both expressing on the one hand the hope that they could work through their differences and that this new country would have a chance to consolidate itself, and he - but he also pointedly said, quite diplomatically, that, you know, that the comrades in these neighboring provinces, specifically the Nuba Mountains and in the Blue Nile, were not forgotten in the South.",
        "It was difficult to know at the time what that meant, but soon time would tell.",
        "And so for people who, you know, may have not really paid much attention this past year, you may have thought, oh, great, OK, the country is split in two, that's - newly independent, they've got it sorted out.",
        "In fact, you go and meet with all kinds of people who still have not given up this idea of overthrowing Khartoum.",
        "Tell us where you traveled.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "So I traveled to the Nuba Mountains, and I returned months later, quite recently, and traveled to the Nuba Mountains, just over the new border in the north.",
        "And now this is one of the areas where his troops had invaded just before the independence ceremony, which he attended.",
        "And in the intervening months of last year, what you saw was a situation in which the north, Khartoum, had essentially been very bellicose and moved its troops into the areas where it wanted to buttress its control.",
        "After all, you know, it could be seen by its enemies as having been weakened, as having lost, and indeed it had.",
        "It lost a third of its territory.",
        "And it also lost two-thirds of the territory where Sudan's oil was produced.",
        "Now, the two countries were sort of bound together inevitably because although two-thirds of the oil production in Sudan remains in the south, the oil is shipped out to the Red Sea via pipeline and to refineries that are in the north.",
        "And the independence agreement didn't quite work out how that was going to function, right?",
        "That's right.",
        "All of these things, it's a bit like trying to solve, you know, the problem of Palestine and Israel without ever discussing Jerusalem.",
        "It was - in effect, it was - you know, the big problem question was left unresolved, and with diplomats from both countries, you know, ad nauseum meeting in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia as they have for many years and only to return to their respective capitals and tear everything up with facts on the ground, which is what happened.",
        "So you began - you have a situation where the - there was already war effectively occurring in South Kordofan in the Nuba Mountains.",
        "The comrades of Salva Kiir, the president of South Sudan, continued to fight in the North.",
        "And, you know, it's the same organization."

        "And until the 1960s, they were virtually cut off from the outside world.",
