        "The very old idea of Mobutu Sese Seko (unintelligible) - the state is me and I'm the state - it's a very familiar idea.",
        "And that's aroused by destroying all credible positions and dividing the ruling party.",
        "And Mugabe is playing that card quite effectively.",
        "Kagwanja and many other analysts predict there won't be a solution to Zimbabwe's problems until Robert Mugabe leaves office.",
        "The good news for Africa is that Mugabe is one of the last of the African big men, such as Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire, Daniel Arap Moi in Kenya, Omar Bongo of Gabon, and Charles Taylor in Liberia.",
        "The bad news is that as the big men depart, there's a new generation of leaders who are tempted to cling to power by almost any means necessary: Idriss Déby in Chad, and Yoweri Museveni in Uganda - both abolished term limits to keep themselves in power.",
        "Olusegun Obasanjo in Nigeria toyed with amending the constitution to get himself a third term.",
        "And Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia sent soldiers into the streets and halted ballot counting when it looked like he was about to be ousted last year.",
        "So the challenges of good governance in Africa remain huge."
