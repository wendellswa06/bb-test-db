        "What do you say to those who say it's the players fault that you should stand up and demand you certainly have a choice, perhaps more so than ever before because of the riches that are afforded?",
        "They got to understand this too, you know, there's athletic slavery going on in the black community today.",
        "It's a fundamentally imposed characteristic that says, without sports as a right of passage you will amount to nothing.",

        "What of those who suggest that athletes are just too afraid to lose money rather than just stand up?",
        "We saw Warren Sapp, a superstar, able to say that he likened it to a plantation.",

        "Miyazaki says he finally decided to make the film because he was worried about Japan going back to the nationalism that took it to war more than 70 years ago.",

        "There is a political movement afoot in Japan to repeal Article 9, which forswears Japan from ever going to war again.",
        "Many people are arguing that if only they could export weapons and go back to war, they could regain kind of a threatened international superiority.",
        "So, Miyazaki did something else he's never done before; he wrote a controversial op-ed against the proposed reforms.",
        "That turned some Japanese against their beloved filmmaker.",

        "Right at the moment, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas is threatening to delay them.",
        "What is going on here and why is this election so important?",
        "Well, the election is critically important because it represents a potentially significant step for the Palestinians to get their political house in order and that could in the best of circumstances open the way for a renewed engagement with Israelis to talk about a peaceful resolution to the conflict rather than continued fighting and occupation and expansion of Israeli settlements and colonies.",
        "There's a lot of potential and real problems in the way of these elections, but the Palestinians are pushing very hard to hold them because they're so important for them both in their own democratic development and in future progress of the peace run.",
        "Well, let's turn then to Egypt where the big recent development was the strong showing of the Muslim Brotherhood in parliamentary elections.",
        "And that political movement is officially banned.",
        "Still, it won 20 percent of the seats in the parliament.",

        "So I think this is a really important wake-up call for many people and a harbinger of what is to come.",
        "That is, if you have free and fair elections, you're going to get Islamist parties like the Muslim Brotherhood and others doing well because they reflect popular sentiment.",
        "Whatever it is, they emerge as a very powerful expression of people's anger but also their aspirations, so that the real challenge is to engage the Islamist mainstream parties in the democratic process and to strengthen democracy rather than to curtail it.",
        "Now Egypt is a really important test case now for this process.",
        "Well, just, though, to speak about the Brotherhood and its agenda, is it about political reform or is it about political reform leading to a greater role for Muslim law in Egypt?",
        "Well, you know, Muslim law like Christian law and Jewish law and other laws is good law.",
        "I mean, there's nothing wrong with Muslim law.",
        "The point you want is the rule of law.",
        "You want law to be defined by its own people, fairly administered and to have a system of justice that is accessible to all people.",
        "The reality is one in which the Muslim mainstream groups like the Muslim Brotherhood are saying they want to engage in democratic processes and they have to be--in a way, you have to call their bluff.",
        "You have to test them.",
