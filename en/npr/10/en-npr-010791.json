        "What is the situation there now that Syria has withdrawn its troops and at least left technically?",
        "Well, the important development is the elections that took place last May and June.",
        "You had a parliamentary election that was quite free and fair and you had a victory by the majority that was then called the opposition that was opposed to Syria's presence.",
        "And they are now the people who have formed the government and they have a majority in parliament, but they haven't really asserted that majority because the Lebanese system is run according to a very peculiar tradition of confessional consensus.",
        "So this has created problems and has brought some stalemate into the government system right now.",
        "So you've had some positive developments in the pushing forward of real democracy in Lebanon, but at the same time, there are some serious constraints that the Lebanese themselves have to overcome.",

        "With that growth, the big companies are eager to be seen as major players in American entertainment and culture.",

        "Reverend Sampson--or Reverend Rivers, I should say, brought up an interesting point.",
        "This was not on our docket here, folks.",
        "I'm throwing this at you, but I just want your thoughts, if you will.",
        "His point was black America in particular and these areas that are laden with crime have to take a real hard look in the mirror and see what problems, not that the man is bringing on, not that society is bringing on--those have been long standing and are there--but the problems that are within the community.",
        "We heard Bill Cosby get into this in terms of education, quote, \"\"poor folks,\"\" etc. George Curry, let me start with you.",

        "I think we have to do it, but I think we always have done it.",
        "I mean, but I think Gene Rivers is right when was saying, you know, there's a certain elevation of thuggery in society, not just in the black community, especially since 72 percent of all rappers ....(unintelligible) by whites.",
        "So I think that these are images we must take on, the behavior we must take on, and there has been--I think this thing--our whole crime problem has exacerbated because of the infusion of drugs, because the violence against old people, robbing churches, these kind of things just didn't happen before.",
        "Yeah, Ed, I think that's exactly right.",
        "And I mean we--here in New York City, we have been somewhat--we've been somewhat fortunate that close to--even more than 10 years now the murder rate has been going--has been going down through successive mayors, successive police commissioners and so forth, and--but I think, particularly our current police commissioner, Ray Kelly, has really worked to get the community involved in regularly visiting black churches and so forth, basically, saying there has to be a partnership between the police and the community to control some of these things and I--obviously, I can't speak for, you know, any other city, but I think that's certainly a model to police to try and get that aspect of the problem under control.",
        "That's true.",
        "Laura Washington, here's what's interesting in all of this, and we don't like to say this out loud, and Eugene Rivers alluded to this, with all of the talk of numbers going down and we've seen crime numbers go down across the country on a whole, there is still far and away, far and away too much crime in the African-American community, particularly those communities who have the hardest go of it.",
        "Well, that is absolutely true, and has been true, probably, for 40 or 50 years.",
        "There's been major cultural shifts in our community that relate to some of the things that have already been pointed out--drugs in the media and images.",
        "But the issue is that I think--it's been discussed that we need to take control.",
        "I think that what Reverend Rivers is saying, that we need to--he talked about it--I thought it was an--interesting, he talked about the cultural problem we have in terms of the thuggery and the imagery of thuggery, but I think there's also a cultural problem in terms of making excuses and looking outward instead of looking inward and when we teach our kids that they can look to the man or they can blame someone else other than themselves, and not look inward, then you're basically recycling the same problems over and over again."

        "If you look at people on death row, it's (technical difficulties) about 33 percent are black (technical difficulties) Hispanic.",
        "Slightly higher percentage are actually white, surprisingly.",
        "But not one person is on death row in California for murdering a black person.",

        "They're going to go below the baseline level of 138,000 troops there on the ground.",
        "There are about 160,000 troops during the last election at the count there.",
        "Laura Washington, so many people suggesting that, for political reasons, and I don't want to try to demean it because we want all of these young men home and stop the killing on both sides, but there are those who will simply say from the cynical side that they knew this was coming December, January, because they want to be ready, Republicans, to say, `Look, we pulled back troops because you're going to go to the polls soon.'",
        "Yes, there has been an expectation that--for weeks now that George Bush wants to go into his State of the Union speech with some good news about Iraq.",
        "And the cynical interpretation I think is understandable, but just let's remember this is a wonderful Christmas present for the troops, for their families.",
        "My brother is stationed in the Army and has already been in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "And, you know, these guys--some of these guys have been in and out of there several times--and women--and if we can give them a break, give them some release, who cares what the reason for it is?"

        "That's a lot of people coming home, but it is a reminder for some who believe that this war was fought on the ill side of the ledger that suggests that once again even bringing these troops home so close to election year underscores the idea that many say that those that have died have come home maimed, etc., have done so for no real reason.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I don't think that's a--the best way to assess that, frankly.",
        "Because, you know, even if anybody was skeptical of the war from the beginning, I mean, certainly say at least in this most recent election where the Sunnis seem to have come out--came to--out and voted when they had boycotted before, there seems to be some positive--I mean, you know, we'll just say, you know, positive developments, at least at--I know it's a snapshot, but it seems to be some positive developments now.",
        "But also keep in mind, you know, they had ratcheted up the number of troops going into the--you know, going into the election, and so it's a pullback from there.",
        "Yes, we're dropping below the baseline of 138, but it's not--we're not dropping that far below.",
        "So, I mean, it seems to me we'll probably--we'll have, you know, in excess of 90 percent of what we've had for the last--you know, for the last three years.",
        "So I think that gives them--I think that gives the administration enough leeway I think--strategically speaking, leeway--where on the one hand they can say that people are coming home but at the same time they've got enough troops there to, you know, game plan any eventuality.",
        "George?",
        "Robert made the point I was going to make and that is exactly, they increased the number for the elections.",
