        "Whether you think it's liberal or conservative, it's been--its reporting for the last few years has been pretty sloppy and pretty tainted, so you go in knowing that you're dealing with a fallible source of information to begin with and go from there."

        "And it turns out that if you're up at the high levels of vitamin A, at the sort of almost toxic levels of vitamin A, it decreases instead of increases the incorporation of calcium into bones.",

        "I think so.",

        "Yes, and when people began to realize about the danger of excess vitamin A, in Norway, for example, they began to decrease the vitamin A to only a quarter of what it originally was in the cod liver oil, but that probably is not true for all cod liver oil in the world.",
