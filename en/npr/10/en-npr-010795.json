        "And they are slaves of a certain special sort.",
        "Yes.",
        "Not just anybody got to be a gladiator.",
        "In order to be condemned to be a gladiator, you had to have committed a great crime.",
        "And yet by the same token, there are some free people who volunteer to become gladiators.",
        "Some of them are taking a walk on the wild side...",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "...and some of them want the money that they'll get and the acclaim theyll get as gladiators.",
        "And the gladiator, of course, every time he goes into the arena could not walk out.",
        "Nevertheless, they got some privileges.",
        "They did.",
        "Although they were slaves and they were un-free, they had certain privileges as you say.",
        "For one thing, they're extremely well-fed, and they also got expert medical care, because they were, after all, an investment.",
        "And one wanted to be sure that they would be at - each gladiator would be at his best in each performance and would be at his strongest and at his fittest.",
        "They were also allowed to have wives or lovers with them in the gladiatorial barracks.",
        "And as I said, they could be celebrities.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Celebrities, which is an odd way to think of it.",
        "Nevertheless, these were huge attractions.",
        "But the gladiators that were led into a revolt by Spartacus, as you point out, well, they came from all over the territories conquered by Rome.",
        "This is in the time of the late republic.",
        "But there were people from what is now France, Celts and Franks, and there were people from Thrace, which was where Spartacus was from."

        "Yes.",

        "This is a period in the 1st Century B.C.",
        "in Rome when it's absolute worst in enslaving people - you know, huge numbers of people from around the Mediterranean and into central and northern Europe.",
        "And many of them were thrown together in various sorts of slave enterprises: farms or shepherd operations or gladiatorial schools in Italy.",
        "This is the raw material from which Spartacus built the foundation of his revolt.",
        "And the revolt - once his men escaped, and not all of them got out, but they fled up to the hillsides on Vesuvius and started to attract - slaves joined them to win their freedom or at least pay back their owners and the society which had enslaved them.",
        "Even some freedmen, you suggest, might have joined them.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "The ancient sources are clear that a small number of Spartacus' followers were free people.",
        "They were free, but they were down-and-out.",
        "They were very poor, and they saw the revolt as a way, at the very least, of winning loot - and also, perhaps, getting a bit of a revenge on the upper classes in Rome.",
        "And there has been all kinds of subsequent writing about the true nature of the Spartacus revolt.",
        "The Marxists have had there say.",
        "We remember the Spartacus League and all of that.",
        "What do we actually know about what they were trying to accomplish?",
        "Well, you know, we have to read between the lines.",
        "They haven't left us any of their own writings.",
        "Still, we're able to figure out a number of things.",
        "For one thing, as I said, they did want loot.",
        "For another thing, they did want to get revenge on the Romans who treated them so very badly and enslaved so many hundreds of thousands of people.",
        "For a third thing, some of them, like Spartacus, wanted to leave Italy and they wanted to go back home.",
        "But did they want to end slavery, and did they want to liberate slaves?",
        "That, of course, is what theyre most famous for.",

        "Sure.",

        "Now that the Americans are here, I feel better.",
        "...highlights so eloquently.",
        "But, in fact, that seems not to be true.",
        "They wanted to free slaves only as a means to an end to these other things that they wanted.",
        "There's no reason to think that they wanted to abolish slavery as an institution, that they wanted to abolish it in Italy, let alone around the whole Mediterranean world.",
        "In fact, some of them might have been happy to own their own slaves at some point.",
        "And even - a suggestion is they did not necessarily want to abandon the gladiatorial games.",
        "When they captured Romans, one of the big humiliations they imposed on them after they have defeated some of the legions sent out to conquer them was to force the Romans to participate in gladiatorial contests."

        "And, in fact, I remember taking my kids to Washington, and those same fasces are on either side of the speaker's podium in the House of Representatives chamber.",

        "Yes.",

        "But I know they're commonly used in government buildings.",

        "Yes.",
        "Decimation was this fiendishly clever and awful punishment that the Romans had in their army.",
        "If a unit misbehaved, you would take every 10th men and the other - punish him by having the other nine men in the unit having to beat him to death with cudgels.",
        "This was a way of imposing discipline, and once imposed, as you can imagine, it was rarely forgotten.",

        "He did.",
        "Cato fought for one of the Roman armies that Spartacus defeated, and Cato was disgusted by the failure of the Republic to put down this revolt swiftly and efficiently.",

        "Is that why they didnt want to go to north, to where it was cold, and so they went south to - all the way to the toe of the boot?",
