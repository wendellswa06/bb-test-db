        "It's very mountainous and there are very steep gorges there.",
        "And Crassus and the Romans take advantage of this.",
        "So in addition to these - using these gorges and the natural terrain, they build walls, and they closed off the whole peninsula, the whole 35 miles wide.",
        "They're trying to keep Spartacus and his men from breaking out.",
        "But they're fighting during the winter, and there are nights that are just too cold for the Romans.",
        "And Spartacus and the slaves, being a very hardy bunch, they take advantage of this.",
        "And on a cold and snowy night, they fill up a trench with branches and debris and corpses, and they go over these.",
        "They use this as a way to get over this Roman trench, and theres point where they break through the wall and they affect an escape.",

        "...however, he was not totally in command.",

        "He was brought to terms himself by an army he could not defeat, and the terrible punishment then visited upon them by the Romans.",
        "Spartacus, you say, died a soldier's death on the battlefield.",
        "His body was never identified.",
        "But all those captured were then crucified...",
        "Yes.",
        "...in a long row up the Appian Way between - all the way up to Rome and left there to rot, and many of them lingered for days.",
        "The story of this conflict is told by Barry Strauss in his book, \"\"The Spartacus War,\"\" and told in rather less historical detail in the new television miniseries \"\"Blood and Sand,\"\" \"\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand.",

        "And what do we know about these five young men?",
        "Well, I'll tell you, what's really different about these five young men, they went overseas, and they clearly - FBI officials feel they clearly radicalized themselves watching videos on the Internet and seem allegedly to have wanted to find some sort of training so they could attack U.S.",
        "troops overseas.",
        "That's sort of the broad outline of it, but what is very interesting about this, for someone who watches a lot of these plots on a day-to-day basis, or a lot of these alleged plots, is that this group was very mixed.",
        "I mean, generally you see groups of young men who have similar ethnicities.",
        "And in this case, we've got someone from Eretria, we've got somebody from Egypt, we've got somebody from Pakistan.",

        "This is - the geographic coherence seems to be northern Virginia.",
        "Yes, exactly, and the fact that they all speak English with an American accent.",
        "And so these are - we've all thought, all along, again unlike the Somalis who are a distinct community and recent arrivals, that American Muslims are much better assimilated in this country than they are in places like Britain and that the appeal of homegrown terrorism may be diminished because of that.",
        "Yes, I think that's been a false hope for some time.",
        "There were mostly two groups that intelligence officials were taking a look at in this country as being less well-assimilated than other groups.",
        "And that would be Somalis - and as you say, the Somalis in Minneapolis, that's where the largest concentration of Somalis in this country are - and then the second group was Yemenis.",
        "And what they have in common is that they tend not to assimilate as well because they're working three jobs.",
        "They're usually pretty poor.",
        "Usually, their households are headed by mothers who came over here alone.",
        "They are very connected to the political goings-on in their home countries, and they never really get politically connected to what's going on in this country.",
        "And together, that makes - puts them in a kind of bubble that intelligence officials think make them much more susceptible to radicalization.",
