        "Absolutely.",
        "That's one huge change.",
        "Another has been what seems like an increase in radicalization in some American communities.",
        "Dina mentioned earlier the Somali-American community, and that's one that counterterrorism officials are watching quite closely, and now, of course, we see the initial reports of the individuals who went off to Pakistan to seek training, which is also quite troubling.",
        "It's also quite troubling, and in fact, the case of the young man arrested in New York, that's Mr. Zazi, who apparently received training in Pakistan.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This is of grave concern to counterterrorism officials because, again according to the initial press reports, Zazi admitted that he received explosives training from al-Qaida.",
        "And this puts him a cut above the other people who have been arrested on terrorism charges in the United States since 9/11, since none of them were trained by al-Qaida, and as a result, none of them were even close to as dangerous.",
        "Dina, let me bring you back in here.",
        "You wrote a book about the Lackawanna Six and follow many of these cases very closely.",
        "Do you agree that once you've had training, you become a much more dangerous person?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, the way that counterterrorism officials were talking about Zazi was that this Najibullah Zazi, the man who allegedly wanted to blow up transportation targets in New York, they were talking to him as being operational instead of aspirational.",
        "I think that we see a lot of these different plots about people who wanted to do something that was really completely out of their ability, almost a pipe-dream type of attack.",
        "And there is some evidence that suggests that not only did Zazi have that explosives training, but actually there's some evidence in a hotel room where he was - and again, this is alleged - that he actually was able to build a particular kind of bomb, the same kind of bomb that they used in the London transportation bombings.",
        "And Daniel Byman, as you look at these kinds of developments, should we be expecting more of this, as apparently these training sites in Pakistan continue to operate?",
        "Unfortunately, the answer is we should be expecting more.",
        "Now, I don't want to exaggerate this too much.",
        "I don't think we're facing the same danger that several European countries face from their domestic populations, but some of the complacency that we've had over the last few years, I think, should be challenged because we're - almost all the direction is negative in recent years when it comes to domestic counterterrorism.",
        "Okay.",
        "My family, my faith, my business.",
        "I know conservatism because I have lived conservatism."

        "Absolutely.",
        "It doesn't take much for an individual to be able to acquire a weapon and start shooting people.",
        "And if you take that individual and give him or her some initial training, they become even more dangerous.",
        "So even though we can be somewhat assured that there aren't large numbers of individuals in the United States who are hostile to the government, we still have to worry about a small group of individuals or a lone individual killing a great many people.",
        "Let's get Mark(ph) on the line, Mark's calling from Olympia in Washington.",
        "Oh, hi there.",
        "Let's see if I can collect my thoughts quickly.",
        "You know, we're essentially talking about a localized global problem with tens of millions, hundreds of millions of Islamic youth, Muslim youth around the world, and they do form a community.",
        "We have a culture of our own that is totally imbued with violence.",
        "First-person-shooter video games, they're I believe a common thread in the kind of school shootings that we saw, that all these kids had that in common, they were good at that game.",
        "I think that may be something of an exaggeration, but go ahead.",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I think that I talked to or listened to a SWAT man talk about that at one point - the point being that we are somewhat desensitized by violence.",
        "Fair enough.",
        "We have a complicated problem in that when adolescents have nothing (unintelligible), and they have limited direction in their life, and they find someone who is willing to manipulate them and play on all the emotions and the change in life that goes on with admittedly very emotional material.",
        "If you can identify with youth and you can see your cousins or your brothers, as it were, anywhere in the world suffering.",
        "And to be sure, whatever the position, there's a lot of suffering in these regions of the world.",
        "I'm not saying that we're responsible for it.",
        "I'm saying that we don't acknowledge that there is really a lot of wrong that needs to be righted.",
        "And we have to understand, in that sense of the articles of war, you have to know your enemy.",
        "What is motivating these people?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "Daniel Byman, does it go back to what Dina was talking about earlier, to that narrative that some of these kids find so appealing?",
        "Certainly.",
        "The problem is there's not a single narrative.",
        "For the Somali-Americans who were radicalized, it was because the United States was seen as siding with the enemy of Somalia - Ethiopia.",
        "And they were very focused on what to most Americans seemed a very distant and minor foreign policy issue but to the Somali-American community was quite real.",
        "It'll be interesting to see what comes up in the next few weeks about the individuals who journeyed to Pakistan and what drove them, but there is a lot that people can take offense at if they so choose.",
        "But on the other hand, I don't think that quite gives the excuse to focus exclusively on their being disassociated from society or some broader economic problems or lack of opportunities."

        "For many of these individuals, they're well-educated, they seem to have professional prospects, but they make a choice.",
        "And it's often a choice that's driven by politics, that's driven by their interpretation of what's wrong with the world.",
        "But one danger, in some ways, is we underestimate these people because we think they're driven by a lack of opportunities and economic motives when, in fact, they have very strong political grievances that shapes what they do.",
        "Dina, how does that square with the people who've been involved in the plots that you're familiar with?",
        "Well, I completely agree.",
        "I think there's a sense that we normally that these are disaffected people who have nothing else to turn to.",
        "In the case of the 20-or-so missing Somali kids, almost of them were in college, and some of them wanted to be doctors and lawyers.",
        "So this idea that somehow they weren't on a good path so they chose this other path just - I think that doesn't bear itself out anymore.",
        "And I think that one of the qualities that we don't put enough focus on is the idea that a lot of these young men go for the adventure and that this is sort of - they get them in a group, and sort of the testosterone sort of builds, and I can be a better Muslim than you can, and I can - I'm willing to go and fight, are you willing to go and fight?",
        "And before you know it, you find yourself on a plane on your way to Somalia or on your way to Pakistan, sort of by bravado.",
        "This is certainly what happened with the Lackawanna Six.",
        "It certainly appears to have been what happened to a large extent, while they were in some ways politically motivated, with the Somali young men, and I think - I suspect we're going to see something like that in this most-recent group.",

        "What do I believe is that all the young men left from America to Somalia, there is no reason that (unintelligible) trying to fight the Americans.",
        "They were trying to fight with the Ethiopian.",

        "That's a problem.",
        "So I think he's making the case - and excuse me if I'm putting words in your mouth, Agawe - but he's saying an American Jew can go fight for Israel if they so choose, but if a Somali goes to fight for Somalia, they're branded a terrorist.",
        "Is that right?",
        "That's what I'm trying to say, yes, Neal.",

        "Could there not be a more effective counter-narrative that would inoculate against this sort of thing?",
        "Certainly, but we have to be careful in practice how we do this.",
        "If the deliverer of the narrative, the one giving the story is an outsider from the community, it's probably not going to have much effect.",
        "But if you can get a respected local leader to explain things in a different way, it can have a huge impact.",
        "And here it's worth pointing out, there seems to be a bit of good news if you look at the individuals who recently went to Pakistan, where you had a case where they were - some local community organizations or -excuse me, a national Muslim organization saw the video, contacted the FBI.",
        "And as a result, the United States government became aware of this problem.",
        "And if you can make sure that people feel comfortable working with their government and empower local leaders who do have the correct narrative, then you've made big progress.",

        "In the case of the Somali case in Minneapolis - sorry to keep going back to that but that's a very recent one - the way they found out that these kids had gone missing is that the parents had gone to the FBI and told them, look, my son is missing.",
        "And that sort of caught them -that made them start realizing that this was a pattern.",
        "And in the Lackawanna 6 case, the way they found out that these young men had gone to an al-Qaida camp is while they were still at the camp, someone from the community wrote a letter to the FBI and said these guys are at the camp, some were worried.",
        "And this was before 9/11."
