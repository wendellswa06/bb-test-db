        "Absolutely.",
        "There are some countries where the primary U.S.",
        "interest is counterterrorism, and Somalia stands out in that regard.",
        "So, if your goal is to reduce the threat of terrorism when dealing with Somalia, you have to figure the impact of your policy on domestic communities as well as overseas.",
        "So if the United States kills an al-Qaida operative in Somalia, if the United States backs Ethiopia, that can have benefits in Somalia, but it can also backfire if it angers the Somali-American community and makes them more prone to radical behavior.",
        "Just another factor in the decision - not saying don't do it, but think about it first.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Just make sure that point of view is at the table.",

        "- when U.S.",
        "officials make a policy decision, like sending 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan, you know, to what extent does that really affect the community here at home and what people are thinking about it, you know, how much does it disenfranchise the youth around here and make it seem as though the U.S.",

        "It is not only customary, but it is sort of a law of the--administrative law of the White House that if you have aides of the executive branch that are under indictment, they cannot serve until the indictment is cleared, and that as been observed by all of the White Houses that I know anything about it.",

        "Do you have a sense that this is a moment of crisis for the Bush White House?",
        "Certainly the United States doesn't have the ability, or I would say even the interest in going around the world and trying to impose order everywhere in the world.",
        "But the tribal parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan are different.",
        "Al-Qaida has always had a presence in Pakistan as well as in Afghanistan.",
        "We think about al-Qaida being in Afghanistan before in 9/11 but it was also quite present in many parts of Pakistan.",
        "And so when it moved largely from Afghanistan to Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban, it wasn't going to a foreign country.",
        "It was going back home in many ways.",
        "And so if we can remove it from that area or greatly reduce its presence, that's a huge, huge step forward.",

        "I mean, we just know ourselves when we move how much disarray there is.",
        "And that's one of the reasons why these Predator missile attacks are considered to be so vital to cracking down on al-Qaida, is that it is causing them to break their patterns.",
