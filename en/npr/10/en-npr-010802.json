        "The value of the Iranian currency has dropped to the lowest its been in 33 years.",

        "They accepted significant declines in real wages, which had huge social consequence and costs and not something easy to do.",
        "But as a result of those large declines, they regained competitiveness, started to boost exports and began to grow again.",
        "So is it safe to observe that you see an opportunity in this distress that other people simply don't, or at least aren't willing to invest on?",
        "Yeah, I mean this is a very research-intensive process.",
        "We have a team of over 40 people in 10 different countries that we draw upon, to really dig into macroeconomic and political and country-level analysis.",

        "So not focusing on what's the next quarter, what's the next quote couple quarters, but what are the prospects over the next couple years?",

        "And we came away from that assessment that it wasn't sustainable long-term.",
        "They would be in a debt trap, which was the more austerity you put in place, the weaker growth, the lower the tax revenues, the bigger the deficit, the more austerity need, and the spiral is going to continue.",
