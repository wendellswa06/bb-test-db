        "The idea behind the rhino costume is, you know, there's a lot of Republicans out there that claim to be very conservative when really, their voting record shows that they're not.",
        "And that's the term called RHINO - Republican in name only.",
        "The eventual Republican nominee will need a broader political spectrum of voters if he wants to become president.",

        "So, Will, what was last week's puzzle challenge?",
        "Remind us.",
        "Yes.",
        "The challenge was to take the name of a popular children's character in nine letters - several of its letters appear more than once in the name.",
        "I said remove every duplication of a letter so that every letter that remains appears just once.",
        "And this new set of letters can be rearranged to name a famous classical composer.",
        "Who is it?",
        "Well, the composer is Chopin, which can be spelled from the letters of Pinocchio.",
        "Last week we had fewer entries than usual - not because our listeners are not brilliant but because of some technical issues with the website.",
        "Still, more than 800 listeners did send in the correct answer.",
        "And our winner this week is Margo Michelle Huffman of Corvallis, Oregon.",
        "Congratulations, Margo.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So, are you a fan of Chopin?",
        "Yeah.",
        "When my brother and I were little, we grew up in Mendham, New Jersey, and the million dollar movie played \"\"A Song to Remember,\"\" which was a semi-fictionalized version of Chopin's life.",
        "And we watched it 11 times in one week and even stayed home from school to watch it.",
        "My brother was a pianist, played a lot of Chopin, and so that came to me right away.",
        "So, it did help in your solving the puzzle.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "To what extent does the current tax code play Robin Hood of sorts, taking from the rich, redistributing income to the poor?",
        "And then what issues does that raise?",
        "Well, the - today's tax code serves more than one purpose.",
        "It raises a lot of money to finance the government, $3 trillion a year.",
        "It gives Americans incentives to do things that the government wants them to do like save for retirement, buy houses - and to avoid things that the government wants them to avoid, like smoking cigarettes.",
        "And for decades, it has reduced the gap between winners and losers in the economy, reduced inequality.",
        "That's why tax rates on the rich are generally higher than those on the middle class.",
        "That's why a quarter of all households at the bottom are freed of paying any federal income or payroll tax.",
        "Now, because we've had a lot of increase in inequality in the last decade or two, liberals want to use the tax code more aggressively to reduce inequality.",
        "Conservatives generally believe that's a bad idea, that this redistribution has unwelcome effects on economic growth.",
        "And this is always an issue when we're trying to do a big tax bill.",
        "So the last time we did big tax reform - that was in 1986 - going in, everybody decided OK, we want it to be what they called distributionally neutral.",
        "That is, it wouldn't change the tax burden on the rich or the poor.",
        "It would just move things around.",
        "And that's the goal of this new attempt, this broad tax overall?",
        "Well, it's not quite clear.",
        "Congressional Republicans generally haven't wanted to make that a condition, although they frame this as a tax break for the middle class.",

        "No, I don't benefit.",
        "I don't benefit.",
        "You don't think rich people benefit?",
        "In fact, very, very strongly, as you see, there's no - I think there's very little benefit for people of wealth.",
        "And the White House, in their eight-page framework document, kind of doubled down on that, promising that the reformed tax code, as they put it, will be at least as progressive as the existing code, won't shift the tax burden from high- to low-income people.",
        "Is that true?",
        "I mean, from what we've seen so far, can they deliver on that?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "And the answer - the short answer is probably not.",
        "A lot depends on the specifics we don't have yet, like what income levels would tax rates apply?",
        "What tax breaks will be eliminated?",
        "There are provisions that would hit upper-income taxpayers harder, like eliminating the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes.",
        "That would affect higher-income people.",
        "There are all sorts of vague statements like congressional committees will work on additional measures to meaningfully reduce the tax burden on the middle class.",
        "But if you take the package as a whole, it's nearly impossible to see how Congress can do all that's on this list - lower the top tax rate, raise the bottom tax rate from 10 percent to 12 percent, sharply cut business taxes, eliminate the estate tax - without ending up with a bigger tax break for people at the top than the bottom.",
        "And that's before you take account of the spending cuts in the future, our tax increases in the future that we're going to need eventually to pay down the borrowing...",
        "Yeah."
