        "Well, no matter how Prague got its Oklahoma twist, rest assured that we will never call Leemah - that we will never call Lima Leemah again (laughter) even though I just did.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "All this month, we've taken stock of the wake-up call the tech world got in 2018.",
        "With privacy scandals, political fallout from those scandals and tech addiction fears, there was a financial cost to all of those companies, such as Facebook and Apple - have seen the value of their shares drop precipitously.",

        "He's containing - just by virtue of who he is, not through any artifice, although there's, of course, there's artifice in all politicians - but even if you stripped away any artifice, by virtue of his biography, he's someone who seems to contain all sorts of contradictions, and that - you can't buy that.",
        "It's priceless.",
        "Is this something - well, it would seem to tend to drive people, if you've got it, if you're born with it, if you have it, into a couple of, well, selected professions, you'd think, obviously, acting and politics.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, people who are charismatic tend to be praised or rewarded very early on in their lives for that charisma.",
        "So, for example, if you're very, very beautiful, and also have other features that combine with that beauty to make you charismatic, you will be someone who plays with that beauty, who uses that beauty, who doesn't run from it, because it's what wins you praise and reward early in life.",
        "Similarly, if you're a superb speaker, if you have tremendous public poise, why wouldn't you go into a profession that rewards that kind of speaking?",
