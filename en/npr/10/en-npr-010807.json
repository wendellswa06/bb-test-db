        "Sure.",
        "Lawyers are, in that sense, performers in the courtroom, yeah.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the best lawyers are not the ones who - if we're talking about litigation, if we're talking about performing in the courtroom, charisma isn't necessarily just being the best prepared or the smartest.",
        "It has a lot to do with forging that connection with the jury, and how do you forge that connection with the jury?",
        "You have to seem as if, on the one hand, you know more than they do, but on the other hand, you understand who they are and their pain and their problems.",
        "And you're hardly, as you've pointed out, the first person to study this, not just Mr. Roach, but a lot of pretty famous people.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, one of the things that we know about charisma is how little we've known about it over the centuries.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "The Renaissance Italians studied it and their word that comes closest to it is sprezzatura, which, of course, is a kind of effortless grace, the person who walks into the room, and without even trying to do anything, become the center of attention.",
        "And the sociologist Max Weber studied it very famously in the context of political figures, and he referred to charisma as one of the ways that a political movement could get started.",
        "Why?",
        "Let's see - we get some listeners involved in the conversation.",

        "Hi.",
        "Fascinating subject, because I used to think about this, because I had my ego shot down a number of times when I playing with a rock 'n' roll band in Cleveland in the '80s that had, quote, \"\"groupie status,\"\" and gals would come over to me and say, would you introduce me to the guitar player?"

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Because it really did, you know, it did me in and I don't - you know, those weren't the women that I would normally want to chase around, but it would be nice to be asked.",
        "Yes, it would.",
        "I don't know what they had and if they - when we were on the road, they never would get hotel rooms, because the always had people's, and mostly female's, houses that they would stay in.",

        "I don't know.",
        "Lead singer as well, he - they were all fairly good looking, but I wouldn't say striking.",
        "But there is - what did you say, the French word, je ne sais quoi?",
        "Je ne sais quoi, yes.",
        "Yes, there was - and just a vibe that they put out.",
        "I mean, they were great guys, like, you know, we still have reunions and kind of relive the old days.",

        "Why has a person learnt that attribute?",
        "Graciousness is elegant, but charisma always has a way of manipulating.",
        "Do you think that's right?",
        "You know, I'm not sure that's right.",
        "I think charisma, like anything else, any other quality of the world, can be used for good or for ill.",
        "And so certainly, there are people who use their charisma to manipulate, but I think that people who are deeply authentic can be charismatic for their authenticity.",
        "I think that - you know, I actually would question - of all the litany that you read off before, Neal, about who has charisma...",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "Who doesn't, the Woody Allen one to me was kind of interesting, because here's someone who, obviously his affect and his persona are nerdy, right?",
        "And they're not classically sexy.",
        "On the other hand, he certainly is compelling in a way that I think a lot of other nerds aren't, or a lot of brainiacs, a lot of other intellectuals.",
        "And I think there's something about his authenticity, his willingness to be himself, that plays as a kind of strength.",
        "So, on the one hand, obviously, you look at him, you'd say, here's the guy who doesn't get the girl, and not just look at him, but listen to him.",
