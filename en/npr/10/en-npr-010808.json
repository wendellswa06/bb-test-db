        "But we're working with folks who are either leaders of organizations or politicians trying to, you know, obviously, trying to make sure their demeanor reassures people that they're in charge, that they're going to get the job done.",
        "And Oprah really is a wonderful example of that.",
        "What we look at is - and Mark mentioned this earlier - strength and warmth, because, you know, we have to find some way to break down this complex and an enigmatic \"\"it\"\" thing into something that we can get our brains around.",
        "And we've found that this combination of strength and warmth really does get through at least most of what people are getting at when they talk about charisma.",
        "And is this verbal communication or is it nonverbal?",
        "Well, it's largely nonverbal and that's very important to see.",
        "It's the strength and warmth that you're projecting with your body, with your facial expressions, and with your tone of voice.",
        "But it is verbal, too.",
        "I mean, take a couple of famous charismatic leadership utterances, right?",
        "Ask not what your country can do for you\"\" - it's very much a bracing challenge, and so there's a strength element to it - \"\"but what you can do for your country.\"\" It's this idea of the greater good, because the leader's role is to watch after the whole group, to be strong enough, to face down external threats, but also, on the other hand, to actually care about the people in the group, so that they're not just a tyrant.",
        "Hm.",
        "And as you try to teach this to people who are presumably just as skilled at communications as you or me or anybody else in the audience...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "What kinds of nonverbal gestures do you emphasize?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, strength you can think about as being projected primarily through your posture, so standing up straight, you know, which used to be one of those things that got taught to children somewhere along the way by someone.",
        "That's a big piece of it.",
        "The way you move, and it's not so much being forceful to demonstrate strength.",
        "If anything, it's moving in a more controlled, deliberate manner.",
        "Think of the word poise.",
        "That really conveys what you're seeing when you see someone move gracefully, in a way that projects strength, that speaks to other people on a gut level.",
        "For warmth, on the other hand, as you can imagine, smiling is the A number one thing, and making sure that you smile in a way that's not too submissive.",
        "That's the problem.",
        "As Mark pointed out earlier, strength and warmth can sometimes be at war with one another.",
        "If you're trying to dial up your strength, you probably look a little less warm, come across a little less warm, than you might otherwise and vice versa.",
        "But there are ways, and in fact, Ronald Reagan, who you mentioned earlier, and Bill Clinton, had a very particular way of smiling that conveys both strength and warmth at the same time.",
        "Their mouth is smiling in the traditional, smiley-face gesture, right?",
        "But around their eyes, there is an intent look, almost a flinty or steely look to their eyes, and you know, if you actually break it out, it's the lower eyelids that are flexed like they're kind of squinting.",
        "And that by itself projects the strength to balance out the warmth that you see on their mouth.",
        "Reagan and Clinton wore those expressions around, and wear, in Bill's case obviously, constantly.",
        "That is their default facial expression, and that's a very powerful thing for them.",
        "It's projecting this reassurance.",
        "Mike Oppenheimer, does that duality work in the equation that you were citing earlier, the strength and warmth?"

        "You know, their charisma is projected on a different stage.",
        "And their dualities are going to be different, because they are trying to persuade people, through the persona of the royal or the persona of a stage actor or screen actor.",
        "So, there are different things they're trying to convey.",
        "And interestingly, you know, this change over time, right?",
        "If you looked at actors from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, they were much more going for just the kind of strength-and-warmth combination, the kind of charisma that would play very, very well if you were president.",

        "Clark Gable, definitely.",
        "Absolutely, absolutely, Gregory Peck, that sort of thing.",
        "But we live in an era in which in our arts, anyway, there is more of a premium on male vulnerability than there was 50 years ago.",
