        "Charismatically.",
        "Thanks very much, Evan.",
        "Listening to NPR...",
        "Oh, good afternoon.",
        "I had two friends who, I think, had charisma, and it was shown in different ways.",
        "The first one was a social worker that I worked with way-back-when in New York, and this woman was not at all attractive.",
        "In fact, everybody thought she was very homely.",
        "She was a typical, plump, Italian woman, and - but she emanated sex all over to all - the men patients loved her, the male staff loved her, and she got along very well with the women.",
        "And I don't know if she was aware of what she did, but she emanated sex.",
        "The other person is - was a very close friend of mine - she died a few years ago - who, again, was fairly plain looking.",
        "She always had a smile on her face.",
        "Her eyes sparkled.",
        "She had a wonderful spirit.",
        "Always very nonjudgmental and cheerful, and she was the kind of person that when we went into Mexico to get medicines, and then we had to stand in a long line, well, the customs looked over things, I always send her first because she would charm the socks off of them.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And when they asked for her prescriptions, she always had them.",
        "I might have mine, I might not.",
        "But by the time they got to me, they were so charmed they'd just whisk me on through, and this was repeated in a little differently on the way home, when they had the check - well, they still do have a checkpoint - in - on I-19, immigration always stops and I always told Carla, smile so that we just get waved through.",
        "It's not that we had anything, but I didn't want to be held up because usually the lines were long.",
        "Well, Mark Oppenheimer, let me ask you about Joyce's points, one of which is charm, but the other one of which is sex, and sex certainly seems to play a role in this.",
        "Well, it does.",
        "A lot of the most charismatic people are also very, very sexy.",
        "I don't think that we - that they're the same thing, but you know, when given the choice of assignation between - with a sexy person - a charismatic person or non-charismatic person, you know, we'll choose an evening in the plaza with the charismatic person.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "The thing that Joyce said that I thought was really very interesting was when she talked about the - her plump, Italian friend's spirit.",
        "And that goes really to the heart of, historically, the debate about charisma, because the Christians, the early Christians, talked about it.",
        "I mean, the word charism in Greek, it means gift, and they thought charisma was a gift.",
        "I mean, Pentecostal Christians, to this day, will talk about charisma as the visitation of, you know, gifts, like speaking in tongues or prophesying or healing, faith healing.",
        "That is charisma to them.",
        "And so, there's a kind of mystical way of thinking about charisma that - you just can't explain it.",
        "It's in the spirit.",
        "Maybe that's what it is with Secretariat.",
        "I'm not sure."

        "You could...",
        "But I have to think that if it's a horse giving it off, it's probably something just - you can't pin it down.",
        "And then, there's a sense that you could actually break it down rather scientifically.",
        "And John Neffinger, I assume, in your training, well, the sex part could get you into trouble.",
        "Charm, though, pretty good.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, charm is great.",
        "And you know, maybe I'm a cynic here, but I would - I'm definitely looking for the constituent parts, because while we see it as this complex, mysterious, magical thing, it - the effect is produced by people doing ordinary things, right?",
        "They're standing up straight.",
        "They're smiling.",
        "There's nothing crazy going on there.",
        "There's no special magic or potion or whatever to it.",
        "In the case of the caller's friends, I think very interesting, right?",
        "These are people who are specifically not that attractive, and yet, are very self-confident, right?",
        "So, they're projecting a strength of character.",
        "They're to be taken seriously, even though they don't have the sort of matinee idol or, you know, a kind of good looks.",
        "In some sense, that may actually work to their advantage, because if you have the matinee idol or female equivalent good looks, and you're projecting a whole heck a lot of confidence in yourself, then, interpersonally, that can create jealousies, that means you probably have to go the extra mile to be that much warmer, to make sure that people also find you likable in addition to finding you confident.",
        "Well, John Neffinger, thanks very much...",
        "Well, you know, that's very valid, because Carla was no threat to anyone, but yet everybody flocked to her, and just - she just was - everybody was her friend.",
        "She was everybody's friend.",
        "Mm-hm."

        "I'm a professor of history at Arizona State University, and 10 years ago, I wrote a book on charisma and community formation in Japan between 1300 and 1700.",
        "So, don't let leave - let's leave out the religious aspect of this some time.",
        "I think that what people do is concentrate too much on what people have, that is to say the Clintons, the Lincolns, or whatnot, and not focus enough on what people want."

        "Really?",
        "And that's a really critical area of looking at the relationship.",
        "Charisma is a relationship of mutual interdependence (ph) and an exchange of power.",
        "And what you see in these relationships, especially on the political side, for example, is you get something from Clinton, Clinton gives you something that you can then turn around and use to make your own relationships.",
        "And that changes over time, as we were mentioning...",
        "(Foreign language spoken)",
        "Yeah, and Joseph Roach definitely points to that in his book.",
        "A great example of that - I think about how it changes over time, because people's needs change over time even if the charismatic figure, him or herself, doesn't.",
        "A great example of that might be John McCain.",
        "Again, say what you will about his politics, or obviously, he's fighting a different battle now than he was eight years ago when he ran for president, but the sense of him as the maverick, as the crusading, I would say, charismatic outsider, which came so much from his sort of brusque speaking manner, the way he holds himself, always with that memory of the war injury in his posture, that was much more effective eight years ago than I think it's proving to be now.",
        "Part of it is that he's gotten older, but you know, as we know from Reagan, age is not necessarily a barrier.",
        "Part of it is a lot of Americans, for their charisma fix, whether they agree with Obama's politics or not, the kind of charisma fix that Americans are craving at this point in time is more Obamian (ph), I would say, than McCainian (ph).",
        "Well, we'll find out in November, won't we?",

        "And in some of those places you had citizen militias fighting the militants, and that's what you had here in this area, in Shah Hassan Khel."
