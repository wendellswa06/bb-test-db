        "It's possible that some defendants might be dropped so they could focus the case on Batiste and one or two of his top followers.",
        "Or it's possible they might try to negotiate a deal with some of these men on lesser charges.",
        "So all that has to be worked out between now and when trial is set to begin January 7th.",
