        "No but it would establish a federal civil union status.",
        "So that if a gay couple who got a civil union or marriage in say Vermont or Massachusetts, they would get the federal benefits associated with that.",
        "But our proposal doesn't require any other state or anybody else to do anything.",
        "And David Blankenhorn, as I understand that there is such a proposal would require the Congress to overturn the marriage act, something that is going to be hard to do.",
        "Overturn the defense of marriage act?",
        "Correct.",
        "Well it would require an affirmative step to give federal recognition to state enacted civil unions.",
        "So that's a pretty limited thing, and you know, we felt it was a reasonable step to ask.",
        "As you approach this conversation, David, what was it then you decided you could give up.",
        "Well what people like me who want marriage to remain in its customary form, we don't want to move toward a situation that is, you know, just like marriage accept going by a different name.",
        "So the move toward civil unions is something that, you know, lot of people on my side of the ticket sort of have to swallow hard on.",
        "On the other hand, I feel and I know probably many people feel, that this debate has become so acrimonious and people are so dug in on their positions in the extremes of the debate have dominated - and you know we've to live together.",
        "You know we've to live together.",
        "And so a little bit of give and take, a little bit of pragmatic compromising so that not anyone is completely satisfied but we lower the culture war aspect of this.",
        "The ugliness that came out of the California situation was very sobering experience.",
        "And so, would it be possible for people on both sides to just relax a little bit when it comes to ideological purity and consistency.",
        "And just everybody gave a little bit and see if we don't feel better.",
        "And Jonathan Rauch, on your side, some people might look at this compromise and say what you've given up on gay marriage is marriage.",
        "Well, and in fact and some of them are saying that.",
        "Yeah, a lot of people, most gay people want nothing less than full marriage and a lot of people feel it's kind offensive to accept sort of second class status.",
        "And other people will say, well, you know, the gay side long term is winning on this anyway, why compromise on civil rights.",
        "But I've come to feel, as David has, that first of all, as Americans it would be good if we can find partial solutions that take some of the fires out from under the culture war.",

        "So I felt that's important.",
        "And Neal, just by the way for the record, I don't think our compromise would require a change in the defense of marriage act.",
        "It speaks to what federal civil union would be.",

        "Well hi.",
        "It seemed to me as kind of an easy way to take care of this for both sides, would be to get the government completely out of the marriage business.",
        "Leave that up to the churches.",
        "Now everybody gets a civil union, so fix some of the legal aspects - inheritance, visitation, things like that.",
        "And you can go to the church of your choice, or you know if you are atheist or agnostic just have somebody officiate then, and you get married.",
        "David Blankenhorn that would seem to be a solution that would be consistent with what you're proposing.",
        "Well I've thought about it, and lot of people have thought about it, but that level of dejuridification of marriage and the withdrawal of the legal protections for marriage, I think we could run the risk of contributing to the weakening of the institution.",
        "There is very good reason…",
        "How it would be weakened.",
        "What aspects of it would be taken away, other than the word, marriage.",
        "It will be consistent across all people level that way.",
        "It would retain all the legal rights.",
        "And marriage as, you know as far as the churches are concerned, that's really where the concept comes in anyway - I think where the argument is.",
        "Churches are free, you know, to marry gays or not marry gays.",
        "So David what would be lost in this?",
        "Well if I understand the caller correctly, everybody - gays and straights - could get married now.",

        "But it's worth thinking about.",
        "Jonathan Rauch, what do you think.",
        "It's a thought experimented, comes up all the time but its just not going to happen in America, which has a tradition of hybrid marriage, that's both religious and civil, that goes back since colonial days.",
        "And remember, marriage is a state level institution here.",
        "You'd have to figure out a way to get all 50 states to do this and there is no public support for it.",

        "I mean, maybe we're looking, you know, way down the line here.",
        "But its kind of a shame that that's an impediment for getting something that I think would be good thing done - basically, you know, politics and pleasing everyone rather than doing something that actually would you know solve the problem.",
