        "Just mentioning the IRS, there is a law that's in the tax code, that says where you can write off your the interest on your mortgage that's intended to promote home ownership - running into some problems with that on bigger scale, but the government sees that is a good thing.",
        "And I think, David Blankenhorn, there are benefits to being married because the government sees benefits in having married people.",
        "Yes.",

        "It does not depend on a certain religious point their view.",
        "It is engaged in by people who have no religious point their view.",
        "So, the idea that marriage is somehow a product of religion - not true.",
        "Secondly, people say get the government out of the marriage business.",
        "But the government is inevitably involved in the human pair bonding and procreative business.",
        "You could call it anything you want.",

        "Even at the age of 10, 11, I was working every weekend in the summer holidays.",
        "And what would happen is the 18, 20-year-old boys would come out of college and work at Dad's restaurant, and I'd be the one breaking them into the kitchen.",
