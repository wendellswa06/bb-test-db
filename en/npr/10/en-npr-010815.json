        "And Glenn Beck and Fox News made this a seemingly cordial announcement that they've both agreed to end the daily talk show -speculation, though, that the relationship with the people in Fox News has become increasingly rocky.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And not even speculation, it's just - it's very apparent.",
        "Glenn Beck, you know, who has a healthy sense of self - in that program last night, he helpfully compared himself to Paul Revere.",
        "You know, it was his sense that he was bigger than Fox News.",
        "And Fox looked at the guy who had soared to ratings heights - exceeding three million in viewers for a time, in the earliest months of the Obama administration, with his concerns and fears about where the president was taking us - became increasingly conspiratorial, increasingly accusatory.",
        "You know, he called the president a racist.",
        "He said other dark things, and advertisers began to strip away.",
        "And once the advertisers start to strip away, it becomes difficult to sustain a program.",
        "But wasn't Glenn Beck one of the faces of Fox News?",
        "He was.",
        "You know, he's - call it, you know, a third or 40 percent off the peak of his ratings.",
        "But that still leaves him in awfully strong company.",
        "He's usually right around two million viewers a night.",
        "And for a cable news, that's a pretty healthy audience.",
        "But, you know, he triggered boycotts for calling the president a racist.",
        "He triggered condemnations, anti-Semitic for things he had said about prominent Jews, such as the liberal finance here, George Soros.",
        "And at a certain point, as Fortune 500 name-brand advertisers back away, hundreds of them in the face of boycotts, you know, Fox felt less of a reason to keep apologizing and more of a reason to say perhaps this isn't going to work out for us.",
        "And are - is there any reason to believe these undetermined future projects will come to fruition at Fox?"

        "Well, indeed.",
        "And he - you know, if you think of all the things he's done lately, he has this Mercury Radio Arts production company.",
        "And he put on - very successful for a while - a concert tour around the U.S., culminated, in some ways, in its most visible presence with that rally on The Mall to restore America, you know, that was on the same spot and on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's \"\"I Have a Dream\"\" speech down at the Lincoln Memorial.",
        "He created The Blaze, which is supposed to be a conservative counterpart to Arianna Huffington's Huffington Post.",
        "This is a guy with a sense of an empire that he's building outside of the Fox walls.",
        "And it's interesting.",
        "He decides to focus on those kinds of activities - so far as we know - the same week that we hear that Katie Couric is going to be leaving the anchor chair and possibly starting, well, some new projects of her own, too.",
        "That's right.",
        "It's very clear from talking to people both at CBS and people close to Katie Couric she intends to be - find her way back to daytime television.",
        "After all, she was a big star as one of the lead faces and figures on the \"\"Today\"\" show on NBC News.",
        "And being an anchor, you know, was - burnished her credentials in some ways, but going back to syndicated television in the daytime, it's where real paychecks are - as though 15 million a year for being a news anchor isn't a real one.",
        "But there's a lot of money there, and it plays to her skills as an interviewer, too.",
        "And this is also, as another daytime TV personality - well, Glenn Beck was on at five.",
        "That's an evening TV - anyway, but..."

        "Well, Oprah, of course, was the queen of daytime talk, and her absence gives an opening for somebody like Katie Couric.",

        "That's a tough go.",
        "This is kind of her second effort to do that - this one, perhaps, a little bit more in earnest, as she's shut down her own, older talk show in the morning - or in the daytime.",
        "But, you know, this is going to be a little tougher than perhaps she anticipated, and I think people are watching to see if she can do it again.",

        "And it raises some of the same issues for her that Glenn Beck is going to have to face, too.",

        "He feels he is the star.",
        "He made himself.",
        "You know, he has a radio show that's nationally syndicated.",
        "But it's not clear whether he just captured a moment of anxiety about the country and also a backlash against President Obama, or he is an enduring figure and personality.",
        "I'd contrast that with Oprah Winfrey, who showed that beyond the niche audiences of cable news, that she had a broad audience that really could command a following with her book clubs and with her, you know, weeding into political waters with President Obama, as well, his campaign.",
        "You know, you do see her influence to a greater degree.",
        "It'll be interesting to see if Beck can continue that, and particularly outside of Fox News.",

        "Yeah.",
        "He's trying - he has become the - not only the face, but a senior news executive for Current Television, which as you recall, was supposed to be something of an alternative to commercial TV.",
        "The idea is that they get user-generated video, but they also have some of their own reporters doing some things that are, they say, in more documentary depth.",

        "And we've always thought that, you know, digital TV would change things.",
