        "There actually is no other effective method we know of defending the border.",

        "And for us, that's a no-brainer.",
        "You've said and American officials have also said that this was organized and orchestrated by Hamas.",

        "How do you respond to that?",

        "But if you see this protest and the Israeli response as a provocation by Hamas to make Israel look bad, do you think Israel made a mistake by playing into their hands and following through with what Hamas expected Israel to do and incurring the international condemnation that we now see?",
        "You know, it's a good question.",

        "This does seem like a cycle that repeats every few years where there are protests on the Gaza border; civilians die at the hands of the Israeli military; there is international condemnation.",
        "Is there a way that the Israeli government can help break this cycle?",
