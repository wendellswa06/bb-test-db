        "This was hammered out before anybody appeared in court on Monday.",
        "In fact, the chief prosecutor admitted yesterday he didn't even know that this plea agreement was underway.",

        "But essentially he also ran away from battle as well.",
        "Some of the strongest moments of the trial came when the prosecution in the sentencing part said, look, this man sitting before you is in a very nice suit right now, but do not forget that he's had training by al-Qaida.",

        "And we tried to get a demographically representative segment of the population so there's certainly a city bias but most Arabs do live in cities and we try to apply weights to be more representative of the population.",
        "And what'd they say about democracy?",
        "Well, first, I think it's--one of the most important findings really is that Arabs now look at America in large part through the prism of Iraq.",
        "I call it the new prism of pain.",
        "And it's a disturbing prism.",
        "Because when you think about how they see Iraq, when you ask them `Do you think Iraqis are better off or worse off?,' the vast majority in every single country think Iraqis are today worse off than they were before the war.",

        "When you ask them `What has been the consequence of the war on--for them?,' they say there's been less democracy since the war, less peace and more terrorism.",
        "Very disturbing picture.",
        "When you ask them `What do you think motivates the US in the Middle East?,' they mostly think it's controlling oil, helping Israel, dominating the region, and dividing the Muslim world and very few, minor, very small percentage believe it's the spreading of democracy.",
        "So it's not that they don't want democracy, they just don't have faith in America's intention.",

        "Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut made a speech this week and wrote and article in which he said the polls in Iraq had said that more people, I believe over 60 percent, thought their lives were improving, and would be better next year.",
        "Is that at odds with what you found?",
        "No, because I did not poll in Iraq, and I think it is a little bit harder to do it in Iraq, given what's happening there.",
        "And I wouldn't be surprised if many people in Iraq--in fact, do think they're better off.",
        "And the Shia, I think, many of them, feel they're better off, perhaps, most, and, I think, certainly, most of the Kurds.",

        "The real issue here really is what's the--how do people outside view it?",
        "Because we're thinking of Iraq as an inspiring model that is going to help change the region.",
        "That was the idea.",
        "And, clearly, it's not an inspiring model because the vast majority of the people in the Arab world outside Iraq see it as a negative, not a positive."
