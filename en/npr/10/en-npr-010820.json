        "When you ask them `Which countries would you want to be a superpower?,' they have France and they have Germany and they have China.",
        "Iraq is determining that, to a large extent--it's not the issue of democracy because when you ask them `Which countries do you think have most democracy and freedom for their people?,' all of the countries on that list are from the West, mostly from Europe, but also the US is there.",
        "So they have no illusions.",
