        "Russia has approximately 27 ocean-going icebreakers.",
        "Some of those are nuclear-powered and so we're not even in the same league as Russia right now.",
        "Back in 1991, a postdoc at the University of Utah made an astounding discovery.",
        "A super high-energy cosmic ray had entered the Earth's atmosphere high over the Utah sky.",
        "How high energy was the particle?",
        "Well, about 300 million times more energetic than ones that could be made in the world's most powerful particle accelerator.",
        "Scientists were stumped.",
        "They couldn't explain where the cosmic ray came from or how it was generated.",
        "To figure it out, they would need to find more particles like it.",
        "It was a very rare particle indeed.",
        "So in 1995, the Pierre Auger project was started.",
        "The project's observatory, which is an array of 1,600 particle detectors, 24 telescopes - well, that observatory was completed a few years ago, and since then, the project has detected 77 high-energy cosmic rays and scientists have come up with a good candidate for the source of these mysterious and rare particles.",
        "Joining me now to talk more about the findings or what they might tell us about the source of the rays is my guest Paul Mantsch.",
        "He's project manager for the Pierre Auger Collaboration.",
        "He joins us from the Observatory in Argentina.",
        "Thanks for being with us, Dr. Mantsch.",
        "Hi, I'm glad to be here.",
        "What is so unusual about these rays?",
        "Well, they're just enormously energetic.",
        "They're the most energetic particles ever recorded.",
        "And it's a mystery to know where they came from and that's why we spent the last 12 or so years down here in Pampa trying to build a detector, to get enough of them to find out where they come from.",
        "When you say enough of them why do you need so many of them?",
        "Well, because in order to find out something about this - well, first of all, you have to identify where the sources are.",
        "And they could be many sources.",
        "In fact, that's what we found, they seemed to be correlated with galaxies called AGN, in which there are black holes that are very violent and indeed are candidates for the sources."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But they may not AGNs, but what they seemed - that's where these particles seemed to point.",
        "And of course, the more of them you have, the more of these sources you can find.",
        "And you can look at the characteristics of those sources and may be find out something about - something about the physics that sends these things toward the Earth at such enormous energy.",
        "So, it's the real mystery.",
        "That's why we're here.",
        "So you then have - are these black holes then the best candidates for the high-energy particles?",
        "Yeah, well, they're one of the candidates.",
        "It turns out that, well, we know how to accelerate particles on Earth because we have accelerators that have multiple turns.",
        "You go round and round this ring until you build up enough energy.",
        "But these things are a hundred million times more energetic, so they have to have some kind of acceleration mechanism where we just don't understand right now.",
        "And that's what we're trying to get at.",
        "So you're looking at these galaxies that have black holes in their centers?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, it seems we made a correlation between the highest energy particles that we've measured and they seemed to correlate very well with AGNs and really - but it could be that there are some other unknown objects, but indeed the AGNs are good candidates because they have conditions, which might, you might be able to make a cosmic accelerator.",
        "That would be it in, we don't understand, it's a mystery.",
        "Do we know why they're so rare?",
        "Would that explain why they're so rare because you need a black hole to make one?",
        "Well, that's a possibility.",
        "But the fact is that these, these particles really aren't rare when you get to lower energies, okay.",
        "It's just -they are only rare of the higher energy.",
        "And that's what makes this thing so tough.",
        "It's as if, you - we get these particles coming at us above at a rate of one per square kilometer per century.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So the consequence, you have to have a huge detector, which, of course, we built.",
        "The one down here is about a thousand square - is an array of over about a thousand square miles."

        "Right.",
        "So then we can plot their energy spectrum and then we can tell something about the acceleration mechanism behind these things.",
