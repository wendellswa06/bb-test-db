        "Good place to - yeah, what's up with Twitter?",
        "Well, the issue that it really comes down to is they aren't transparent about everything they do.",
        "So what happened Tuesday night is, quote, unquote, \"\"quietly,\"\" they purged a lot of, quote, unquote, \"\"bot accounts.\"\" It's really unclear what exactly happened, but what people spoke out about is that thousands of people got locked out of their accounts, meaning they couldn't tweet anymore.",
        "And me, a user who wasn't affected, if I went to one of their pages, I would be warned that their account was temporarily locked, and I would have to click to actually see their tweets, which is, you know, just another hassle.",
        "But so the issue that Twitter required a certain subset of users to provide a phone number to verify that they're a real account - that's a total common practice across social networks to guarantee that, you know, it's people like you and me, actual humans behind accounts, versus...",
        "Because a bot can't provide a phone number.",
        "Exactly, yeah."

        "What is the company saying about that?",
        "Seemingly.",
        "And I think that's what's really telling is the statement that Twitter provided.",

        "This happened quietly Tuesday night.",
        "It wasn't until late Wednesday afternoon when they provided a statement that the first line was super telling.",
        "It said, Twitter's tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias.",
        "It's insane to me that they have to say that in the first sentence to really tell their users that they don't have bias.",
        "But the backlash has gotten so strong that really no one believes them anymore.",
        "They've been saying it again and again, but it's so common, especially for conservatives, to be like, no, you guys based in the Bay Area in San Francisco have a liberal bias.",
        "That's what they call out.",
        "At a minimum, it's a real image problem for Twitter, I mean, regardless of what exactly happened.",
        "Is this a - becoming more of a problem for them, that they're not transparent when they deal with these types of crises?",

        "Now, mental health of course comes up a lot after mass shootings, but how do you tackle that issue, and whose job is it?",

        "Good morning.",
        "So whose job is it to watch out for mental illness and, you know, try to keep schools safe?",

        "Most of the work we do at NaBITA is with college campuses and K-12 schools.",
        "We really encourage this to be an issue that's looked out from various facets.",
        "We're looking at this from a law enforcement lens, from a mental health lens, from a student conduct lens and from disability support.",
        "So we're really looking at this from multiple perspectives.",
        "So the idea that there's a singular answer to this question - gun control, mental health - I think is a little complicated.",
        "You said the community, though.",
        "Does that mean if I'm a parent of a student, I mean, I should be doing something to somehow watch out for for potential red flags and mental health problems in other students?",
        "I think the red flag part is right on and exactly accurate.",
        "I think it's beyond mental health red flags, though, that we know that people with mental health disorders are 5 to 6 times more likely to be the victim of a violent crime, never to be the one who's committing it.",
        "When we see these extreme events, almost like when an airplane crashes - we had that a few years back with a lot of airplane explosions and accidents - you know, people began to worry about air travel.",
        "And we also understand that driving to the airport's a lot more dangerous than actually getting on an airplane.",
        "So I think understanding this idea that when we hear these events that we have this visceral reaction to remove guns, to deal with this as a mental health issue, and we really need to look at this from a research-based, more scientific approach and understand what are the protective elements that we need to help our young folks with, and what are the risks elements that put them at a higher risk for committing this kind of violence.",
        "Help people grip onto something.",
        "I mean, what does the research, the science, suggest could have happened, say, differently in a case like the school shooting in Parkland this week?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think, again, shifting away from just simply looking at mental health diagnostics here - someone with schizophrenia, someone with Asperger's or autism spectrum disorder - and moving way closer to the risk elements.",
        "Individuals, for example, who have a sense of hopelessness and desperation and suicidality.",
        "It's a mental health issue in that those individuals are at a higher risk to move forward with these attacks.",
        "It's a gun issue in that every attacker who has this unfettered, easy access to lethal means can move more quickly to their goal.",
        "And I do think from a gun perspective, we can have freedom and access to guns in this country along with tighter controls.",
        "We've seen that in other countries, as well.",
        "I think about Nikolas Cruz, this young man who we're talking about.",
        "Of course, there's so much we don't know at this point.",
        "But there are already reports that there were neighbors and others who, in retrospect now, feel like they saw a very troubled, isolated young man.",
        "But there are a lot of young students who might be isolated who could you know, be sort of on their own.",
        "And you don't want to target or label people with something like that.",
        "So I mean, where do you find that balance?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's two concepts that we talk about in the field.",
        "One is threat assessment, and the other is threat management.",
        "The idea initially is when we get these reports coming in and these teams, these behavioral intervention teams at schools and colleges where we talk about the risk, that we get these reports from the community.",
        "We analyze the reports.",
        "We come up with a level of risk that we're concerned with.",
        "Then we move towards intervention.",
        "Those interventions, when they're best, are about connecting the student to resources and moving them off the pathway to violence and towards a pathway of social connection.",
        "The idea of simply punishing them, locking them up into an inpatient unit, you know, looking at arrests or, you know, taking them away from society just ends up pushing the problem somewhere else.",
        "It's like rolling the problem downhill to the next place, which is problematic."
