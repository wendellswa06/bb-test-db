        "I think there is a fierce battle is raging in Lebanon today, between what I call the American-led alliance - that is the ruling coalition to which Pierre Gemayel belongs - and the Iranian-Syrian front led by Hezbollah or the Party of God.",
        "And the murder of Gemayel is an extension of this deadly power-play between the two alliances, the American-led alliance and the Iranian-Syrian alliance in Lebanon.",
        "What do you hear as you travel in the Arab world and talk with other intellectuals these days, because the prospect of Iraq coming apart and Lebanon coming apart must be horrifying, but how do you stop it?",
        "Not only the Lebanese people are terrified, people I talk to everywhere - in Jordan, in Lebanon and Egypt, in Yemen - people feel that the entire regional landscape is being fragmented and splintered along sectarian lines.",
        "In fact, I would argue that the Sunni-Shiite divide in Lebanon is as powerful and as dangerous as the Sunni-Shiite divide in Iraq.",
        "The sense that things are heading for collision, things are going very badly - what can we do to take control of this situation and to draw back from disaster?",
        "No one can prevent the plunge to disaster in Lebanon except the Lebanese people themselves.",
        "Unless the Lebanese people take responsibility and unless the international community - particularly Arab states - come to the help of the Lebanon people, I believe that Lebanon today stands on the brink of another major disaster.",
        "And I do hope that the Lebanonese people who belong to various ideological and religious backgrounds, basically step up to the challenge and prevent this particular plunge to the brink of abyss.",

        "That's hardly a public consensus.",
        "And while this has been a dramatic change over the last decade, it's only a percentage point or two more every year because these younger generations are more supportive.",
        "This won't be a public consensus at that rate for a long time if that trend continues.",
        "But what about the 70 percent among millennials who do support same-sex marriage?"
