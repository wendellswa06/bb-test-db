        "David, have Republicans now market-tested their slogan for November: a noun, a verb and Obamacare?",
        "Yep.",
        "This was an excellent win for Republicans.",
        "Stu Rothenberg, the election guru in January, said this was a must-win for Democrats.",
        "They had a good candidate, a big chunk of money, sort of a marginal district, but maybe leaning a little Democratic and so they were expected to win.",
        "The fact that Jolly was a former lobbyist, not an especially popular profession in most elections these days, the fact that he could win just by mentioning Obamacare over and over was a good sign."

        "Two, the second thing is Obama himself is unpopular and third, there was a sign that the Republicans who'd been really trailing in some of the technocrat technique of getting the voters out have improved their machinery.",
        "E.J., are Democrats dispirited and are they running away from Obamacare?",
        "Well, people always read too much into special elections and that's exactly what I'm going to do right here because I agree that this was a real defeat for Democrats and that they had better learn from it.",
        "I think turnout is a big issue.",
        "This was very low turnout, even compared to the 2010 midterms.",
        "Conservative Republicans are eager to slap the president in the face and Democrats have to figure out how to turn their people on.",
        "I have a slight difference on Obamacare.",
        "Clearly the Republicans think that repeating Obamacare over and over is enough.",
        "In fact, there's evidence that Alex Sink, the Democrat, fought the Republicans to a kind of draw on this issue and there are other issues out there that won them the race.",
        "Even Karl Rove thought this.",
        "But I think rather than run away from it, they need a robust defense of Obamacare.",
        "They need to embrace it because all of the advertising and all of the dialogue is so negative, that it creates a drag going into a race and requires all this pushback.",
        "So Democrats had better - should have won this and they're going to have to do better than this if they're going to do well in the fall.",
        "If that's the case, David, it sounds like the battle is joined for the fall.",
        "It's Obamacare.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And Obamacare is two things.",
        "First, it is the actual policy, but second, it's a stand-in for big government.",
        "And so I think it's more a metaphor for big government liberalism than anything else and that's why Republicans are stressing it.",
        "Having gone to quite a few open houses over the course of 2005, they were literally insane.",

        "Senator Feinstein is often a often a defender of the agency, but not in her speech Tuesday on the Senate floor.",
        "I have grave concerns that the CIA's search may well have violated the separation of powers, principals embodied in the United States Constitution."

        "There were leaks in the paper saying, well, actually, the Senate staffers had gotten hold of this material improperly and she was furious about that because she said, no, that's not true.",
        "In fact, the CIA went into a computer that was reserved for the Senate to take of this information and you cannot - spy agencies have to keep secrets.",
