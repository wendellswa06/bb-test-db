        "So I was a little concerned after Katrina and everything else, and it made me put my place on the market as soon as possible.",
        "And frankly, I thought at the time, well, I'll have a couple of offers the first week, and the place will be in contract by October.",
        "So at this point, it's now obviously well into October, and I haven't even gotten one offer yet, so I obviously was very disappointed about that.",
        "For now, Chen's real estate agent says not to lower the price.",
        "He basically has said to me, `Well, this is something that a lot of people are experiencing.",
        "So I feel that the price is not the problem for my particular apartment yet, but sure, if it gets to be December and I still haven't had an offer, would I lower the price at that point?",
        "You'd better belive I will.",
        "Audrey Edwards is a licensed real estate agent who runs Plaza Properties in Brooklyn, New York.",
        "She thinks the market is strong, but sellers need to temper expectations.",
        "...had not gotten one offer in a month in this market, I would know that I had done something wrong.",
        "I had either priced it incorrectly, I had not spruced it up the way it needed to be spruced up.",
        "Clearly, one of those two things would be operating.",
        "In fact, according to one study, the average sales price of Manhattan apartments has fallen 13 percent in the past three months.",
        "But seller's woes are not limited to New York.",
        "Barbara Goodspeed is an interior designer in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",
        "When she got married, she bought a new house with her husband, but it took her months to sell her previous home at a price lower than the one she expected.",
        "Occasionally, there would be people even stopping by, telling me, `If you ever decide to sell your house, you have to let me know.",
        "It's just a perfect starter home and in really good condition, and then when I went to put it on the market, I thought, oh, there'll be no problem to sell it and did not get an offer.",
        "Finally, after four months, I did list it with a realtor, and after being on the market for about a month, an offer was presented, but it was extremely low and, you know, after many negotiations, I finally did sell it.",
        "Still, Edwards says that purchasing a home shouldn't be scary."

        "And what does that say to the effort to try to gain a bigger black base for the GOP?",
        "Well, I think it says what we've been saying all along, Ed, and that is we have our work cut out for us, as we always have and we will.",

        "I think that, of course, it gives us pause, but it also encourages us to move forward and to continue on the path that we've gone.",
        "Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman has been across the country, as you know, in communities where we haven't been before.",
