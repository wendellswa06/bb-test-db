        "The bigger you are and the more threat you pose to the system as a whole, then the higher capital requirements you ought to be - you ought to have to hold.",
        "Community banks like that idea because the biggest banks have always had a competitive advantage over them.",
        "Investors assumed that the government wouldn't ever allow the biggest banks to fail.",
        "So these huge banks could borrow money more cheaply and have an easier time attracting large deposits.",
        "So by creating tougher standards for the biggest banks, that would take away some of their advantage.",

        "He spoke about this with NPR yesterday.",
        "Yeah, 561 is a lot of arrests.",

        "Crossroads GPS president Steven Law says the group is in for the long haul, not just the election, and it's out to change policies in Washington.",
        "But you can't achieve that merely by producing the TV equivalent of a policy white paper.",
        "You need to reach viewers viscerally, and so we spend a lot of time figuring out how to explain issues in ways that get viewers to be persuaded, and also to get fired up to take action.",
        "Crossroads GPS has been one of the most prominent political advertisers this spring.",
        "It's run ads attacking President Obama on a wide range of issues.",
        "The donors who finance those ads get to stay anonymous.",
        "That's a big advantage for Crossroads GPS and other social welfare organizations or 501(c)(4) groups, as they're known in the tax code."

        "But it still matters which side of the line a group is playing on.",
        "And here's a new paradox about that: a federal judge recently ruled that for certain types of issue ads, 501(c)(4)s have to name the donors.",
        "The ruling hasn't taken effect yet.",
        "But for now, some groups are switching to express advocacy ads.",

        "We don't know how many ads the (c)(4) could run before it would jeopardize its (c)(4) status.",
        "And without 501(c)(4) status, an organization would lose the thing that gives it so much political clout, the ability to take anonymous contributions.",

        "As you say, for decades now it's been kind of addicted to cheap foreign workers.",
        "And they can afford to do that because they're obviously the biggest oil exporter.",
        "But the flipside of that is that their private sector has not grown at all.",
        "Their private sector employs only maybe one-out-of-10 Saudis and the government is still dependent on oil for something like 90 percent of its budget revenues.",
        "And long-term that's not sustainable because Saudi Arabia has a growing young population, one of the largest percentages of young people in the world.",
        "And there's millions of them, Saudis, coming in the job market looking for jobs and there's not private sector jobs for them.",
        "And there's not any more room left for people on the government payrolls.",
        "But aren't the people whom they're cracking down on doing jobs of a kind that Saudis might not be interested in?"

        "But on the other hand, there's also a lot of very inexpensive foreign workers working as teachers in the schools, and working in shops, and working in jobs that Saudis maybe would take if they were able to get more pay for them but because there are so many millions of these inexpensive foreign workers, the wages have been depressed throughout the economy.",

        "There was stone throwing and clubs, you know, and it was just a melee in which foreign workers joined in, ordinary Saudis joined in, and security forces were there too in a capital where you never see any kind of public disturbance that's very highly policed.",
        "All of a sudden you had throngs moving through the streets and people being injured.",
        "I think there was one Saudi and one or two foreign workers who were killed that night, and something like dozens injured in 561 arrested.",
        "Well, it would appear so.",
        "It doesn't bode well, but, you know, for--I mean, first thing, I think, that we need to think about is that you can't put 100 percent of your faith in polls.",
        "The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll only included 89 blacks out of about 700 or 800 people that they polled.",
