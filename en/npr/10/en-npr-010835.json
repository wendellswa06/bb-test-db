        "Can I--let me just add something to that, because you're right, Ed.",
        "There are--there is a very--there is a minority of people in the Republican Party who are saying, `You know, we're not going to get the African-American vote.",
        "Let's forget it.",
        "But those people also said that about the Hispanic vote and...",
        "That's right.",
        "...Hispanics overwhelmingly voted for this administration during the last election.",
        "You know, I want to point out in January I was invited to appear--to attend a meeting that the president held with African-American leaders at the White House.",
        "That meeting was overwhelmingly bipartisan.",
        "There were black Republicans there.",
        "There were black Democrats there.",
        "A lot of these people were members of the clergy.",
        "And the Democrats, as well as the Republicans, present at the White House were overwhelmingly supportive of the Republican Party and of this president because of the president's views on certain social issues that are important to African-Americans.",
        "Katrina, no--undoubtedly has done a lot of harm to the GOP.",
        "However, when you look at African-Americans in general, we tend to be people who are conservative on a lot of social issues, and I think it's significant that in the last election the president's approval rating with African-Americans went from 8 percent to, I've been told, anywhere between 10 percent and 16 percent.",
        "And that's a pretty dramatic shift for a population that for many, many years has voted overwhelmingly Democratic.",
        "But Michelle, let's be fair about the characterization of that audience.",
        "I don't know that I would agree with you when you say that it was overwhelmingly even in terms of Democrats and Republicans.",
        "Well, I was there, so I know that it was.",
        "I would actually say that it was probably--there were probably more Democrats in the room than Republicans, simply because we know most African-Americans tend to be registered as Democrats and tend to vote as Democrats, but we didn't see that happen in this last election, and, you know...",
        "Well, I can't say that I was there, Michelle, but I will still take issue with you on the bipartisanship.",
        "We won't argue about that today.",
        "Well, let...",
        "...because we had many of the people who were, in fact, in that meeting on the program following that.",
        "But the point is that the president, to some degree, has reached out to a concentrated number of African-American leaders.",
        "But by and large, Tara, you know this to be a fact, the mainstream black leadership--I think leaders who most people would identify as `the black leadership'--have had at best a tenuous relationship with this administration.",
        "Well, part of that is because...",
        "Let's start with that, OK?",
        "But let me just say this.",
        "The president's message and the president's policies and Republican policies are a message I--that resonate with all Americans, including African-Americans.",
        "It's a message that we take everywhere.",
        "It's a message that Chairman Mehlman will take, not only when he's doing outreach, but when he's going to Iowa and all-white audiences, Republican audiences.",
        "This message of outreach he takes wherever he goes.",
        "It is not a one-time thing.",
        "This is something that this party is committed to, this president is committed to and we will see--we are seeing incremental gains.",
        "Yes, slow, but incremental."

        "And let me talk to you a little bit about that number, that eight--everyone wants to talk about the percentage: a 3 percent increase among African-Americans nationally.",
        "We're not even--I'm not even going to get into the double digits in some of our battleground states where he got--gained support.",
        "But overall, the individual number of African-Americans that voted for this president actually increased 70 percent from 2000.",
        "Because you had 864,000 African-Americans vote for him in 2000; 1.6 million in 2004.",
        "That's a 70 percent increase of the number of individual African-Americans that went to the polls and pressed the lever for President Bush.",
        "We still have a long way to go, yes, Ed, and we are still ready to ch--step up to that challenge.",
        "But I will challenge folks to say that we are not stopping because we have a few setbacks.",
        "The Democrats know that they have taken the black vote for granted.",

        "We have gotten nothing but praise from both sides when we go on these outreach efforts and events.",

        "We need to start doing this.",

        "We may not always agree, but there is common ground there, and I think African-Americans...",

        "...deserve to hear both sides.",
        "All right.",

        "Why has it been such a hard sell, in your opinion?",
        "A hard sell to African-Americans to become Republicans?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, you know, African-Americans we--I don't even want to just say African-Americans.",
        "It is human nature to align yourself with people you feel comfortable with and who you believe are comfortable with you.",
        "And there was an historic change in the Republican Party early on.",
        "A lot of African-Americans, like Frederick Douglass, were Republicans.",
        "There was a shift in the party.",
        "The Southern strategy, for example, that was, you know, undoubtedly biased against African-Americans--there's still a taint from that, and the party needs to regain the trust of African-Americans.",
        "What's interesting, though, is that we are seeing, some analysts believe, a generational shift in attitudes and you're seeing more people 50 and younger who are African-American who are showing some sort of a bias towards the Republican Party, or at least towards becoming Independents, and who are willing to listen to both sides of the story.",
        "You know, African-Americans--a lot of African-Americans are pro-affirmative action and the Republican Party tends to be against affirmative action.",
        "So you will have African-Americans who stick with the Democratic Party for that reason.",
        "Yeah."
