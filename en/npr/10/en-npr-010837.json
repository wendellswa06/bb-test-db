        "No, I don't think it's the worst case, although some people here at CDC thinks it might be an overstatement.",

        "Although I am sitting in the basement of the CDC here - I am not speaking for the CDC, so I'm not going to give you government soundbites.",
        "But I think what I can say is that there's a pretty good Web site called flu.gov that will have a whole lot of information that make you sound a lot - you know, as knowledgeable as you want to be, really, about what they know.",
        "And it'll have some specific guidance and advice about this.",
        "But in general, it's really very simple.",
        "I mean, you really should encourage students to - if they feel sick, don't come in.",
