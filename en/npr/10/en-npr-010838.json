        "And has it been known for years that there's something underneath it?",
        "It had been suspected.",
        "Actually, the painting had been x-rayed in 1997 by paintings conservators here at the Winterthur Museum and the University of Delaware.",
        "And so when they did a conventional x-ray, what they saw underneath was a black-and-white image of two men engaged in a fistfight, a very dynamic image.",
        "And when they worked with curators at the Brandywine River Museum, who owns the painting, they were able to identify it as a 1919 illustration that NC Wyeth had done for a magazine called Everybody's Magazine that was thought to have been lost since the 1920s, but, in fact, it wasn't lost at all.",
        "It was just buried beneath this family portrait.",
        "Wow.",
        "So with the techniques that had been used, you could tell something was there and you could see what it was, but you couldn't bring out any of the colors or any of the depth of the painting.",
        "Exactly.",
        "When you do conventional x-radiography, you get a black-and-white image of the buried painting.",
        "And it's really only a partial image, because you're imaging the positions of the piatomic number of pigments, like the lead of mercury-based pigments, because they absorb x-rays so strongly in the same way as when you go to the dentist and you wear a lead apron.",
        "The lead apron absorbs the x-rays strongly."

        "And what did that do for you?",
        "Well, the way that the technique works is that we're going to be using a very high intensity x-ray beam.",
        "And so this is going to be an x-ray beam generated by a synchrotron.",

        "Yeah, it had a lot to do that.",
        "I spent 15 years with an organization called Population Action International, and was lucky enough to travel a lot around the world, particularly in the developing world with that, and that's where I gathered quite a few of the stories that make up the book.",

        "And it's in the news right now, but it's also pretty sensitive and controversial, which is population growth and its impacts on environmental risk and other problems that people face (unintelligible).",
        "And the premise is basically this - it was something I heard from a woman whom I eventually came to work with at PAI, the organization I worked in so many years - that if women were actually able to decide for themselves not just what size family they wanted, but really, at any given moment in their reproductive careers, do I want to get pregnant now?",
        "Or would I rather not be pregnant now, wait another time, or not ever get pregnant ever?",
        "And could actualize their decisions free of pressure from husbands, mothers-in-law, churches, whatever, that world population problems would pretty much resolve themselves in an environmentally sustainable way, and they'd take care of themselves.",

        "They - because of various innovations that really belonged pretty much more securely to women than to men, particularly around the birth process itself, we can say pretty confident that if women hadn't been as strategic and successful at giving birth and raising children to adulthood as they had been, the human species would have went the way of most of the other hominid species, and in fact, most other animal species in the world, and would've eventually gone extinct.",

        "This is no small feat and one of the things I looked into it was, so how exactly did women do this in history?",
        "And why were Homo sapiens women so good at it, our mothers and grandmothers?",
        "Right.",
        "And midwives tend to turn - to have a pretty important part in this story, don't they?",
        "Well, this is a really interesting thing, and I really feel that very little attention has been given to the relationship between mothers and midwives.",
        "It was a revolution in animal behavior.",
        "Most animals give birth alone, and humans, for various reasons that are little complicated to demonstrate on the radio, need help.",
        "It's very dangerous to give birth when you walk on two feet because of the way your pelvis is shaped, quite literally.",
        "You need help, and very, very early on we can say through logic and deduction more than fossil evidence, we don't have midwife fossils particularly, but we can figure, and people have worked this out pretty interestingly and well, that women had to get help from probably other women in giving birth, and that assisted birth itself was a tremendous spirit to language to communication and to a whole way of raising children that was cooperative.",
        "It involved probably not just a mother but a number of adults - the father, too, I might add - but probably especially grandmothers and cooperating women to bring children to adulthood.",
        "Now, to get back to your question about population growth, the other side of this question that's interesting is that it's not hard to document that, throughout human history or for certainly quite a long time, women have also been interested in the other side of this.",
        "It's very important to have enough children survive, as Margaret Mead pointed out long ago.",
        "It becomes difficult if too many consistently do, because then suddenly your population grows rapidly, and you run a little short on resources.",
        "And women tended to be acutely aware of that, and the evidence is very strong, and the documentation, even, historically as strong, that for a very long time they have sought to find methods and substances that could help them be sexually active but only become pregnant when they wanted to do so.",
        "And they've been frustrated by that, in some cases, by men, for interesting reasons that relate to our social development over the years.",
        "And that frustration is probably one of the major reasons that populations have grown as much as they have over the years.",
