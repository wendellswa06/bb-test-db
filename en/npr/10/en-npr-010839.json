        "And we were talking about not only getting - having more babies, but also figuring out ways to have fewer babies.",
        "And I was surprised to read in your book about how early there were, at least reportedly, herbal contraceptives and things like that.",
        "Do you have any idea?",
        "Well, tell me about them.",
        "Do you think any of them were actually effective?",
        "Well, about as early as there is writing, there's mention of the idea of contraception.",
        "Egyptian hieroglyphics talk about using crocodile dung.",
        "I'm not quite sure how or how effective that would be.",
        "And there's varying opinions about this, Richard.",
        "There's so many - or some views that said, well, these were some kind of herbs you ate.",
        "It was pretty hard to invent the oral contraceptive pill and took a lot of testing and a lot of work.",
        "It'd be pretty surprising if you could just eat a piece of fruit and it would be as effective as the pill.",
        "And I think that's a point well taken.",
        "These were not what - you know, I say in the book, don't try these at home, readers.",
        "But interestingly, they have been studied by historical pharmacologists, and many of the herbs particularly that are mentioned in, for example classical Greek literature, pomegranates feature and the Myth of Persephone, for example, and Demeter, have been found to have this interesting hormonal estrogenic - or mimic estrogenic kinds of qualities, and that leads some pharmacologists to think they might have had some effect.",
        "And the interesting thing is, from your own personal perspective, you wouldn't want something that might have some effect.",
        "But from a demographic perspective, if people were using these in widespread ways, you don't have to bend down the arc of fertility very much to actually have a big impact over time on demographic change.",
        "I suppose if enough women are taking them...",
        "That's right.",
        "And by some theories in some populations, Europe, for example, in the Middle Ages, they may have been quite widely used.",
        "There are also other things that can be effective if they are used, withdrawal, for example, which you get a nice lesson about by reading Genesis.",
        "And withdrawal can be relatively effective if it's used consistently.",
        "It's not a woman-controlled method.",
        "That's kind of a problem.",
        "But under certain circumstances, it can be and probably has been used to reduce unwanted pregnancies in the past.",
        "Yeah.",
        "One theme of your book seems to be that men want more kids and women want fewer kids.",
        "Is there an explanation for that?",
        "Hello there.",
        "My assertion would be that not only must women have control of their reproductive rights, but they must have a certain degree of education in order to exercise that control.",
        "Absolutely."

        "Yeah.",

        "But yeah, men and women are different in the way they have children.",
        "This is the one way that I think we can all agree, that men and women are generally, without any controversy, different.",
        "Women give birth to all babies, at least last time I checked the data, and men have a lot to do with that, but they don't give birth.",
        "They have a bit of different interest about it and it's evolved to actually bifurcate, to some degree, in that probably in early days men shared many of women's interests in not having too many children in the tribe or the clan of the family for environmental reasons.",
        "But as societies developed, men began to realize the - recognized the importance of having lots of soldiers, lots of people to build pyramids, lots of farmers for food surpluses, while women were continuing to think, is it safe for me to have a child?",
        "Will it be safe for my child?",
        "Will my child grow up and become an adult and have children of her own?",
        "So there's this different view that's quite born out in the anthropological and sociological literature as well.",

        "Let's go to the phone.",
        "Let's hear from Vincent, Rockford, Illinois.",
        "Welcome to the Talk of the Nation.",
        "Yes.",
        "This has been sort of a frightening subject for me ever since reading Paul Ehrlich's \"\"Population Bomb\"\" about 1970, and I'm just wondering if we're past the point where certain resources - I mean, oil is all over the news these days, but you know, fresh water and other such resources for growing food, are we past the point of being able to support ourselves even if the population birth rate were to drop to zero at this point?",
        "Hm.",
        "Well, let's hope it's not going to drop to zero.",
        "And it's a good question.",
        "I think it's fundamentally unanswerable, Vince.",
        "My sense about it is - I guess the best answer I can give you is that, yeah, it's possible.",
        "We may be.",
        "We don't really know.",
        "The book comes out at a pretty good time because of the concern about rising food prices, rising energy prices, not a good time in the sense that I'm happy about that, obviously but these issues are getting more attention.",
        "I chose in part because of the attention Ehrlich got for his book, and there's sort of a history writing about population, not to dwell on, is it too late?",
        "Are we past the point of no return with human population?",
        "But the focus, again, looking at a long term, on the fact that we have had population pressures in the past, we are very innovative as a species, we often find ways to address them, we have a good record of survival for the 200,000 years that Richard mentioned.",
        "So I prefer to be optimistic and look at the idea that if women are able to make decisions about their own childbearing, hopefully with their partners, but if not with their partners, on their own, that we can - and if we do all the other right things, we clearly have to do a lot that doesn't have anything to do with population, saving energy and being more penurious about our use of resources and being fairer with poor people, and people who don't consume as much as wealthy people.",
        "All of these things have to be done in concert, and then, I'm hopeful that we'll find out we haven't overshot.",
        "But we're in a pretty dangerous zone right now, I would agree with that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I guess one of the issues is that people think this personally about, how many kids I want?",
        "And one kid is not going to make a difference to whether the world runs out of resources or not.",
        "So it's a difficult juxtaposition about - of personal views versus global views.",
        "And I think you saw that replicated also in the debate about population, as you mentioned, in - up until about the early '90s, everyone was concerned about world population and then the discussion very much shifted to personal issues, and hasn't really come back full circle, I would guess, to the question about, what do these numbers all add in up to?",
        "Yeah, and there is a real strong sense, and I think it's understandable and in many ways justifiable, that people shouldn't be telling other people how to make these decisions for themselves.",
        "There's a great discomfort with that.",
        "And one of the most encouraging things I discovered in researching this is that there's a kind of invisible hand that relates to personal wellbeing and connects at the collective in species-wide wellbeing."

        "The Mexico City Policy is a policy that Republican presidents and not Democratic presidents since 1984, have had an effect that U.S.",
        "foreign assistance for family planning and reproductive planning, and reproductive health care generally, can never be given to any organization, any nongovernmental organization, at least, that ever mentions the word \"\"abortion,\"\" even if in distant response to a woman's question about abortion, and whether it is legal in her country or whatever, and certainly not if they offer abortions.",
        "And it's had the effect of limiting U.S.",
        "assistance to some of the better, more comprehensive reproductive health organizations around the world, groups like Planned Parenthood or Marie Stopes International out of Britain.",
        "And I don't think that there's a way to draw a direct connection to how much environmental damage it may have caused, or even how much - where fertility is because of it, but it's very clear to people who work in the field that it is much harder to provide good services to women who are asking for them as a result of this restriction.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is the biggest single donor in this field, and when it tells half to two-thirds of the talented people that work in this area, we can't help you because you occasionally mentioned the word abortion, obviously the care that real women receive goes way down, and PAI, the organization I used to work for, documented numerous clinics that had to shutter their doors.",
        "Some were offering HIV prevention and treatment, had to close their doors because of this policy.",

        "That appeared to be a method of population control.",
        "Yeah, infanticide is interesting, and obviously sad, and one of the main points about infanticide, which has been a method of - a kind of fertility control or a way for women to avoid the commitment to being a parent, is that even aside from the attachment you might have in giving birth and have to break when you cause your child to lose its life, it's a horrific, bad investment in reproduction.",
        "You have to go through all the dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, which have been historically and still are quite dangerous to very many women around the world.",
        "You obviously wouldn't do it if you had the choice of safe and effective contraception.",

        "And I'm just wondering if you could comment on the relationship between our finding in animals that, when the population tends to be limited, the quality of life for all of the animals that are brought into the world tends to go up, and that the fewer surplus animals there are due to unplanned birth, the better quality of life the animals that are brought into the world tend to enjoy.",

        "Now, relative to your direct point, I would want to be very careful about talking about - using the word \"\"surplus\"\" when we discuss humanity.",
        "It's not a word that I'm very comfortable with in talking about people, can be perhaps used in discussing animals.",
        "But a point that I would make about our pets and our livestock is that these animals, much as we love them and are grateful for them, and my wife and I really loved our cat, are now getting in an unbalanced situation because of the large numbers of humans in the world, and naturally outnumber wild animals by very large ratios, which I discuss in the book."
