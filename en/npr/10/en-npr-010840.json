        "And that's' about the size of a human hair.",
        "And so that lets us be very selective about the spot on the painting that we're analyzing.",
        "So, basically, what we're doing is we're shining this incredibly tiny x-ray beam on the painting.",
        "And at this point, we're doing what's known as regular or conventional x-ray fluorescence, which is something that museum scientists do in their laboratories all the time.",
        "And what this means is that when this tiny x-ray beam hits the painting, all of the atoms in the paint layers that are hit by this tiny x-ray beam are going to emit or fluoresce their own x-rays.",
        "And so every type of atom fluoresces x-rays of characteristic energy.",
        "And so, for example, for chromium, which we see in green pigments, and cadmium that we see in yellow pigments, they're going to emit x-rays at different energies, allowing us to distinguish them from each other.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So then, do you run the x-ray machine over the whole painting?",
        "We do, actually.",
        "And essentially, at this point, what we've done with the conventional x-ray florescence, as we scan it over the surface of the painting, what we're doing is collecting x-rays from the buried painting simultaneously with the painting on the surface.",
        "And so that makes it very difficult to determine which pigments belong to the surface painting versus which pigments belong to the buried painting.",
        "And so then we have to add in the confocal technique.",
        "And what's different about the confocal technique is that we have an additional x-ray focusing device on the x-ray detector so that we're only collecting x-rays at a single focal point.",
        "We can move this focal point through the paint layers, and that allows us to determine the pigment composition of the surface painting and the buried painting sequentially.",
        "Or to put it in other way, it allows us to isolate the pigments that are in the buried painting.",
        "So you can find different layers of pigments…",

        "Exactly.",
        "And we can actually move our tiny focal point horizontally and vertically across the painting, as well, to generate a three-dimensional image of the paint layers.",
        "And so that shows up on your computer screen some place as a new painting.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Well, what we wind up getting is a three-dimensional map of the elemental composition of the paint layers.",
        "And then we can use this map in order to generate a full-color image of the buried painting.",
        "And so, for example, whenever we see titanium, we know that's a white pigment.",
        "And when we see cobalt, we know that that's a blue pigment.",

        "And Andrew Wyeth told us that his father used to instruct him to turn his paintings upside down and then paint over them so that he could be inspired by the abstract shapes of the former composition as he made the new composition."
