        "They do reflect a stereotype, as you described.",
        "And one of the things I've tried to point out in my work is that the stereotype is accurate in so far as it describes a certain model, and most of all, a set of constraints that were clearly present on '50s men - emotional constraints about what they could and couldn't express.",

        "They may, themselves, have for a period at the beginning thought that it really genuinely did work because of a psychological phenomenon called the Ideomotor effect, which is the same principle that convinces people that ouija boards work, apparently, which is that in response to suggestion or expectation, you can make tiny muscular movements entirely involuntary that can cause something that's free swinging or moving to move from side to side in the direction of something that if you were using a divining rod you're looking for.",

        "And then he rebadged the devices, because originally they said gofer golf ball finder, with the logo of his company.",
        "And then the devices, which he paid around $19 for mail order, he would sell for $3,000 each.",
        "Now I gather in the trial of McCormick, the challenge to prosecutors - this was in Britain - was that to convict him of fraud you had to show not just that this device didn't do anything but that they knew it didn't do anything and were selling it despite that fact.",
        "That's right.",
        "Because the original manufacturers of the similar device that this all started with in the mid-'90s ended up begin acquitted because they were brought to trial by the Department of Justice in 1996 and subjected to a jury trial in which the prosecution fielded a wide array of expert witnesses that showed that this was nonscientific junk.",
        "But the jury, apparently, were not convinced that the guys who were selling these things really knew that however ridiculous it seemed, what they were selling did not work."
