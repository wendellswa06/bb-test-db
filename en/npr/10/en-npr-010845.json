        "You had people in Lockerbie telling our BBC correspondents there during the course of the day that they felt that this was the right decision as well.",
        "And that they sided with Kenny MacAskill in his definition of there should be justice tempered by compassion.",
        "And then, you had a very different reception from here in the United States, from the families of course, but also from the administration, who were, you know, quite simply furious with this decision.",
        "So, you know, you had these - very different voices and it struck me that it was interesting.",
        "Is compassionate release routine in Scotland?",
        "Well in the last 10 years since the Scottish parliament has being devolved there have been 31 applications for release on compassionate grounds, 24 of them have been freed and the seven that weren't freed, it was because the Scottish prison system didn't think that there was medical evidence that they had terminal illnesses.",
        "So it is, yeah, clearly of those you have applied for it on medical grounds with terminal illnesses and the terminal illnesses have been proved, then they've got out.",
        "And we will talking later about the system here in the United States, which is considerably less forgiving particularly for men and women convicted of violent acts.",
        "And that's one of the things you keep hearing from the parents of the Americans who were killed, at least many of them, in the Lockerbie bombing.",
        "And that - well, they draw the analogy, would we release Osama Bin Laden?",
        "Right and I think, you know, I can quite understand the outrage here.",
        "And I was wondering, I mean, in a sense what surprised me most was the lack of outrage in some respects, from the British relatives.",
        "And particularly the most outspoken relatives, who were interviewed by the BBC, this father, as I said who was saying that they felt that al-Megrahi should be released.",
        "That they felt that, you know, we were losing our moral standing, as one of them had put it.",
        "You know, if we didn't show compassion, that this was, as some of the people in Lockerbie were saying, that they didn't feel that this was such a black and white issue.",
        "That they were shades of grey and that they did feel that if the West was to hold itself up as a moral example to the rest of the world, then we ought to be able to show compassion even to those who had not shown compassion to us.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And you, I mean - you would have thought that these were people who might have similar reactions to their American counterparts.",
        "And yet the reaction was very different.",
        "And I wondered, you know, if it was not partly that Europeans have a slightly different attitude to terrorism in general.",
        "We've lived with it for longer.",
        "Obviously in Britain, you know, we've had the Northern Ireland issue for decades, the Spanish have (unintelligible), there have been the Red Brigades, that we have had terrorism in our soil, in our countries, with us for much longer.",
        "And I wonder if there is not some of that they played out as well, whereas the Lockerbie was such a defining, changing event for the United States.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "Oh, wait.",

        "George, are you there?",
        "George, can you hear me?",
        "Evidently, George is not listening.",
        "And let me ask you, Katty Kay, a point that we'd actually hoped that George would make, and that was, in fact, there is more to this than simply, at least some people argue, the release on grounds of compassion."

        "There was the celebrations in Tripoli, which were an embarrassment to the British government, which thought this would be a low-key matter.",
        "And the revelation that, in fact, at least the Libyans said, this came up every time they were negotiating trade relations with Britain, including oil leases of substantial amounts.",
        "I think there is an awful lot more going on here.",
        "I mean, first as you mentioned, there's the release.",
        "And the Scottish government said that it was reassured that there would be no hero's welcome, that that was part of the deal and that - when they were negotiating over al-Megrahi's release, they were told that he wouldn't be welcomed back as a hero.",
        "Obviously, he was.",
        "It's caused a huge amount of embarrassment, I think, for Scotland, this.",
        "I mean, those pictures of Megrahi coming down the steps and the Scottish flag waving alongside the Libyan flag has been something that the Scots have found very embarrassing and the British government, too, in London has found embarrassing, has not been happy with.",
        "And I think that, you know, you always have to think in these deliberations that there is also a lot going on, I think, in terms of - I mean, trade you mentioned but also the domestic politics between London and Scotland, that Scotland does not a foreign policy and yet was landed with this decision, which was an incredibly sensitive one in terms of foreign policy implications.",
        "And so you had this, the parliament in Scotland, the justice secretary in Scotland, making a decision with huge ramifications around the world for a government that doesn't have its own foreign policy decisions.",
        "You know, we've got - this has become embroiled in domestic British politics, as well.",
        "And I think on the trade issue, the fact that Prince Andrew has canceled the visit to Libya now shows how sensitive the British government, and not just the Scottish government but the British government, is about the implications of this release.",
        "In the '80s, before Lockerbie, there was also an example of a British constable, a young woman was shot and killed outside of the People's Bureau, as it was styled, of the Libyan government in London, a case where those - the men alleged to have fired those shots were also allowed release, that on diplomatic grounds.",
        "Yes, I mean, you know, I think that - isn't that another example of what the people of Lockerbie, I guess, were saying to us on Thursday, that these issues are grayer, perhaps, in Europe.",
        "And I don't know whether it's a cultural difference, a legal difference.",
        "You mentioned an economic difference, a political difference, or all of those factors together where the fact that we have a history in Europe of different countries in different ways of negotiating with terrorist organizations.",
        "The Spanish government has talked to ETA.",
        "The British government talked to the IRA and to Sinn Fein.",
        "And maybe we have a higher tolerance threshold.",
        "I'm not sure if that's the case, but I felt some of that on Thursday, that there was this different cultural attitude towards terrorism.",
        "Stay with us, if you would, Katty Kay, of the BBC World News America.",

        "As we think about this economic crisis, what about electricity?",
        "What about fuel?",
        "Well, I think the debate that you're hearing in Edinburgh, I would put, you know, some of that as down to politics, that obviously you've got the Scottish National Party, which Kenny MacAskill belongs to, which was being attacked by both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.",
        "And this again gets caught up in Scottish domestic politics, which where there is a push for a referendum on more independence.",

        "If you had a politician who was being attacked as having done something wrong internationally, you'd probably get people from the other parties piling in on them at the same time, but I do think it's very interesting what Maura said about how you are getting different voices here as well.",
        "And I'm, you know, interested to hear what some of the families were saying from Arkansas.",

        "I didn't see on television - and I was watching nearly all of the cable news coverage on Thursday, I didn't see American family members who were being interviewed.",

        "So…",
