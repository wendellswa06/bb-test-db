        "Yes sir, great question.",
        "Actually, in 2004, the Mississippi legislature actually amended its statute, its law that allows for what they term a conditional medical release.",
        "In other words, it's not a full pardon in a sense, but it understands that patients with pretty severe medical illnesses could be released essentially to what is sort of home custody.",
        "So they're still under the auspices of the Department of Corrections, but because of their medical condition, they are, you know, released to home.",
        "And would this be qualified if they'd convicted of a violent crime, for example?",
        "Well, actually, initially in 2004, the requirement did not - or the law did not exclude people who had committed violent crimes.",
        "It did, however, exclude patients or prison inmates who had been convicted of a sex crime.",
        "It also required that you have served at least one year of incarceration.",
        "Now subsequent to that, I believe maybe last year, they amended the law slightly and excluded anyone who had committed a violent crime.",
        "So if anything, these - ideas are being tightened, if anything.",

        "Well, he wasn't on that plane that exploded over Lockerbie.",
        "He was a planner, and he can still plan.",
        "Second, I don't think victims get any compassionate release from what happened to their family members."

        "It's my experience, Neal, that they did receive - the Department of the Corrections, when we had an inmate who medically - and I want to point out - the caller raised a good point - that our job as the physician or the caregivers of the medical staff there in prison, it was our job there to make a medical diagnosis and to provide the medical care.",

        "They could be in a coma, for example, or they could be completely paralyzed, so that technically wouldn't be a, quote, \"\"terminal condition.",
        "So we certify that information to the Department of Corrections.",
        "And it's my understanding that the staff there actually would have communications sometimes with the local prosecutors, sometimes of victims of the crime in a case where they may have been a victim.",
        "We have people obviously who, you know, did different things like - were convicted of, you know, felony DUI, so there technically may not have been a victim there.",
        "But they did get feedback from those individuals.",

        "In fact, at one point, I think, Angola was considered one of the most violent prisons in the United States.",
        "They have over 5,000 inmates.",
        "And about the same time that I began working with the Department of Corrections in Mississippi, we were able to go down and visit their hospice program.",
        "They were kind enough to invite us.",
        "And they really do have a model program.",
        "It's been acknowledged in both the medical literature and in some of the hospice literature.",
        "They actually have inmates that participate directly in the hospice care of their fellow inmates in many circumstances.",
        "And interestingly enough, many of those inmates are viewed great status.",

        "You don't have to even quite forgive a person - my understanding is there's some question as to whether this man's guilty.",
        "But to have compassion for somebody to spend the last days of their life, regardless of what kind of political edge somebody makes, seems like a pretty small leap to me.",

        "I don't specifically know what happened.",
