        "Yesterday on CNN, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the public option was not the essential element, and mentioned the possibility of member-owned health care cooperatives.",

        "There are health co-ops already in the U.S.",
        "What do we know about how they work?",
        "Well, there are a number of different kinds of health care co-ops that exist right now.",
        "And I should say that there used to be a lot more.",
        "Co-ops have a long history in this country of providing health insurance, as well as health services to customers.",
        "And, in fact, many of the insurance companies that we know today, the Blue Cross Blue Shield, started out as a form of cooperative in the sense they were called mutual insurance companies, where members pulled together to buy health services.",
        "Today, there are not many left.",
        "There are a couple of really big - the bigger ones are in the Pacific Northwest and in Minnesota, where Group Health in the Puget Sound area and HealthPartners have about a half-million members, a bit more.",
        "They go back decades.",
        "And their members own the cooperative.",
        "They vote on the members and they own the insurance.",
        "Now the interesting thing in both of those cases is that the co-ops actually also are the health care providers.",
        "So the co-ops employ the doctors, own the hospitals, own the clinics.",
        "So you have a sort of fully integrated system in which people get their health care.",
        "There's a more simple kind of co-op that exists, for instance, in California, where you have something called the United Agricultural Benefit Trust, which is a group of farmers that banded together about 25 years ago to buy insurance in a more traditional kind of way.",
        "They hired some people who had expertise in insurance.",
        "And then this - after taking their premiums, they contract with providers, doctors, hospitals, et cetera, where their members can go get medical care.",
        "You said there used to be more.",

        "Now to U.S.",

        "I was talking to a pro-union person today who said, look, the other side says, oh, we love private sector unions.",
        "Well, but private sector unions have largely, if not been destroyed, been diminished to about seven percent of the workforce, so that average workers don't get the health care and the pension benefits they used to.",
        "And now the conservatives are saying, well, the unionized public employees get these benefits, that's not fair, let's cut everybody's benefits.",
        "And so I think there's been some political success.",
        "It's still hard to see a path to the unions winning the fight in the legislature.",

        "Have the unions actually scored points with public opinion in this showdown?",
        "There's anxiety on both sides, I guess I would say.",
        "I don't think it's a question of hating the teachers or firemen, I don't think anybody hates that.",
        "But it is a simple fact that some of the benefit packages - not so much the wages, the wages are pretty much in line - but the benefits packages are extremely generous and more importantly, unsustainable.",
        "And so it is simply a fact that the state-union relationship got out of whack, a little imbalanced and led to these unsustainable benefit packages."

        "So it has to be scaled back.",
        "And I think as this goes on, I hear a lot of Republican governors, not so much from Wisconsin, but elsewhere thinking, you know, why did they take this all-or-nothing approach?",

        "I think not.",

        "He set this two-stage process where they're probably going to propose this continual resolution for a couple weeks filled with cuts that the president already more or less buys onto.",
        "And then the question will be, how much can he move the Obama administration, how much can he move his freshmen?",
        "And from the freshmen I've spoken to, they really do want to cut the size of government quite a lot.",

        "I think you're seeing Senate Democrats move toward cuts, but it's not clear yet whether they can possibly agree to as many cuts as some of these freshmen actually want.",

        "No, no. All these cuts are immaterial.",
        "They're all symbolic.",
