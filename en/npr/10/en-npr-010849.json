        "And as you know, only a few weeks ago, Zimbabwe was elected chairman of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in face of fierce opposition from the British and their allies.",
        "And lastly, you know that we have this annual consultation conference between the African Union and the European Union.",
        "The British had prevailed on their allies in the European Union to say we should not meet if Zimbabwe is there.",

        "Now, I'm just saying all these things to show you that the rest of the world have solidarity with the government and people of Zimbabwe.",
        "This is because we are a very democratic country.",
        "Democratic, not just in the sense of having free speech and separation of powers and so forth, but democratic in the sense that we would want the vast majority of the people of the country to enjoy the national resources of their country, particularly land, the minerals and so forth.",
        "And that's where the Zimbabwe's, you know, problems started, when we decided that the time had come for the land to be redistributed equitably on a non-racial basis to the people of Zimbabwe.",
        "We had inherited a situation, untenable racist situation, where 75 percent of the land belongs to white farmers.",
        "And Africans had been herded into native reserves.",
        "Yeah, because Zimbabwe, like South Africa - if you read the colonial office documents - they were termed white men's country, along with Australia, New Zealand and Canada.",
        "So basically, when we redistributed land, the British imposed sanctions against us and they prevailed on their allies in the European Union and North America to impose sanctions against us as a punishment for this land reform program.",
        "And this is why our economy is, you know, has been on a downward spiral system.",

        "Scary - it used to be such a great country.",
        "Now, it's just a ruin - very sad.",
        "The economic crisis, the political crisis in Zimbabwe, Mr. Ambassador, this was - as was described once one of the most prosperous countries in Africa?",
        "Yes.",
        "But, you know, it was prosperous - it was heaven for the white men, not for the black men, because Africans did not own land.",
        "And we - when it came to other natural resources such as minerals - the vast mineral resources that we have - all the minerals, all the mines belong to white companies.",
        "And Africans were just - they were just laborers there.",

        "But when, as you know, her party was defeated in the 1997 elections, the new government of Tony Blair reneged on that and they said we are not beholden to promises made by the Conservative Party.",
        "And when we proceeded to pass legislation and to amend our constitution to enable the government to legally and forcibly acquire land for redistribution to landless black people, the British government imposed sanctions and prevailed on their neighbors in Europe and North America, to impose sanctions against our country, to hurt the economy in the hope that a damaged economy would make the people rise against their government.",
        "And the outgoing prime minister of Britain made no bones about it.",
        "He proclaimed to the House of Commons that his government's policy was that of regime change.",
        "And the government here in the United States have come out - I mean, recently - to say that they are working with the opposition for the downfall of the elected government of Zimbabwe.",
        "So these economic sanctions that are hurting our economy really are the bane of Zimbabwe.",
