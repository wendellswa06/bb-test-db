        "He's terrified of ending up in the criminal court, at The Hague, and he's now pulling down the temples of the pillar.",

        "He's demonstrating to the rest of his countrymen that time is running out for them and he will destroy their country, and then, before he leaves power.",
        "If the situation is that bad, we heard the ambassador describe any number of diplomatic organizations which have honored Zimbabwe of late, by electing them to various representative offices.",
        "Why are South - why are Zimbabwe's neighbors apparently not have the same opinion?",
        "It's very strange.",
        "I've just been reading, actually, today in the South African press how ashamed many of the people are here of the complicity, apparent complicity of the South African government through their policy of quiet diplomacy and crimes against the people of Zimbabwe.",
        "For example, there's a massive swell of refugees coming from Zimbabwe into South Africa, people fleeing for their lives.",
        "Many of them are put into detention centers here and are then put onto deportation trains, about 4,000 per day, and sent back into the furnace(ph).",

        "Gardasil protects against four strains, including two that are responsible for about 70 percent of all the cervical cancer cases.",
        "So the vaccine really does have the potential to have a major public health benefit.",
        "Basically 100 percent of cervical cancer is caused by HPV.",
        "So if you can really prevent people from becoming infected with these two high-risk strains you're really going to have a major impact on the problem.",
        "And how is the vaccine made?",

        "It's given in three doses over the course of about six months.",
        "Arthur Allen, made in an interested way, is it not?",
        "Yeah, it's grown in a - it's cloned into a bacula(ph) virus, a virus that grows in caterpillars - the kind of caterpillar that live in, I think, cabbage and things like that.",
        "Anyway, they grow it in a subculture(ph) of these caterpillars, and the idea behind it was that previously a lot of viral vaccines have been grown in tissue cultures of humans or apes where there might be other viruses that could infect people.",
        "And so there's nothing that infects caterpillars apparently.",
        "There aren't any viruses that attack caterpillars that also attack us.",
