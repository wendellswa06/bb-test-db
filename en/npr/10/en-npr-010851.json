        "Mary, thanks for your call.",
        "So, Noam Levey, from our very scientific data pool here of two callers, it's not exactly a rousing endorsement from the people actually in them.",
        "No.",
        "And in fact, as this debate progresses here, I suspect we'll be hearing - if we go down the route and we see a full-blown proposal to create this kind of co-ops, I think we'll see a debate about what the benefits and some of the drawbacks can be.",
        "There certainly are complaints from people about how responsive co-ops are, especially Group Health, which has, as I said I think about half a million members, maybe more.",
        "The degree to which a co-op really responds to its members and to their complaints is a big test.",
        "And I'm sure it can be difficult if you have a very large - a large co-op.",
        "Critics of a co-op who are generally proponents of creating a government plan, would argue that a government plan could be more responsive because it is essentially owned very explicitly by the people.",
        "On the other hand, I think one could argue, as well - you probably could find a lot of people who are critical of decisions that the government makes on health care, as well.",
        "So…",
        "You think?",

        "My question concerns, in a general way, the role of the nonprofit sector in the financial - nonprofits in the financial sector.",
        "For example, in the banking side, credit unions came out looking pretty good in the wake of the banking scandals.",
        "They didn't get involved in the sorts of abuses that some of the for-profit side got involved in.",
        "I'm just wondering if we could hope to see some of that on the health care side, if expanding the nonprofit involvement would cut down on some of the political and economic abuses, like lobbying excesses and just a concentration of power that we see in the financial sector.",
        "Mike, thanks for your call.",
        "Noam?",
        "Well, certainly there are those who believe that some of the for-profit excesses in the health care sector could be controlled by further and tighter regulation by the federal government.",
        "Co-ops may be one piece of that.",
        "Although, you know, it should be noted that some of the largest health insurers in the country are nonprofit still, and can be - as are, still - there are still nonprofit providers as well out there.",
        "You know, it seems like we were just reporting that Merck had success with its clinical trials and boom, now the vaccine is already on the market.",
        "How does it move that fast, Arthur?"

        "So it's not necessarily, I think, a simple panacea for all the ails of the health care system.",
        "But clearly, there is, I think, a recognition by those pushing both co-ops and pushing more government plan that letting unfettered private interests control the health care sector hasn't necessarily been the best thing.",
        "One of the big proponents of co-ops in the Senate is Senator Kent Conrad.",
        "Is there something about representing a rural area that makes this a more appealing option?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "I mean, Senator Conrad's been very explicit, in fact, in saying that this is a model of economic organization that is familiar to us, being people from the Midwest.",
        "Where there are agricultural co-ops, people have banded together to sell their products.",
        "They've banded together to buy electricity.",
        "They're a little less familiar to folks on the East Coast and the Northeast.",
        "In fact, I had a conversation not too long ago with a senator from Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse, who said, you know, we have to look at this.",
        "Where I come from, we don't have co-ops.",
        "I don't exactly know how that would work.",
        "So there's probably going to be an education process that's going to have to go on for those aren't from places like North Dakota.",

        "Doug, welcome to the program.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "Thank you for covering the topic.",
        "As a libertarian and a proponent of the free market, I'm glad we're covering the idea of reform.",
        "But one of the things that concerns me is whether it's an insurance company, the government or a co-op, whether you pull $200 out of my left pocket and call it a premium or $200 out of my right pocket and call it a tax, nothing is addressing the actual cost of health care, which is skyrocketing, which is the real problem.",
        "No one can afford to get a test or any sort of procedure of significant size without some sort of coverage that keeps going up.",
        "Well, I mean, you've put your finger on possibly the biggest and most vexing problem confronting policymakers here.",
        "We talk a lot about coverage and how are we going to cover everybody, but I don't think anybody's figured out exactly how we're going to pay for all of the things that we want to have done.",
        "Now, I would suggest that that discussion about controlling how much we pay for health care would demand more of a discussion about what we can and can't afford.",
        "And once you get into that discussion, you get into, I think, some pretty touchy territory in terms of when you actually say no. And actually, I would think from a libertarian's perspective that would be particularly interesting to sort of start making decisions about who can and can't have health care.",

        "Hi.",

        "You know, I'm willing to pay my, you know, my premium for it, but I believe that that's very important.",
        "I have two brothers that work fulltime, neither one of them have insurance at all.",
        "And I have a friend who recently lost her job, purchased insurance in Pennsylvania, then her daughter got breast cancer in Florida and she can't use her insurance in Florida unless it's 60/40.",
        "And there are many other people in this category who are working, who pay taxes, who are willing to pay premiums, but they need something that they can carry with them throughout the nation.",
        "That's a problem we hear a lot, and it's something that, actually, insurance companies themselves have argued for more - what's called portability of health insurance.",
        "At the moment, health insurance is regulated at the state level, for the most part, around the country.",
        "And that's pleased a lot of consumer advocates because many states have put tougher restrictions and requirements on insurance companies, in places like California, for instance, or elsewhere.",
        "But creating a system where you would have the same standard across state lines is a tricky business, and one that I think is still very much in discussion here.",
        "Politically, what do you think is actually going on with the strategy here?",
        "Do you think this is a real proposal that is likely to make it into a version of the legislation, at least on the Senate side?",
        "The co-op proposal?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, I think it is a very real proposal.",
        "I think - well, a couple of things.",
        "I mean, the government option, the government plan has sort of become a - almost a holy grail, I think, for some on the left who believe that without it, you cannot have meaningful health care reform.",
        "Those advocates are most represented in the House of Representatives.",
        "So I think it's unlikely that the House, when it passes a health care bill, could pass something that doesn't have a government - a new government insurance program in it.",
        "On the Senate side, there's never been as much enthusiasm for that, in part because Republicans wield much more influence, but also there are a lot of moderate Democrats who are pretty uncomfortable with creating a new government insurance program."

        "So they're searching for some alternative that would satisfy people who think that you can't just let insurance companies run the insurance market.",
        "There's a feeling that that's been what we've had, and it hasn't worked too well.",
        "So how do you find an alternative?",
        "That co-op proposal's a real proposal.",
        "It's being discussed in the Senate Finance Committee, and there are discussions going on in town now with the administration, as well as senior Democrats on the Hill about how you lay the groundwork for emerging with a bill in two or three or four or five months that doesn't have a full-blown government plan.",
        "And if the alternative is co-ops in some form, how likely do you think it is to win bipartisan support?",

        "Mm.",
        "Well, I wouldn't bet on a lot of bipartisan support at this point, frankly.",
        "I think if you listened to some of the rhetoric on both sides, but particularly on the Republican side, even from those who purport to be interested in bipartisanship - I point particularly to Senator Chuck Grassley, who's been working on this and has been extremely vocal in his criticism of major proponents - major components of the bill.",
        "I think at the end of the day, I'd be pretty surprised if there are many Republicans that vote for whatever emerges.",
