        "He wasn't profiled on CNBC or in the Wall Street Journal, at least not for the hedge fund.",
        "And I took a look at some of the returns that he was said to be producing and was actually tipped off by a source at Deutsche Bank, worked there at the time, his name was Ken Nakayama.",
        "And he gave me the name of one of these feeder funds he called it, which I didn't know what they were at the time.",

        "He was very affable on the phone for the brief period that I talked to him.",
        "It was only about 10 minutes.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So, his investors however were rabidly loyal.",
        "One told me he put his kids through college on his investment in Madoff.",
        "And then finally, another told me, he, you know, Bernie Madoff had requested he never tell anyone that he was managing the portfolio, which on Wall Street is - that's just anathema to the whole culture.",
        "If you do well, you want people to know about it.",
        "It didn't make any sense.",
