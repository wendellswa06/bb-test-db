        "And while it was kind of an astounding-looking vaccine coming out of these trials - that it was 100 percent effective against the strains of the virus that it was aimed at.",
        "Still it was - the trial involved 25,000 women, which is a good-sized trial.",
        "Of them, I think something like 1,500 were girls of the age who were being recommended for the vaccine.",

        "That's correct.",
        "I mean, the safety data on Gardasil look very good, but some vaccine adverse events.",
        "All vaccines have adverse events and some occur very rarely.",
        "Even a trial - a relatively large trial - of 20,000 people may be too small to detect extremely rare adverse events.",
        "If it's something that occurs in, for example, 1 in every 100,000 shots, that's not something that's going to come up during the trial, and that's why the FDA conducts very extensive post-licensure, safety monitoring to track people after the vaccine is on the market.",
        "In fact, the American Academy of Family Physicians issued a statement on their website that says that they believe that - I'll read the whole thing.",
        "It says the AAFP feels that it's premature to consider school-entry mandates for human papillomavirus vaccine until such time as the long-term safety with widespread use, stability of supply and economic issues have been clarified.",
        "So it seems like there - from both sides, from people who say I don't want the government in my life telling me what to do with my family.",
        "And from the other side, people saying this hasn't been tested long enough.",
        "I think there are good arguments for and against mandates, and those arguments can be considered on their merits, but I think there is general agreement that the speed with which this has happened is a little disconcerting.",
        "Also, of course, because of the publicity surrounding Merck's very aggressive lobbying efforts created, you know, certainly the appearance of a conflict of interest.",
        "And I think that kind of muddied the waters a bit.",
        "Arthur?",
        "Right, I think you could argue that Vioxx wouldn't have gotten Merck in the hot water it did if they had marketed a little less aggressively and if it had only been, you know, targeted at people who had no other solution for pain control.",
        "Then the side effects, there was a smaller number of them and they would have been in a smaller, sort of, population.",
        "I wonder if they would have had as many lawsuits.",
        "And I think in a sense they took the same sort of broad approach in just trying to get this vaccine into as many kids as they could as fast as they could.",
        "They have a competitor of GSK that's coming out with a vaccine sometime later this year.",
        "They may have been trying to sort of corner some of the market share.",
        "That's speculation.",
        "I haven't talked to them about it, but it sure looks that way.",
        "And it's just - there's a group called the Association of Immunization Managers, which are state public health people who are actually responsible for making sure that vaccines get into kids when there's a school mandate.",
        "And they were very - they issued, sort of, some guidelines in February",
        "Where they say that any mandate has to be done, you know, sparingly, cautiously and only up to the appropriate time - period of time that a vaccine's been started to be used.",

        "Well, generally the Family Research Council has been in support of both the development and the widespread availability of the - any HPV vaccines.",
        "We feel that there are this great benefits in the development to protect women's health.",
        "What we have trouble with is the mandates, and feel that the mandates infringe on the right of parents to make decisions regarding their children's medical care.",
        "And since - as has probably been mentioned already on the program, since the (unintelligible) HPV is not spread by casual contact but rather it's a sexually transmitted infection, that there's not sufficient public health justification to require vaccination for school attendance.",
        "And it could also lead parents to believe that the vaccine is the only way to reduce risks of cervical cancer, which is untrue.",

        "I mean, I hope - I assume we're going to talk about this.",

        "I disagree with this kind of particular reason why we shouldn't mandate it.",
        "I think it's too soon to mandate it, but I think potentially this could be a vaccine that would be worth mandating, but we'll get into that later, I'm sure.",
        "You can get into it now, sure.",
        "True, but again the hep B can be transmitted through blood.",
        "There is that other route.",
        "So again, this places this vaccine in its own category by clearly one route of transmission.",
        "Well let's get into it now.",
        "Yeah, I mean, my feeling is that there's a huge overlap.",
        "I mean, of course it's true that there are other ways of preventing cervical cancer and that's what we do now and that's actually one of the most successful preventive strategies we have, you know, for an infectious disease - or cancer in this case - which is pap smears.",
        "And obviously, I think the number of women who get cervical cancer, which is I think 14,000 a year, the studies show that almost all of these women haven't been getting regular pap smears.",
        "And if they had, in all likelihood the cancer could have been stopped.",
        "But I believe that there's a huge - there's very likely a big overlap between women who don't get regular cervical exams and daughters of people who don't get their kids vaccinated unless they have to.",
        "Now, I don't have data to support that, but I have a strong feeling that, you know, the plus side of mandatory vaccination programs in that they generally get people - the people who are brought in and vaccinated are not people who are opposed to the vaccine.",
        "They're people who don't know about it, who can't afford it, or who just can't be bothered because they haven't read up enough about the disease."

        "And so mandatory vaccination programs can be really positive in getting a vaccine to people who need it.",
        "And this has proved true, you know, in the past historically with measles campaigns, with rubella, with whooping cough, all kinds of diseases in the past, where making it mandatory did not mean that you grab people by the hair and drag them in kicking and screaming if they don't want to get their kids vaccinated, because there is almost always a way you can opt out.",
        "It means getting people who can't be bothered or who can't afford it.",
        "Because another problem with making this vaccine mandatory right away was that the state public health agencies were in no position to pay for it, most of them, with some exceptions.",
        "And so you're mandating a vaccine without being able to pay for it for people who don't have it.",
        "And I think that there's sort of a morally untenable issue there.",
        "Are you going to tell someone they can't go to school because they can't afford a vaccine?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "Because it's like $400 for the series.",
        "And this is an expensive vaccine.",
        "Moira, how do you react to that?",
        "Well, certainly we've supported the Vaccine for Children program, a federal program to help fund vaccine for children who are underserved and who would not be able to afford it.",
        "But I just want to go back to an element of prevention which has been missed out of the discussion, and that is early on by pediatricians and health care providers.",
        "They can provide another form of primary prevention in the form of risk avoidance, clinical counseling towards sexually transmitted diseases, which they provide for tobacco use, drug use, violence prevention…",
        "Would that be abstinence?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that would be the best form of a preventative.",
        "It's a form of primary prevention, as are vaccines, to affect behavior and prevent disease.",
        "What about girls who have been molested or raped or things like that and have no choice?",
        "Well, in that sense, the vaccine again would be beneficial.",
        "But I'm speaking to the message that's delivered with the vaccine, which is medically accurate in terms of your best way to prevent receiving the infection, especially with those strains of HPV which are not covered by the Gardasil."
