        "Do you want to jump in?",
        "I just have a couple of comments on some of the things that have been said.",
        "First of all, I think we should clarify the meaning of terms compulsory and mandatory that get thrown around.",
        "Almost every state has opt-out provisions that allow parents who have a variety of objections to vaccination to exempt their children.",
        "So you could argue, really, that a policy with a opt-out provision isn't really compulsory in the strictest sense.",
        "The other issue I wanted to touch on was the fact that mandates always achieve higher levels of protection than non-mandated vaccines.",
        "And as Art said, you're not really forcing - for most people, you are not forcing them to do something that they don't want to do.",
        "You're getting people who either haven't heard about it or just never got around to it.",
        "And this is particularly an issue for adolescents.",
        "Adolescents are the age bracket least likely to have any kind of contact with a health care provider.",
        "It's very difficult to get adolescents immunized or to get them any other kind of regular health care.",
        "And of all the studies on this - really mandates for vaccines prior to entry to middle school is really the only effective way to achieve very high levels of coverage for adolescent immunization.",
        "We're talking about HPV vaccine this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Arthur, do you want to jump in there?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I would agree with what James says there.",
        "And I - one other point I wanted to make about this sort of sexually transmitted nature of this virus.",
        "You know, I think that sex - I mean, one thing is important to point out about this virus is that it's presence in, I think, 80 percent of women who've ever had sexual intercourse.",
        "It's - you don't have to be promiscuous and therefore, you know, to be infected with HPV, you - and therefore, you're not sending a message that it's okay to be promiscuous when you vaccinate someone with this vaccine.",
        "And if someone is promiscuous or is having a lot of unprotected sexual encounters, this vaccine will certainly protect them against a couple of strands of HPV, but there are a lot of other things it wont protect you against.",
        "...as \"\"The Girl from Ipanema\"\" is softly playing in the background.",
        "And certainly I would be the first person - I mean, I think most pediatricians would agree that it's good to caution, you know, young women and men about this, about, you know, the risks of contracting disease from having sex.",
        "But I just don't see how sort of withholding this from kids is good public health."

        "They did it rather quickly and I find it rather hypocritical since this is a state that teaches abstinence only in its sex education programs.",
        "But my question is, if this is really such a big deal and we really need to protect our women, why are we not vaccinating the carriers that are the boys?",
        "All right.",
        "James, do you want to…",
        "The vaccine is not licensed for use in boys.",
        "Merck has data on its safety in boys but they don't have data on its efficacy.",
        "Once they look at that data, which they are currently doing, they may or may not apply for its use in boys depending on what they find.",
        "But it is not currently licensed for boys.",
        "I think that's a really good point that she makes.",
        "I mean, eventually it would make sense to have it licensed for boys as much as for girls.",
        "And I mean, you know, the thing about HPV, I mean, it is an important disease.",
        "I mean, 4,000 women die of it every, so it's nothing insignificant.",
        "That's about the number of kids who died of measles every year before we started measles vaccination which - so, you know, it does have a serious impact on a population, but it's something that's going to require a lot of buy-in and a lot of money and a lot that you can't demand out of the population until you have really good evidence that it's safe and effective.",
        "And that will take a few years.",
        "And that's why, you know, other vaccines have been introduced more slowly and I think that's why this one had, you know…",
        "Hang on, because I have to take a break.",

        "And really, again, it's placing the decision back in individual parents' hands.",
        "And I think that, you know, going back to mandate a widespread coverage with the vaccine, this would set a bad precedent for mandating a vaccine which is not spread through casual contact like measles and other childhood diseases.",
        "Can I jump in?",
        "I would actually disagree with that.",
        "I don't think that casual transmissibility is the only conceivable justification for mandating a vaccine.",
        "And, you know, I would also point out that for about 25 years we've had a vaccine against hepatitis B.",
        "Hepatitis B is, as you know, transmitted primarily through sexual contact and through injection drug use.",
        "There are some other relative infection, but those are the primary ones.",
        "It's been universally recommended since 1991 and now almost all states require it for admission to elementary school or middle school, or both.",

        "But it's really a small percentage of the new infections.",
        "So, I mean, this is angels dancing on the head of a pin.",
        "I mean, most of this - mostly in our country, not around the world, but in our country, hepatitis B is mainly spread through actions that many people deem sinful.",
        "But it doesn't stop it from being good public policy to do it.",
        "I mean to - and it cuts down disease.",
        "And we don't see, you know, the reductions in hepatitis B and some of these diseases.",
        "They're not dramatic.",
        "They don't jump out at you, you know, the way that getting rid of polio did, you know, or smallpox.",
        "But it's significant.",
        "I mean, the rate of hepatitis B in kids who've been vaccinated in that age group up to 15 has fallen 98 percent.",
        "You know, there's some new data that just came out yesterday.",
        "So, I mean, these are kids who - when you're infected at a young age, you're more likely to have become a chronic carrier and could get liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver.",
        "These are, you know, thousands of infections and thousands of deaths and terrible illnesses that have been prevented through this vaccine.",
        "And the same could be true of HPV.",
        "That's why it's really unfortunate, in my view, that we're having this whole debate about mandating.",
        "Because it'll make it probably harder to mandate this vaccine in four or five years because everyone's going to still feel, like, oh, maybe this isn't soon enough.",
        "But if you - if we hadn't had this misstep initially, I think it would have been easier to sort of deal with this more, you know, sort of - I won't say rationally because I don't want to accuse people of being irrational - but more sort of detachedly.",
