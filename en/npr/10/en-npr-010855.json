        "And I discussed it with her, and she thought it was a good idea.",
        "Because I made her aware that it wasn't just because I wasn't trusting her and, you know, I'm glad that she's a virgin and all those kinds of things, it's just that if it prevents cancer, you know, you can't beat that.",

        "I do not, but I was going to say I know that there is a DNA test available that a woman can get to see if she's carrying the virus and different strains of the virus."

        "And that's a very important issue, and I think we need to pay careful attention to it.",
        "But the other issue I think, really, is that, you know, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation about mandates if the U.S.",

        "We just do a really poor job of this.",

        "It's considered to be an issue of economics or politics, but it really is an ethical issue.",

        "We never - people were flocking to get a polio vaccine, right?",
        "You didn't have to talk anybody into that, you know.",
        "What's different about this?",
        "Well that's - the point I was trying to make is that with polio, I mean, the risk of not getting vaccinated was clear.",
        "I mean, the benefit of the vaccine was just shouting at everyone from every street corner.",
        "And it isn't as clear when you're dealing with diseases that are somewhat less public."

        "And especially the people who are most vocal opposing or being critical of vaccination policy don't often come across these diseases, perhaps because they're getting better medical care than some of the people who would be protected by the vaccines.",
        "I think that's another reason.",
        "And I also think that these vaccine controversies kind of come in waves that aren't entirely predictable, but they…",
        "Do you think that, you know, do you think that people trust the government less these days, and that's why they're questioning more than, you know, people trusted everything in the '50s.",

        "That was the policy decision.",
        "Well, 40,000 people were vaccinated.",
        "Well why not?",
        "Because there was no confidence, there was no trust in the idea.",
        "And so trust is based, you know, on - it has to do with an obviously - I mean, it can have to do with the obvious soundness or unsoundness of a policy, but it also has to do with how much we trust the people who are giving us the advice or who are asking us to do something."
