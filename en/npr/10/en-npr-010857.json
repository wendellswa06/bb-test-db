        "So why do you think he stole?",
        "You know, I think the scam began so long ago, his father-in-law - Ruth Madoff was his wife, and Ruth's father helped recruit some of his early clients from his accounting firm, and I think that it became such a family affair that it was too difficult to end.",
        "And by the time, say, the early 1990s rolled around, there was really no reason to stop it.",
        "Madoff had recruited - started to recruit billions of dollars from these, you know, feeder funds or fund of hedge funds, which basically just feed hedge-fund money managers, and it started to get bigger and bigger.",
        "This is the mystery that I believe his - Madoff's right-hand man will clear up for us, Frank DiPascali, who was pleading guilty last week."

        "It sounds almost Keystone Cops, and it is, sadly.",
        "The second reason was that Bernie Madoff and his brother, Peter Madoff, in the 1970s went to the SEC's aid.",
        "The agency at the time had a mandate to help break the monopoly of the New York Stock Exchange and really help the average investor so they wouldn't be robbed by commissions.",
        "The SEC had no idea how to do that, and Bernie and Peter Madoff came to them and said we're going to help you.",
        "We're going to help you create this new, third market.",
