        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Rebecca Roberts in Washington.",
        "We're talking to Erin Arvedlund.",
        "She's one of those reporters who raised the alarm on Bernie Madoff early, and she's got a new book out about Madoff.",
        "It's called \"\"Too Good to be True.\"\" You can see the original article she wrote back in 2001, as well as one by another skeptical reporter, over at our blog, that's npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "And tell us what you don't understand about the Madoff case.",
        "Give us a call at 800-989-8255, or send us email, talk@npr.org.",
        "You can also join the conversation on our Web site, npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "We have an email from Sabrina(ph) in Westminster, Colorado, who says: How was Bernie Madoff able to trick so many people into investing with him?",
        "Surely mine couldn't have been the only mother to warn me that if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",
        "Were investors really that gullible, or do you think their vision was somewhat clouded by greed?",
        "Let's see.",
        "I think people don't like to - people don't like to be judged on how they manage their money.",
        "It's a very personal decision.",
        "So for those investors who knew that Bernie Madoff was investing their money and knew that they could have investigated some of the red flags that were out there, I think they were motivated in part by greed because they had the opportunity, at least, to investigate, and many of them didn't.",
        "Bernie Madoff used a very old trick, which was, many times, he would turn people down the first time they wanted to get into his fund.",
        "And he didn't have a sales force, per se.",
        "He relied almost exclusively on referrals, so every investor was converted into a sales person.",
        "And so if your father or your mother or your uncle or your aunt is saying I can get you into this fund, they're a trusted party.",
        "You're really going to take their word for it.",
        "Now, for those who didn't know that Madoff was investing their money - and there are a lot of them.",
        "For instance, many of these feeder funds turned around, like Fairfield Greenwich and Tremont and some of the others that have been named by - in suits from the Madoff trustee, they turned around and sold these funds to pensions and 401(k)s and retirees who had no idea that Bernie Madoff was running their money.",
        "So he infected a lot of different people across America.",
        "So in those cases, those people weren't greedy.",
        "They just had no idea, and I think the feeder funds are really going to have to answer for that.",
        "Well, there's also a sort of third group of people who were suspicious, and so they limited their investment with Madoff…",
        "That's right.",
        "…sort of I'm willing to take a little bit of a risk that this guy isn't all that he is looking like, but his returns are so good that maybe I'll take a small risk.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "And the other thing that was so appealing about Madoff was that if you wanted your money out, he'd give it right back to you.",
        "It was almost like having a money market account or an ATM.",
        "It's very hard to get your money out of, say, a mutual fund.",
        "Sometimes it takes several days or even weeks.",
        "Madoff…",
        "Because it's actually invested in something."

        "My question is, I think, a really simple one.",
        "I don't know, I always wondered: Where is all the money?",
        "Great question.",
        "So let's start with the $65 billion.",
        "That is actually not a real number because that number includes all the phony profits, all the false profits that Madoff claimed to have at the end of 2008.",
        "Now, if you assume that, say, this is going on for 20 or even 30 years, and he was promising 10 percent a year, the quick math means that if you take out all those false profits, that real number is probably closer to, say, $12 to $20 billion of real money, real dollars.",

        "She, Astrud, had - was apparently, like, she was barely experienced as a singer.",
        "And some people didn't think that she actually sounded right, but somehow, it was perfect.",
        "It was this perfect voice to sing the song.",
        "It is.",
        "We know about half of that money came from feeder funds.",
        "So that leaves anywhere from $6 to $10 billion, and the question is where is that money?",
        "So, Madoff spent a lot of it.",
        "He and his family went on an enormous spending spree.",
        "In 2008, they were buying real estate, apartments, cars.",
        "Madoff's brother, Peter Madoff, bought an Aston Martin for over $100,000.",
        "And the rest of it has gone out to some of Madoff's favored investors who were taking out more money from the Ponzi scheme than they were actually putting in over the years, and two of those guys are actually under investigation right now."

        "As far as we can tell, he never invested in a single security on his phony hedge-fund side.",
        "In other words, he had a storefront.",
        "He had his real brokerage firm on two floors of his office, and they really were trading.",
        "They were doing a very legitimate business.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But more than that, I don't think - not everybody in the world can be a forensic accountant or a financial expert who is really going to be in a position to be able to say, well, what's reasonable to expect, and what's unreasonable to expect?",
        "And you know, when you've got a society where more and more people are having to invest in order to support their retirements, and you had talk of privatizing Social Security and so forth, it seems to me that this was really a failure of regulation",

        "I would say Madoff had - there was one red flag that I could point to, and I would disagree with the caller on this one point, which was that his fund never had a losing year.",
        "And if you're investing in the stock market, there will be down years.",
        "And this is exactly how the whole Ponzi scheme unraveled, which was that in 2008, as most of your listeners know, we had a record-setting correction in the stock market.",
        "We hadn't seen a year like that since the Great Depression, and yet Bernie Madoff's returns were up for the year.",
        "And you don't have to be a financial whiz to see that that just doesn't make any sense.",
        "So that's exactly how his end came, which was that everyone else was - while everyone was losing money in their other investments, they all ran back to Bernie Madoff and said okay, we really need our money back, and it just wasn't there.",

        "Since December, I've wondered what more I could've done.",
        "Even a Freedom of Information Act request to the SEC in Washington would have been fruitless, ditto for a FOIA request to the New York SEC.",
        "I never would've thought of contacting the Boston office at the SEC, which we now know had the dirt on Madoff from Harry Markopolos.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I hate hearing stories like this because, you know, this is a guy who - or a woman, perhaps - who tried to do the right thing.",
        "And you know, I think in this case, the SEC really fell down on the job because they had an opportunity and many red flags from Harry Markopolos, who had been sending letters to the agency for almost 10 years by December of 2008.",
        "And it was only maybe two or three years prior that the SEC finally opened an investigation, and yet they found nothing.",
        "So in any case, I think that's part of the reason why hedge funds will now fall under government purview, either SEC or FINRA.",
        "The question is: Will they do any better of a job on the rest of the hedge funds as they did on Bernie Madoff?",

        "I did.",
        "We thought something was a little weird because information would leave the one part of the computer system completely out of the system, and then to reentered into the investor finance system.",
        "Then it was doing multiple securitization, basically selling the same piece of paper over and over and over.",
        "So it would have been, you know, easier to catch, I think, maybe in some ways.",
        "But we had a clue as we were, you know, writing the software to manage this stuff and we'd asked, well, how do we get information from, you know, the regular system, you know, the accounting system into the finance system and back and forth?",
        "And, oh, don't worry about that.",

        "Madoff had an old IBM AS/400 computer, which he used completely separately from his space-age brokerage firm, the legitimate operation.",
        "He had an old computer that they would use to punch in stock prices manually.",
        "And that was how they were able to create the template for all the phony statements.",
        "So the caller is exactly right.",
        "That was not connected to any of the other systems, so it was perfect.",
        "It was a dinosaur.",

        "and Rene-Thierry de la Villehuchet, who was an investor, a billion-dollar investor in Madoff, a Frenchman who committed suicide not long after Madoff's arrest.",
        "The fallout personally is that the Madoff investors are going back to SIPC, which is the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which is kind of like the insurance company for investors.",
        "It turns out SIPC's out of money.",
        "So that's going to be kind of a problem.",
        "And I think also the fallout is for - personally, is that it's caused a lot of people to go back to their portfolio managers and say: Who's in charge of my money?",
        "Who actually touches the money in my portfolio?",
        "Because a real good money manager always has your money in third-party custody.",
        "So, you know, if you have a Schwab Accounting or TD Ameritrade, then somebody else actually controls the flow of money besides the portfolio manager.",
        "So a lot of people have gone back and asked these questions, and as a result, other Ponzi schemes have been uncovered, like Allen Stanford in Texas and Tom Petters in the Midwest.",
        "So, that's one good thing.",
