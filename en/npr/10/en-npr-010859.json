        "I think of him as sort of consigliare to Madoff's Godfather.",
        "And Frank DiPascali worked for him for 30-plus years on the phony hedge fund side and helped oversee a team of people who produced these phony statements.",
        "Now, I think Frank DiPascali's been cooperating with prosecutors from day one.",
        "He's facing 125 years.",
        "But I think he's going to name another 10 to 12 people.",
        "I personally think that Madoff's brother, Peter Madoff, could be indicted just merely for sending in false filings to the SEC.",

        "It's that we have a market in which there are economists and theorists who didn't catch this.",
        "If this article was written in 2001 and there were others who, at least, there was a murmur of something funny going on with Madoff, why wasn't it caught by the system?",
        "You know, the market capitalist system of an economist saying, this should not happen.",
        "No one should have consistent returns like this all the time.",
        "There should have been alarm bells going off constantly within academia or someone on Wall Street saying this doesn't ever happen.",
        "We need to say something with regards to Madoff that he's not legitimate, that this doesn't happen.",
        "I totally agree with the caller.",
        "In fact, the surprising part about Madoff is that so many people on Wall Street figured something was wrong.",
        "And they knew that he was crooked.",
        "There were many of the big investment banks who - which wouldn't do business with Madoff.",
        "Among them were Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and some others.",
        "Within the industry, which is not a very large industry, there were a lot of rumors about Madoff, and that was the genesis from my original story.",
        "Again, it wasn't mainstream media.",
        "Barron's is a very business-oriented magazine.",
        "However, it was out there.",
        "And Harry Markopolos, who I didn't know at the time and had no idea that he'd been following Madoff for years already, he had gone directly to the SEC.",
        "And due to a couple of - bureaucratic infighting and the fact that the SEC rarely made big cases, it really went nowhere until 2005.",
        "So people on Wall Street knew, and it - there were consequences, however, for putting your hand up and saying this guy is a crook.",
        "It was easier just to not say anything.",
