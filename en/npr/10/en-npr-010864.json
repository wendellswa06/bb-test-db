        "Who were the people that were living there, and why were these settlements destroyed?",
        "Why did Mugabe order them destroyed?",
        "Well, these are essentially small settlements on the edge of not just Harare but also Bulawayo, Beitbridge, even Victoria Falls.",
        "They're people who had come in from the country after losing their jobs on the farms because the farms have to a certain extent--to a great extent collapsed, and so they came in looking for any kind of work, and they put up their own little shelters.",
        "They found their own jobs in the kind of alternative economy on the black market, whatever you want to call it, and they've been settled there for the last few years in, as you would describe them, shanty towns.",
        "Some of them, though, actually had built their places.",
        "They may not have had a contract for it or land title, but they built them with bricks, and some of the places that were destroyed were actually quite solid homes that had been there for a number of years.",
        "And what was the logic--what was the government's logic in destroying these settlements?",

        "Well, the more sophisticated we become, the more vulnerable we are.",
        "Our grid is now at the tipping point.",
        "Almost everybody knows that.",
        "There's a huge concern about cyber-attacks on the grid, and that would be a pretty mild effect compared to what a really robust EMP lay-down would do.",
        "Our only real-life experience with that was in 1961 over Johnston Island out in the Pacific, when we detonated a nuclear weapon high above the atmosphere and were really surprised when we had electrical and electronic effects in Hawaii about 800 miles away.",
        "The Soviets, the Russians, now have very much more experience than we have had.",
        "They have actually built EMP-enhanced weapons, and the Russian generals told the EMP Commission that the Soviets have developed, and they had EMP weapons that would produce 200 kilovolts per meter at the center and a weapon that made it 300 miles high over Iowa, line of sight, would blanket the whole United States, and the pulse would be 100 kilovolts per meter at the margins of the country, and that is about twice anything we ever designed to or protected from.",
        "So it would really be quite devastating.",
        "What it would mean is that all microelectronics across the country would be shut down.",
        "That means you have no power, you will not have power for a very long time.",

        "They're made overseas.",
        "There are none on the shelf.",
        "You order one and they will build one for you.",
        "So this is potentially a very, very serious event.",

        "They couldn't shut down the whole country.",
        "They couldn't get that far with a Scud, but they could shut down all of New England, which would be Katrina at least 10 times over.",
        "You know, we may avoid this, but there's one event that we will not avoid, and that is a solar electromagnetic interference, solar storm.",
        "If we have a big one like the one that occurred back in 1859, that would shut down the whole grid for quite a long while.",

        "Yeah, they can fix it.",
        "My understanding is it would cost about $100 million to protect much of the grid, but if the grid went down, it would cost us between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, damages, and the loss of life could be horrendous if in fact you were without electricity for months at a time.",
        "Well, 100 million doesn't sound like a lot of money.",
        "No, you know, that was only one-tenth of one billion, and there were 700 of those billions in the stimulus package.",
        "This is a trifling amount of money, and we ought to be doing it.",
        "We should have been doing it a long time ago.",

        "No.",

        "During the years when we had - Clinton years, and we did not have enough money, they waived EMP hardening on their equipment.",
        "So now much of the equipment we have is not EMP-hardened, and the only enemy against which we need this equipment is a peer, and the first thing that the peer would do, it's in all of their open literature, and it's in all of their war games.",
        "There will be a robust EMP lay-down and deny us the use of all of our equipment which is not EMP-hardened, and now that's most of our equipment.",
        "By the way, there's a third source of energy that could be very disruptive, and that is small, directed energy weapons, IEMI, intentional electromagnetic interference, and if these are strong enough, they could, one of them going down Wall Street for instance, could just devastate our financial system.",
        "So what kind of protection can you harden it with?",
        "What can you put in there?",
        "Well, these are surge protectors but very special surge protectors, because the usual surge protector for electricity won't work for nuclear EMP because the rise time is in nanoseconds, and it's already through the surge protector before the surge protector sees it.",
        "But there are hardening techniques.",
        "For new equipment it costs five to 10 percent more, maybe not even that much more.",
        "If you try to harden the equipment after it's made, already made, it may be very, very expensive to harden it then.",
        "So this hardening should be built in.",
        "It's not all that difficult.",
        "There's a major report out by the EMP Commission, and they have spent a lot of time and taken a really in-depth look at this, and you know, hardening the grid so that we would be survivable is not all that difficult.",
        "You just need to do it, and we need leadership to do it.",
        "It's a tough thing, and people just - you know, they just shy away from it.",
        "Some things are too good to be true.",
        "Therefore they're probably not true.",
