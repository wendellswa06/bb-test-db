        "The official version was that these were illegal settlements, that they were damaging to the infrastructure of the cities in terms of the strains they put on the drainage system and the sewage system and everything like that, and that they were a breeding ground for the illegal economy, which is essentially black market money, black market fuel, and black market food.",
        "And by clearing them out, the idea was to restore the cities and restore order and get rid of people who were indulging in illegal forms of behavior.",
        "How many people are we talking about here who were victimized?",
        "Well, this is very, very difficult to estimate.",
        "The government say the total in the country affected is 120,000.",
        "Some of the opposition groups have mentioned a million, which I think is far too high, because Harare itself is only one and a half million, two million people.",
        "But there's--a figure that a lot of aid agencies seem to use is about 300,000, and that's in the whole country, not just Harare.",
        "And where are these people living now if their homes have been destroyed?",
        "Well, some of them are in transit camps they've set up.",
        "The--after the UN announced that it was sending a special envoy in in the wake of what was happening, the government set up a transit camp at a place called Caledonia Farm, and there are a number of odd people there.",
        "Some people are being looked after by churches.",
        "Some people I saw are still in the destroyed areas and they--what they say they do is they put up their little shelters, maybe corrugated iron and a blanket or something like that at night, and take them down at dawn so that they don't get bulldozed.",
        "Some of them have gone back to the country, and I also understand that there were farmers recruiting people to work on their farms who had come in and were offering them transport back into the countryside.",
        "Because one--the other problems with the land redistribution, Mr. Mugabe wanted to redistribute land from the white farmers who, at the time of independence, they were 1 percent of the population and they owned 70 percent of the land, so he was trying to redistribute that.",
        "The problem with that was that the people to whom he gave it, some of them war veterans, some of them, according to his opponents, his own sort of colleagues and pals, they were not experienced farmers, and as a result a lot of those farms have just collapsed.",
        "Duncan Campbell is a reporter for The Guardian, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Duncan, maybe you could put this in context--the destruction of these settlements--put it in the context of what's going on overall in Zimbabwe now.",
        "Well, Robert Mugabe's been in power since 1980, and as you said in your introduction, he did a lot of very impressive stuff when he arrived.",
        "The education system in Zimbabwe has been one of the best in Africa.",
        "He introduced good health care.",
        "And there was an enormous amount of optimism and hope and a sort of good example set by somebody who, like Nelson Mandela, had been imprisoned by the previous white regime under Ian Smith, who's actually still alive and still living in Zimbabwe.",
        "And--but since those early optimistic days, he has been accused by his opponents of becoming much more involved with looking after his relatives, six of whom are now in parliament, looking after his political allies, and becoming more and more extreme against any forms of opposition.",
        "Last month they changed--they amended the law so that now if you publish stuff which could be seen to be prejudicial to the state, you can be jailed for up to 20 years.",
        "Previously it was just two years.",
        "And then he's taken what I think is a very counterproductive step against allowing foreign press in, because in many ways Zimbabwe's not as--in such dire straits as many other African countries--Somaliland, Somalia, Algeria, Rwanda and so on.",
        "So there's not the great reason to bar everybody, and as a result of his actions against the media, I think it's rebounded on him because people don't know whether they're being told the truth by him or not.",

        "Are there any coalitions that might try to overthrow him, and who are they?",
        "Yes.",
        "As it happens, one of his central committee, a guy called Pearson Mbalekwa, resigned when I was there at the end of last week, and he said he was perturbed and disturbed by the destruction of the shanty towns.",

        "That's changed a bit.",
        "At the weekend on Sunday, he met the leader of the opposition in Pretoria in South Africa, which is the first time, and there is an indication now that South Africa is getting perturbed by what's happening in Zimbabwe, because lots--an estimated million Zimbabweans have crossed the border because the economy's come to a standstill.",
        "I mean, it was in almost--sometime--the last few days I was there, there was hardly any fuel around.",
        "You couldn't get from one side of the town to the other sometimes in the evening because people juts hadn't got any fuel left, and as a result of that there's been a bleeding of people into South Africa.",
        "So for that reason, they want some kind of change and they want some kind of stability up there, and I think that, rather than anything else, is what will motivate them.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah, exactly, and I think there's been a lot of exaggeration, particularly in the West, you know.",
