        "There's an interesting piece in Politico today saying that really, the only economic numbers that count are those in the swing states.",
        "They're using numbers run through Moody's analytics - which says if you look at the numbers in, say, Colorado, Ohio, Virginia; looks pretty good for President Obama in November.",

        "It's doing better in par - some of the energy states, and some of the energy industries are doing well.",

        "I suspect that - or I don't suspect, but I think there's a strong possibility that we're going to have some sort of European crisis, at some point in the next six months.",
        "And the bad news out of Europe, and how the two candidates respond to it, will swamp everything else.",
        "President Obama's going to have terrible feelings about Europe at the end of his term, whether it's, you know, sooner or later.",
        "Every summer, we've had this happen - where it looked like we were climbing out, it looked like better news was there and then, something bad happened in Europe.",

        "Let's turn our focus to Wisconsin, where the Republican governor, Scott Walker, faces a recall vote on Tuesday; going up against Democrat Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee.",

        "Walker's move to strip public workers of collective-bargaining rights.",

        "And now, Scott Walker has two things going for him.",
        "First, he's taken a huge deficit, and he's turned it into a surplus.",
        "So he can point to that, as a result of what he did.",
        "And the second - he's got sort of a good government thing going.",
        "A lot of people are not particularly pleased with what he did, but they don't think it's the sort of thing you should be recalled over.",
        "So there are a lot of independents who may not be with him substantively, but who don't think this is the sort of thing we should have recall elections about.",

        "Well, after today's jobs report, maybe Tom Barrett's happy he didn't go.",
        "The president is running ahead of Barrett, in the polls in Wisconsin.",
        "And I think that this is a recallable issue because it involved a party in power trying to change the rules of the game - both in voting laws, and in collective bargaining."
