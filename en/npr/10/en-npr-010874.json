        "Stage two is what we've been through in the last two years, when there've been economic shocks around the world.",
        "And so, stage three is the government response to that which has been more aggressive in China than the U.S., where they have more government spending, they've told the banks to lend more money, and the banks have more money to lend.",
        "And so it started to work in China.",
        "And now, we're facing the consequences of that where the Chinese government is always afraid of inflation, so they've started to put on the brakes.",

        "And you've written about this.",
        "But I'm wondering if we are actually starting to witness some of those predictions in real time; that is a China that is increasingly comfortable calling the economic shots for the world.",
        "It's possible.",
        "There will come a time when I change my tune about this.",
        "But my sense is what we're seeing now is the fact of the connectedness of the world's economies, especially China's and the U.S.', rather than the Chinese ability to boss us around or have their way.",

        "And I think the fact that we're going to downturn has brought this surprising news, number one, as you mentioned, that for people who are well-educated and largely white man of middle years and above, the unemployment rate is quite low for them.",
        "And, number two, this article that you mentioned by Don Peck in my magazine, I think is extremely sobering.",
        "He mentions among other things that the effects of the Great Depression of the 1930s in a way never really left.",
        "The cohort of people who were in their 20s then, there were psychological affects, family formation affects, income stream affects.",
        "And so he warns about the dangers of letting this kind of chronic unemployment persist because it can have effects for decades into the future.",
