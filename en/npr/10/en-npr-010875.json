        "It doesn't really matter.",
        "We can change the name of the cities.",
        "In fact, we do frequently.",
        "If it's in the old Iraqi days they had a particular name and now, they have an Afghan name.",
        "And in the future, we'll move to probably change them to another name, just to keep people thinking.",
        "But it will take more than a name change.",

        "And we could look at would you think that a brigade combat team would have to worry about cyberwarfare?",
        "Yes.",
        "So we train now, and I never would have thought 10 years ago that we would do that.",
        "And then we alert a human to come down and take a look at what's going on and pretty much in a nutshell that's it.",
        "So you're monitoring fish stress.",
        "Fish stress.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "The training center has also been bolstering chemical and biological weapons training for the soldiers.",
        "All of this costs money, a lot of money.",
        "The military's training budget is in the billions of dollars, but the budget is shrinking.",
        "Last year, sequestration cuts forced the National Training Center to cancel almost a quarter of its training rotations, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has announced the size of the Army will shrink dramatically in the coming years.",
        "Our recommendations favor a smaller and more capable force, putting a premium on rapidly deployable self-sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries.",
        "Todd Harrison is a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.",
        "He doesn't see any evidence that the Army is actually getting more targeted in a way Hagel envisions.",
        "In fact, he sees training centers like the one at Fort Irwin going back to traditional, very broad training despite looming budget cuts."
