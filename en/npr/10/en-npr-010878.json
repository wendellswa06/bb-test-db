        "And you know, it triggered this whole thing, you know, oh, the black athlete and these guys get too much money.",

        "And you contrast this with the treatment of Phelps - the endorsements, well, listen, you know, it's OK and we stand by him, and you know, boys will be boys.",
        "Tony, it's a complete double standard on the part of the media.",
        "I can't fault Phelps if he smokes reefer, he does, and that's another issue that I feel strongly about, but I think the issue here is the double standard in terms of perception of a white star athlete which has been built up and a black athlete.",
        "And it's old and I'm tired of it but it goes on.",
        "Now, there's another angle to this, potentially, I'd like to get you to respond to it that is, beside the racial difference, Phelps was a superstar, international, global superstar with his performance in the Olympics.",
        "Does that in some way insulate him because of his accomplishments in his sport?",
        "I think it insulates him because the media allows it to insulate him.",
        "And you can argue that it's even worse.",
        "You know, that here is a guy who - we built up as the American hero, and the champion, and the breakfast of champions and, you know, that kind of thing and this is the second time - thing, Tony.",
        "This isn't his first.",
        "Yeah, he had a DUI before this.",
        "Yeah, there was a DUI and now this.",
        "And again, everybody is saying well, he's young.",
        "I'm just saying, then if - if that's going to be the standard, then let's let everybody off the hook.",
        "If youth is the thing that we are talking about here, then let's let everybody off the hook.",
        "But if we're going to hang people for these indiscretions, particularly the second time, let's hang anybody.",
        "I think what lets him off the hook is that a lot of companies have a lot money tied up in him.",
        "Now, Leigh Fletcher, how did you and your professional colleagues let Anthony Wesley in Australia beat you to the discovery?",
        "All right, we'll have to keep our eye on that one.",
        "You mention the Super Bowl.",
        "I was going to bring up Santonio Holmes but you did it.",
        "You know, last year you and I had a bet about the Super Bowl which I won.",
        "This year, I guess you are afraid...",
        "No (laughing).",
        "To bet - to bet with me.",
        "Were you surprised that it turned out the way that it did?",

        "Our time is out, but I'm going to ask you about this before I let you go.",
        "Talking about perfect performances, two people strolled in to New York's Madison Square Garden and lit up the Knicks back to back, Kobe Bryant 61 on one night and LeBron James, I think, it was 52 the next night and a triple double.",

        "In the Troy Davis case, one of the issues that has really come to the forefront is that the majority of the witnesses in the case are now saying that their own testimony was flawed or coerced or fictitious.",
        "And in a case like that, why wouldn't there be a new trial?",
        "Well, there - as I understand it, at least in Georgia - and there was a very close decision of the Georgia Supreme Court, I believe four to three, on recantation.",
