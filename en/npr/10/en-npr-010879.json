        "The company has an ambitious plan to hang thousands of miles of new fiber optic cable.",
        "The advantage that that gives us is that as the explosion of data speeds and requirements takes place, we have the capacity to take that all the way to the customer.",

        "Verizon technicians are lashing fiber optic cable onto telephone lines in Schwenksville, Pennsylvania, on the edge of the Philadelphia suburbs.",

        "You run into situations like, you know, if you're going to run into a whole string of trees like this, you're not going to get 5,000 feet up in a day.",
        "Fiber optic cable can carry many times as much data as traditional copper wiring, but it's expensive to deploy and every little delay adds to the cost.",
        "Verizon says it spent a billion dollars last year alone building its so-called FiOS Network.",
        "With so much money involved, Wall Street investors are eager to see the payoff, but Verizon's Eric Rabe says that will come a few years down the road as consumers demand bigger and bigger pipes to deliver their digital entertainment.",
        "As consumers use the Internet, they use video--that requires more and more bandwidth.",
        "And we're now typically deploying networks that are far, far faster than anything we've ever had in the past because of that demand.",
        "But there is concern among local governments that not everyone is going to be served by high-speed fiber optic networks.",
        "Analyst Blair Levin says local officials are worried that Verizon's FiOS and similar services will only be available in the most affluent neighborhoods."

        "What the municipalities want is the ability to tell the telephone companies that they have to build out to the entire area.",
        "And what the fear is on the part of the municipalities is that projects like FiOS, the way they're building it, they're only really building out to about 50 percent of the homes.",
        "And Levin says there's another reason Wall Street is wary of fiber optic networks.",
        "He says they may wind up facing competition from emerging wireless technologies.",
        "For instance, WiMAX, a wireless technology that promises to deliver broadband over great distances.",
        "If WiMAX technology--a technology a lot of folks are talking about--actually works, you can put an antenna on a big building downtown and suddenly the entire downtown area is connected with very fast broadband.",
        "For now, WiMAX remains relatively untested in the wild, but a technology called Wi-Fi is already widely available.",
        "Wi-Fi uses a number of smaller antennas called nodes to build a mesh network.",
        "Wi-Fi is slightly slower than cable or DSL, but it's cheap to build and operate, and that's making it popular with cities that want to offer affordable wireless service to their residents.",
        "Cole Reinwand is a vice president at EarthLink.",
        "The cities, I believe--at least those that I've talked to--don't believe that there are enough choices or that the broadband availability is there yet.",
        "While reports and so forth suggest that there's universal coverage available, some of the poorer neighborhoods really haven't been built out, and, you know, DSL or cable is not available.",
        "I can't really comment as to the training that they get overseas.",
        "But I know here in America, we have not seen one data point saying that we had a performance or maintenance issue with it.",
        "So when you look at what's going on with Supreme Court now, and with these moves to make exoneration a big part of the criminal process, and the fact is, more than a hundred people have been freed from death row since 1976, what do you see as the trends in how the death penalty is going to be meted out in America?",
        "Do you see legal changes coming from the top, from the Supreme Court, or from state levels, local levels?",
        "That's a good question.",
        "I mean, the Supreme Court, as you remember last term, had the Kennedy vs. Louisiana case, and was asked to reconsider that, where the court ruled five to four that the death penalty for child rape violated the Constitution.",
        "And the court in that case and many other cases looks at whether there's a national consensus in terms of mostly state and federal government legislation.",
        "And then secondly, exercises its own independent judgment informed by its precedents and its understanding of the Constitution and the right it secures in deciding whether the death penalty is appropriate.",
        "But - and some justices, for example Justice Stevens, recently said that he almost never thinks that it is appropriate.",
        "And earlier justices like Burton and Marshall said that they believed it was never proper.",
        "And so I think there is beginning to be some national re-examination, and some states have suspended the death penalty.",
        "I believe Illinois did because they felt it couldn't be properly administered.",
        "But I think we're going to see development, state by state, and I don't know that we're going to see the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court say that the death penalty is unconstitutional."
