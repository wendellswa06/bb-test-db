        "The engineers there were not able to go back to reset the wells due to the fact that Gadhafi forces have came to that area and taken their vehicles.",
        "So - and they threatened them with their weapons and so on.",
        "And so the engineers are afraid to go back to the well to reset them as well as they are not able to move around because there is no vehicles to do so.",
        "Whatever the explanation for the water crisis, Ahmish says once the pumps are switched back on, it will take a couple of days before water will reach the capital.",
        "He says the rebel leadership is trying to organize a force to go secure the wells, but it's unclear how long that will take.",
        "What is clear is that the Libyan capital is going to be without tap water well into next week at a minimum."
