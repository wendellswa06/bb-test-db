        "You know, I would say that there's lots of people that run around saying things like, you'll only survive two minutes in the water on the Beaufort Sea, and this sort of thing.",
        "And I think where people are mistaken about that is when you hit the water, you start to gasp, and you have this gasp reflex.",
        "And if you get a lung full of water while you're gasping then you sort of done, you're drowning.",
        "You actually have quite a long time before the next problems start to arise.",
        "And the very next problem is that your muscles start to seize up.",
        "So, if you're actually swimming, you lose the ability to swim.",
        "And that takes, under most circumstances, much longer than five minutes.",
        "You made me think about something that I don't think I'd ever really considered before, which is why we shiver.",

        "But, it actually - it's serving a purpose, when we shiver.",
        "Well, it's serving a purpose.",
        "Sure, it's trying to warm you up.",

        "They want to take a stand and fight for larger models, to fight for less airbrushing representation, to fight for more reality.",
        "But, you know, when you think about your life in the world of beauty and the fact that you were someone who won the swimsuit competition in the 2004 Miss America Contest, which is huge, and you were out there in front of millions of people watching you on television.",
        "Well, that's the whole thing.",

        "And even in - I think what's important for women to realize, that girl up on the stage with the makeup on her legs and her stomach sucked in and high heels on with the bathing suit has just as many insecurities about what's going on in her body as the girl watching the television.",
        "And that's why I just decided to take one for the team and put my own issues out there and talk about how I felt during this whole thing and talk about how I feel now and how I felt when I was a teen and how we all deal with body drama, regardless of your situation in life.",
        "And that was really important to me, because everything is so accessible to even younger and younger ages now, that 15 year olds are expected to have on $400 jeans and $500 pumps and carry $600 bags and wear push-up bras and have lip waxed and wear tons of makeup at such early ages.",
