        "Wow.",
        "And do you have a question for Will?",
        "I do.",
        "About a year ago, I really started getting into crossword puzzles.",
        "And I'd be interested in hearing what goes into constructing a crossword puzzle.",
        "What do you think, Will?",
        "People ask, you know, what comes first, the answers or the clues?",
        "And of course, it's the answers.",
        "You construct a crossword exactly the opposite of the way you solve one.",
        "You start with the answer grid.",
        "In fact, you start with your theme, if you have that, construct the grid and then you write the clues at the end.",
        "Very good.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I love ground squirrels.",
        "They're very common in Alaska up in the mountains around Anchorage and further north in the lowlands.",
        "They're very common.",
        "And they look like little prairie dogs.",
        "They stand on their hind legs and they look around.",
        "So, people are used to tree squirrels or grey squirrels - they're a bit different than our arctic ground squirrel.",
        "But in the winter, he crawls into a burrow and hibernates.",
        "And as he hibernates, he begins to cool off.",
        "And in fact, cools off to a temperature that's just below the freezing point of water.",
        "And when he hits that temperature, when one would think that this animal is, for all practical purposes dead, that its neurons aren't firing and nothing's going on in this animal, he spontaneously starts to shiver.",
        "And I don't think it's very well known.",
        "In fact I don't think it's known at all what triggers him to shiver when everything's sort of shut down.",
        "But if he didn't shiver his temperature would continue to drop and eventually he would in fact freeze.",
        "So, he starts to shiver and as he shivers his brain goes into a standard sleeping pattern.",
        "And he starts to dream and he has squirrel dreams, so maybe dreaming about summer is what many people suggest.",
        "So, he shivers for a while and dreams for a while - maybe a day - and then he starts to cool off again.",
        "And he goes through the cycle of cooling off down to a freezing point and then shivering and et cetera, all through the winter until summer arrives.",
        "And he crawls out of his burrow and starts eating nuts.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And who knows what he has been dreaming about?",
        "Who knows, that's right."

        "Well, I guess it's two things.",
        "And the first thing is that, especially living in Alaska, cold is sort of all around you all the time.",
        "And it seems like a subject that's been forgotten.",

        "So, I thought it was an important topic to have a look at and an exciting topic and full of drama, with people dying and being hurt and explorers surviving or not surviving, and this sort of thing.",
        "The other thing that attracted me to it is that I always felt like cold has gotten sort of a bad rap, you know.",
        "I actually grew up in the Eastern and Southeastern United States, and there cold is just something that people dread.",
        "And they turn the thermostat up way too high and wear sweaters when it's actually pretty warm, and are constantly worried about getting cold.",
        "And in fact, in my experience, cold helps you feel alive.",
        "You know, you walk outside on a brisk day and it's - nothing like getting a good breath of cold air and suddenly you're awake.",

        "I could also see, I guess, as the spot rotated a little further around into view in the nighttime hours of Monday morning that it was not the circular shape that you would see or that you would expect to see from Earth if it was simply a shadow projected from one of the moons.",
        "The spot looked very much like it was circular on the surface of the planet, but we were seeing it at an oblique angle.",
        "So it was definitely something very unusual and very out of the ordinary.",
        "Well, when you realized that, how did you let the rest of the world know?",
        "I was up here at the house, starting to send emails at about 2:00 Monday morning, and really, at that stage, was shaking with excitement and hoping desperately that Leigh or Glenn or any of their colleagues were close to their computer and were able to pick up my email.",
        "I didn't know at that stage that Glenn and Leigh had time already organized for imaging Jupiter that same day.",
        "I was hoping that they would pick up on the emails and be able to organize time.",
        "Did you know these folks or did you just meet them as a result of this discovery?"
