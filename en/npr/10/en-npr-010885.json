        "I have corresponded with Glenn many times over the last few months, or last couple of years.",
        "It's becoming more common these days for the professional astronomers to take images from amateurs on a semi-regular basis just to keep an eye on Jupiter and see if anything unusual is happening.",
        "Who is Glenn?",
        "Okay.",
        "Glenn is Dr. Glenn Orton, that is Leigh's colleague.",
        "He's a - you have to correct me here if I'm wrong, Leigh - he's a planetary scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's absolutely correct.",
        "Glenn Orton has been at the Jet Propulsion Lab for over 30 years now and has been involved in outer planet gas giants and dynamics for all of that time.",
        "Now, Leigh Fletcher, Anthony gave you this image - gave you this heads-up.",
        "It's up to you, I guess, not so much him, to figure out what happened.",
        "So, what do we know so far?",
        "Well, a lot of the things that we're finding out about this incredible collision are based on comparisons to a similar event back in July of 1994.",
        "In fact, as the media have been reporting, the event was almost 15 years ago to the day for Shoemaker-Levy 9.",
        "Now, when we look at the impact scar itself, we're seeing that there's a small, dark localized feature and a region of debris that's extending out to the northwest.",
        "Well, that already tells us something about the impact.",
        "What happens is you have this huge amount of energy and momentum of the impact as it plummets in toward its fate in the Jovian atmosphere.",
        "And it creates, when it first hits, a kind of splash back along the direction that the impact came from, so in this case from the northwest.",
        "And that splash back of material pulls a lot of ammonia gas - there is aerosols, particulates, dust and some really exotic molecules and particles high up into the Jovian atmosphere.",
        "And what we can do with the infrared telescopes here on Earth is sort of determine the three-dimensional structure of that splash back.",
        "And it's that splash that we've been now tracking over the past five days since this impact occurred.",
        "There's a huge amount of work to do.",
        "And I have to say that the professional astronomers - there's an international team now involved in trying to determine the aftermath of this event.",
        "Just to go back to your original question, we believe, by comparison to Shoemaker-Levy 9, that the impact itself was of the order of a few hundred meters across.",
        "And given the prevalence of large, icy material in the outer solar system, it seems likely that this was an icy body that collided with Jupiter.",
        "So let's take a question.",
        "I have Alister(ph) in Oregon.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "The gentleman already answered a portion of my question.",
        "But I was just trying to visualize as far as what it would have looked like with this impact on the surface of Jupiter.",
        "I've heard two conflicting accounts, that the surface of Jupiter is almost kind of like a semi-liquid hydrogen type of mass there below the gaseous outer atmosphere or is just a solid mass of swirling gas.",
        "So what exactly did this rock or icy body hit, and what is the effect of the impact on the actual surface of Jupiter?",
        "Leigh Fletcher, I had exactly the same question.",
        "When you talk about debris, what was that stuff?",
        "That's a really great question.",
        "And what you have to visualize here is a rocky body that's plummeting down through the various gassy layers of Jupiter's outer atmosphere.",
        "Now, Jupiter is a big ball of hydrogen and helium gas.",
        "That's the most dominant gasses that are there.",
        "But there's also a lot of trace compounds, things like ammonia and methane and various other heavier molecules, hydrocarbons, for example.",
        "Now, these - ammonia in particular, at a particular altitude in Jupiter's atmosphere, starts to condense.",
        "And if you imagine an image of Jupiter in your mind's eye and you see those incredible banded structures and the Great Red Spot, all of these different colors, what you're seeing there is the cloud tops, these condensed molecules in the atmosphere of Jupiter.",
        "Now, as the rock came in plummeting towards these cloud tops, it would have been disrupted, it would have started to vaporize and it would deposit all of its kinetic energy into the surrounding atmosphere.",
        "That initiates this huge splash back and plume of material.",
        "And what we're seeing in the (unintelligible) and what Anthony was seeing in the visible, that dark patch, is a sort of dusty aerosol deposits as an aftermath of that collision.",
        "But you're right.",
        "This is a giant fluid ball of gas, where the pressure increases as you go down towards the center of the planet.",
        "Thanks, Alister.",
        "Thank you.",

        "One of them is as big as the Pacific Ocean.",
        "If that is the case, how was this missed?",
        "I mean, this thing has got - must have been huge.",
        "If we would not have had Jupiter on the way to act as a magnet to suck this thing in, how soon would we have noticed this thing bearing - I mean, if it was going in our general direction, how soon would we have noticed this thing traveling at the speed it is or the size it is?",
        "And two, is there any evidence to suggest that it might be part of a field that was included in the Levy comet?",
        "Leigh Fletcher?",
        "Okay.",
        "Let's start with the beginning of that question.",
        "Now, the - we've got to distinguish here between the size of the impact field, the ejector and the debris that we're seeing, and the size of the body that caused the impact itself.",
        "Now, what happens is this plume of material we've been talking about, right, is so high in the atmosphere, that it's easily spread over an area that's - yes, you're absolutely right, the size of the Pacific, comparable in scale to the size of the Earth.",
        "But the impact itself was much, much, much smaller than that.",
        "When we look to the - at least, 16 fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9 that collided with Jupiter in 1994, they were, the absolute maximum, a kilometer across.",
        "And it's more reasonable to suppose that this particular object was only a few tens to maybe a few hundreds of meters across.",
        "Now, if you imagine that the way that we spot this features is by the reflected light from the Sun, and out in the orbit of Jupiter, there's not a lot of that light available for us to spot these things.",
        "In fact, Shoemaker-Levy 9 was only observed by Gene Shoemaker and his team because they were doing a very deep sky survey at the time.",
        "Imagine as well - another great example is the fact that Saturn's rings contains material that can be of these meters to tens of meter sizes, and we have no hope of resolving those from planet Earth.",
        "So I find the fact that we didn't spot it not unsurprising."

        "Anthony Wesley, what type of setup do you have in your backyard?",
        "Are we talking hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and your family's disserted you because of your obsession?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "No.",
        "Not quite that radical.",
        "No. In fact, all I have is what would be considered a relatively average - maybe slightly more than average - setup for a backyard amateur astronomer these days.",
        "It would have been the case, I suppose, that if we look back 10 to 20 years ago, perhaps more like 20 years ago, your average home astronomer would have a telescope, somewhere in the six to eight-inch diameter mirror.",
        "And as time has gone by now with the increase in technology and the ability for manufacturers to make these optical components with great precision at ever larger sizes now - really, the 14 1/2-inch telescope that I have here would really be considered a midrange or a mid - or middle of the class in terms of size.",
        "What does it take to get into this?",
        "Can somebody get into it for a couple of hundred bucks or does it take a little more than that?",
        "Look, people can get into it for almost nothing.",
        "Astronomy, like many of these hobbies, has a whole range of different areas.",
        "And really, people I know can get into astronomy with nothing more than a good pair of binoculars.",
        "Probably, the most important thing that you need to think of if you're considering getting into astronomy or if you have some interest in it is to contact some other people in your area that are already into the hobby and maybe are members of a local club or society, and just take the opportunity to go talk with them and maybe look at what they've got, look through their telescopes to get a bit of an idea of the slippery slope before you start going down that path, because this hobby is like cameras and it's like many other hobbies: Once you start, it's a great way to spend a lot of money.",
        "So what do you plan to discover next?",
        "Look, I don't know.",
