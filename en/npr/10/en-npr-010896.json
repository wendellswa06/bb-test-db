        "Well, tell the audience briefly what happened.",
        "Well, it was just, you know, me and Dwight used to - Dwight Gooden, which is my uncle, he was always, you know, he used to get in a lot of fights, you know, when I didn't want to play baseball he wanted me to play baseball.",
        "So he used to get mad at me outright and we used to fight.",
        "And on this particular day, he really wanted to play and I didn't, and I chose not to play at all.",

        "And he just did it out of just being rebellious or whatever but, you know, it hurt me at that time.",
        "But you know, and that's when, you know, we started, you know, me and my mom and my dad, my stepdad, started talking about it and they kind of revealed it to me.",
        "And then we got it all out in open and I was able to put it behind me.",
        "Well, I was thinking about that moment in the book when you talk about the funeral where you went and you had a revelation even that day.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I mean, that was something from a total different aspect of it.",
        "You know, I was just going to the funeral thinking, you know, his was name was Sheffield, and I get there and I read the obituary and there was a Johnson on there.",
        "And I was - it kind of confused me a little bit.",
        "You know, I was thinking, you know, this don't make sense, a man to change his name (unintelligible) he gets married, it should be the other way around.",
        "It's the woman who changes her name once she gets married.",
        "So I started getting confused and then once I found out and then I've met my half-brother at the funeral.",
        "So he was in the military and that kind of like set on me and that's when I asked my mom a lot of questions about, you know, how did I get my name and all of these things, and then she broke it down to me.",
        "And then I was over it.",
        "You know, Gary, you've been on a number of teams.",
        "Let's talk about that for a moment, including the champion Florida Marlins, of course.",
        "Championships aside, that seemed to be, from what I've read about you and what I read in the book, that your happiest time in the Majors so far, was it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, the thing is that when you win with 25 guys and coach and staff and organization, that's probably the most memorable time because you remember every player that was on that team.",
        "You know, outspoken - that word is an understatement when it's applied to you.",
        "Sometimes being outspoken is a leader's role.",
        "What motivates you when you say things that you do?",
        "Things like the recent comments about the Latin ballplayers.",
        "Is that an example of being a leader in your opinion?",
        "Well, that's part of it, but I mean, it's not all of it.",
        "It's just a matter - I'm called to do certain things.",
        "You know, and a lot of people don't look at it that way, but I know that I'm called to do certain things because the repercussions are I'm not concerned about, you know, what people think, what they're going to say.",
        "Somebody got a problem, well, it's too bad and I'm probably - if something come up tomorrow and I need to address, I address that too."
