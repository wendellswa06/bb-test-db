        "Yes.",
        "The Under Nile, which is what you're referring to, is a myth -not real as far as I know.",
        "But it was something that I kind of picked up on as a footnote to some other ancient Egyptian mythology, about the area where Cairo is now.",
        "It was not called Cairo during the time of the ancient Egyptians.",
        "But I remember hearing from an Egyptologist friend that there was a myth that began very early in ancient Egyptian history that told of a passage to the underworld that you could get to through a river that ran beneath the Nile backwards.",
        "The Nile, as you know, is one of the only rivers or the only river that runs south to north in the world, and so the Under Nile, would be something that ran north to south through which you could enter the underworld.",
        "And I thought it was a really interesting idea, and again, something that kind of begged to be represented in comics, which lends itself so well to these kinds of myths.",
        "Another character, of course, is the jinn, the genie - the more familiar name here in the West - and obviously, another fantastical character.",
        "Yeah, certainly.",
        "You know, what I tried to do in the book was kind of draw together these layers of mythology that kind of inhabit and are a part of Cairo and the Middle East.",
        "And the jinn or genies are something drawn from Islamic mythology.",
        "They're mentioned in the Koran.",
        "And if you talk to people in Cairo and in most of the Middle East, they're accepted as being as real as your eye but simply something that you can't see.",
        "And so I definitely wanted to draw on that and kind of weave the various mythologies together and kind of see what happened.",
        "Modern politics obviously plays an important part, too.",
        "Two of your other characters, one of them a woman Israeli soldier who finds herself caught up in this.",
        "It's a little too complicated to explain in the time we've got.",
        "And the other, a very troubled student who is flying to the Middle East for very different purposes, not anticipating, just being a tourist.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's - something I also wanted to do when I was writing the book is present a more personal look.",
        "The politics of the Middle East than the one that we typically get in the news media, something that was less abbreviated and more human.",
        "And I think fiction and especially magical realism and fantasy are a great way to kind of unpack some of these agendas, and show not what people believe but why they believe them.",
        "Because in a place where you can't expect the outcome of your actions, in a world that you don't recognize, the status quo disappears and what you're left with is the human element of these political conflicts.",
        "And so that was something that was important to me, to have people and characters in the book with conflicting ideologies but to see how he would interact as people not simply as kind of puppets who are representative of some ideal, but of complex human beings, who believes things for a reason and from their own experience.",
        "And obviously, giving your interest in comic books from when you were a child, the graphic novel forums seem to be just about right.",
        "Nevertheless, this is your first one.",
        "They're not so easy to write, are they?",
        "No, they're not.",
        "It's a really interesting medium to work in and, you know, if - to tell the truth, probably my favorite medium to work in of all of the mediums that I do use, you have to be - when you're writing a comic book or a graphic novel - very, very structure conscious because usually, you have a very strict page limit, you have to envision not only how the story is told but how it's going to appear visually on the page, and how one image will connect to the next.",
        "And it's really a very different skill to learn than any other kind of writing.",
        "But once you get the hang of it, it really - it opens a lot of doors and to ways of storytelling that we don't typically get in other, you know, in prose fiction or in movies…",
        "We're also…"

        "…so it's a great medium.",
        "As a journalist, you're accustomed to deadlines.",
        "I don't think people quite understand, maybe not quite so much for graphic novels, but regular comic book's very difficult deadlines, too.",
        "Oh, yeah, certainly, certainly.",
        "And it's something that, you know, colleagues of mine in the comics industry talk about a lot as sting on that monthly deadline where you have to keep a story going from months to months and maintain that momentum, but also taking to consideration the amount of time between when each issue comes out, so what the reader is going to feel between the issues that he picks up for month to month.",
        "So it is a great medium for a type A personality, if you can handle that kind of schedule.",
        "And finally, when you called the Atlantic Monthly to propose a piece, has anybody said that, say, are you the Willa Wilson who writes comic books?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
