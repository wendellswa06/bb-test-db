        "Yesterday, President Barack Obama signed that tax cut package that was a result of a compromise he reached with congressional Republicans but riled a lot of his own Democrats.",
        "During the bill signing ceremony, Mr. Obama said the new legislation would help the middle class.",

        "Yeah, it does.",
        "For the Democrats and President Obama, it's really a turn back toward a focus on the immediate condition of the economy.",
        "They were elected in November '08, the recession was really at its nadir at that time, and they spent the transition and the first few months in office focusing on stopping this crisis and recession, and largely succeeded.",
        "And at that point they turned toward longer term things - health care reform, financial regulation - and hoped essentially the improvement in the economy would continue.",
        "And they were wrong about that; it didn't continue.",
        "And so, or it continued only for a little bit.",
        "And so by the time you get to the spring of 2010, the recovery starts to stall out.",
        "And really we have had only no economic progress this year on the short-term stuff.",
        "The Democrats were very much punished for it at the polls.",
        "And with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, the Democrats realized that extending the Bush tax cuts for the high end and cutting the estate tax were very important to the Republicans, and that they could negotiate essentially a second stimulus with that, and that's what this is."

        "Yeah.",
