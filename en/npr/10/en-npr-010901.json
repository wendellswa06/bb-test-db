        "I mean, certainly the school district says it's not true.",

        "Very much.",
        "It's actually led to a discussion of whether Ohio and a lot of other states should be starting to think about education funding as funding that goes to the kid, not to the school district, and if there's some way of pooling that money so if kids want to go to any public school district in the state, they can go.",
