        "Hey, Rachel.",
        "So, broadly, what kind of reputation does this jail have?",
        "Well, it's really known for a lot of these high-profile figures that have been held there before and during their trials.",
        "We're talking about the mob boss John Gotti, the financial fraudster Bernie Madoff, the drug lord \"\"El Chapo\"\" Joaquin Guzman and now Jeffrey Epstein.",
        "It's also known for pretty tough conditions there.",
        "Prisoners usually stay six to 12 months while they're going through the legal process.",
        "Very limited education or recreation facilities.",
        "And I spoke with David Patton.",

        "Now, this is a nonprofit that represents several hundred of the roughly 800 prisoners that are there at any given time.",
        "And he said some of their clients, or actually many of their clients, are often initially held at Rikers Island.",
        "Now, this is the New York City jail notorious for rough conditions.",
        "And here's what he said about it.",
        "When we first meet them, they'll ask us if there's any way they can go back to Rikers because, as terrible as the conditions are there, it can be worse at the MCC.",
        "Wow, they'd rather go back to Rikers.",
        "But getting back to the security element of this, Greg, El Chapo?",
        "I mean, this is a guy who was famous for breaking out of prisons, so security, you would expect to be airtight.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "And in addition to the cases I've just mentioned, like El Chapo, you've had high-profile terrorism cases, I mean, dating back to the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 and then more after 9/11.",
        "But the MCC, as it's known, like many other federal jails and prisons, is considered understaffed.",
        "And this is according to Eric Young.",
        "He heads the federal union that represents correctional officers.",
        "He says there are simply too few officers working too many hours in overtime shifts.",
        "He says this problem is chronic, and there's thousands that need to be hired nationwide.",
        "And here's what he said about the MCC.",
        "We've been ringing a bell.",
        "I could tell you there are dozens and dozens of missing correction officers at the MCC.",
        "So they feel like they've been raising the red flag here.",
        "Attorney General Barr has promised a thorough investigation.",
        "But what about all those folks you talked to; are they expecting any changes to come down the pike?"

        "The airport, its direct, indirect and associated economic impact, it really adds up to about 5% of the city's GDP, so that's where they want to hit the government.",
        "At the same time, it's also a highly symbolic place.",
        "They can get their message across, out to international travelers and, yes, internationally, people are fascinated by airports as a hub of - as the symbol of globalization.",
        "Right, sure.",

        "Earlier, we had reports of about 190,000 officers police officers doing a drill ahead of the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.",

        "China really won't stand to gain anything from sending in People's Liberation Army troops into Hong Kong.",
