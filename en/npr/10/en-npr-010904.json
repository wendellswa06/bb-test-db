        "And the other factor that I looked at was the population changes.",
        "There was, interestingly, in the FBI statistics in 2006, a sudden drop in population in the outlying areas of about a quarter to a third.",
        "Well, that reflects geographic redefinitions, and it reflects different ways of estimating population.",
        "You have to be very skeptical of this kind of statistic based on just two time points when there are so many other factors involved.",
        "So, I think in the end, it's not that I don't think that crime is an issue.",

        "In fact, it's gone down mostly.",

        "And there are other people, though, who looked at those same numbers - and, again, going back to that original Times' article say violent crime might be down - and this is, again, looking at the numbers for the state overall - but property crime went up.",
        "And that might be the kind of crime - it's more common than violent crime - and it might have impact on more people's lives.",
        "Well, it could be.",
        "Let's all understand, too, that the vast majority of property crimes, about three quarters of property crimes, are low level thefts, thefts involving property worth $10, $25, $50.",

        "But the problem with that statistic is that if you take any population, even red-blooded Americans who are poor, underclass, lack opportunity, you will also find a higher rate of criminality.",
