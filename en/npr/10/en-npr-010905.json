        "Frank, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it.",

        "But people do it.",
        "It is illegal.",

        "Drop houses, for those who aren't familiar with the term, are sort of holding areas, holding places for people along the various smuggling routes once they're across the border?",
        "Correct.",

        "And obviously these are controlled by the same criminal elements who smuggle the people across the border in the first place.",
