        "Probably there was more kind of a show of it on the streets than here in Havana.",
        "People are out talking about it, walking through the streets, chanting.",
        "I've talked to people in Artemisa, which is another province to the west of Havana, and they all watched on television - they watched both Raul Castro announcing it and Obama announcing it.",
        "So they were just thanking them both - very, very positive about President Obama, etc.",
        "Could you just briefly remind us what has the embargo meant over the years for the average Cuban?",
        "Well, you know, I've lived here.",
        "It's really meant that you live in a pressure cooker.",
        "It always hangs over everything.",
        "It hung over things like not being able to see your family because they're outside of the country, though that now has changed.",

        "These talks have now been going on for 18 months.",
        "You know, I'm just curious what about the Cuban government?",
        "Do you think it's up to meeting the challenge of an open Cuba?",
        "Yeah, I think it is up to meeting the challenge.",
        "I think they made a decision four or five years ago that as part of their efforts to reform their economy, four or five years ago they started building these big marinas for boats that never came.",
        "They started talking about golf courses.",
        "They started building a huge, new container port on the northern coast near Havana.",
        "And at the time we all said, well, they must know something we don't know because these projects make no sense without improved relations with the U.S.",
        "So I think they made the decision at the same time that they decided to start changing their economy that they needed to find a way to mend tensions with the United States.",

        "New York has one of the biggest prison systems in the country - more than 52,000 inmates - so the effort here will be watched closely.",
        "Alphonso David, a lawyer for Governor Cuomo's office, says this deal will make New York's correctional facilities more humane without hurting security.",
        "This agreement will not only decrease the number of people that enter into solitary confinement, but it will create a safer environment for both inmates and staff."

        "When he went to prison in 2002, he gave a prepared statement and said, I've never understood jihad to mean anti-Americanism or terrorism.",
        "I condemn terrorism on every level, he said at the time.",
        "But we do have to note the terrorism - the Taliban, rather - was already a very notorious group when he joined - had an abominable human rights record.",

        "Well, Farai, you can probably guess what came next.",
        "An avalanche of emails, some disappointed, others downright nasty.",
        "Here's a pretty even-tempered note we got from Dana Franchito(ph) in South Wellfleet, Massachusetts.",
        "I understand that the Pope, as a young man, was a member of the Hitler Youth because he didn't have a choice.",
        "But there is no known record of his having been an active, willing member of the Nazi Party.",

        "Peter Wiseacre (ph) in Ithaca, New York, heard that conversation and sent us this.",

        "One, I would argue, probably invited more scrutiny from the media than the color of his skin.",
        "In 1996, he was quoted as saying, 'why should I reward someone who doesn't like the president?",
        "So they can use funds to try to campaign against the president?",
