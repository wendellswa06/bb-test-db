        "Morally, I find what the judge said very appealing, but legally, it's not a form of discrimination to provide only religious groups with exemptions.",
        "What about conscientious objection?",
        "How is that different?",
        "It's actually fine if the government chooses to give exemptions to people with secular motivations as it did, in fact, at the time of the Vietnam War when it came to conscientious objection.",

        "Yes.",
        "We're in the middle of a historic shift.",
