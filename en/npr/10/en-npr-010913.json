        "Well, NASA is involved in a lot of research on global climate change, and so what does it mean that the head of NASA is kind of doubting that it's a problem?",
        "I still hope that his remarks are perhaps out of context.",
        "On the surface, they appear to be remarkably uninformed about the status of our understanding.",
        "Because as our paper pointed out, if we continue on the path we're on, we will be producing a different planet which will have devastating implications for many people on the planet.",
        "Has he read your paper?",
        "Apparently not.",
        "Will you be asking him, in the light of his comments, to read it and to have a conversation with you about it?",
        "Well, I don't normally bump into him at my level in NASA.",
        "But if I have the opportunity, I certainly would like to talk to him about it.",
        "What kind of signals do you get from your bosses, from the people there at NASA, in terms of your research?",
        "Are you directed in any way as to where you should point your research?",
        "Well, the signals that we've got really come from the research support, which has decreased dramatically in the last couple of years.",
        "There's a 30 percent cut last year in the research and analysis budget for Earth science.",
        "And that's the money that funds climate research in NASA.",
        "A 30 percent cut.",
        "What does that translate into?",
        "Well, that's a huge cut.",
        "That's decimating the program."

        "So are there key areas that you think are vital to research that you just can't afford to research right now?",
        "Well, the biggest problem is the measurements that need to be made.",
        "Those - the budget for satellites has not been cut as much, but it's been cut to the point where we cannot afford as many satellite missions.",
        "And measurements are the foundation of understanding.",
        "Why do you think Michael Griffin would make comments such as these, kind of - sort of downplaying the significance of global warming?",
        "I have no idea.",
        "It's an amazing coincidence that it's at the same time as our paper just came out and the president's statements.",

        "And we'll talk about some controversy over that good news, and the Millennium Development goals."

        "In any case, BP continues to collect at least some of the crude with the cap they've placed over the top of the ruptured well.",
        "Authorities earlier reported the cap collected around 460,000 gallons on Sunday and that it was capturing anywhere from a third to three-quarters of this oil spewing out of the damaged riser pipe that was cut as part of the containment effort, increasing the flow as a side effect.",

        "And there is news today about the amount of oil that is being captured by this cap that BP placed on it over the weekend, and then it runs through a pipe up to the surface.",
        "So the efforts to control and contain the oil have been moderately successful and prevented this from being an even worse catastrophe than it could be.",
