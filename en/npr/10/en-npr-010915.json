        "Now, there are a couple of efforts under way, as I understand it, to improve things, one of which involves bringing a rig from the North Sea?",
        "That's right.",
        "That's the I'll get to that in a moment, but let me tell you about the first thing they're planning to do, which is that you may recall a week or two ago, they were trying to top-kill the well by dumping, pumping oil mud, essentially drilling mud.",
        "It's not really mud.",
        "It's just sort of a chemical slurry that includes mud and other and stuff.",
        "They were trying to pump it down these two lines that go into the blowout preventer and pump enough mud in there to stop the oil from flowing.",
        "That, as we know, was a failure, but the lines are still there, and somebody at BP realized, oh, well, what if we run these lines backwards, and instead of putting things down those lines, we can pull oil up those lines.",
        "And so they are actually now in the process of sort of re-plumbing this kind of elaborate system so that they can bring oil up those lines.",
        "And they can bring about 5,000 barrels a day, maybe a little bit more, up to a separate ship through those lines.",
        "That ship can handle about 5,000 barrels a day.",
        "They could probably bring more up the lines, but then they couldn't deal with it once it got to the surface.",
        "So that's the intermediate step, and they may be able to do that by the end of this week.",
        "So by the end of the week, we may be able to deal with or see 20,000 barrels a day, approximately, not going into the Gulf.",
        "There likely will still be some oil going into the Gulf beyond that.",
        "And so then the question is what next?",
        "And so BP finally decided, well, what we need to do is get a bigger oil processing vessel, which happens to be in the North Sea at the moment.",
        "So they're going to have to bring it across the Atlantic, which will take a couple of weeks.",
        "We dont think of these things as sailing vessels, but in fact, they can be towed across the ocean.",
        "Yeah, I have actually gotten conflicting reports about whether this is a rig or a vessel, some sort of a ship.",
        "But yeah, but either can come across on its own steam, or it can be put on top of an enormous transport ship and be brought across that way.",
        "So I hope we'll learn more about as I say, we've heard conflicting reports about whether it's a rig or a ship, but we'll get that straightened out.",
        "Richard Harris, bringing us up to date on the spill in the Gulf and efforts to contain it.",

        "Hey, Neal.",
        "Hi.",
        "I can be pretty direct with my question here.",
        "I keep seeing a lot of numbers, barrels, gallons of oil leaked per day.",
        "We all see the video.",
        "We all see the pictures of the where the plumes are.",
        "And we all know that this is a very, you know, this is a huge catastrophe.",
        "But I just want and I would love, like, a one-second or one-sentence summary: how big of a deal is this?",
        "Is this a disaster of Biblical proportions?",
        "Is it apocalyptic?",
        "Just something to give me, like, a finite grasp of the magnitude of this event.",
        "Well, it's hard to do that in a single sentence, except I can say it's not apocalyptic.",
        "There certainly was an oil spill in the Gulf in 1979 that was substantially bigger than this.",
        "It was off the coast of Mexico, as opposed to the coast of the U.S.",
        "And that fortunately, the currents brought a lot of that oil into the middle of the Gulf.",
        "So it didn't wash ashore.",
        "If you look at it from the standpoint of the fisherman, a large percentage of the fishing grounds have been closed, and that's an economic hardship for them.",
        "It can mean bankruptcy.",
        "It can mean a lot of things.",
        "So for people who live along the Gulf, that's potentially catastrophic for individuals.",
        "Beaches, many of them are open, but even the ones that are open, people are a little bit afraid to go down to the shore in Alabama or Florida or whatever, because they're concerned that, well, maybe by the time we get there, oil will be coming ashore.",
        "And so even if it's not actually having an impact on the beaches, it's certainly having an impact on the businesses along there.",
        "So in terms of deep water, also, we just don't know what the impacts of this will be on the ecology of the Gulf.",
        "That's a question that will take many years to answer.",
        "But obviously, we are seeing pictures of killed seabirds and wildlife.",
        "This could have impact on, for example, tuna, small tuna that breed in this area.",
        "They could be harmed, the bluefin tuna, this beautiful animal, and we just don't know exactly how big an impact it will have on them.",
        "Jacob, I'm sorry we can't come up with a simple answer for you."

        "We talked last week, Richard, about efforts to contain the spill, and a couple of people called and said why don't we set off large charges of explosives to try to get the well to crash in on itself, and you explained why that wasn't a good idea.",
        "And in the time since then, there's been a front-page story in the New York Times about an effort that the Russians apparently did with a similar problem and in an undersea well, and they apparently detonated a nuclear weapon.",
        "Yes, it's not that it's impossible, but I mean, think of there are a couple of issues to confront here, one of which is in the Gulf of Mexico, you have 1,000 feet of mud before you get to solid rock, and presumably, you don't want to try to set this off in the mud.",
        "You would want to get it to the solid rock.",
        "You have 5,000 feet of sea to go through, which is much more than the Russians had to deal with.",
        "We're talking, remember, this is a really deep well that we're dealing with here.",
        "It's not you know, this is new stuff for drilling in this kind of depth.",
        "And so and then beyond that, it could fail well, whatever happens, I think it's just, you know, trying to stop one environmental disaster by risking another one is kind of beyond the pale.",

        "Is this kind of brave new territory?",
        "And why are we just, you know, enamored of finger-pointing on this?",
        "Why do we have to look at this online 24 hours a day?",
        "I can take my answer off the air, but I'm just a little bit I guess I'd like to put this into some sort of perspective and kind of cut back on the finger-pointing."

        "Finger-pointing, I think we're going to have to look to human nature, and I'm not sure we have time to go into that in depth.",
        "But on the specific question, Richard, how new is this deep-water drilling technology?",
        "How many other rigs like this are there?",
        "Yeah, well, this technology has been evolving over the last 10 or 20 years.",
        "There's something like 1,200 deep-water wells, although most are not as deep as this one.",
        "And this is a technology that, you know, we keep pushing farther and farther into more and more risky areas, as we demand more and more oil for our economy and for, you know, our cars and everything else that we need oil for.",
        "So it's a so it's true that this is a, you know, this is sort of uncharted territory.",
        "People were starting to feel pretty confident because they were, you know, drilled so many, and they weren't having so many troubles.",
        "I think what we have obviously seen here, part of the story here, is that the ability to drill and technology to get into these wells was evolving much faster than the safety technology that should also have been coming along behind it, to make sure that if there was a disaster like this or a blowout like this, it wouldn't end up as a disaster.",
        "Given the record, obviously the probability of a disaster was low, but the ability to cope with such a disaster was very limited, and well, the worst case seems to have happened.",
