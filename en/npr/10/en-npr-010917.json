        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The studies in families and relations around these cases don't show additional spread, so we do not believe that there's been much additional spread in humans at all in either Indonesia, China, or elsewhere in the world.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's talk about the reports of people catching the virus from wild birds, in this case, the swans rather than...",
        "That would be unique, and that was a very - that's the first time ever we've had direct evidence of transmission from a wild bird to a human.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is this a cause for worry?",
        "Oh, it's certainly a cause for worry, but again, this is a unique case where we believe that in the depth of winter, when the virus was moving rapidly through that area of Azerbaijan, that swans, dead swans, were occurring, and the people went and plucked the down and feathers off those dead birds.",
        "And so these are a unique set of circumstances that are not likely to happen frequently.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So this is - was this a case where they were - is a typical very close contact but this time with wild birds?",
        "This is a case of very close contact with wild birds.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "How significant a role do the wild birds play?",

        "Well, the wild bird route is - the wild birds were certainly involved in the spread of this virus from China through Central Asia into Turkey and Europe, probably not wild birds alone.",
        "The industry is integrated and probably the integrated industry plus the wild birds.",
        "But the wild birds were certainly involved, and there's no doubt that this virus is now in wild birds in Europe and Asia.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And, of course, the question everyone asks me at the moment, is when is it going to arrive through Alaska?",
        "And you tell them?",
        "I don't think that this is going to occur so easily, because when we look at the biology of influenza in birds, and in the continents, the viruses in Europe and Asia are a different family from those in the Americas.",
        "And there's not a lot of transmission between these two sites.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Otherwise these two super families of influenza would not have developed over thousands of years.",
        "It could happen, however, and it does happen...",
        "Well, I guess the answer to that is no, since all you hear is laughter.",
        "But you know, my guess is, is that it depends largely on who's making these estimates and which estimate is correct.",
        "And the estimates could very well change, I think, because I think it's clear that there's a lot of unknown when it relates—as it relates to rebuilding the Gulf Region, the levees in particular.",
        "It seems like, that you have various experts who have gone down there and who've come back within different reports--and so I think it's probably as much an art as it is a science--and that might count for some of the discrepancy.",
        "And also, too, I think that I would agree with Joe's estimation of the situation, but what we have to be clear about is what's going to get cut.",
        "I think, initially, everyone was on board: we need to rebuild.",
        "We need to rebuild.",
        "I think it was about $10 million--$10 billion, excuse me, that we were talking about at one point.",
        "Then there were politicians who were not particularly on board with that—amount has been reduced to $7.6 billion.",
        "We're even talking about, at this point, of not even giving money to one of the parishes, so that's the $1.6 billion that's being taken off the table.",
        "Plaquemines—I'm quite sure that's not how you say it—but Parish, they're being considered to be taken off the table.",
        "So, I think it's about a lot of jockeying that's going to go back and forth as to exactly who is going to get these resources.",
        "There's been some comment about some of these reductions are redundancies, where we're eliminating redundant programs and projects, but that has yet to really be determined.",
        "So I think you're right.",
        "I think we're all still not clear on the math, and I think we won't be clear until we're really sure of what this total rebuilding really entails."

        "Before I get to you, Professor Irvin, I think it's Plaquemine Parish, but I, too, could be very wrong.",
        "And the thing that really gets me about all these numbers, is that they're all attributed to the administration.",
        "So they're all different numbers that have been flowing through the administration at some point, but Professor, go ahead.",
        "Oh no, I was going to say, I'm no better with the numbers than anybody else.",
        "I would say this though, that it's obvious that politics plays a major role in this, how much money will come from the federal government, as opposed to the state government.",
        "And $10 billion was a lot of money in the beginning, so they changed the numbers to somewhat less that that.",
        "I think the good news, though, is that at least the federal government now has come up with some tentative plans for how residents may be able to return--that is, by having established what would be the flood plains.",
        "So now you have the, at least the convergence of the insurance companies who may now be willing to fund the homeowner's policies if they decide to return.",

        "It is, you know, it's politics.",

        "This $2.5 billion that was announced this week has received generally favorable reviews in Louisiana, but it still must go to Congress.",
        "And so, that number could still change once again, after it comes out of Washington here.",
        "And there's also a question that the governor and others in Louisiana are raising about just how much the state will have to pitch in.",
        "There is some talk that the state might have to pitch in $900 million, which it doesn't have.",
        "And Senator Mary Landrieu from Louisiana, said this is like throwing a 30 foot rope to someone who's 50 feet from shore and drowning.",
        "So, it might be a step in the right direction, but for folks in Louisiana, they're not quite satisfied with what they've seen so far.",
        "I'm also intrigued by one provision of this, which says that houses will have to be elevated three feet above ground level.",
        "Now, there's ground level, and then there's sea level.",
        "You can have a house that's three feet above ground level, but which is still below sea level, at least the bottom of it.",
        "So I'm also curious to see how these evaluations of the flood plains really reflect the geography and the topography of New Orleans, which is a very specific city."

        "Well, I think that's certainly correct.",

        "I think they're raising the same questions that you're raising.",
        "I guess my concern, however, too, is that the Army Corps of Engineers is saying that this repair and upgrade won't even be completed until 2010.",
        "So I'm not sure what the interim plan is going to be, God forbid, if there is another disaster.",
        "You know, how is that going to be handled?",
        "And I don't know about everyone else, but I haven't heard about the planning, or how things are being handled, in the case of such an instance.",
        "Well, this actually brings us to our next topic, which is the Red Cross.",
        "It plans changes after Hurricane Katrina problems.",
        "It was widely criticized for not reaching enough people fast enough.",
        "For one thing, it's going to create a call center that can take 100,000 cases a day, in order to avoid long waits of people who felt like they kept calling back, and they kept getting no help.",
        "They're also going to try to partner more closely with local organizations, including churches and faith-based organizations.",
        "Nat, do you think that this change is critical, because so many people who donate, donate to the Red Cross.",
        "Yes.",
        "Like, for example, in a particular division that was responsible for the manufacturing for a particular product they could say, hey, you know, if there was a defect in this, we want to see every email, every instant message, every Word document that anybody ever got, and without the judge necessarily realizing how many millions of items that might amount to.",
        "There you go.",
        "Say it twice.",
        "Oh, it is, Farai.",
        "And you know, the fact is, the Red Cross is very much like the federal government.",
        "It's huge.",
        "It is, after all, 125 years old.",
        "I mean, it was created when Chester Arthur was president, and it's a great organization.",
        "It's done—over the years, it's saved millions of lives, you know, through a lot of programs--but any organization of its size can find itself overwhelmed by a circumstance, as Katrina presented itself to our country last year.",
        "And it just simply wasn't able to get out of its way.",
        "So I think there are a couple of things that the Red Cross is thinking about now.",
        "One is how do you streamline responses?",
        "How do you respond more quickly— streamline the size of the organization so that you're able to respond more quickly to immediate disasters?",
        "Number two, and I think you pointed this out, relating more to the people who actually are being affected by the tragedies.",
        "In the last instance, the Red Cross was criticized—and this is not the first time it's happened—but the Red Cross has not bee sensitive enough to the diversity of the regions in which they find themselves, the organizations, located, which—you know, in all 50 states.",
        "So you can look for the Red Cross, I think now, to be much more concerned about the way that the organization looks--the kinds of people, more Latinos, more black folks involved in the volunteer efforts--and working more with those local kinds of organizations.",
        "And the final thing is, the whole issue of accountability.",
        "You know, they are the designated federal organization to respond in times of crisis, but there was a lot of mismanagement of huge sums of money during this last crisis.",
        "So the watchword this time is going to be accountability.",
        "Joe, how does this tie into the Bush administration's faith-based initiatives recently announcing that they wanted to tie disaster aid to faith-based organizations?",
        "Well, I think that this is really something that's very much focused on the American Red Cross, at this point.",
        "Because this is an issue of the Red Cross trying to get itself together, as opposed to the Bush administration's relationship with faith-based organizations.",
        "So, I think that there's probably some tie, but it's not necessarily a direct one.",
        "This is really about a Red Cross that—it acknowledges and apologizes for--it stumbled pretty badly, according to these reports that were done by International Red Cross affiliates, such as the British Red Cross."

        "The British Red Cross did a report some time ago, but it was just recently released, and it talked about how really some of the basic needs of beneficiaries were not met two weeks after the hurricane struck.",
        "There were some basic items, feminine hygiene products, juice, Gatorade, other personal types of hygiene products, disinfectant, these things were not available.",
        "And it was, and I think it's worth remembering that the Red Cross is the go-to organization, it's a federally chartered organization.",
        "One story indicated they had 235 volunteers in the field that's half the population of Washington, D.C.",
        "But these volunteers were very frustrated, because they, because of poor communications, poor organization, poor direction--and so I think that this is very much an effort to solidify better organize, reorganize perhaps, the American Red Cross, so that it will be in a much better position to respond the next time there is a disaster.",
        "Yvonne, regardless of these changes, do you think there's going to be some effort by donors in future disasters to try out smaller organizations?",
        "I know that, as some reports emerged, that the Red Cross may not have made the wisest choices in how it administered its charge in Louisiana.",
        "People began asking, Oh, you know, what are local charities, grass roots charities?",
        "Well I think that, in the main know, I think that the Red Cross has a brand that's recognizable by a broad sector of Americans.",
        "And I think that in the next disaster, whenever that would be, I think that they would still be the primary organization that people would go to.",
        "I however, think that in local communities, the grass roots organizations; the churches; whatever other aid organizations; have a responsibility to get the word out that they are also available and are helping on the ground.",
        "I think one of the reasons why a lot of these organizations do not get assistance, is people simply don't know that they exist.",
        "So, I think part of that is going to have to be marketing that happens when there is not a disaster.",
        "I think that also, too, people are leery about frauds and scams and the like.",
        "And although the Red Cross certainly could have done a better job--they are currently acknowledging that--I think people are just, again, very leery about handing over money to organizations that they don't know how they're run, how they're structured.",
        "So I really would suggest that smaller organizations in regions around the country make themselves known.",
        "Become trusted allies to citizens, and become places where people feel comfortable giving their money.",
        "So, that means they just simply cannot wait for a disaster to happen.",

        "The Red Cross has decided though, it has pledged to work more closely with the community-based organizations and develop partnerships with them.",

        "To better reach…",
        "Right.",
        "…a broader section of people.",
        "And again, to be able to get, I guess, closer to the ground, so to speak, by going through community-based organizations.",

        "And I think, far too often, when we hear a very large organization saying they're partnering--again, I don't want to ascribe any, you know, ill will or ill intentions with the Red Cross--but a lot of times it's PR.",
        "So people are coming in after, you know, a storm and say, Oh, now we have to be more diverse.",
