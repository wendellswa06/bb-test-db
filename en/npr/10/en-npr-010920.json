        "There's the performance-based bonus, and that's been increasing over the last 10 or 15 years, the percent of employers who pay performance-based bonuses.",
        "And then just straight Christmas bonuses--the number of employers--the percentage of employers who pay just straight Christmas bonuses--that has been going down, so if you have an employer who's measuring your performance, then you're more likely to get a bonus this year.",
        "As to just a gift, those are a little less likely.",
        "Sixty percent of employers--six out of 10 employers no longer pay any kind of straight holiday bonus, and among the ones who do, a small number of them pay cash.",
        "So if you want a cash bonus, you want a performance-based bonus.",

        "Yeah, the idea of the gift.",
        "Now three out of four employers will have a holiday party of some kind at some point between now and the end of the year, and maybe four out of 10 employers who say they do just some kind of a gift bonus--a lot of them you're talking about gift certificate or a pizza party or something.",
