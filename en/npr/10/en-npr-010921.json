        "Well, you know, I think really my mentor in this process has been the French writer Louis Guilloux, who knew very little about American race relations, but he had a great intuition and my favorite line of his is something like, `Even the stupidest of men would have ended up asking himself why there could be so much crime on one side and so much virtue on the other anyway.'",
