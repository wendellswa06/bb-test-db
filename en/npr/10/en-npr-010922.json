        "One year, though, the worst was a $5 coupon at the school store and so she didn't...",

        "Right.",
        "Yeah, so it was a fairly disappointing time of year when you hear about friends receiving $2,000 doing secretarial work and things and she's taking care of children and receiving not much in return.",
        "Well, do you recall what she actually spend the money on?",
        "I don't think she did because there's nothing at the school store for $5 or more, so it would have just been buying a school shirt and getting it for $20 instead of 25."
