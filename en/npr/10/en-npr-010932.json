        "This involved a death row inmate in Florida, Clarence Hill, who literally, Alex, was strapped to the gurney in January, waiting to receive a lethal injection.",
        "That was stayed.",
        "And the court heard argument in a case that was not a challenge to the actual constitutionality of the lethal injection process.",
        "It was a narrow procedural question essentially saying, can the court make space in the appellate process for claims, such as my claim, says Clarence Hill, that this is a cruel and unusual punishment?",
        "And today the court decided unanimously that yes, you can bring this claim, bring it as a civil rights claim, not as a habeas corpus claim and will be able to hear that petition.",
        "So what does this mean for future challenges to the constitutionality of lethal injections?",
        "There have been several cases in the last several months on this issue of whether or not lethal injection is cruel and unusual because it might be painful.",
        "Well, essentially it sort of creates a broader path to the courthouse door.",
        "It opens the door for claims like that of Hill and says, you have another route to the courthouse to come and complain to us that it's unconstitutional.",
        "And I should add that at oral argument in Hill, some of the justices already wanted to get to the merits of lethal injection and how appalling it may be.",
        "So I think essentially it signals a readiness on the part of the court to start to hear these kinds of claims.",
        "Okay.",
        "The other case involves whether an inmate can try to prove his innocence using DNA.",
        "And what are the details in this case?",
        "Alex, this involved yet another death row inmate.",
        "This one is challenging the DNA evidence that was used to convict him decades ago.",
        "Essentially he says the fluids that were found on the victim's body were not mine, and I want to come to court and prove that to you.",

        "Her quest - to row 6,700 miles from San Francisco to Australia.",
        "Savage is modest, her humor, self-deprecating.",
        "What's surprising is it's not even her first ocean row.",
        "Last year, Savage crossed the Atlantic alone, battling fatigue, pain and treacherous waves."

        "My reach across the Atlantic was fairly wiggly.",
        "It looks a bit like a drunken spider staggering across the chart, and especially a couple of times when the wind was against me and I got blown backwards.",
        "My worst day out there was negative eight miles, which was bad a day at the office.",
        "And Savage knows bad days at the office.",
        "For eleven years, she was an IT consultant for an investment banking firm in London.",
        "But she never quite felt happy.",
        "She eventually chucked her materialistic life, got a divorce, sold her possessions, and moved into a camper van.",
        "After two years of reflection, an idea popped into Savage's head: row the Atlantic alone.",
        "My first thought was that it's the best idea I've ever had.",
        "Because my second thought was, that was without a doubt the worst idea I've ever had.",
        "Because her only rowing experience was on the River Thames as a student at Oxford.",
        "People told her she was crazy, but Savage trained hard and was determined.",
        "I think one of the toughest aspects for me was just the sheer relentlessness of day after day out there on the ocean.",
        "At times, the sadness seemed like a prison with no escape from the terrifying storms, loneliness and unrelenting exhaustion that come from rowing alone for 103 days.",
        "Savage chronicled some of her journey across the Atlantic on video camera.",
        "Oh, it's just such a nightmare.",
        "It is just - the whole situation there is no way out of.",
        "What was I thinking of when I got in to this?",
        "She develop tendonitis in her shoulders, nearly the capsized, loss navigational power on cloudy days, and was plagued with self-doubt.",
        "Up to the first month, thunderous waves broke all rowers, which Savage patched up with duck tape.",
        "And then her satellite phone broke.",
        "Some time the 19th of February, my second day without any contact with the outside world.",
        "But strangely, Savage says the feeling of total self-reliance brought her peace.",
        "The Atlantic also thought her the absolute necessity of positive thinking, something she'll need for the Pacific, a much tougher journey.",
        "It will be carried out in three stages and is more than double the distance of the Atlantic.",
        "She knows it will be grueling."
