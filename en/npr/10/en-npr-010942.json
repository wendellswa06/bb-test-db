        "Yes, hi, how are you?",
        "Dr.",
        "Schweitzer, let's get the story ball rolling here.",
        "Your colleague, Jack Horner finds this fossil, a T.rex femur, right?",
        "Well, he actually found more than the femur.",
        "There was quite a bit of the dinosaur in association.",
        "Take it from there.",
        "How did you discover that the bone contained soft tissue?",
        "How do you get soft tissue in a fossil?",
        "Well actually, that story, it's old hat right now.",
        "We actually looked at the dinosaur when the bones were sent out to us in North Carolina and realized that we had a pregnant female.",
        "And in the process of trying to look at this new bone tissue that indicated it was in reproduction, one of the things that's standard to do is to remove a little bit of the mineral in the bone and see how the collagen fibers were once oriented.",
        "So the thought was we'll just etch the bone a little bit, because our thought was the same as everyone else's: that if you take a dinosaur bone and you remove the mineral, you won't have anything left.",
        "And much to our surprise, we had very fibrous and very stretchy, resilient tissue in tiny amounts, but it was still clearly there.",
        "And basically, the rest of the analysis that we've done have built off of that under the assumption that - well, two assumptions, I guess - that with fossils, just because it looks like something doesn't mean it is, particularly when you're making the claim you have original tissue preserved.",
        "You need to back that up with pretty heavy-duty analytical studies.",
        "And so we announced the soft tissue in 2005, but we never made any claims as to what it was composed of or whether it was original or not.",
        "And how could you figure out what the tissue was?",
        "Well, if it were modern bone, all of the tests that we did to show the soft tissue presence would have suggested collagen, since collagen is the main protein component in bone.",
        "About 85 to 95 percent of the proteins that make up the bone matrix are collagenous proteins, but that's, you know, like I said, that had to be demonstrated with a lot more analysis than just, boy, this sure looks like collagen.",
        "So that's what we did."

        "And John Asara, that's where you come in, to figure out exactly what the protein was.",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "So the thing is basically I contacted Mary back, that was in 2005, when she first made this discovery of the soft tissue.",
        "And it was really Lewis Cantley at Harvard Medical School, and also the BIDMC, that sort of suggested that I do that after he saw the report, knowing that we sort of had collaborated in the past to actually sequence collagen from mammoth bones, 100,000 and 300,000 years old.",
        "So when I got this bone, basically it was a brown, gritty substance.",
        "So we tried to run that, okay, by mass spectrometry, which is the technique that actually sequences the potential proteins that are there.",
        "And what we realized quickly was there was really a lot of contamination that we had to basically fight through.",
        "And sort of by using tricks that we learned in the mammoth study, we basically figured out using several sort of purification techniques and also separation techniques, we were able to actually purify off this brown contaminant.",
        "And then we got just barely enough peptide material, which represents protein from the bone that we could then detect that by mass spectrometry and then sort of determine sequences.",
        "And the way that sort of the mass spectrometer works is that these peptides are basically strings of amino acids, you could just sort of view this as like a bracelet with all these sort of strings of beads which actually represents the sort of intact protein.",
        "They get fragmented by the mass spectrometer, and that sort of fragmentation pattern reveals the sort of original protein sequence.",
        "And when you sequenced them, did you find them similar to different, other kinds of animals?",
        "Yes, so that's what we did.",
        "Basically, we got these fragmentation patterns, and then we searched those against other protein databases.",
        "And basically what we found was that we got seven total, and sort of three of these uniquely matched, okay, chicken, and then we also got matches to newts and also frog, other amphibians.",
        "And if you sort of look at this group of sequences, what it really says it that from all of the sort of organisms that are present in protein databases - and there are a lot of organisms that are not present; for example, reptiles have not had their genomes sequenced - but if you compare it to the protein database, you basically find that it's more similar to chicken than really anything else in that database.",
        "Mary Schweitzer, doesn't that confirm what we've been saying, what some scientists have been saying about dinosaurs really being - or chickens being descendants of dinosaurs?",
        "Well, it does, actually.",
        "Most of it - well, all of the data so far that suggests that dinosaurs are basically non-avian theropods, and birds are avian theropods, there's so much data to support that relationship right now that this particular piece of evidence is really not adding a whole lot more from that standpoint."

        "But what this is is an independent test of all of our theories that are based on morphology.",
        "You know, everything that we've done so far that suggests that birds and dinosaurs are the same thing has been based upon whatever can be preserved in the bone in terms of the shape of the bone or whatever.",
        "But now we've got molecular data to back that up, and that's pretty cool.",
        "That's pretty neat.",
        "But you also found the other amphibians in there.",
        "Well, realize that - and John can back me up on this, but there's very, very little difference between your collagen and a frog's collagen in terms of the overall amino-acid content.",
        "Because the molecule is a structural molecule, it has such importance to vertebrate animals and it's so highly constrained because of its function and its structure, there's not a lot of difference.",
        "There's not a lot of variation.",
        "It's my understanding that when John did the sequencing, where it came up frog was basically one amino acid out of all those peptides that was unique in that position to a frog.",
        "Did you find anything unique to T.rex itself?",
        "No, we did not do that.",
        "And in fact so just to kind of further comment on Mary's statement.",
        "So if you look at the sort of collagen alpha-one sequences, okay, inside the...",

        "Okay.",
        "So actually I...",
        "Let me ask you about the T.rex sequences.",
        "You started to say that there was nothing unique about any of the T.rex sequences there.",
        "I think, if I can just step in for a minute - realize that we are limited in our comparisons to what is in the current database, and there are no crocodile sequences in the database that we can compare what John got.",
        "So my guess would be - or a really neat thing would be - if we sequence crocodile collagens and we got some overlap with what we pulled out, maybe we'd find that in those particular regions crocodiles also contain the same amino acid as a frog because of the overlap.",
        "And so what John has said is that there isn't anything that is a unique fingerprint to dinosaurs that we know of because we haven't been able to compare it against anything more than what is currently in the database.",
        "Am I interpreting that right, John?",
        "What's the term for an English county?",
        "Shire.",
        "Well, I think from here there's a couple of different directions.",
        "I think one thing is to continue to try to improve our detection technology and our extraction and purification methods, in which I rely totally on John for direction and advice, and to see if we can continue to pull more proteins or more peptide sequences out of the bone.",
        "And then the other thing for me, I am really anxious to see now if we can find any original proteins from those structures that look like blood vessels to determine if they are original or not.",
        "And those would be different proteins.",
        "John, are people - they're going to say: Hey, this is \"\"Jurassic Park\"\" all over again.",
        "I mean, can you pull any real DNA out of this collagen to make a dinosaur?",
        "Well, no, absolutely not.",
        "We have no evidence that there is any trace of DNA.",
        "Basically these are a few snippets of the protein collagen, the most abundant protein that is in bone.",
        "And all we can really say is sort of based on these sequences, we can maybe make sort of an evolutionary relationship to sort of sequences that we know from different organisms.",
        "But sort of based on these tiny snippets, there's really nothing you could do sort of on that level.",
        "And I'm not sure that anybody would want to.",
        "But you could really view this as if you had a bucket, let's see, of water which sort of represented an organism in terms of its sequence; this is sort of less than, let's say, a droplet.",
        "So this is really very little representation of the T.rex."

        "Dr. Schweitzer, do you think you're going to be looking through other museum-piece dinosaur fossils or other kinds of fossils around the world now?",
        "Well I probably won't look for museum pieces because I think by the time they get to a museum they're pretty heavily contaminated.",
        "But we do have two field excavations that we've got planned for the summer that I'll be collecting samples from while the dinosaur's still in the ground and before it's been basically been touched by anyone.",
