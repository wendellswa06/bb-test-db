        "The book was published a year before 9/11.",
        "In a follow-up called \"\"The Sorrows of Empire\"\", Johnson described a global network of military bases that he says creates a modern version of colonialization.",
        "And now, in the third volume of his trilogy, Chalmers Johnson argues that the maintenance of the American empire will inevitably undercut our domestic democracy and lead to either military dictatorship or to its civilian equivalent.",
        "The author joins us in a moment.",
        "Later in the program, the husband of a little-known but highly regarded classical pianist confesses that he faked her recordings - the denouement of the Hatto hoax - and your letters.",
