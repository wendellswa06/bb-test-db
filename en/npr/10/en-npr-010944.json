        "Well, it seems to be that what you get when you open up a copy of the folio and you find a scribble by Elizabeth Oakle writing in her book, that you've a direct connection with readers, and our vault is full of books with marginalia, notations, responses to reading.",
        "Those are the things that make each of these objects, particularly in the hand press period, unique.",
        "And you get a sense of connection to prior readers, prior minds, that the digital copy will not - will not provide.",
