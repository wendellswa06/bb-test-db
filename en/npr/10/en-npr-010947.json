        "Yes.",
        "Lots of the things that I see are during the Republic's time, that they usually used excuses to get into the (unintelligible) of their empire, but they're always justified.",
        "And in the end, you have lots of civil wars, and one man who came out - Augustus, who became the first emperor - and he called himself the first among equals because I think people were trying - were giving up liberties for security.",
        "And I just think the question is would that -something like that can happen here, do you think?",
        "Would people give up those liberties for security when there's that kind of chaos?",
        "Isn't it fascinating that two millennia later we can still be arguing about what went on in the Roman Republic?",

        "Washington, D.C., used to have a creek down the Mall that was called the Tiber, that flowed into the Potomac.",
        "It's a haunting parallel that we are approaching this direction.",
        "And you may -like Gibbon himself - admire the young Octavian who became the god Augustus Caesar, but it is always worth reminding ourselves what followed.",
        "There was Tiberius, who retreated to Capri with a covey of his small boys for his sexual pleasure, followed by a genuine horror, Caligula, who was then followed by a drooling idiot, Claudius, who was assassinated - poisoned by his wife in order that she could bring to power her son by an earlier marriage, namely Nero.",
        "Now I mention this simply to say whatever you may think of the Roman Empire, this wasn't good government compared with the world of Roman liberty under the Republic, with its elaborate checks and balances, two councils, the ability to veto each other, the - all of the words that come - concepts that are written into our Constitution - fixed term limits, periodic elections, things of this sort.",

        "And they were all lost as a result of transforming the armies of the Roman Republic from citizen armies, raised to defend the country in a case of a genuine emergency, to standing armies - to the armies that George Washington warned us against - because these large standing armies with long service and then the need to find work or find security for the troopers afterwards, that these were indispensable to establishing the empire, protecting the empire, policing the empire.",
        "There is no way to have an empire without a military industrial complex, a military establishment.",

        "Don't we have tendencies towards presidents arrogating power to themselves, and slowly, Congress will take it back?",

        "You see, the interesting thing about Eisenhower's warning - it was so strident.",
        "It wasn't diplomatic.",
        "He was scared to death about what had been created during his administration, and that it was going to dominate us - that military Keynesianism would come to exercise a powerful influence over our society.",

        "So the American people, last November, elect the opposition party in Congress.",

        "It's one of the reasons why we continue to admire the efforts by NPR to overcome the interests of people who report simply for advertising purposes.",
        "But at the same time, NPR is not unaware that it's often been a target of people who have vested interests.",
        "Public radio's going to play a very small part in no matter which way this goes.",
