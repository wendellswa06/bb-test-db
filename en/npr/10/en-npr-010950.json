        "George W.",
        "Bush's critics argue he's a go-it-alone president.",
        "They call him a unilateralist.",
        "They say he does not play well with others.",
        "They might not have recognized the George Bush they heard this past week.",
        "It began with America's first formal high-level talks with the government of Iran in nearly 30 years; then the president announced tougher sanctions against Sudan; he urged Congress to double the funding for the fight against AIDS; he nominated the widely admired Robert Zoellick to be president of the World Bank; and finally the president did something his critics have been urging him to do for six years -he called for a global target for reducing greenhouse gases.",
        "Some of these positions represent a change in policy, others a continuation -all seemed intended to appease President Bush's overseas critics.",
        "Suzanne Goldenberg is the Washington correspondent for The Guardian, a London-based newspaper, and she joins us.",
        "Welcome to the program, Suzanne.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And Philippe Chatenay is a reporter with the French newsweekly Marianne.",
        "He's in Paris.",
        "Welcome to you, Philippe.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I'd like to start with you, Philippe.",
        "This flurry of international initiatives by the American president, how is it gone over with the French?",
        "Well, not very far.",
        "I think that most French people, including our political leaders, has basically made up their mind about George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "And I don't think that they can believe the tiger can change his stripes.",
        "So yes, Mister Bush obviously seems to have become more of a multilateralist.",
        "But I don't think it's going to convince anybody here in France that Iraq is a good idea, or that the American position on global warming is a good one.",
        "The French, I imagine, are obsess with their own new government of President Nicolas Sarkozy.",
        "Sarkozy's predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was a critic of U.S.",
        "foreign policy.",
        "Is Sarkozy at all interested in moving France closer to the United States, and might President Bush's initiatives help in anyway?"

        "Perhaps.",
        "Although, there's something one must keep in mind, which is that, there's been a change of the political guard in Europe over the past few months - Garhard Schroder is now replaced by Angela Merkel; Aznar in Spain has been replaced by Zapatero; Berlusconi in Italy has been replaced by Romano Prodi; Tony Blair will soon be replace by Gordon Brown.",
        "So there's a change of the guard, and I think that many of these European leaders are basically waiting for the change of the guard at the White House.",
        "Suzanne Goldenberg, I want to bring you into the conversation.",
        "Why do you think President Bush has taken these steps at this moment?",
        "Well, there's two views.",
        "The most cynical view would be that he is turned on global warming, is that he's trying to prevent a new negotiation of Kyoto.",
        "He's trying to block a global accord on that - that would be the view of environmental activists across the globe.",
        "On the other issues, I think he wanted to put his marker down at the G8; on the issue of HIV-AIDS, in particular, which has been one initiative this week that's been most warmly received in Britain and in other countries.",
        "How much substance do you think the European governments find in the stance that the president is taking - the one he's projected this past week?",
        "Again, I would have to share what Philippe is saying, and that they're viewing it with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially this latest initiative on global warming which has been denounced in the editorial pages at least with most British newspapers as a spoiler.",
        "That it's intended to block any kind of meaningful outcome of - from coming out of the G8 summit, when it comes down to discuss climate change.",
        "Let me ask you, Philippe Chatenay, another issue nominating - choosing Robert Zoellick to be president of the World Bank to succeed Paul Wolfowitz.",
        "Is there a reaction at all in Paris to this?",
        "I think not.",
        "I think that the - on a more symbolic level perhaps.",
        "There was a view in Paris that the long-drawn twisting in the wind of Mister Wolfowitz was seen as another example of the fact that when the people in the Bush White House realize that they're wrong, they can not manage to admit it.",
        "They know it's over, but there's no way they will surrender gracefully.",
        "What about Sudan and the edict about the bloodshed in Darfur, President Bush announced tight economic sanctions?",
        "Well, there perhaps there might be - how can I put it - a test case for a new closeness in Franco-American relations, because as you know Mister Sarkozy's new foreign minister is Bernard Kouchner, the founder of Doctors Without Borders, a celebrated humanitarian aid expert.",
        "And so he indeed has been making speeches about the need to do something about Darfur.",
        "So yes I think that Mister Kouchner is open-minded enough to take help wherever he can find it in attempting to solve the problem in Darfur."

        "It now acknowledges the importance of global warming.",
        "But in terms of action, there really hasn't been much progress at all.",
        "I mean it has to be said that, you know, all these initiatives from Mister Bush are coming after six years of, you know, relative obduracy on many issues, on many international initiatives.",
        "So it's going to take quite a lot for the rest of the world and Europe anyway to warm to him on these.",
        "Philippe Chatenay, let me ask you about what Europeans were hoping to hear from President Bush last week that they did not hear.",

        "In four states, Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia and South Dakota, pharmacists' right to refuse to fill a prescription is protected under a specific law.",
        "Three other states, Massachusetts, North Carolina and California, require pharmacists or pharmacies to ensure prescriptions are filled.",
        "Lori Bickel is director of state relations for the American Pharmacists Association.",
        "She says more and more states are grappling with this issue.",
        "In 2005, we've certainly seen a flurry of activity throughout the states on both sides.",
        "Bickel says the APA has a policy supporting a pharmacist's right to refuse to dispense medication, but it also wants pharmacies to develop plans to help customers get all their prescriptions.",
        "Illinois' rule requires pharmacies, not individual pharmacists, to fill the prescriptions, but Governor Rod Blagojevich supports Walgreens' decision to ask each of its pharmacists to dispense contraceptives and the morning-after pill.",
        "Sheila Nix is a senior adviser to the governor.",
        "He's happy that Walgreens is following the law, because it's important that the pharmacies fill prescriptions for women who have valid birth control prescriptions from their doctors, and he believes that Walgreens should do what they think they need to do in order to enforce the law.",

        "But centuries before intercontinental carbonation or the rise of the European coffee house filled with intellectuals with brains sharpened by caffeine, the first beverage which marked civilization's improvement upon nature was beer.",
        "Tom Standage joins us from London.",
        "Welcome to the program once again.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "How old is beer?",
        "Nobody really knows, but it seems to be older than civilization itself.",
        "It probably goes back to about 10,000 BC, and it may go back even further.",
        "The trouble is that not much from that period survives and particularly not organic material, so we cannot be sure."

        "How did people make beer at first?",
        "Well, again, we can't tell because obviously we don't have any written records from that period.",
        "But there are legends that describe the accidental creation of beer, which probably come quite close to what happened.",
        "Around that time at the end of the ice age, people started gathering cereal grains for the first time, and they noticed that if you kept these grains, you could protect yourself against food shortages, so that was very useful.",
        "And they started burying them in pits so they could go back to them later.",
        "And at some point, these pits weren't perfectly water-tight, some water would have got into one of them, and you might have got fermentation that way.",
        "Another thing these grains were used for was to sort of thicken soup.",
        "And if you made soup with nothing but these grains, and then you left it lying around for a bit, that would also have fermented.",
        "So somehow or another, I mean, this is in fact what happens in one of the Egyptian myths, you end up with some fermented grain sitting in water, and the result is beer.",
        "Well, one measure of how ancient beer is is that beer is served in order to civilize a character in the epic of Gilgamesh, the Sumerian king from 2700 BCE.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "So there's a character who is sort wild man, and he's taken in, and he's kind of cleaned up and scrubbed and given some new clothes.",
        "And then he's given bread and beer, seven jugs of beer, in fact, to drink.",
        "And he's told this is what they do in the cities, this--you know, if you want to get on in the world and you want to be civilized, then you have to drink beer.",
        "So he does.",
        "And the equation between beer and civilization is very clear for the Sumerians because previously they were hunter-gatherers.",
        "They didn't have things like cities and writing, and they didn't have beer either.",
        "And all these things go together because they all arise from the surplus of cereal grain.",
        "So beer drinking was one of the things that reminded the Sumerians that they were different from the people of the past who hadn't had any of the trappings of modern life.",
        "And the other amusing thing is that one of the Sumerian epics describes a Sumerian god making a banquet for another god, and the steps are all mapped out for how the beer is made, which means that the oldest written recipe in the world is for beer.",
        "The oil lies more than four miles beneath the sea bed.",
        "It's in what geologists call the lower tertiary trend, the layer of rock and silt and sand laid down about the time the dinosaurs died out.",
        "Geologists suspected there was oil there, but how could they get to it?",
        "First, the ocean is 7,000 feet deep there.",
        "Then there's 20,000 feet of earth to get through, including layers of salt.",
        "Chris Oynes is the Gulf manager for the Federal Minerals Management Service.",
        "This is new when you have the combination of the water depth and going that deep into the lower tertiary geologic formation, that the big complicating factor is you're, of course, drilling beneath salt when you're in the offshore setting, and more importantly, lots of problems in terms of identifying the target accurately enough so that you can have a picture of what you're trying to go after.",
        "Geologists can see through the earth using sound waves like sonar, but seeing that deep and through salt is tough.",
        "Lately though, super-fast computers and better seismic techniques have given them three-dimensional images good enough to guide them to the new oil.",
        "Over the past four years, oil companies drilled 19 exploratory wells into this lower tertiary formation in the Gulf, and 12 of them hit oil.",
        "This week three of those companies, Chevron, Devon Energy, and Norway's Statoil, announced they'd actually pumped up to 6,000 barrels a day from a well called Jack Number 2.",
        "They claim the whole formation could hold between three and 15 billion barrels of oil.",
        "If that proves to be accurate, and even company executives say that's just an educated guess, it could amount to about one-fifth of all the oil thought to be in U.S.",
        "waters.",
        "Oynes of the Minerals Management Service says the discovery is promising but no one's actually produced oil from such depths in the Gulf before."
