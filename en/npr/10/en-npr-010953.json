        "Well, this week's challenge was brought to my attention by Ed Pegg Jr., who runs the Web site mathpuzzle.com.",
        "You're probably familiar with magic squares.",
        "In a standard four-by-four magic square you arrange the digits from one to 16 so that each row, column and cornered diagonal totals 34.",
        "Well, this is a multiplication magic square.",
        "Arrange 16 numbers in a four-by-four square so that the product of each row, column and corner-to-corner diagonal is 5,040.",
        "You can use any numbers you want, but they have to be whole numbers and you can't repeat a number in a square.",
        "And as a hint, I'll tell you the number in the upper left corner is 42."
