        "He said Americans should listen to people they disagree with.",
        "When our Steve Inskeep sat down with the president just before he headed out for a Christmas vacation, Obama faced this question - whether he understands the people who profoundly disagree with him.",
        "We began this part of our talk with a list.",
        "It's a list of major events of 2015.",
        "I read them off to the president as we sat by a fireplace in the White House Cabinet Room.",
        "They are all events that highlight the question of national identity, who we are - a Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, the Black Lives Matter movement, the immigration debate, the question of whether to admit Syrian refugees and whether to admit Muslims.",

        "I do think that the country is inexorably changing, I believe in all kinds of positive ways.",

        "But I do think that when you combine that demographic change with all the economic stresses that people have been going through because of the financial crisis, because of technology, because of globalization, the fact that wages and incomes have been flat-lining for some time and that particularly blue-collar men have had a lot of trouble in this new economy, where they're no longer getting the same bargain that they got when they were going to a factory and able to support their families on a single paycheck, you combine those things.",
        "And it means that there is going to be potential anger, frustration, fear, some of it justified but just misdirected.",
        "And you know, I think somebody like Mr. Trump's taken advantage of that.",

        "So I don't want to discourage kids from doing that.",
        "As I've said before, I do think that there have been times on college campuses where I get concerned that the unwillingness to hear other points of view can be as unhealthy on the left as on the right.",

        "Some of them may just not like how I walk or my big ears or - you know, so I mean - you know, no politician, I think, aspires to a hundred percent approval ratings.",
        "Within that opposition, the president argued, there are some specific strains of the Republican Party suggesting he's different or Muslim or disloyal.",

        "And so...",
        "Coal plants are already closing, yeah.",
        "It doesn't pay to build coal plants - if somebody tells you that this is because of Obama's war on coal, well, you know, that's an argument that you may be sympathetic to.",
        "And that's perfectly legitimate.",
        "So as I said, yeah, you asked a pretty open-ended question.",

        "No, I understand.",
        "But what I'm saying is, is that I think that there's always going to be, every president, a certain cohort that just doesn't like your policies, doesn't like your party, what have you.",
