        "Now, he says he understands the nostalgia for these names, but he's got to sell cars in China.",

        "So in April and May of 2014 a group of scientists from around the country and the United Kingdom gathered at the Nevada test site facility where they conducted scientific experiments related to the nuclear weapons in the U.S.",
        "arsenal.",

        "They operated it without a shroud called a top hat, which was meant to contain leakage of radiation.",
        "And they were annoyed by the radiation alarms, so they switched them off.",
        "And that switched off the ventilation system.",
        "And as a result, particles of highly enriched uranium leaked around the room.",
        "And they leaked into an anteroom where they gathered before and after the experiments.",
        "And you write that the scientists didn't even find out that they had been exposed to this radiation until months later.",
        "Because the alarms were switched off, they didn't really know about it.",
        "The first inkling that there had been this contamination didn't come for more than a month.",
        "How does this particular failing fit into the larger pattern that you found at these nuclear sites across the country over many years?",
        "We found that it was one among many safety lapses.",
        "And also that the contractor didn't really suffer any serious consequences in the aftermath.",
        "All their expenses are covered routinely under their contract.",
        "These are privately run, government-owned laboratories."

        "And the government is paying these contracting companies.",
        "Right.",
        "And they cover all their expenses, and then they pay them a profit.",
        "And in each year, we found - not just at Nevada, but at the other sites we examined where there had been safety lapses as egregious as this one, we found that they earned between 86 and 93 percent of the maximum profit allowed no matter how many safety lapses they'd had during the period that we studied.",
        "Why doesn't the government do a better job at holding these companies accountable for their safety lapses?",
        "So it's interesting.",
        "Congress sets a ceiling on the number of employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration in Washington, which does the oversight and administers the funding of these contractors.",

        "Yes.",
        "The directors of the three weapons labs all declined to talk to us.",
