        "Another national debate about civility was set off when a Virginia restaurant refused to serve the president's press secretary, and protesters heckled Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant in Washington, D.C., shouting shame and end family separation.",
        "Representative Maxine Waters of California said that officials in the Trump administration should be called out in public over their family separation policy.",

        "Many immigrants who feel they've been special targets of the administration's policies and rhetoric, as when the president said immigrants infest our country.",
        "It might have been more polite or politically effective for protesters or restaurant staff to just let the Trump administration officials eat in peace, then approach them to say, we profoundly disagree with what you've done.",
        "But I understand how people who see public figures they hold responsible for what they find a reprehensible policy that tears apart lives will decide they just can't walk past what may be their one chance to say something directly to people in power.",

        "And Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream says we'll see who wins that game in 2016.",
        "Around this time 70 years ago, following the liberation of Nazi concentration camps in Europe, the world was coming to grips with the scale of the Holocaust and how to deal with crimes so horrendous, they're almost incomprehensible.",
        "That process is still ongoing.",
        "Right now in Germany, Oskar Groening, a 93-year-old former Nazi guard at Auschwitz, is on trial.",
        "I spoke this past week with Holocaust survivor Eva Kor, who testified at the trial.",

        "I knew he was right, but I refused to die.",
        "And I found out only in 1985 that would I have died, Mengele would've killed Miriam with an injection to the heart.",
        "And then Mengele would've done the comparative autopsies - my diseased organs, and Miriam was the control.",
        "I spoiled the experiment.",
        "Seventy years after all of this, Eva was asked to testify at the trial of Oskar Groening.",
        "At first, she wasn't sure she wanted to, but an attorney convinced her.",
        "It would be a unique experience to be able to face one of the guards from Auschwitz, tell him what I think and also hear what he has to say in a German court.",
        "Eva went to Germany.",
        "(Laughter) For me, a survivor of Auschwitz who used to be called a dirty Jew, to sit in German court and be treated with respect by German judges and attorneys was a little bit surreal.",

        "She says her comments were mistranslated.",
        "There have been rumors that I have asked to stop prosecution of all Nazis, and that is 100 percent incorrect.",
        "In the contrary, I want all Nazis to come forward and be prosecuted and stand trial and bear witness to help us, the survivors, and the world with the truth.",
        "But Eva says if she were the judge, she wouldn't throw Oscar Groening in a prison cell.",

        "And that message is that there is a cultural disconnect between the bubbles of New York, Washington and Hollywood, versus the flyover country, or the land of God, guns, grits and gravy.",
