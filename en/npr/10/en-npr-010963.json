        "It would unite the Republicans against him even more than they are now.",

        "Krikorian says that doesn't mean Republicans can ignore the concerns of Latinos.",
        "The challenge is how do they attract Hispanic voters without alienating their own Republican base?",
        "One way, says Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy group, is for Republicans to take the reins on the issue.",
