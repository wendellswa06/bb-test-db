        "Now, he again, he wasn't a bonus baby.",
        "But he is putting up so many great numbers and when you see him pitch at the ballpark, you ask yourself, what is he doing on this team.",
        "He used to be in a big leagues.",
        "But wouldn't you be - wouldn't you agree with Frank that players sign the big contracts, the bonus babies, get a better opportunity particularly in the lower rungs but after a few years, the numbers don't lie.",
        "No, they don't.",
        "And what they do is they really, you know, they look at those guys - don't kid yourself, they look at them - but they look at all of them.",
        "Nowadays, they have this thing down to a science.",
