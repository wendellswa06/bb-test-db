        "And it's just a matter of time.",

        "The reason that I think he is going to make - there's couple of reasons, but one of them is that when he pitched in our championship bid, I mean we - we won the Pacific Coast League Championship and then as the Tucson Sidewinders in 2006, we won the Triple-A Championship.",
        "But when Dustin pitched last year, he was pivotal in some pivotal games, and that - and so Dustin under pressure can pitch.",
        "And that's what they want to see.",
        "They want to see you pitch in a play-off game.",
        "They want to see you pitch when the odds are against you.",
        "And that's part of this building process too because, see, that tells you the character of the ballplayer.",
        "I happen to like Dustin a lot.",
        "I think he's going to be a major league player for a number of years.",
        "When he finally gets there, and when he sticks, he's going to please a lot of people for a good number of years.",
        "The only thing that I hope is that Dustin never forgets his roots and if we need some autographed baseballs to promote things, I just hope that he goes, you know what, I'll be glad to sign a couple of dozen for you to help the next guy make it.",

        "Hi.",
        "When I was kid, I had some friends in the neighborhood whose dad was a triple-A umpire and I thought that was even a notch above the players in terms of commitment, long odds against making it, and, you know, you talked about how the players are on the road half the time, but the umpires are always on the road and the crowd is always hostile and…",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "They are always wearing a black hat.",
        "That's right, yeah.",
        "Well, think of it this way, the umpires now, we do an eight-game series.",
        "They only do a four-game.",
        "They won't let them do an eight game.",
        "So they travel twice as much as the players travel.",
        "So you got to keep that in mind.",
        "Yeah, there's some dedication level, but again, the payoff when you make it to the show is huge.",
        "And so, you know that dedication and sacrifice will payoff.",

        "And that call raises a question.",
        "Everybody in the Minor Leagues is in a way looking for a promotion.",
        "The groundskeepers, the trainers, the play-by-play announcers as well as the players, and I suppose, even general managers would like to be working in Major League Baseball.",
        "I think, you know, Neal, I wouldn't disagree with that.",
        "I think that everybody is always looking for the next step.",
        "And, you know, and the division between Minor League and Major League is so vast as far as the pay off that, you know, it's just incredible.",
        "And if you feel that you are that talented -and you're right - if you're a Major League groundskeeper, you're somebody.",
        "You really are.",
        "You have made it to the pinnacle of your field.",
        "A little bit different for general managers.",
        "For me, I don't aspire the Major League - to be a general manager on the Major League level.",
        "Mine is more quality of life.",
        "I have always felt that a community like Tucson deserves a quality of life and if you can play triple-A baseball in a community like Tucson, then you have done great things for parents around the world because they want to bring up their kids in a great environment."

        "And a lot of them don't have the life skills to really adapt to the pressure and challenges they're facing.",

        "And so what they have to learn is, they're going to work every day and they're going to have to travel half of those days that they do work and then they're going to play games at night and they're going to get out of there about 11:00 or 12:00 midnight and they're going to get back up and they're going to do this all over again.",
        "And here's an existential question, how many times can you watch the same sports center?",
