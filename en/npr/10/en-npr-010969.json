        "Yes, this is the most delicious and zesty account of how the women of Newsweek magazine in 1970 launched a class action suit against their bosses because, incredibly, women at the time at Newsweek were only allowed to be researchers and fact checkers, not either writers or editors.",
        "And it's incredible because there had been famous women journalists, not just women journalists, but really famous and distinguished women journalists; for a century, by 1970 - or more.",
        "It's really remarkable.",
        "And, of course, what is deliciously sort of comical, in a sense, about it is that here was Newsweek, which was on the vanguard of writing about civil rights, about liberal causes, and in fact their own culture was so kind of adamantly \"\"Mad Men.",
        "So the uprising at Newsweek, what made it such a landmark instance?",
        "Well, it was a landmark instance because it was the first time that women in the media had sued.",
        "And the women got together, basically, and plotted quietly in the ladies room what they were going to do.",
        "And they timed it absolutely brilliantly to coincide with the publication of a big Newsweek cover about, you know, women's lib called \"\"Women in Revolt.",
        "And what they did was, what was very crucial was that they managed to sort of recruit the brilliant, you know, civil rights pugilist Eleanor Holmes Norton, the African-American lawyer who took it on as the first woman's media class action suit.",
        "And it was really her insistence that they should not make this a kind of interoffice kind of revolt, but a real suit that actually changed the culture."

        "These middle-aged men who are laid off are still always really haunted by the men they used to be, the roles they used to play, the sense of their own stature, whereas the women, of course, didn't have that stature, didn't have those rules, so they're kind of willing really to do anything.",
        "They're quite happy to come in at more entry-level, they get a bunch of skills, they do this and that, they take on these things, and finally they become very invaluable to their companies, and they rise and a rise and they're promoted while their husbands are sending out their resumes every night.",
        "It's a bit, a tragic situation, actually for, of course, the men.",
