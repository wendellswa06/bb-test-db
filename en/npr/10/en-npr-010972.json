        "People should know, those of us who've been in radio a long, long time -I thought I would be buried with a cart machine.",

        "Well, it depends on your broadcast engineer.",
        "Our guy was really good, so could probably get two or three years out of a cart without a critical failure.",

        "But my question for your guest is roughly how large, uncompressed, how big of hard drive would I need for about, oh, 2,500 albums?",
        "Uncompressed?",
        "Uncompressed.",
        "Well, doing some quick math - I mean, an uncompressed CD or album generally will run you somewhere on the order of a gigabyte or two."

        "My comment was when I used to have an old Macintosh and I would download very slowly, many MP3s from television shows - that was like, you know, when the Internet started putting pictures and things like that where we can download them onto your computer?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And eventually, my, you know, drive would get full so I put them on these lovable diskettes.",
        "And then I had hundreds of diskettes of just little bits of TV trivia and things like that.",
        "And then finally it got to the point where I was getting really bad and I saw a special on TV about Buddhism and they were creating this amazing sand sculpture, this big huge - took them hours, it took them, you know, made it - I don't know how many hours.",
        "But when they were all done, they just wiped it away and destroyed all the work that they had done.",
        "And after I saw that, I sort of broke my habit of collecting things.",
        "You know, when you realize that, I think your guest said it earlier - that really is about the content of what you're collecting rather than the actual physical item itself, it's sort of knowing that you have this attachment to something that's more important than actually keeping it.",
        "So that was my comment.",
        "And, you know, it's - I think that - and there are just some people built with the collecting gene, for a lack of better term.",
        "You know, I think that they are plenty - you know, I have friends who, you know, have ten albums and that's what they listen to.",
        "And you know what, they buy music that they want to hear and have no desire to sort of hoard and complete and have the thing and, you know, and they're the people who end up buried under, you know, the newspaper they haven't thrown out.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "Well, Megan...",
        "I think I'm somewhere in the middle.",
        "Megan, it sounds like you've come - you've really arrived at a whole change of life."
