        "Well, that cheesy grits comment kind of sums it up.",
        "Alabama and Mississippi are, as Romney has described it, an away game for him, not his comfort zone geographically or culturally.",
        "However, the polls in Alabama and Mississippi have shown all three candidates very close and Romney doing better than I think even his campaign first expected.",
        "So maybe Republicans in Mississippi and Alabama are eager to get this thing over with and move on to the contest with Obama.",
        "So the point is that Romney is the one with the least at stake tonight.",
        "He doesn't need to prove anything by winning.",
        "He's still going to get delegates.",
        "He already has twice as many delegates as Santorum.",

        "If he does win or do very well, I think it would give him a huge boost.",
        "It would be a symbolic win.",
        "He would have proved that he can win in a conservative state and he has yet to win in the Deep South, which is the epicenter of the GOP base.",
        "And if that does happen, Mara, if Romney does do well in the South, would you expect that one of the other candidates, Newt Gingrich, say, would drop out?",
        "Well, there might be pressure on Gingrich from Santorum, certainly not from Romney.",
        "He'd like Santorum and Gingrich to stay in and keep splitting the anti-Romney vote.",

        "That said, they claim they're going all the way to Tampa.",
        "And, of course, as long as they have a superPAC and a suitcase and the chance of winning some more delegates in a proportional primary, there really isn't a lot of pressure.",
        "And Santorum has made it clear that his strategy is to deny Romney the 1,144 delegates he would need to wrap up the nomination, even if Santorum himself doesn't have a chance to reach that number.",
        "But looking ahead, there are some primaries coming up that would be very helpful to Romney - Illinois on March 20th, couple days in April - April 3rd, Maryland, Wisconsin and D.C.; April 24th, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island.",
        "Of course, there's Pennsylvania that night, too.",
        "That's Santorum's home state.",
        "So the point is, there might be a turning point in here somewhere for Romney."
