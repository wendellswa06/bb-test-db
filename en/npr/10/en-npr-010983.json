        "One hundred and fifty thousand, roughly.",
        "So who decided to turn off and actually take down streetlights?",
        "You know, this is one of the proposals that was an option came forward from our public works department, as one way that they could save a considerable amount of money.",
        "They had estimated last year - when they were talking about this plan - that they spend about $2.7 million just on street lighting.",
        "And what they were hoping to save was between 250 and $500,000.",
        "So that was a considerable amount of money, given that they were talking about a $5.2 million budget gap.",
        "Yeah, a simple part of what the public works department was being asked to contribute, as their share of the cut.",
        "But the city isn't just turning out turning off lights, they are actually literally ripping some of these streetlights out of the sidewalks.",
        "Why are they doing that?",
        "You know, a number of lights are being removed and they're being removed by the electrical company.",
        "Some of them, the poles are remaining because the company is using the pole for other purposes.",
        "All right, so with Daylight Saving Time now upon us, is it literally pitch dark in parts of Rockford, you know, starting at around 6:00 PM?",
        "It is dark.",
        "Yeah, it is getting dark earlier.",
        "I'm getting quite a bit of feedback from different parts of town, saying that they're seeing dramatic differences on the streets where they live and it's concerning them.",
        "I think that if you just drive around town it's not that noticeable.",
        "But if you're in an area and you're used to a certain kind of lighting every time you drive home, you're going to notice it."

        "I mean, obviously, the city is saving money, but what about public safety issues?",
        "You know, there were a lot of questions posed to the police chief.",
        "And the police chief told the council that there really are no studies that show direct correlation.",
        "And he is of the belief that, directly, the lighting doesn't affect crime.",

        "But we're only a few months into this.",

        "How else is Rockford sort of thinking creatively about ways to balance the budget?",
        "You know, they are looking in different areas where they can cut back, and then also generate revenue.",
        "One thing that they're talking about is to adopt an increase on vehicle impoundments.",
        "That they're talking about increasing that price from $100 to $500.",
        "Wow.",
        "It's a potential revenue-generator for the city of about $500,000, they're hoping next year.",
