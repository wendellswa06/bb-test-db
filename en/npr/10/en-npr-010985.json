        "Last week on this program, we looked at the challenge the National Institutes of Health would face if it received a recommendation to end the use of chimpanzees for biomedical research.",

        "About a year ago, an independent report, commissioned by the National Institutes of Health, said that most biomedical research being done on chimps is not scientifically necessary.",

        "I mean, clearly, there is going to be a reduction in the use of chimpanzees in research.",

        "The NIH currently owns about 360 chimpanzees that aren't yet retired and that are living at research facilities.",
        "The new report from the working group says the majority should be retired and sent to a sanctuary, a non-laboratory setting where chimps can live more natural lives.",
        "Only a small population of about 50 chimps should be retained for any future research needs.",
        "What's more, the report lays out a detailed description of the kind of living conditions that research chimps should be given.",

        "I wouldn't characterize it as contentious.",
        "But I would characterize it as intense and thoughtful.",
        "The group concluded that chimps need to live in social groups of at least seven.",
        "And each chimp should have at least 1,000 square feet of living space, plus year-round access to the outdoors.",
