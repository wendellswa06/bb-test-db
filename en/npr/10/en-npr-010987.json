        "But there were two people in the hip-hop world who helped sort of shift that balance, and I want to ask you about one of them in a moment, The RZA from the group Wu-Tang Clan.",
        "But first, I want to ask you about sort of this unlikely champion of hip-hop.",
        "This is an ad executive you write about named Wendy Day.",
        "She was white.",
        "She was 30, which was considered ancient in that world.",
        "What did she do?",
        "Wendy Day went to work for a company in Canada that sold to Seagram, and she ended up making, she says, almost a half-million dollars.",
        "And she was basically sitting on this wad of cash, wondering what to do with the rest of her life.",
        "And she took this course on the pop music business from a man named Burt Padel(ph), who was at the time accountant to a lot of hip-hop stars.",
        "And he taught Wendy, and also Sean Puffy Combs, who attended that same class, about how onerous recording contracts were and how tilted the relationship was.",
        "So Wendy Day decided that this is what she was going to do, that she was going to dedicate her life and her fortune to liberating rap artists from bad deals.",
        "She quickly realized that she needed to do more than that, that she needed to help them get better ones.",
        "And she becomes instrumental in the landmark deals that Master P landed in the 1990s, Eminem.",
        "The biggest deal she ever did was the deal for a label that has a lot of currency right now called Cash Money.",
        "They did an unheard of deal with Universal for 80 percent of the wholesale price and a $3 million advance against records that they hadn't even sold yet.",
        "The cycles of the frequency is in that key.",
        "So you have B-flat all day...",
        "And Russell Simmons at the time was shocked.",
        "He said: I had to wait 10 years before I got a deal like this.",
        "And people are walking in and getting these deals right now.",
        "Tell me about how The RZA was involved.",
        "We've had him on the program, by the way.",
        "You talk about how he does something very, very clever.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, basically, what he insisted on was if he signed a deal for his group, which had eight to nine members at the time, that he was going to insist that he have the right to make separate solo deals for each of the members of the group, and this was unheard of at the time."

        "And RZA turned that on his head.",
        "He found a record company to accept his terms and gradually sold off the solo artists to other record companies.",

        "And as a result, I think that changed, again, the metanarrative of this whole thing, the changing relationship between the races in this country.",
