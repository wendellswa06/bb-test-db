        "The real interest rate that the bank needs to charge for this, actually, very strange kind of credit - it's unsecured, it goes to almost everybody - that the banks really need to make something like 30 or 40 percent interest to make enough money to make this business worthwhile.",
        "But nobody's going to accept a 30 to 40 percent interest rate, so the banks have been hiding it.",

        "They've been hiding in all sorts of strange charges, like being charged to pay by phone - what the advocates call tricks and traps.",
        "So they say that the fundamental business model is deceptive, and that makes this different from other maybe annoying businesses that have all sorts of charges.",
