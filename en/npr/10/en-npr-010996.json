        "You actually are reading things from al-Qaida leaders saying, oh no, democracy, that'd be terrible?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",

        "I mean I think this just illustrates, you know, for all of the praise in some ways that al-Qaida gets for its media apparatus, just how difficult it is for them to keep up with a revolution that is happening in the speed of Twitter.",
        "When you move away from al-Qaida leaders and begin monitoring what people are saying who are clearly sympathizers who show up in these chat rooms and so forth, how does the discussion change?",
        "Well, I think it is much more emotional in a lot of ways.",
        "It is people just exhorting the folks on the ground in Egypt or Libya or Tunisia to go forward and to overthrow these people.",

        "In a place like Yemen, if there is going to be a revolution, violence will probably be part of that.",
