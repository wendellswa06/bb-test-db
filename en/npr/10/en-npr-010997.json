        "It must be the case that something else is going on here that extends way beyond, you know, the decline of the dollar.",
        "So if it's not just the weak dollars sending oil prices up, maybe it's supply and demand.",
        "Maybe supplies are lower than last year, or demand is higher.",
        "Hensley says this might seem like an easy question to answer, if we knew what supply and demands were.",
        "But strange as it may seem, nobody knows how much oil the world actually demands each year.",
