        "But when you think about people who work hard and play by the rules, if you use that as a definition, you people who are in the, quote-unquote business elite, and a lot of those guys aren't playing by the rules, and that's why they're ending up in jail, disobeying the law, whatever.",
        "In the sports elite, you see these elite athletes we don't have to name all the names who have gotten themselves into scandals with drugs, infidelity, things like that, because they don't think the rules apply to them.",
        "The political elite, we see corruption.",
        "We see them operating the federal government without a budget.",
        "They see massive spending with no way to pay for it.",
        "Families can't do that.",
        "The families who play hard I mean work hard and play by the rules have to have a budget.",
        "And I think that's feeding some of this anti-intellectual, anti-elite attitude that you're talking about, because they see people who don't have to abide by the rest of it like we do.",
        "What about, though, you do have people appointed out okay, we've got President Obama, who worked hard, played by many rules on the way up in his difficult life, just as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas came from a very impoverished background, worked hard, rose up on the merits, also pegged as elitists.",
        "Is that fair?",
        "Well, I think that's coming from a similar term that we mentioned in the beginning: career politician.",
        "And sometimes elite means that they didn't have to hold a job and pay a payroll and understand what it's like to pick up a lunch bucket every day.",
        "For example, former President Bill Clinton, the first time he ever paid a mortgage was after he left office.",
        "The guy had never been a homeowner.",
        "That feeds the sort of feeling that they don't understand the rest of us, we've got to make our mortgage payments, we've got to punch our time clock because they've never had a job or done anything but run for office.",
        "Lee Siegel?",
        "Well, you know, the you have to remember the history of the term elite, as a term of abuse in American politics, it started with McCarthy, of course.",
        "And by the elite, McCarthy meant communists, and by communists, he meant simply intellectuals because unlike becoming a Republican or a Democrat, to become a communist, you at least had to read something."

        "So elites were intellectuals.",
        "Elites were not bound by the material facts of life as intellectuals.",
        "That's why business elites, they certainly are elites in the sense that they hold often the wealth and the power, they're not considered elites by many people because they have to abide by the material facts of life, the transactional facts of life, the business facts of life.",
        "So I think elite has this meaning of people who can live immaterially, who are not burdened by fact, by mortgages certainly.",
        "And I think the other meaning is people who are the products of clandestine networks, you know, people who go to Ivy League Schools, people who are the products of extremes of influence, of log-rolling.",
        "I think the term elite is used in that sense to contrast these cultural elites with, again, business elites who at least had to you know, they had to make money.",

        "A badge of honor.",
        "A badge of honor, even though someone else, Anne Applebaum, pointed out recently the Ivy League schools have worked very hard in recent decades to broaden and diversify their student body, to not be elite.",
        "But yet it's still a bad label.",
        "But I think elite also carries this as a bona fide intellectual and someone who reads Henry James, I do think that elite carries this stigma of abstraction.",
        "And certainly, in some ways, it's legitimate to criticize elites.",
        "Is it legitimate to call President Obama an elite, who did have a mortgage and student loans at one point before the presidency?",
        "True.",
        "In the ordinary sense of someone who thinks, of someone who reads, of someone who in his abstractions does not seem as bound by material facts of life, as for all of their wealth, the business elite, yes, elite applies.",
        "Elite is very effective.",
        "Do I myself buy elite as a stigma?",
        "No, of course not.",
        "I want thinking and articulate people running the country.",
