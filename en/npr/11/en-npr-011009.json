        "One of the first things he did was to climb the city's famous limestone steps, those steps made famous in the silent film \"\"Battleship Potemkin.",

        "That's right.",
        "The city, in fact, has this kind of double identity, a place that's liberal, that's relatively open but a dark and subversive side that appears from time to time over the course of the 19th century, and then, most spectacularly, most tragically, over the course of the 20th century.",

        "Well, different dictionaries have different ways of organizing their definitions.",

        "So you have this traditional meaning and then sort of chronologically comes the next one.",
        "Random House, for instance, which supplies many of the definitions that are used on dictionary.com, the target of this new petition, organizes entries so that what meanings are most frequently encountered come first, and then you get to more peripheral meanings.",
        "And even though that's not historical, it's still - there's a rationale behind it that would explain why the traditional marriage between a man and woman would be considered in the first part of the definition, followed by the extension of this sense to same-sex marriage.",
        "And then there's the argument that, wait a minute, dictionaries are not supposed to reflect what advocates of any argument want the word to mean.",
        "They should reflect the way the words are actually used in conversation.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And what we find with this contentious word marriage is that regardless of what you think about same-sex marriage, that expression same-sex marriage or gay marriage, that gets used across the political spectrum even by people who don't think there should be legal protection or legal standing for same-sex marriage.",
        "Someone like Rick Santorum, for instance, might complain about same-sex marriage, but he uses that word marriage to label what he complains about.",
        "So there has been kind of a transformation, I think, across the political spectrum, and it would be a little ridiculous for lexicographers not to reflect what's going on in usage to simply ignore this new change in usage.",
        "And at the same time, he does have a point in that most people or many people still use the word marriage in that traditional sense.",
        "There are two definitions.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, but, again, this is how the dictionary has become a kind of political football where people look at the dictionary definition with their own ideological point of view about the matter.",
        "And if it doesn't accord exactly with their idea of how marriage should be defined, then they'll find grounds for complaint.",
        "But, again, the lexicographers are really trying to pin down the way people now are using it in real conversation, real texts, and that's what they're basing their definitions on.",
        "And it was interesting, in your piece, you said - you noted that in the - two centuries ago, there were other definitions of marriage that are no longer in the dictionary.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, there's - some have said that, well, the definition of marriage simply hasn't changed over centuries or millennia even.",
        "But if you look through historical dictionaries, you can see interesting reflections of their time period.",
        "So, for instance, The Century Dictionary, which is a great American dictionary that was compiled in the late 19th century, made room in its definition of marriage to also refer to plural marriage which had explained - would apply especially to the kind of polygamy existing among the Mormons without the accompaniment of the harem of oriental countries, each wife usually living in a separate house.",
        "You know, that was something that was very specific to the American scene and describing certain practices in certain parts of the country which obviously are no longer around.",
        "And so the social realities of marriage have dictated the way that it's been defined, and that's certainly what's happening today.",
