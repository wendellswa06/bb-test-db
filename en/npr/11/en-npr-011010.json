        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for having me on.",
        "Go ahead please.",

        "I'm a Spanish student.",
        "I'm studying towards a Spanish minor.",
        "My understanding is that a dictionary is really supposed to be a tool to learn a language.",
        "I mean, that's how we used it when I was in elementary school and a little kid.",
        "And how - I agree with your point that it's - it shouldn't be used as a tool of advocacy.",
        "And how - I would like just your guest to address how it has strayed from being just a purely educational tool.",
        "Every Spanish dictionary I use has outlined how a word can be used in several different contexts and how the usage is, but it never really touches on opinions ever.",
        "Well, that's interesting question.",
        "I mean, dictionaries obviously are used for many different purposes, including to learn the language.",
        "And as an educational tool, one could say that it's important to reflect the way that the word is used in the real world.",
        "So that if it ignored, for instance, the reality of the word marriage being used in same-sex context, for instance, that would not be a very good educational tool because if a language learner encountered that, they might be confused by a dictionary definition that was too restrictive.",
        "And on the other hand, if you just sort of glossed over the fact that we have this sort of traditional sense that has been the case historically and a more modern extension of that in certain jurisdictions to same-sex couples, then that would also be an oversight by the lexicographers.",
        "So there are a lot of criteria and a lot of concerns that dictionary makers are juggling when they're trying to fit all of this crucial information into a compact dictionary entry.",
        "It can be a real challenge, especially with something as highly politicized as the word marriage.",
        "And they really are just looking for a compact way to express that that will describe the way that the word is really used in the world.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Matt, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Do lexicographers have that kind of power?",
        "It's interesting.",
        "Both sides of this argument seem to give lexicographers an awful lot of power and more power, I think, than the lexicographers themselves would ascribe to themselves.",
        "The idea that the dictionary has some sort of defining authority for the way that we think about these things, like marriage, rather than simply just reflecting popular usage we find on both sides of the dispute.",
        "And while on the one hand, that's a bit of a naive point of view to give dictionary so much power, on the other hand, it does - actually the dictionary of, you know, dictionaries from various publishers do very often serve as a kind of umpire when we're trying to figure out the meaning of a word.",
        "And even judges in court cases will very often consult dictionaries to find out the so-called ordinary meanings of words that might not be defined by statutes that they're arguing over."

        "I think it's wonderful that dictionaries are broadening the definition of marriage because in so many states marriage is now legal between same-sex people.",
        "I also am a public school teacher in California, and I think many people don't know that all California public school teachers have to swear an oath of allegiance to the California State Constitution, promising to uphold Prop 8 and the California Constitution without mental reservation.",
        "So if you're a gay and lesbian teacher, you have to promise to uphold Prop 8 without mental reservation or you're not allowed to teach in the public schools.",
        "So I'm hoping that the Supreme Court challenge will get rid of Prop 8 so that gay and lesbian teachers can teach in public schools without having to swear allegiance to the California Constitution which includes Prop 8.",

        "Appreciate the phone call.",
        "And the question is - I do gather from time to time, Ben Zimmer, as you mentioned, the courts do cite dictionary definitions.",
        "It's true.",
        "Again, that tends to happen if there's a word that's under dispute that isn't defined by a statute.",
        "So, for instance, the Defense of Marriage Act, that actually gives a definition on the federal level that marriage is between a man and a woman.",
        "But there have been state cases.",
        "For instance, there was a case before the Rhode Island Supreme Court a few years ago.",
        "There was a same-sex couple that had been married in Massachusetts, wanted to get divorced Rhode Island.",
        "And the question was did the family court in Rhode Island have jurisdiction over this couple since Rhode Island itself didn't have same-sex marriages on the books, and marriage was not actually defined in the statute that set up the family court there?",
        "And so what the Rhode Island Supreme Court did is they went back to look at dictionary definitions of the word marriage from 1961 when this, you know, the family court was originally set up in Rhode Island.",
        "All the dictionaries agreed that marriage is just between one man and one woman, so they said, well, that's what the dictionaries said.",
        "That's what the ordinary meaning of the word marriage was at the time.",
        "So the family court in Rhode Island doesn't have any jurisdiction over this couple.",
        "So there were cases like that where dictionary definitions really actually do end up having a kind of legal import.",
        "And are there any - this is the cause of the day, but are there any other words that you can recollect that have become so politicized where definitions have been battered around?"

        "Well, marriage is certainly a highly charged one.",
        "But, I mean, it can come down to other words in our vocabulary too.",
        "So for instance, one recent case between AT&T and FCC went up to the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court, and it was a battle over whether personal privacy should apply to corporations like AT&T that - who was trying to get - they were trying to get out of out of this Freedom of Information Act request.",
        "And since corporations can be identified as persons under the law, does that mean that personal privacy can also apply to them?",
        "And so the Supreme Court ruling on that, which is a unanimous decision, ended up looking at that word personal, the adjective, and there's some sort of grammatical imperative that says just because corporations are persons then this adjective personal should also apply to them.",
        "And they decided no. Based on looking at the way the word personal is used in real usage, it's about human beings and not about corporations.",
        "And so they did consult dictionaries and other collections of text in order to figure that out.",
        "So lexicographers are, despite their humility, they do have power.",
        "They do have some power even if sometimes they would disown that power and say, well, we're just humble scribes doing our dredge work compiling the dictionary.",
        "Ink-stained wretches, yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "And so there is an effort to be current but not to be ahead.",
        "That's true.",
        "I mean, again, the idea is not to promote some sort of ideological agenda and to reflect usage as it is developing.",
        "And in a case like marriage, obviously, over the past decades, things have changed pretty rapidly, not just in the United States but in other countries.",
        "I believe there are 10 countries that allow same-sex marriage nationwide, and we have various jurisdictions now in the United States that allow it.",
        "And so because the reality of the situation is changing, that means that dictionaries have to catch up and reflects that as best as they can.",
        "And since technology is changing as well, since it's now much easier to make a change, you don't have to publish a whole new book, you can do it online for most dictionaries.",
        "I assume that these battles are happening more often.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "And, in fact, dictionary makers are actually responding more quickly, I think, because they can make changes online.",
        "So for instance, the American Heritage Dictionary came out with a new edition of their dictionary late last year, and there were certain complaints about one word, audism, A-U-D-I-S-M, which they defined as discrimination or prejudice against people based on the fact that their ability to hear is impaired or absent."
