        "It turned out the actual rapist was someone called Bobby Poole, who looked a lot like Ronald Cotton.",

        "So, how does that happen?",
        "How is it that someone who, like Jennifer Thompson, was convinced that she had the right guy, how could she be so mistaken?",
        "Well, science is starting to prove - and again, the whole field of eyewitness identification, the science of it, is quite new.",
        "Much of the really interesting research has happened since this 1977 Supreme Court case.",
        "And the research shows that our eyes simply deceive us, that our brains do a lot of work manipulating our memories and reframing our memories.",
        "One of the things that's interesting about that particular case is that long after Jennifer Thompson knew that Ronald Cotton wasn't her actual rapist, that Bobby Poole had done it, she still could close her eyes and see Ronald Cotton, in her head, committing the rape.",
        "So, this has been said for many, many years, decades in fact, by legal experts and by people who observed this, and yet nothing has changed.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, the Supreme Court hasn't heard a case on this in over 30 years.",
        "And Gary Wells, who's a professor who's been studying this for decades, says that what happened is in 1977, when the court last looked at this, they simply relied on old science about the underpinnings of the reliability of eyewitness identification.",
        "And because they haven't revisited it, police departments haven't brought their practices up to a modern standard.",
        "He says that eyewitness ID evidence should be treated more like trace evidence, like blood evidence or fingerprint evidence that can be corrupted and that can be manipulated over time.",
        "And so his point is, we really need to rethink the science underpinning the 30-year-old science that we've relied on for a long time."
