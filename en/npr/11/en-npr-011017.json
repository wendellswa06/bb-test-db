        "So as I understand it, the descriptions in the papers this morning, at least five of the seven most controversial nominees would be guaranteed a vote on the floor; at the same time, Democrats would preserve the option, in some cases, of filibuster.",
        "That's correct.",
        "It would reserve the right and the option of filibustering, but wouldn't guarantee that the filibuster would be used even in those cases, but it would make it clear that if each senator felt, in his or her opinion, that a particular nominee involved exceptional circumstances--extraordinary is the word that's used--then they could vote against that--they could vote for the filibuster or, in effect, against cloture."
