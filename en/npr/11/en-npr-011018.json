        "What's holding things up?",
        "Well, you know, when you get 12 senators in a room, there are 14 opinions, at least, maybe more.",
        "The key is that we are continuing to look at language to make sure that everybody is comfortable with the draft and redrafting of language.",
        "The very encouraging thing about this process is that we've all learned to work together.",
        "There are a whole host of us that have not worked together before this closely.",
        "And when you're looking to make things happen and to get something done, you really begin to understand and develop mutual trust with one another, and that's been a very important part of this process.",
        "Well, listening to the rhetoric on this issue, trust is an illusive concept in Washington these days.",
        "Well, it's a very rare one, but among these 12 or 13 individuals, I think we've gotten to where we trust one another very much, and we've also tried not to undercut the leaders of either caucus.",
        "We want to make sure that we're working with them, as much as we can, but we also know that at the end of the time frame, we don't want to see judges not get up or down votes wherever we possibly can, and at the same time, we don't want to see this meltdown that would come most likely from a nuclear option.",
        "And, you know, are there going to be any winners on this issue, either way this happens?",
        "Well, I think the winners are the American people, getting up or down votes on most of the judges, but at the same time, recognizing that the minority rights that are protected by the filibuster are retained as well.",
        "So I think we avoid the runaway situation that you can have with a simple majority, and we preserve for the future the right to object, through the use of a filibuster, wherever it's appropriate.",
        "Both sides in the compromise--obviously compromise means giving something up.",
        "On the Republican side, Senator Frist said he wants up or down votes on all of the nominees.",
        "President Bush said the same thing today.",
        "That's hard to fudge.",
        "Well, you know, the only way they can do that, I guess, is to do away with the nuclear option, or through the nuclear option, do away with the filibuster.",
        "Well, they don't have enough votes on their side if we come to this agreement.",
        "So that's clearly what this is about.",

        "Hi, Ron.",
        "Hello, Neal.",
        "Do Senator Nelson and his colleagues have a chance of avoiding the nuclear option by this compromise?",
        "It does not appear that they do.",
        "Certainly, there is a chance in the sense that if it were all to fall the way that they have described--and the senator did a nice job of describing how that would be done--it is not apparent at this point that they have hit upon language formulation that all 12 or 13, as the senator said, could all subscribe to.",
        "That's going to be extremely difficult to do, because, for example, if you were to say under extraordinary circumstances, individual senators might still use the filibuster, well, that essentially preserves the right of filibuster, and that is exactly what this whole argument is about.",
        "The president and Senate majority leader have said the filibuster should not be an absolute right or any given senator or for either party in the event of a judicial nomination.",
        "And whether you believe that that could be limited to judicial nominations or not, that's what they claim.",
        "They say they are only interested in shutting down judicial nomination filibusters, and I don't see how you make a compromise by which that principle and the other principle of up or down vote for absolutely every nominee can be honored.",
        "I just don't see how they sort that out, unless you go ahead and characterize this as a rebellion against the leadership, which, of course, Senator Ben Nelson did not want to do.",
        "He did not want to say--he said, `We're working to help the leaders.",
        "We're not trying to undercut the leaders.'",
        "But it's impossible to see how you would resolve this matter without essentially taking it out of their hands and saying, `No, we're going to deny you the votes in either direction.",
        "We're going to keep either party from being the majority in this body.",
        "And we're going to set up a third, if you will, moderate party in the center that denies its votes to either side.'",
        "And which trusts--because this is all based on trust--and trusts the other guys in that moderate party to hang with their--we also talked about the--I guess the rhetorical corner that the majority leader, Senator Frist, is in.",
        "Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, is also in a corner, the opposite one.",
        "Correspondingly, he has committed himself to preserve the right of the filibuster for all of these nominees and not to essentially throw any of the Democrats captives over the side.",
        "In the end, of course, any intransigent position can just be backed away from if the people who have taken that position have the will to do so, have the mind to do so, but what I see here--and the reason why I think the chance of a deal or a compromise is remote, what I see here is a drive to see whether or not this can be accomplished by fiat; that the White House has brought to bear all its guns and it wants to achieve the right to approve a judicial nomination with 50 votes, plus the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Dick Cheney, and that this is their strategy for a Supreme Court nominee.",

        "What if, in a couple of years, the Democrats take over, can these rules be changed back?",
        "Will the Republicans try to go back the opposite direction once the Democrats are in control and then they have Democrat and more liberal judges who are being nominated for the bench?",

        "They feel quite confident they will hold it in 2006, 2008, and beyond.",
        "Now, of course, no one can guarantee it forever, but they're willing to take that risk in order to have the ability to proceed now without this limitation.",

        "Then in retaliation, Democrats will begin a threatened slowdown of Senate business.",

        "And, Ron, just before the break, a caller from St. Louis, I think also named Ron, was asking about the use of the filibuster back in the 1960s to block civil rights legislation.",
        "Would this affect that at all?",
        "Well, I think that if you're going to split into filibuster, you should be prepared to stand up and talk for a while, either side.",
        "I think that all of us are tired of seeing this nice politics, this gentleman's politics, and that if the Republicans are going to have majorities in the House, the Senate and the administration, they need to start acting like it and using some of their power.",
        "Not technically, because we're only talking here about eliminating the filibuster for judicial nominees and not on legislation, so legislation would still be subject to the 60-vote rule to cut off debate.",
        "However, it has been argued that once you have eliminated the filibuster for judicial nominees, it's not a very long step to eliminating it for other kinds of nominees, such as John Bolton's nomination to be United Nations ambassador.",
        "That could be perhaps another case where the precedent that Mr. Cheney is invoking in this case could be invoked again, and they could say, `Well, you can't filibuster any kind of an executive nomination.",
        "He deserves an up or down vote.'",
        "Then, of course, the argument becomes why only for people?",
        "Why not legislation?",
        "Why shouldn't the Senate be ruled by a simple majority?",
        "That's the way the House operates.",
        "And that opens up the final layers of Pandora's box, in this particular case, and people would be arguing that the filibuster really had no place in a democracy.",
        "Certainly the filibuster gained a very bad reputation in the '50s and '60s when it was used against civil rights legislation repeatedly, and it took months and months to break the filibuster in 1964 and bring about passage of the Civil Rights Act.",
        "Since that time, the number of votes needed to break a filibuster has been reduced from 67 down to 60, and that was largely because of the civil rights abuse of the filibuster, if you want to call it that."

        "And Republicans maintain today that this is another abuse of the filibuster; that it was really the Democrats who started this fight because they started applying filibusters to numerous judicial candidates, 10 in the last presidential term.",
        "Previous to that, there was a filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination back in 1968 that tended when the candidate withdrew.",
        "There have been other instances of judges being blocked when nominated, but that's taken place, by and large, in committee or even before they got to committee.",

        "You conducted a survey on this issue with 1,500 Americans two weeks ago.",
        "What did you find?",
        "Well, we found that the public wasn't paying close attention.",
        "Only 30 percent or a third were paying any attention to this filibuster fight, and 14 percent paying very close attention.",
        "Those are low numbers, even by Washington standards.",
        "But this is not going unrecognized.",
        "I mean, the public sees a big argument.",
        "They're not paying attention to the details.",
        "We had 64 percent saying that Congress--people on the Hill are bickering more than usual.",
        "That's a very high number.",
        "We haven't been in that region since October of '95 when 72 percent thought that when the government was all but shut down or was shut down, so the public is noticing.",
        "And poll ratings for Congress are falling both in our poll and in other polls.",
        "The Wall Street Journal put out a poll last week, had 33 percent approving of Congress.",
        "That's 51 percent disapproving.",
        "At the beginning of '04, those numbers were 46-41 percent.",
        "So this is a big decline, and we also even see declining percentages of people saying their member of Congress deserves re-election.",
        "Now generally, the public is down on Congress, but likes their own members.",
        "But The Wall Street Journal poll found only 42 percent saying their member deserves re-election; 45 percent saying no comparing to a 49-34 split back in '04, when, of course, most of them were re-elected.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So while the public is not tracking it--to make this simple, while the public is not tracking the ins and outs of this argument, they realize that these people are involved in a big fight up here, and not much is getting done, and they're unhappy.",
        "Of that 30 percent, who is paying attention?",
        "How do they break down or is that significant?",
        "Well, I think it is, because it might portend what would happen as more people pay attention.",
        "And among that group, we find a 54-to-36 percent majority oppose to stopping the judicial filibuster.",
        "Now when the other 70 percent tunes in, they might be like this or they might be different.",
        "I think the whole question will depend upon who the public sees as the most reasonable, you know, or the other way, the most unreasonable.",
        "Generally Americans like politicians who compromise, try to get things done and minimize the fight.",
        "So if it should come to the nuclear option, who are they going to blame?",
        "The Republican numbers are dropping a little faster than the Democratic numbers, which might argue that the Democrats may have the advantage, but with so many people still out to sea on this one, it could go either way."
