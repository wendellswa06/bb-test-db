        "And you did point out, Democratic numbers are not dropping as fast as Republican numbers, but it doesn't seem like anybody's coming out the winner in this.",
        "No, they're not.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "Drew is with us.",
        "Drew's in Wichita, Kansas.",
        "Hi.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "Thank you.",
        "One of the things I would like to point out is while many people may think that the filibuster may not be something that should be available in a democracy, we are a republic, and to that end, I think one of the senses that we're seeing more locally may not be the specifics--the interest in the specifics of the issue, but more of an interest and an encouragement that we actually see the Republican Party acting like a party in the majority.",
        "For too long, I think, there's been a general sense of frustration, especially with the Senate, that they are more interested in their image and maintaining gentleman's politics than actually going ahead and representing the people or doing the business of the government.",
        "We have a couple of visitors from the East, sometimes it feels like, more than representatives in the Senate from Kansas.",
        "So in other words, you think that as a Republican majority that got elected, they should get ahead with the Republican agenda, majority rule.",
        "Well, there are quite a few issues that are hanging fire.",
        "We've got an energy package out of the House the Senate hasn't taken up yet.",
        "There's going to be a great deal of immigration legislation that's needing to be debated that's being proposed in both chambers.",
        "Congress would like to get around to talking about taxes yet this year.",
        "There is the Social Security proposal from the president.",
        "That's making its way through committees and toward the floors.",
        "And there are a lot of other things that they would like to get to this year, to put it mildly.",
        "That's not going to happen in the Senate in the normal fashion after tomorrow's vote, assuming that we do go to the nuclear option.",
        "And this is the reason.",
        "In the House, the rules are fairly simple, and there is a majority rule, concept and rule.",
        "In the Senate, however, each and every individual member has had a lot of power, back through all the history of our republic.",
        "And as a result, in the Senate, when you wanted to move forward, you needed to be mindful of the sensitivities of each senator and you needed to build a consensus that was at least equal to the number of votes necessary to stop a filibuster, if not greater.",
        "And as a result, if one party or the other declares war on the filibuster and on the protection of the minority's rights, the other party is likely to withdraw its consent from the usual way of doing things; for example, they always agree not to read a bill, to just go ahead and debate the bill without reading it out loud, which can take hours or days.",
        "That could be very easily withheld.",
        "And a number of other things can be done to slow down the process in the Senate, because the Senate has been the place where it was expected that people would compromise, that they would seek the middle, that they would seek consensus.",
        "If that's not going to happen, if the Senate's going to be run along the model that the listener just described in urging the Republicans to behave this way, then I think you're going to see the Senate get to be an extraordinarily slow place.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line, and this is Brad, and Brad's with us from Salt Lake City.",
        "Brad, are you there?",
        "How are you, Neal?",
        "Thanks for taking my call."

        "Sure, Brad.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I have two sort of questions.",
        "The first one is I don't quite understand the logic behind some of the Republican thinking.",
        "They're saying that on the one hand, that without question, every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote, and if you don't agree with us on that, then we're going to threaten as a very, very, very last resort to actually make that a rule.",
        "I don't understand why it's not just a given that you just make this rule change and move on, why all the dramatics?",
        "It's a little like saying, `We really want to build a path, and if you don't concede to us that it should pass, then we're just going to go ahead and vote on it, darn it.'",
        "And then the other question that I have is, is I talked to people out here.",
        "We kind of have the sense that this is really all about posturing for a potential Supreme Court nominee, and I don't understand why the people looking for a compromise here don't just cut to the chase; why Harry Reid and some important Democrats don't sit down with Senator Frist and Orrin Hatch and Arlen Specter and somebody from the White House and say, `You know, let's just cut right to the chase.",
        "Let's scrap these really controversial appellate court nominations.",
        "You give us that, and we'll give you Michael McConnell when Chief Justice Rehnquist retires.'",
        "Well, Ron Elving, certainly the Supreme Court--a lot of people saying this is just a skirmish leading up to that battle.",
        "If it were not for the Supreme Court, this probably would have been worked out some months ago.",
        "Under previous administrations, previous Senate leadership, this probably would have been worked out months ago.",
        "It's entirely possible that some sort of compromise could have been reached, but what a lot of this is about--and, by the way, the reason that they don't just make it a rule change is because to formally change the rules in the Senate takes 67 votes, even higher than 60 votes, so that's not going to happen.",
        "There isn't the spirit of cooperation to do that.",
        "What they would have to do if they were going to work out some sort of a deal on the Supreme Court justice would be to have everybody at the table and say, `Who could we all agree on?",
        "Who could be filibuster-proof as a nominee to the United States Supreme Court?",
        "and the administration has said that they don't see it as necessary for them to negotiate with Democrats over their choice of who a Supreme Court nominee would be anymore than they see it as necessary to negotiate over appellate court justices, like Priscilla Owen or Janice Rogers Brown.",
        "They want to pick the people they want.",
        "They want those people to be approved by simple majority.",
        "They don't want to negotiate on who they choose for the Supreme Court.",
        "Andy Kohut, you said the polling showed not many people were engaged on this issue.",
        "What about on the Supreme Court?",
        "Well, if we get to a Supreme Court appointee, that will bring in the public, particularly if there's a fight which raises the question of moderation.",
        "The American public doesn't want the Supreme Court to become more conservative nor more liberal.",
        "They want a status quo situation.",
        "And if there is an argument about the conservatism of the nominee, it could be quite a problem, particularly because Independents these days--our studies show that Independents these days are very worried about perhaps the Republican Party going too far in legislating morality and being too conservative.",
        "For example, while we found Independents breaking about evenly on the argument that President Bush won the election, and if a majority of senators agree, he should get a conformation.",
        "But when it comes to the proposition that the minority party ought to be able to block some judges because they're appointed for life, 2-to-1 Independents say, `Yes, that's right,' they take the Democratic position.",
        "So this issue of the direction of the country--moderate, not too conservative--is very important to those people in the middle who are generally the least engaged.",
        "We're talking about the brewing battle over the filibuster and judicial nominees in the US Senate.",
        "Our guests are Andy Kohut of The Pew Research Center for People and the Press and NPR senior Washington editor Ron Elving."

        "You know, I love your guests today, and I think they're the perfect candidates to answer one question that I like to ask myself when I listen to your shows: Why should I care?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I am--you know, I try to keep my ear to the tracks, but generally this kind of stuff is too heady for me, and I don't see where the rubber meets the road.",
        "Why should I care?",
        "Ron Elving, why should Todd in Reno, Nevada, care?",
        "I can understand why people listen to all this and certainly ask themselves, `Why should I care?",
        "certainly ask themselves, `How does this affect me?",
        "It takes a little bit of walking through the consequences through several sequences to see why they should care, unless of course they have a particularly interest in the federal judiciary or in the interpretation of the law.",
        "Most people get interested in those things when an issue comes up that affects them; for example, whether or not they can get an abortion legally in the United States.",
        "One of the cases that will come before the next Supreme Court after it's been given a new chief--if we assume that Bill Rehnquist is going to step down, as most people do, this summer--one of the issues that'll come back before them in all likelihood is the freedom to get an abortion or to get an abortion without certain kinds of parental notification.",
        "That case was just added to the Supreme Court docket for next year this morning.",
        "So there are issues of that kind.",
        "There are issues of economics.",
        "There are issues of all kinds of personal freedoms that come before the Supreme Court all the time.",
        "A few years ago, the Supreme Court made a ruling regarding homosexual behavior in a Texas case that has changed the landscape of laws regarding gay life in America, gay people in America; let the door open to the issue of gay marriage, which is probably going to come before the Supreme Court in and of itself.",
        "And these things are going to be decided by the very people whose identity is being determined by this argument.",
        "This is a big argument over process and procedure, but it all has to do with picking people who will make decisions that will affect the everyday lives of average Americans.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And if I could just weigh in, I think that last thing that you said, Ron, is really important.",
        "When ordinary people hear this, they hear an argument about process because the reporting is about what's going on up on the Hill and it's very much inside baseball.",
        "But there are all of these connecting links that are quite important to people, but that isn't registering.",
        "So that's why we're only getting about a third in these polls saying, `Yeah, I'm really tracking the ins and outs of this.",
        "But a much broader percentage of people would be engaged if they saw those connections.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think we'll get there very soon.",
        "And we're going to have some serious drama later today when this debate goes on all night, and then we could come up with the vote as soon as tomorrow.",
