        "And, Daniel Yergin, I wanted to ask you the disaster at the nuclear power plant in Japan.",
        "As a result, there is a sea change in public opinion there, and all of the nuclear power plants in Japan, as you mentioned, have shut down.",
        "In this country, Deepwater Horizon, disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, all of these platforms are now up and producing again.",
        "New licenses are being offered.",
        "We're talking about drilling in - off the coast of -northern coast of Alaska and the Bering Sea.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think they're two different kinds of accidents.",
        "And, you know, just the consequences of Fukushima.",
        "I mean, there was Japan saying that we're going to get 50 percent of our electricity from nuclear power, and now these plants were shut down for normal maintenance, and they just can't - public opinion won't allow them to open it again.",
        "So Japan is going to incredible soul searching.",
        "It's true.",
        "I think one of the things is that the regulatory system or regime was changed, and the kind of promotion side of offshore development was separated from the safety side.",
        "And I think, you know, and kind of, you know, it's not back to where it was, but it is a new system.",
        "And also, you know, this was an accident that supposedly couldn't happen.",
        "It did happen, and they didn't have the technology to deal with an accident like that.",
        "Now, their two companies have forced under pressure of the events to develop the technology to do it.",
        "And I think that was one of the requirements for the administration agreeing to reopen and begin new licensing in the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "But if we talk about - and in Alaska, in the Bering Sea, that's shallow waters.",
        "It's not as deep as...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...as with that platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but disaster there - how are you going to get resources to that remote part of the world?",
        "Well, I think that's all going to be built in to the whole process.",
        "I don't think it's going to go forward with the sense that, oh, well, we can improvise.",
        "It's got to be built into the basic plan, and I think it will be.",
        "And this is a project that's really been under development for 20 years now.",
        "All these projects take decades to come to fruition.",
        "Long lead times, yes.",
        "Daniel Yergin, thank you so much."

        "The president and Hollywood stars have made special appeals to this group, nicely reminding them that those who choose not to enroll have to pay a fine.",
        "In 2011, over 18 million of these young adults were not insured for health care.",
        "We spoke with Lisa Dubay, a fellow at the Urban Institute, about why many have not had coverage.",
        "Only about 11 percent of the uninsured Young Invincibles aren't purchasing coverage because they think they don't need it.",
        "Most of them are saying they're not purchasing coverage because it's unaffordable.",
        "So I'm not convinced that they're not going to enroll.",
        "I think they probably will enroll.",
        "If the rates are good and they look like they're going to be low with the subsidies, I think that we will get Young Invisibles to come in.",

        "They can buy a catastrophic plan if they're under 30.",
        "They can buy a plan that is cheaper than, you know, the average plan.",
        "So I think the flexibility that the exchanges offer to the Young Invincibles, as well as the subsidies, will get them enrolled.",
