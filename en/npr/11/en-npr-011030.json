        "The order was to kill him; only capture him if he was clearly surrendering.",
        "There's no legal question whatsoever under international law.",
        "He was an illegal combatant.",
        "That is a U.N.",
        "legal definition.",
        "This is war, not a police operation in a domestic environment.",
        "Well, first of all, there's a serious question about whether or not it is even legal at all for the CIA to command a covert action like this.",
        "There's an article this morning in Wired magazine that I would highly recommend that describes the way in which covert operations run by the CIA that use lethal force are legal under both domestic and international law.",
        "The other aspect that I would note is that, again, you know, you can look at the way we treated some of the most heinous criminals in the world, people who have violated all kinds of laws of war, and had been engaged in all kinds of combatant behavior that has been illegal, starting from the Nazi and working our way down to war criminals, who in the last several decades got sent to The Hague or to war crimes tribunals because Western justice adopted the idea that even for people clearly guilty of being illegal combatants or war criminals, it is far better to be a civilization that follows rules and laws; that its the way that you avoid abuse.",
        "And it (technical difficulty)...",
        "And we seem to have lost the line to Rio de Janeiro.",
        "Oh, are you still there, Glenn?",

        "And as much as I cannot bear the thought of Osama bin Laden and what he stands for - and I saw that attack in (unintelligible) live on TV, the niggling feeling of what if that situation of the SEALs going into assassinate or capture or kill bin Laden were flipped, and that happened in the United States with perhaps our present president or someone very high and respected in our government?",
        "If the same thing happened here, what - how would we feel about that?",
        "And wasn't it perhaps the same kind of thing that was done to the Twin Towers.",
        "And, you know, again, I just wonder about the president, the precedent, the president and how we go forward from here.",
        "Anne, I think a lot of people would have difficulty withdrawing a moral equivalence between Osama bin Laden and the president of the United States.",
        "But Glenn Greenwald, in a sense, that's the question you're asking.",
        "Right.",
        "And I don't think it requires a moral equivalent.",
        "But what I will say is that the United States under George Bush launched what a huge portion of the planet believes to be a completely illegal war by invading Iraq that killed many, many, many, many more times the number of people that Osama bin Laden killed.",
        "Currently, President Obama is engaged in multiple covert wars that people think are illegal, that have slaughtered children and women and civilians in Yemen and in Pakistan with drone attacks, and in Afghanistan as well.",
        "And so if you're going to take the position that anybody who kills civilians in a way that is questionable or legally dubious can be targeted for killing by the people who are the victims, then I do think you start getting into justifications where Pakistani who feel aggrieved by drone attacks or Yemenis who were (unintelligible), family members were killed by our cluster bombs can come to United states and try and kill the president, or can try and bomb the White House and turn our leaders into legitimate targets as well.",
        "You cannot espouse principles that we get to apply to the rest of the world but that the rest of the world doesn't then get to apply to us.",
        "Glenn Greenwald, thanks very much for the time.",

        "Hillary Clinton has been officially running for president for a couple of months now, but she's kept a small-scale events with voters and steered far clear of the press.",
        "Yesterday, she took to the main stage with her first major political rally.",
        "As NPR's Tamara Keith reports, she kept to the familiar from this bedrock Democratic platform to the location of the rally itself."

        "They're sort of set in a spot you might see them out in the wild.",
        "Have you ever wondered how they got that gazelle to look so realistic, the alert look on its face, like it's just got a whiff of a predator or the tendons and the muscles stretched tight beneath its hide as it prepares to sort of bolt off to safety?",
        "Well, it turns out that there's one man who's really largely responsible for a lot of that magic, a taxidermist by the name of Carl Akeley.",
        "Akeley revolutionized natural history museums in the early 1900s, dreaming up the idea of putting animals in realistic scenes of life on the savannah, instead of just putting stuffed hides in wood and glass boxes as people had been doing before.",
        "It wasn't easy to get the animals to look so alive, so muscular, rather than just a patchwork of skin and stuff - stuffed body filled with sawdust and rags.",
        "He figured out how to do all of that and how to elevate taxidermy to an artform.",
        "And along the way he had some crazy adventures, like the time he wrestled a leopard, killing it with his own bare hands, or a more unfortunate encounter when he was mauled by an elephant.",

        "When I was a little kid that was one of my favorite things to do when I went to New York, was to go visit the dioramas.",
