        "But there are all of these sightings of them all over the place, almost like Elvis sightings.",
        "And I guess I got kind of taken by the whole cryptozoological thing of that, and I got in deeper, but then I started reading about the natural history behind it.",

        "Right.",
        "...and, you know, the programs and the - I just read something in passing about this famous taxidermist, Carl Akeley, who had once famously strangled a leopard with his bare hands, and I was immediately smitten.",
        "And how did he revolutionize - what did he do differently than what other people have been doing until then?",
        "Well, he - I mean, he did start out, you know, the same way.",
        "I mean, he might have had a little more passion as a youngster.",
        "He was so obsessed with it as a child - like 11, 12 years old - that his whole bedroom had been devoted to tearing apart and reassembling animals.",
        "And he had the arsenic and the phenol and all of these toxic preserving chemicals that he could get around the corner at the local drugstore.",
        "But his family was so concerned with him and his obsession with taxidermy that one point an aunt of his suggested that perhaps he could - he'll do well to go away to an insane asylum for youth.",
        "But then he finally left home and he went and worked for a company called WARD's Science - WARD's Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York, which was not far from the farm where Akeley grew up.",
        "And this place, WARD's, was producing not only dioramas and stuffed animals for the new up-and-coming natural history museums, but you know, everything - you know, gemstones and geodes and fossils and all of that."
