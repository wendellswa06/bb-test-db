        "And it wasn't until 1921, when he was in the Congo collecting mountain gorillas, when he really first had his great epiphany and realized - I mean, he felt like a murderer, and he writes about this very affectingly, just - and I think it was probably easier for him to feel like a murderer because he was face to face with a primate, and it was easier to feel, you know, simpatico with a gorilla that seems much more like a human than maybe a gazelle or a, you know, or a giraffe or something more alien.",
        "So, you know, in the end, that that led - this is towards the end of his life and his story - but I mean that is his great redemption in the end, that he felt so strongly about this that he dedicated the latter part of his life persuading the Belgian government to establish what would be the first wildlife sanctuary in Africa.",
