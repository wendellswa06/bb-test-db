        "I mean the lowland gorilla was much more populated and people had had more encounters with them, but the mountain gorilla, Akeley felt, was very special, so...",

        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, I'm aware of William Hornaday.",
        "I mean, there's - I mean, Akeley did not invent taxidermy, and there were certainly other people who made great advances in it.",
        "One of his predecessors who ended up being at the, you know, American Museum of Natural History as well, William Hornaday, had created some of the proto-natural habitats.",
        "These are the ones that kind of express the idea of ecology within a diorama, so it's not just, you know, a monkey paw or an animal in a vacuum, you know, in a glass box vacuum, but actually included the flora and the trees and the plants.",
        "And it showed that an animal is, you know, intertwined with his environment.",
        "And you know, in going back earlier, I think the first natural history museum of the United States was run by Charles Willson Peale here in Philadelphia, and he had done some advances as well.",
        "The thing is though - I mean, Akeley's method was the one that - it was just so far beyond what anyone else had done...",

        "And that's a great point.",
