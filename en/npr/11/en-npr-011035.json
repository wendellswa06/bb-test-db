        "And I was surprised to learn that you don't need a lot of really synthetic, new age chemicals to do this, right?",
        "Oh, no. No, no. So, you know, just like pickling spices for foods and other materials of what is used in the skins.",
        "You mean, the same stuff that turns a cucumber into a pickle will preserve a skin?",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "But then, once the natural oils are taken out of the skin during the pickling process, they have to be reapplied with synthetic oils and then manipulated to get back the softness of them so that they can be taxied or arranged over the mannequin.",
        "So taxidermy is the arrangement or movement of the skin over an artificial form.",
        "You know, I was wondering - and this is a question for Jay too.",

        "You know, there's mounted birds from 400 years old that are still in existence.",
