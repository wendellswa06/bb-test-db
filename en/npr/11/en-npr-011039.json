        "So it has to be done carefully, but it can be done.",
        "It's an idea.",

        "To make Superman more relatable, he needs to be powered down to the levels he started with in 1938, where, indeed, he was only leaping tall buildings with a single bound, not circling the planet fast enough to make it go back in time.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "In the '70s, they tried it.",
        "They took - he was depowered by, I think, about a third, because before - up to that time, he could twist the planet out of its orbit.",
        "He could go back and forth in time just flying really fast.",
        "So they realized that that was just -he had really silly powers at that time, too.",
        "He had super-ventriloquism, super...",
        "Super - I missed super-ventriloquism.",
        "Yeah, the super-ventriloquism.",
        "Help.",
        "Let me out of the box.",
        "Well, see, what happens is, he got so powerful that they couldn't make stories about what he can do.",
        "So they had to make stories about him trying to keep his secret identity.",
        "So the entire book kind of shifted over to Lois and Jimmy, because they had to make stories about them, because they were the only humans around.",
        "What was interesting, Jack Kirby, one generally recognized as a genius, he did some bad books, too."

        "You can't go in and take out a person's tumor, which brings about this human pity.",
        "It just - it seems like it's almost too much.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well then, you should really read the series that just started now, starting with \"\"Superman 700\"\" because that's exactly what this - I think that's the organizing principle here is to kind of take out the brainiacs and super suits and just kind of tell human stories.",
        "It does seem to me like it's going to be kind of repetitive, as he kind of goes from town to town, fixing people's problems instead of running -kind of like \"\"The Fugitive,\"\" except instead of running away from a one-armed man, he's running from himself.",

        "But in '86, John Byrne decided the real thing is Clark.",
        "Clark's the real guy, Superman is the disguise.",
