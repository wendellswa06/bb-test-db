        "I just talked to a teacher in Kentucky who said that what's happened in West Virginia has lit a fire under teachers there in Kentucky.",

        "There are rumblings that a teacher strike in Oklahoma might be coming soon.",
        "There, you have two tracks in a sense, where you have the leadership of the Oklahoma Education Association, whose president told me they are announcing a timetable of escalations.",
        "And if they don't get what they want, that timetable ends with shutting down all the schools this school year.",
        "Meanwhile, you have teachers, dozens of whom met recently to make plans about how to build towards a strike in a dozen or more schools that they represent.",
        "Those teachers say even if they hear the timetable that the union has come up with, it might not be fast or aggressive enough for them, and they might try to pull off a wildcat strike first.",
        "A wildcat strike - explain what that is.",
        "A wildcat strike is when workers go out on strike without formal support from a union that they're part of or the legal authorization to do it.",
        "What we saw in West Virginia was something that began as a somewhat more traditional strike, and then it morphed into a wildcat strike, something that is extremely rare to see on this scale.",
        "Aside from whatever momentum may have been generated by what happened in West Virginia, is there any other factor that might push teachers to conclude this is a really good moment to strike, to push for more pay?",
        "The broader labor market plays a role.",
        "The fact that we're in a tighter labor market with lower unemployment has multiple effects for public employees.",
        "On the one hand, it means potentially better offers elsewhere, including in the private sector.",
        "Oh, that they could walk and expect to have a decent job waiting for them if they leave their teacher post.",
        "Yes.",
        "And it also means that there is a better revenue situation for the states.",
        "And so as one economist said to me, it's harder to argue that this is like getting blood from a stone when you know that the state is in a comparatively better revenue situation."

        "Well, Trump is on a steady path to win South Carolina at the moment, but I think the biggest thing South Carolina might do is turn into the state where the establishment candidate, whoever's going to claim that lane, begin to really duke it out.",
