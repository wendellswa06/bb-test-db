        "Can you give us a sense of what that study said about the black community?",
        "And we're certainly - and we'll say this a million times on our series - we're just looking to ask the questions about how people interact and we know that data can be flawed.",
        "But what did that study find?",
        "Okay.",
        "This study found that 39 percent of adult men in this neighborhood said they'd have overlapping sexual relationships in the last year.",
        "And 27 percent of the men - so nearly 30 percent - said they'd had what the researchers called long-term polygamy, which is not - nothing to do with marriage, but sexual relationships that overlap for at least six months, which is quite a striking figure.",
        "And then they talked to women in the community, and only eight percent said that they had concurrent sexual partners in the last year.",
        "But 20 percent of the women said they knew or they believed that their partners had been with other women in the last year.",
        "So there seems to be not just quite a lot of long-term concurrent sexual relationships going on, but to certain extent an acceptance of it among women in this community, much more so than I found in other communities in America or in America overall.",
        "The taboo - my impression from this data - is weaker on having overlapping sexual relationships.",
        "Well, Dr. Ronn - let me bring Dr. Ronn into this.",
        "Because, Dr. Ronn, there are a lot of feelings that people have from their gut about the availability of women in the black dating pool versus the availability of men.",
        "Do you think it's a situation of play on player versus stay home and be a nice girl, or is it a situation of supply and demand, or what's causing this?",
        "I believe all of those elements play a part in this.",
        "I also think it may be something notable to the fact that in the African-American community we are marrying much later than in previous generations.",
        "That means there's a whole lot more dating experience long before there is marital experience or long-term commitment experience.",
        "That means I'm well practiced at having more than one partner before I make the commitment to have only one.",
        "Can I interject something?",
        "Please.",
        "I think that certainly dating has something to do with it.",
        "But these relationships seem not to be - according to the researchers - pre-marital relationships, but sort of permanent situations or semi-permanent situations of long-term - dating is more of a - where you have a short-term overlap in the number of partners, but here you had a long-term overlap.",
        "And what the researchers concluded is that people in those situations are the least likely to end up married at the end of those relationships.",
        "Well, you know, there is a question that your book raises, Pamela, about what is fidelity.",
        "I'm thinking here of America's first black president, and I'm only talking in metaphorical terms, but I did not have sex with that woman was a phrase that marks the Clinton presidency.",
        "And the question was, is oral sex sex?",
        "And is oral sex infidelity?",
        "And that was, you know, as much as we have talked about it as a nation, that's a question that I think comes down to how people perceive their relationships.",

        "immigration authorities.",
        "But eventually, over half of the parents at Desert Trails Elementary did sign a petition demanding changes - which is all that it took for the parent trigger law to kick in.",
        "The Adelanto school board tried to invalidate the petition after some parents changed their minds, saying they had been duped into signing it.",
        "This summer, though, a county court judge allowed the petition to go forward, forcing the school board to respond to the parent trigger's initial demands: one, that a new principal take over and be allowed to hire and fire teachers; two, that the school be given control of its budget and curriculum.",
        "The school board said it couldn't do this without concessions from the teachers' union.",
        "The union's position was that the parents' demands were unreasonable.",
        "I saw the list of demands.",
        "And there were many things on the list that were out of not only the union's control, but the district's control."
