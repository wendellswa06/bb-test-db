        "This week, the defeat of Cynthia McKinney and Joe Lieberman in primary elections sparked some good conversation on yesterday's Roundtable.",
        "For a closer look at those results, we now turn to NPR's senior correspondent Juan Williams and his Beltway Insiders for our weekly segment, Political Corner.",
        "Juan?",
        "Thanks, Ed.",
        "We're joined now by Donna Brazile, former campaign manager for Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign.",
        "We're also joined by Robert Traynham.",
        "He's a political strategist with the GOP in Washington.",
        "Welcome, Robert and Donna.",
        "Thanks for joining us on Political Corner.",
        "Thank you, Juan.",
        "Thank you, Juan.",
        "Let's begin with Cynthia McKinney's defeat at the hands of Hank Johnson in Atlanta - or just outside Atlanta I should say.",
        "This is a race that I think surprised Cynthia McKinney.",
        "She really didn't think she was going to even have to get involved with a runoff, but was unable to avoid it - and then loses 59 to 41.",
        "Donna Brazile, what do you make of this?",
        "Well, this was Representative McKinney's second loss in six years.",
        "Look, the fact is is that became a national race because Cynthia McKinney has become a national figure - a controversial national figure.",
        "And as a result of it, Hank Johnson was able to tap into the national base of people who do not support Cynthia McKinney.",
        "Likewise, Representative McKinney was able to raise money across the country as well.",
        "This was a national Congressional race."

        "Robert, when you look at this race, do you think, in fact, that there's any legitimacy to the idea that Republicans wanted Hank Johnson to win?",
        "I don't know if Republicans deliberately tried to influence the race.",
        "But what I do know is that Representative McKinney's constituents have consistently said over and over and over again that they were tire of the controversy surrounding this very person.",
        "I was pretty general in my definition of what infidelity is in my book.",
        "I just - I let people define it for themselves.",
        "And I think in polls they tend to say general things like sexual relationship and let people decide what they would count as infidelity.",
        "And I think it's clear that if you're in a long-term secondary relationship with someone, you know, all kinds of things are going to happen and certainly it meets the definition.",
        "I think it's more of a gray area when you're talking about, you know, a kind of sort of a one-night stand with a co-worker in that kind of situation.",
        "But it tends to be pretty black and white, especially if people define it for themselves.",

        "So Dr. Ronn, you've written the book.",
        "When people say I do forever, what makes that last and people be faithful as opposed to folks who are not?",
        "Oh, it's a ton of things, and I'm sure a lot of them fit under what we see on the front of magazines all the time, the seven things you do to have a faithful marriage, the five things you do to make sure that the passion stays forever.",
        "I think, ultimately, it comes down to people - certainly over time - making a commitment to do without some of the pleasures and excitement that comes with having multiple partners.",
        "It is kind of a lose-something-to-get something.",
        "It is a surrendering of the unlimited opportunities and a focus on monogamous relationship with one person recognizing that I'm going to lose the splendors of a bunch of folk to gain the richness of one somebody.",
        "Now, Pamela, I just want to broaden this out a little bit, because your book did cover people in other nations.",
        "Do people in other nations think differently about the pledge that you make when go into a marriage and how having sex or intimacy with someone else figures into that?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think there are big differences.",
        "I mean, people all -monogamy tends to be the dominant system all over the world.",
        "Wherever you go, especially in a situation where you have love marriages, you have pledges of fidelity and people enter marriages expecting very much aspiring to be faithful.",
        "Where the differences lie is basically in what happens when someone slips and isn't faithful anymore, and in that sense there's big differences between America and the rest of the world.",
        "I think one reason why Americans generally are so faithful is because they fear punishment if they're unfaithful.",
        "We have this kind of one-strike rule in America where, generally speaking, if you cheat, the marriage is over, at least in theory, or you're going to have big conflicts.",
        "So I think in places where the marriage really isn't threatened, where you know your wife is going to stay with you or your husband is going to stay with you, you're not going to lose your kids or lose your house.",
        "I think more than aspiring to just be faithful, I think people react to a fear of punishment.",
        "And in America, generally speaking, punishment's pretty severe.",
        "Pamela, and Dr. Ronn, I want to get you on this, too.",
        "So you have also the media perceptions - pop culture I'm talking about - of what relationships are like.",
        "And what came to mind for me is the \"\"Sopranos,\"\" where you have Carmela and you've got the boss.",
        "And he goes to the strip clubs and he engages in extra-marital affairs, sometimes with fairly large consequences, but they stay together for economic and love and family reasons.",
        "Is that something that's very common?",
        "And I'm going to start with you, briefly, Pamela, and then Dr. Ronn."

        "Sure.",
        "I mean, I think in the case of Carmela she's caught between two sexual cultures.",
        "One is the sort of Italian underworld culture, where infidelity seems to be quite accepted among Tony Soprano, her husband, and his friends.",
        "And the other is a broader American culture that she's a part of where, you know, they do follow this one-strike rule, you know, you shouldn't tolerate cheating.",
        "You're a doormat if you let your husband get away with it.",
        "So you see her even in the show go back and forth; she leaves him, she goes back to him.",

        "(unintelligible) with the couples that I work with - I would say right now in my private practice, the number one issue is recovering from infidelity.",
        "Among African-Americans, my experience seems to be that there is kind of this unspoken assumption that a man - particularly a man - a man is probably going to be unfaithful, but the real prize in a marriage is they have a marriage where you can brag that he worked against type.",
        "And so when we have couples who come in because of infidelity, there's this huge hurt.",
        "And it's not so much about how will we survive individually on the other side of this faithfulness, it's about the loss of status and the stigma that's attached to -I was not able to keep my partner in place.",
        "Keep my man.",
        "Let me follow up on that.",
        "There are couples who have rules - well, you can cheat but only when you're out of town, you can cheat if you do this but not this.",
        "Is that a devil's bargain?",
        "What's your opinion of how, for example, you would treat someone who came in and said, well, we have a rule that - blank?",
        "Oh, then I would say to them, you probably don't need a therapist to help you with fidelity.",
        "You need a director or producer to help you with this stage play that you've got in production, which is when we pretend that we have faithfulness.",
        "It's now a matter of how you adjust to smoke and mirrors as opposed to how you adjust to commitment.",
        "And Pamela, do people - there's a stereotype that the French, for example, are much more tolerant of having a mistress and a wife.",
        "First of all, did you find that stereotype to have any basis in fact?",
        "And secondly, what, if so, allows people to go back and forth?",
        "Well, I found actually that while French presidents are extremely promiscuous, actual French people are not.",
        "In fact, if you looked at the national statistics, French people are slightly more faithful than Americans are.",
        "That's very interesting.",
        "You're referring to a Mitterrand, who had his wife, his mistress, and his daughter from the mistress…",

        "But even that, you know, wasn't exactly what it seemed.",
        "Because French people were quite scandalized by the fact that he had a whole second family, too, and he was very discreet in the way he introduced them to the public at the end of his life when he was actually on his death bed.",
        "And the difference, though, with the French is that they would never - they tend not to do this kind of open relationship at all where, you know, your spouse comes homes and says, I was at a conference, I just want to confess to you in the name of honesty that I had an affair when I was traveling.",
        "They're extremely discreet when they do have affairs.",
        "And they're comfortable with the idea that there are things about their partner they might never ever know and that that is a healthy marriage.",
        "Whereas, I think, in America it's much more about breaking down walls in a marriage and having full disclosure about everything that happens.",
        "I absolutely agree that, I think, our definition of intimacy is one where you tell everything.",
        "So I literally have couples who come in and want to go through long-term therapy because one of the partners admitted that they fantasized about a coworker or that they took a phone number but never used it.",
        "It is this idea that we must nakedly tell everything, and sometimes, I fear, to the detriment of fidelity and commitment.",
        "Well, since we're talking about politicians, I'm thinking in reference to what you're saying, Jimmy Carter's I have lust in my heart, which was something that other people thought was over-sharing.",

        "This is will sound strange and it does, couples on my counseling couch look back at me with wide eyes and in disbelief.",
        "But I think one of the biggest protectors of fidelity in a long-term relationship, and particularly in a marriage, is to make sure that both of the partners have really strong, very intimate same-sex friendships.",
        "A lot of times we make demands of each other in marriage relationship or in long-term relationship, and we pressure each other to provide for us what you really ought to be getting in friendship with somebody else.",
        "And so one of the worst things to predict marital stability is I ask all the time couples in pre-marital, how close are your same-sex friends?",

        "We require that when we're in each other's presence that every conversation has to be deeply romantic and full of self-disclosure and have huge, eternal, spiritual and emotional weight to them.",
        "And a lot of times we need to be just talking about the Lakers and the Dodgers and wasting time, and our hearts are exposed to somebody over the course of a bunch of shallow, superficial interactions.",
        "Pamela, you get the last word very briefly.",
        "Any ideas, you studied infidelity, what makes fidelity work?",
        "You know, it's interesting that you mentioned talking to friends, because what I found looking internationally is that often peer pressure makes people cheat.",
        "And when people consult their friends about what they should do, if their friends are cheating, they're much more likely to cheat themselves.",
        "I found this even in very religious countries - in places like Indonesia where, you know, it's a predominantly Muslim country - that peer pressure seemed to be the most important factor, in fact, in creating a sexual culture where cheating is considered permissible.",
        "Because nobody wants to feel that what they're doing is wrong, I mean, the - there are some, sort of, psychopaths that do whatever they want.",
        "But in general people cheat because there's a socially acceptable excuse available to them for cheating, and often these excuses are conveyed by their peers.",
        "We are in a moment where we've seen high-profile activism from fast food workers to the Women's March to athletes taking the knee.",
        "Of course the teachers who are involved here don't all come from the same political persuasion or background.",
        "But yes, for some people, what is going on now is part of a tapestry of activism."
