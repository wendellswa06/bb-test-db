        "Well, the ethics manual for the Senate says that the select committee on ethics should receive complaints and investigative allegations of improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate - violations of law, violations for the Senate code of official conduct, and violation of rules and regulations of the Senate relating to the conduct of individuals and the performance of their duties as members of the Senate."

        "This cannot be welcome news for Republican leadership in the Senate.",
        "They really nudged him to at least announce his intention to resign in the first place, right?",
        "That's right.",

        "They want the Larry Craig story out of the news.",

        "And, of course, Senator Craig has pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of disorderly conduct in that airport bathroom.",
        "I would say this, that there is a - the Senate can expel a member if it so chooses with the two-thirds of vote, but I think it would be a long time before that happened.",
        "It would be highly unusual to see someone expelled over a misdemeanor that does not involve any sort of corruption or abuse of office.",
        "Though, I guess one could argue that if he did, in fact, as has been reported, show his business card to the police officer that might be grounds for a making an argument that he abused his power as a senator or perhaps that he improperly used his office in this case.",
        "So what tools are at the disposal of Senate Republican leadership to encourage Senator Craig to continue on with his resignation?",
        "Well, mostly it's the pressure that they've already applied to him, you know, in the form of removing him from his spot on the Appropriations Committee, which means he's not as capable of delivering for Idaho and not as capable of representing Idaho as he once was, in the form of not supporting him for reelection should he choose to not only continue in the Senate but to try to seek reelection.",
        "There all sorts of small goodies and I guess sort of carrots and sticks that the Republican leadership has at its disposal, but it's mostly in the form of trying to pressure him with good reason.",
        "Generally speaking, it is difficult for party leaders to remove someone from office who is elected to that office by the voters of their state, or in the case of the House, their district.",
        "Is it conceivable that the Republicans could support another Republican to run against Craig in the primary?"
