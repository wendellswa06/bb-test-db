        "In opening statements, the attorney for the petty officer currently on trial describes what went on as good-natured horseplay, and says the victim dished it out just as much as he received it.",
        "Eugene Fidell is a military law expert in Washington, D.C.",
        "He says hazing has a long history in the military.",
        "It was - used to be something called blood pinning, where you would take a insignia of one kind or another and hammer it into a person's chest, thereby drawing blood.",
        "Hazing is also occasionally done in connection with Naval traditional ceremonies involving crossing the equator, probably the Arctic Circle.",
        "So there's a lot of this in the lore of the branches of the military.",
        "But the military draws a distinction between hazing and harmless rights of passage.",
        "And these days, says Fidell, the military is cracking down.",
        "Last summer, the Secretary of the Navy issued an updated anti-hazing policy.",
        "It says all hazing is contrary to Navy core values and will not be tolerated.",
        "The second criminal case at Bremerton goes far beyond hazing.",

        "They're accused of pointing a loaded gun at their alleged victim and threatening to blow his head off.",
        "The hazing and assault cases are not exactly top of mind in this sleepy Navy town, an hour's ferry ride from Seattle.",
        "But at the Westside Burrito Connection, a popular Navy hangout, cashier Veronica Lopez(ph) calls the allegations sad.",
        "These are supposed to be role models for us, you know, and we're not - the Navy's supposed to represent Bremerton, a Navy town.",

        "So we're hearing that it actually costs money to shut the government down, which seems counter-intuitive on some level.",
        "So first, is that true?",
        "And if it is, why does it cost money?",
        "Well, it is true.",
        "Of course, there's a lot of time spent getting ready for a shutdown - just like if you have a vacation house and you shut it down for the winter, you have to turn off the water to the pipes.",
        "The federal government is a huge machine, and if you want to stop it in mid-action, it - you have to spend time turning the dials and figuring out who works and making sure that the right people are working and the right ones aren't.",
        "And I found a Government Accountability Office report from 1990, which if you adjusted for inflation, says that if the shutdown is three weekdays, it costs $80 million in administrative costs and $320 million in lost revenue to the government.",
        "So those are actual hard costs.",

        "Before I get started, I should note, in the interview that we just did with Dr. Satcher, he mentioned Judge Mathis, and I realize now, that maybe everyone isn't familiar with daytime television.",
        "That, of course, is Judge Greg Mathis, who has a successful television courtroom program on air, and we should note the Detroit native, by his own admission, was a little street thug, as he came up in life - turned his life around, became a judge, and now a television star - and, as Dr. Satcher said, had been misdiagnosed often, and luckily found a judge, who gave him a second chance, and he was able to turn his life around.",
        "And that, as Dr. Satcher says, is happening far too often, particularly with African-American males.",
        "Now, with that clarification, we'll go on to what we're going to talk about in the roundtable.",
        "First up, folks, and that is that we saw House Democrats vote 99 to 58, yesterday, to strip Republican - or I'm sorry - Representative, I should say - I'm sure he'll appreciate that - Representative William Jefferson of his committee assignment; that with the powerful ways and means committee.",
        "This all around swirling accusation in the federal bribery investigation as it runs its course, and this in the face of the fact that William Jefferson, Joe Davidson, continues to assert his innocence.",
        "And we should note, the Congressional Black Caucus, has been very boisterous in their defense of, not necessarily Jefferson, but the actions of the Democratic Party, suggesting that this is an unprecedented move and that they should give him the benefit of the doubt until the investigation runs its course."

        "Well, that's right.",
        "In fact, Congressional Black Caucus chairman Mel Watt, has said that there's neither precedent nor rule for this and that - and Congressman Watt worried out loud, that black constituents around the country will say that there is a different standard in the Democratic Caucus, based on race.",
        "Interestingly enough, though, he went on to say that none of us are saying that.",
        "I'm not saying that.",
        "So in some ways, he's kind of sending an on the one hand, on the other hand, kind of message here.",
        "But I think it does raise some legitimate questions of how - is everyone being treated fairly?",
        "Is everyone being held to the same standard?",
        "If there is no rule nor precedent, as Watt says, for this to happen, why is it happening now?",
        "Why was Congressman Jefferson's office the first office to be searched by the FBI, something that Republicans and Democrats have argued vigorously against.",
        "And so I think Mel Watt is right.",
        "I think there will be black communities, black people around the country, who will question whether or not this is the imposition of a double standard.",
        "Jeff, here's what's interesting.",
        "We saw House Democratic Leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi really lead this fight from that position.",
        "As she has said, and many people are saying, that the Democrats are using this as political fodder against Republicans.",
        "She has said that this action isn't about proof in court.",
        "This is about an ethical standard, and that they wish that the White House - they being Democrats - would follow their lead in this.",
        "Interesting, coming from a Democrat.",
        "Interesting coming from anybody out of Washington to talk about ethical behavior in the times that we live in.",
        "I don't think that there has ever been a time in history where we associated ethical behavior with most of Washington, and that's on both sides of the party and all the branches, especially in the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch.",
        "This issue kind of disturbs me, because, one, we're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.",
        "It's not the job of Congress to conduct personal monkey trials on personal ethics.",
        "That's the job of law enforcement and the courts.",
        "They find the criminals, build a case, prosecute, and then they punish according to the law.",
        "And if Congress wants to be effective, they should worry about the law.",
        "Jefferson, basically, politically, has been carried up the mountain and laid on the altar of perceived political gain and the knife is in the air.",
        "And I don't think there's a ram in the bush in this situation, and even if they were, the udder bloodlust for political gain on both sides, with Democrats and Republicans, is so strong that anybody will be sacrificed for the greater good of political control.",
        "All right.",
        "Tara, take your Republican hat off for a moment, and just be a political strategist, if you will.",
        "There are stories that some Democrats had gone to Jefferson, to say, step aside voluntarily.",
        "If you're cleared, it will much easier to step back up.",
        "Should he have done that?",
        "I think so.",
        "Similar to what Congressman Mollohan in West Virginia did by - that's the congressman who was accused of profiting from business deals in West Virginia because of his congressional position.",
        "He stepped aside from the ethics committee because he recognized that this may not be in the Democratic Caucus' best interest to have someone, who's under questionable - but nothing illegal, just questionable - ethical practice.",
        "Maybe I should step aside so they can't use this as a political weapon against me.",
        "In this case, with Congressman Jefferson, it's a little more egregious.",
        "It's a fed bribery case.",
        "And I think what happens is outside of Washington, the average person does not recognize whether they're being treated fairly.",
        "Is it because of race?",
        "It's very easy to throw race in this as a diversionary tactic, to take away from the federal bribery case.",
        "We discussed last week whether Representative Jefferson had a national profile - and no, he didn't before this.",
        "But the average voter can identify with an elected official taking money as a bribe - allegedly - as opposed to whether he's being treated fairly because of his race, whether this has been precedented or not.",
        "I think that's a diversionary tactic by the Black Caucus because they know that by substituting the issue, it softens the blow, slightly.",
