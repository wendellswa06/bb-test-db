        "The problem with her when she appears primarily in procedural crime novels is that there's something she offers that's essential to actually solving the mystery, so the hero can never give her the hair letting down session the writer apparently believes she deserves so richly.",
        "There are a fair number of males who also perform this function, and you think of Ecklie, the boss on \"\"CSI.\"\" I mean, he's the ice queen, but he's not a queen.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I think, you know, the ice queen is probably a distant cousin to the shouting at the top of his lungs, you know, supervisor or superior officer who's supposed to, you know, provide the 11th hour obstacle to the hero's brilliant plan.",
        "So there are all sorts of variations of this character.",
        "I think where this one becomes particularly troublesome in the area of gender is when she's simply there for the male characters to poke fun at her the way they would poke fun at their sixth grade math teacher.",
        "We're talking with Christopher Rice.",
        "His most recent book is \"\"The Moonlit Earth.\"\" And we're talking about the female tropes in a lot of modern crime stories.",

        "The token lesbian cop.",
        "Well, this was the hard one for me to approach in this essay because I am an openly gay writer, I guess, as opposed to a half-open gay writer.",

        "But the problem with the token lesbian cop is that she's written almost entirely from a male perspective.",
        "And, you know, as soon as she is introduced or as soon as she has her sort of coming out moment, which is usually designed to let the hero look as cool and P.C.",
        "as the writer would like him to appear, she basically becomes a man with lady parts.",
        "And she raises no objection when the men around her, you know, basically, you know, make crude comments about women.",
        "And to that I'd say I have never met a lesbian who doesn't have at least some strong opinions about the objectification of women, and I defy those writers to go out and find one in reality.",

        "Could you briefly, Cliff, describe Anita Blake for us?",
        "Well, she's actually a combination of the babe assassin and the last example, the lesbian cop, because she's - she, in a lot of ways, has become the male with female parts at - it's highly sexualized because it's a vampire novel in that - sort of that genre.",
