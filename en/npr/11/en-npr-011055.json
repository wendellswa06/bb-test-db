        "I feel like Ross Macdonald, who is probably the lesser known of those three, being Chandler, Hammett and Macdonald, has probably been the most influential on some of the successful contemporary mystery writers that we have - Jonathan Kellerman; Sue Grafton, even uses Santa Teresa as a sort of alternate name for Santa Barbara in that area in her books, which is what Macdonald did in his Archer novels.",
        "And he was a softer, gentler take on all of this.",
        "You know, Macdonald introduced psychological layering into his books, which sort of separated them from just the usual sort of tough guy universe that was prevailing in Hammett's work.",

        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",

        "She seems to understand where he's coming from.",

        "My favorite TV show of all time is a crime show from the '90s called \"\"Millennium.\"\" And it's specifically awesome to me because it breaks so many of the stereotypes, you know?",
        "But at the same time, you know, even though it's such an amazing show, and the critics love it, it got cancelled after three seasons.",

        "That's very true.",
        "I think risk just for the sake of risk is never a recipe for success.",
        "I think what we're talking about - what the callers all seem to have in common are characters that have a richness to them and that are depicted as being in genuine relationships with other characters rather than foils for other characters.",
        "I mean, we talked about the femme fatale as just this device to present temptation to the stoic detective.",
        "But you know, we're talking about - and it's not always a romantic relationship as well.",
        "It's about characters actually learning and growing with one another.",

        "And I think right now we're looking - you know, one of the things I wanted to do with the \"\"The Moonlit Earth\"\" is it was going to have a smart female heroine but she wasn't going to be a forensic psychologist or a psychiatrist or a medical professional.",
        "You know, so it's like letting those types of characters branch out into other fields and other areas of living, for lack of a better phrase.",
