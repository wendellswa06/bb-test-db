        "Steuerle worked at the Treasury Department during the last big tax reform in the 1980s, when policymakers lowered tax rates dramatically and did away with numerous tax breaks.",
        "Since then, little by little, tax breaks have crept back in.",
        "And today, both President Obama and Mitt Romney say it's time for another housecleaning.",
        "Despite their superficial agreement, though, Tax Notes columnist Bruce Bartlett says the two men approach tax reform with very different goals.",
        "For Republicans, it really only means one thing and that is lowering statutory rates.",
        "When Democrats talk about tax reform, I think they're mainly concerned about the distribution of taxation and to get the wealthy to pay a larger share.",
        "So, clearly there's an enormous gulf between their two perspectives.",
        "Romney's tax plan is mostly about lowering rates, though he would also eliminate loopholes so the amount of money the government collects stays the same.",
        "Mr. Obama's plan, on the other hand, is designed to raise more money to bring down the deficit, with lower tax rates thrown in as a sweetener.",
        "But here's the thing about the so-called loopholes in the tax code.",
        "They're not just for fat cats with secret bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.",
        "Berkeley economist Laura Tyson, who sits on a couple of White House advisory panels, notes the two biggest tax breaks are for interest payments on home mortgages and the tax-free health insurance that many workers get from their employers.",
        "If you end up with a tax reform which significantly cuts something like the mortgage interest deduction, you're going to hit a lot of middle class families.",
        "That's why both candidates run for cover when asked about the tax breaks they want to eliminate.",
        "Here's Romney, being grilled by Scott Pelley on \"\"60 Minutes.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF \"\"60 MINUTES\"\")",
        "Mr. Obama was similarly evasive when NPR's Steve Inskeep tried to pin him down back in 2010.",

        "Mr.",
        "Obama said at the time he wanted to start a public conversation about tax reform.",
        "But that conversation has not gone very far.",
        "Steuerle, of the Urban Institute, says politicians know better than to call for higher taxes on the middle class.",
        "To be fair to them, that's partly because we, the public as voters, really penalize the candidates when they start identifying who's going to pay for government.",
        "Tyson says President Obama tried to thread this needle by leaving tax breaks in place for middle class families, while limiting deductions available to the very wealthy.",
        "That proposal really went no place politically, either among Democrats or among Republicans.",
        "The president has proposed that again and again.",
        "Given the difficulty of fixing the individual tax system, Tyson says policymakers might start with a more modest effort to re-write the corporate tax code.",
        "But Steuerle has his sights set higher.",
        "He says whichever candidate is in the Oval Office next year, he'll have to tackle the deficit or have little money left to spend on any of his other priorities.",
        "Steuerle thinks that could provide the impetus to do the hard work of a broad tax overhaul.",
        "Sometimes you finally get the person to go to the dentist, when the pain from not going to the dentist is greater than the pain from going.",
        "So far, though, it's been getting the candidates to talk specifics that's been like pulling teeth.",

        "It's a relatively safe Democratic district, but you will muster up outrage by people when you seem so defiant.",
        "And I think it's a misstep by Congressman Jefferson, and I think that the Congressional Black Caucus is wasting political capital in this area, given the egregious nature of the offense.",
        "But you know…",
        "Here's the interesting point, Joe Davidson, though, the idea of it being an assignment with ways and means.",
        "We're talking big money there.",
        "Well, that's true, but I think it's also worth pointing out that another committee assignment that deals with big money is appropriations, and Congressman Mollohan is on the appropriations committee and has not stepped aside from that.",
        "And it's also true that Congressman Jefferson did offer to step aside before the vote last night, but on conditions, and conditions that Nancy Pelosi would not accept.",
        "And one of those conditions was that there would be a rule kind of defining when people in his position should step aside.",
        "And another condition was that a colleague of his from Louisiana be appointed to that seat, at least temporarily on the ways and means committee.",
        "So I mean, there's kind of multiple layers here, and it's also true - and I think it must be said - that when you have $90,000 in your freezer, you know, it goes beyond looking bad.",
        "So it's a situation where I don't think Congressman Jefferson can come out of this looking good almost no matter what happens.",
        "Yes.",
        "Even those who want to defend Congressman Jefferson - and we should say again; all of this, at this point, is alleged - find it hard to really step up based on the things that we've heard and seen so far.",
        "But again, the investigation has not been completed."

        "This, again, is a concern of the makeup of the court for some who suggest that this makeup of the court may, indeed, start to chip away at constitutional rights for citizens here.",
        "There Supreme Court ruled this week that police can use evidence collected with a warrant, even if officers fail to knock before rushing in.",
        "This was a Detroit case where Detroit police called out their presence at a man's door, and then went inside within three to five seconds, therefore, the suggestion not giving enough time and warning that they, in fact, were coming in.",
        "This is looked upon as a test case in looking at previous rulings that police armed with warrants generally knock, announce themselves, and then go in, for fear of running afoul of the constitutional amendment - the fourth amendment there, unreasonable search and seizure, Jeff Obafemi Carr?",
        "Well, I mean, and when we talk about the Booker Hudson case and we talk about what happened there and what's on the forefront, we're talking about issues that are important to American people, by and large.",
        "Particularly, there are reasons why you have the Fourth Amendment; there are reasons why you have knock and announce; there are reasons why you have lawful entry: To give citizens rights.",
        "And that's what's in question here.",
        "With the war on terror that's being waged, supposedly now, the Department of Homeland Security, border immigration issues, all of these things are coming together right now at the crossroads of America's radar screen.",

        "But that's what I think we're moving toward, and I think it's scary that you won't have many rights.",
        "Well, I think that it's important to note, also, that the exclusionary rule, which is what is kind of at question here, is not something that is just - that has not just come about in recent days.",
        "I mean, there's, you know, Antonin Scalia wrote, in his opinion, that the common law principle that law enforcement officers must announce their presence and provide residents an opportunity to open the door is an ancient one."

        "And it was in 1914 that the Supreme Court first announced the exclusionary rule, which says that if some evidence is found by illegal means, then that evidence can be excluded - in other words, not held against the defendant.",
        "And so I think that what you alluded to earlier, Ed, about the changing of the court with the recent appointments by President Bush, is clearly is what is indicated here.",
        "So you have a situation where a long-standing rule has now been - not totally thrown out, but clearly has been weakened, if you will.",
        "It's certainly not as strong as it was the day before yesterday.",
        "And that is a result of the Bush appointees to the court.",

        "This case, to be fair, to kind of calm the alarmists on the left about - that this is going to become a police state and this is - our Fourth Amendment rights are being eroded; this case is about, specifically, the exclusionary rule.",
        "All of the lower courts already acknowledge that the knock and announce aspect of the Fourth Amendment was, in fact, violated.",
        "But the question at hand was whether the full suppression of all of the evidence that the warrant detailed, and that whether the warrant was executed properly, is that full suppression of all of that evidence applicable in this case.",
        "And the justices felt as though, and the majority ruling said, no; because the exclusionary rule should be applied as a last resort, not as a primary reason to suppress evidence or exclude evidence because of the potential social costs and the floodgates that could be opened up in the criminal justice system if the exclusionary rule is applied too liberally.",
        "No pun intended."
