        "As far as the other cases, I mean, the - in March, they ruled about whether police can enter if one person lives there, says yes you may enter, and the other person says no. They ruled in favor of the residents.",
        "They said, no, the police cannot enter.",
        "There was another case in May, out in - a Utah case, where police observed teenagers engaged in brawls with adults inside of a home where a party was taking place.",
        "He observed it through a window.",

        "And you really do find the idea of whether this is political movement to the right or change in a changing world.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "And there - you definitely have to make enough allowances for the change in the world, to be reasonable.",
        "You have to.",
        "I've had several friends who are on a police force, and they say that things aren't always done by the book because the world we live in is not a by-the-book world.",

        "Well, we've got the warrant so we can just barge in.",
        "And I'm afraid that if we start giving away too many of our freedoms and not protecting them now, we'll reach a day where, if the judge executes a warrant, they can just come in and kick in your door, and just not worry about it.",
        "I think we open the door for that when we do that.",
        "You know - and if I could add one quick point.",
        "In '95, when the court unanimously said that the Fourth Amendment requires knock and announce, they also said - the justices also said that this is for the protection of the police, as well as for the privacy of the residents.",
        "Because if someone is just bursting into your home, and you don't know they're the police, you might take some action against that person.",
        "You know, in your mind it's self-defense, not realizing they are police offices.",
        "So - and so that's why the justices - that's one of the reasons the justices decided for their unanimous decision in '95.",

        "Right, and, as we know, just like when your momma knocks on the door, that knock and announce doesn't always work.",
        "She just knocks and simultaneously comes in, so, you know, it's one of those things that, until you're out there on the front line, it's hard to sometimes gather all that goes on.",
