        "And a lot of the debate about the alleged shooter is centered on whether or not Major Hasan was mentally ill.",
        "What do we know about his mental state?",
        "Let's start in the spring of 2007, and then we can work our way back because in that timeframe, a new boss of all the psychiatric residents at Walter Reed took over.",
        "His name is Scott Moran(ph).",
        "He told me he cannot talk, he referred me to public affairs, but I'm basing everything I'm about to say now on sources who worked closely with Nidal Hasan, worked with his supervisors, were privy to meetings where they discussed him and that sort of thing.",
        "Okay, so this Scott Moran comes in, the new boss of psychiatric residents.",
        "He starts, like any boss does, he looks through the personnel files, and he says we've got to get rid of this guy Nidal Hasan.",
        "He had one of the worst records of any psychiatric resident in years and years and years.",
        "He they say he was a bad doctor.",
        "He would proselytize to patients.",
        "He was caught saying to at least one patient: Islam will save your soul.",
        "When he would be the guy on call, you know, it's an emergency, you've got to call the doctor, the psychiatrist, get him to help, he wouldn't answer the phone.",
        "He would show up for work late.",
        "His third year of his residency, and this is when the psychiatrists start pretty much building their own patient schedule, according to the records, he was seeing about one patient per week.",
        "And I've asked other therapists about this, and they just, their jaws drop, and nobody could account for his time.",
        "In addition to that, there were these issues about his apparently extremist Islamic beliefs.",
        "And everybody I've talked to has said look, we never had any problem with somebody being Muslim.",
        "In fact, there was a very popular Muslim psychiatrist who was elected as chief of the residents by all the other psychiatrists there.",
        "But what bothered them about Nidal Hasan was that he would be in the hallway, they would be walking to a clinic, or they would be working silently in a room, and according to my sources, suddenly, out of the middle of nowhere, he would start haranguing them about what they interpreted as being his hostility toward hypocritical Christians.",
        "And one psychiatrist said now, you have to understand, it's not like you, Neal, and I and some of our colleagues are sitting around in our cubicles chatting about religion, and suddenly, you know, the big mouth starts saying let me tell you what I think.",
        "This would come out of the blue, where people were not talking about religion, and he would start haranguing them, and",
        "This raises two questions, one of which is this psychotic behavior and the other of which is how come he didn't get fired?",
        "So Scott Moran, according to my sources, says let's get rid of him, finds out there are huge, bureaucratic impediments.",
        "You have to build a very careful paper trail.",
        "You have to show all kinds of evidence that prove the person's a bad psychiatrist.",
        "Nidal Hasan then could have hired a lawyer.",
        "He could have contested it.",
        "It could have dragged on and on in hearings.",
        "And they decided look, he's about to go off on a fellowship in late 2007 at the military's medical school.",
        "Let's let him go there, and let's hope he does better.",
        "Somebody else's problem.",
        "Well, that's what it seems to be, and when he arrives at the military's medical school to get a master's in public health and do some research, they start worrying about him right away.",
        "And in the spring of 2008, they are so worried that there start to be a series of meetings and conversations among psychiatrists who supervise him saying is it possible that Nidal Hasan is psychotic?",
        "Now, the word psychotic is something we throw around (unintelligible), but it basically means somebody who is out of touch with reality, and he also had other attributes.",
        "People who worked with him frequently give me these adjectives: loner, isolated, detached, aloof.",
        "They sensed hostility, you know, under the surface.",
        "But he would also be sometimes super, super polite, so polite that it would really bug people because it just seemed phony.",
        "And I don't mean to psychoanalyze him from afar, but the point is people had been building up all these concerns about him.",
        "Do you think, if Hasan suppose he's deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.",
        "Do you think he could actually leak secrets, military secrets, to Islamic radicals?",
        "And another psychiatrist who supervised him mused aloud to colleagues: Do you think he could even be capable of committing fratricide?"

        "And yet nothing was done.",
        "I asked one of the sources who worked with him: Did anybody refer him to mental health counseling?",
        "Did anybody say, you know, we need a professional evaluation?",
        "And there was this silence, and the psychiatrist said, you know, I guess a lot of us sort of figured well, we worked with him every day, we're all psychiatrists.",
        "You know, so we were evaluating him.",
        "And I said wait a minute, but he said no, you're right, that's totally different than a professional evaluation.",
        "Not only did they not insist that he seek mental health evaluation, but every psychiatrist in this program can get umpteen hours of free psychotherapy, and apparently Nidal Hasan never took advantage of that program.",

        "Remember the Walter Reed scandal, the horrific treatment of traumatic brain injury and PTSD that has gone on for years.",
        "Army medicine has been dropping the ball on these issues for a long time.",

        "The political correctness Mark Benjamin is a terrific reporter.",
        "Political correctness is not quite what I heard but close to it.",
        "Some of his colleagues, some of Hasan's colleagues, appear to have bent over backwards to prove to themselves and to prove to their colleagues that they were not discriminating against him or being too harsh against him in any way because of his religious beliefs.",
        "And the way they would think of it is this: Okay, supposing he were Jewish, supposing he were talking about U.S.",
        "policy toward Israel and whatever, would we judge him this way?",
        "Would we be so hard on him academically?",
        "People really wanted to convince themselves that just because he said things about Islam that bothered them because they seemed extreme, they wanted to make sure they were not being too harsh on him for that reason.",
        "And I think I mean, I'm speculating here but it seems like they were bending over backwards to give him a second chance and a third chance and a fourth chance for that reason, not because of political correctness, but they wanted inside to feel like they were fair.",
        "Back in 2007, a big report came out from the American Psychological Association about the terrible problems troops were having, and still have, at many bases getting help when they desperately need it for post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression, traumatic brain injury and that kind of thing.",

        "We all know it.",
        "One final question, Danny, and that is there have been some to suggest that somebody who counsels people who have been traumatized by war, people with PTSD, can gather some of that condition themselves.",
        "I've talked to many psychiatrists inside the military and outside the military about this issue, and I can't find people who really find this to be a very credible issue here.",
        "Everybody agrees, look, we do get exhausted, we do burn out, some of us do get depressed, but we don't become unhinged that's a non-medical term, forgive me.",
        "And second of all, this is a sort of ironic thing, of all the psychiatrists in the military who might have been overburdened by people coming back and telling them about the horrors of war, Nidal Hasan was not one of them.",
        "In the last two years, until he went to Fort Hood this summer, his past two years, he saw almost no patients because he was in a research program.",
        "So he had almost no or zero clinical caseload since late in 2007 until just May of this year.",
        "So he saw way fewer cases of PTSD than the vast, vast majority of psychiatrists in the Army.",

        "The problem is that in that subset of disturbed people who will commit violence, we have a very small number of the Muslim population that tries to connect personal frustration or anger over their job or their inability to function well or personal problems whatever it is, they try to channel it into a cosmic cause.",
        "Ms.�NOMANI: I very much understand what you're saying, and it's very much also the critique of a lot of these Muslim organizations that say why bring Islam into the equation here.",
        "But the reason why I very humbly suggest that we have to understand and try to really incorporate our understanding about Islam in here is because it's clear that Major Hasan's ideology was a clear indicator of why he did what he did.",
        "His ideology sanctioned, in his own mind, this act of violence, and to me that's why we have to include this conversation about religion in this tragedy.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF AUDIOBOOK \"\"THE AUDACITY OF HOPE\"\")",

        "But more importantly, we are afraid now that maybe radical Islamic jihadism counts on that tolerance and forbearance to A, ensure that some people who do connect their own frustrations will slip under the radar, and 2, that we as a society will not be able to formulate an opinion about it when somebody as blatantly as Colonel Hasan Major Hasan, you know, says Allah Akbar(ph) or has business cards with soldier of Allah or whatever, that we are becoming increasingly inept to do that."

        "And that's what the worry is because since 9/11, we've had I think it's 24 formal plots foiled, attempts to commit mayhem against civilians, and then we've had another, what I would call al-Qaidistic: individual, lone-wolf type of incidents, whether attacking a Jewish center in Seattle or San Francisco or the halal counter in Los Angeles or running over people in North Carolina.",
        "In all of these incidents, the perpetrators have tried to connect this seemingly random act of violence with a more cosmic theme of personal grievance against the United States and the West in general for its treatment of Islam.",
        "And therefore, we should pay attention to that and watch patterns is what you suggest.",
        "Mr.�HANSON: Yeah, I think that there was enough patterns in the case of Major Hasan to have acted in a way much differently than we did, and then the reaction toward it was also symptomatic of our inability to confront the issue, when the chief of staff of the Army said that it would be - that the loss of diversity might be a more troublesome price to pay than the actual violence itself or that people are arguing whether a person who openly evokes radical themes is really acting in a radical fashion in accordance with radical Islam.",
        "I think we have an inability as a society to confront that danger, and the problem is that you don't need most of the vast majority of American Muslims are peaceful, and they're no different than the religion practice as far as anybody else.",
        "But if you have a small subset, and you have - you're working with a group of two or three million people, then you're going to have to be careful when somebody who's disturbed starts to resonate with bin Ladenism or Dr.�Zawahiri's theories.",
