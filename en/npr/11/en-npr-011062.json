        "My sadness on this Fort Hood tragedy is that Major Hasan represents a casualty to me in this war of ideas inside of our Muslim world.",
        "The war of ideas within the Muslim world.",
        "Ms.�NOMANI: Exactly.",
        "You cite a series of conversations he had with a man at a local mosque not far away from here in Washington, D.C., when he worked at Walter Reed.",
        "Ms.�NOMANI: Yeah, you just had this wonderful telling of what Major Hasan was like inside the halls of Walter Reed.",
        "Well, he would get in his car and go down the road to the Muslim community center in Silver Spring, and there, he would have very honest conversations with this man that I've been talking to inside the community for years.",
        "And he would have a very clear acceptance and embracing of puritanical, literal interpretation of Islam that said that jihad was a holy war, that said that you should cut the hands of thieves, that sanctions polygamy, all of the spectrum of interpretation that goes along with a very literal interpretation of the Quran and Islam.",
        "And yet when leaders are asked about that, there's no word of it.",

        "And anyways, Hasan's unit, some of those health care workers I believe are actually going to that same Baghdad unit, where this sergeant previously shot, you know, basically did an act of fratricide, you know, whatever it was, six months earlier.",
        "And I just can't believe nobody's kind of put these two in context, especially given that Hasan's unit is actually going to this other mental health clinic in Baghdad where there's a history of, like, soldier-on-soldier violence, and",
        "Yet, he had not been to Iraq himself.",
        "He'd had no experience of that.",
        "That's absolutely not my point.",
        "I was I'm trying to say that we've had these fratricides before, and there wasn't all this, you know, do you know what religion John Russell was when he shot, you know, when he shot his own soldiers",
        "Mr.�HANSON: There are, but there's two points to be made again.",
        "If Mr.�Russell in Baghdad had said that he was doing this because of radical environmental issues or he was against abortion, that would make our antennae rise a little bit because he was trying, again, channel a random act of violence into some sort of political agenda, A.",
        "And then, B, is there a history of similar incidents - that when people try to do this?",
        "In the case of Major Hasan, unfortunately, as I said, we have both formal and informal radical jihadist efforts since 9/11, probably altogether over 40 in which individuals or groups of individuals have tried to commit mayhem and violence in a systematic fashion, you know, either as lone wolf or as a part of a cabal.",
        "So, again, its a not good logical trope to just say, well, theres random violence by everybody.",
        "We had things in the post office 19 - as you know, 70s and 80s - I think it was 25 incidents.",
        "And we reacted because there was a particular type or particular profile and a particular complaint, and thats what you try do when you look at these things to prevent them.",
        "But if youre just going to say that every time someone shoots somebody or runs somebody over or tries to break into a Jewish center and emulates bin Laden or resonates with his ideology, if youre just going to say, well, hes no different than a radical environmentalist or a radical Christianist(ph) who does this at a much less frequent - much less frequency then its - were going to get nowhere.",
        "Were just going to be inept and were going to be a deer in the headlights and say its - we would rather err on the side of feeling good about our tolerance than we are about the safety and the lives of innocent individuals.",
        "Theres something amoral about this whole discussion that weve seen in the last week.",
        "But we were concentrating on whether its fair or not in the way that we adjudicate Major Hasan.",
        "But nobody of the 300 Americans knows the names of the 13 that were butchered.",
        "We dont know the names of the 31 that were wounded.",
        "Were not concern about what happened to them and at least to the effect - the extent that we would do something to prevent it.",
        "Were more worried about whether feel good about ourselves and we are tolerant enough.",
        "And thats something thats quite pathological.",
        "I wonder if you have a response to that, Asra.",
        "Well, you know, it may seem politically incorrect again on this point, but I could tell from the clothes that Major Hasan was wearing when he went to the convenient store to get his morning run of coffee, what ideology he practices.",
        "He wore his pants higher than normal, theyre sort of like what you call, you know, high waters in America.",
        "And that is part of an interpretation of Islam that says that the Prophet Muhammad wore his pants high and thats the way we have to do it today.",
        "Its part of a profiling, you could say, but these are the kind of cultural cues that I think as a society we need to believe that we have the right to examine because they become cues to ideology.",

        "If that -if we cannot, as a society, react to that, then we have no moral compass left because we're essentially saying to people we know that people are quite dangerous and prone to violence, but what they say and what they're proud of saying, what they post on the Internet, but we are not willing to do anything to protect people because we have a certain self-image about ourselves that we wont endanger.",
