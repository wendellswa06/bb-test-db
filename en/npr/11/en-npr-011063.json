        "Pretty much.",
        "This is the last interview I'm doing because everything that I've said anywhere so far has been spun to fit the agenda of the people interviewing.",
        "I have been called at all hours of the day and night and most of the conversations begin with, `Well, we want to get a word from somebody on your side of the issue.",
        "They immediately believe that my side is whatever their agenda is.",
        "So explain to me why you are advocating clemency without a possibility of parole.",
        "What does that mean to you?",
        "When I wrote my letter about clemency to the governor and said that I do not believe after following this case for almost a quarter of a century that Mr. Williams' lawyers will ever stop before they get him out.",
        "Clemency is just the beginning.",
        "I said, `If that is the case, then I cannot be for clemency because I do not believe that Mr. Williams on the street will enhance America.",
        "I do believe that there's a possibility and it's just that, a possibility, that he is doing some good where he is, but there's no guarantee that that would continue to be were he free.",
        "Tookie Williams has said that he is innocent of these crimes, although he's been convicted.",
        "Does it hurt you personally or hurt members of your family that he has never admitted responsibility and that he's never apologized?",
        "Well, I would not expect him to admit it, whether he did it or not.",
        "I mean, that's not my judgment.",
        "He will have the ultimate judgment at the same time all of us do.",
        "And if Mr. Williams is innocent of these crimes, then maybe we'll meet up in the next world and he can tell me there.",
        "Do you believe that the governor will grant clemency or not?",
        "Just your personal gut opinion.",
        "I believe that it's going to be a political opinion and have nothing to do with justice either way.",
        "It will be a sad day either way.",
        "And because it's politics, I have no confidence in it because our government has gone from a democracy to a political society and politics is to governance what puppetry is to dance.",
        "They have nothing to do with each other.",
        "Wayne Owens is the brother of the slain convenience store clerk Albert Owens, one of the four victims Tookie Williams has been convicted of murdering.",

        "Congratulations, Rita.",
        "Thank you very much, Audie.",
        "So, what was the answer to last week's challenge?",
        "The answer was Kent State, which makes tent stake.",

        "Why?",
        "Matt Cain is another guy who's been completely dominant with a great fastball.",
        "And they just picked up a pitcher from the Boston Red Sox named Brad Penny.",
        "And it'll be interesting to see if they make it to the post season, if that pitching staff is good enough to carry them."

        "And right now, there's a lot of ill feeling between Joe and the organization since he had his book come out on spring training.",
        "He was critical of different members of that organization, including Alex Rodriguez.",
        "And so it would be interesting to see the Dodgers and Yankees, old rivals, face off with that as the underlying story.",

        "How well do you think the Dodges are doing?",
        "How likely is it that they would make it all the way?",
