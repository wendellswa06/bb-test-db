        "And he didn't seem to have any hesitation about that, was perfectly willing to defend it, and said he simply disagreed with their view of how to interpret the law.",
        "Well, let's listen to some Barack Obama's literal words on this subject.",
        "He actually did a book on tape - he read his book out loud - and this is something that he said about different Supreme Court justices.",
        "I had just - wanted to mention some - that we like the U.S.",
        "government facilities.",
        "My family's is always on the lookout for factory tours when we visit cities.",
        "And some of the U.S.",
        "government facilities that we have seen recently that have been very educational have really held my children's interest.",
        "There is an atmospheric center that overlooks Boulder, Colorado.",
        "And it has - we often hear releases from that center, it has beautiful scenery and trails plus you learn a lot about the atmosphere and air, and they have exhibits.",
        "Woodshole Oceanographic, which is on the other side of the country on the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "Again, it's free tremendous information about oceanography and atmosphere.",
        "We love military bases.",
        "Like we took - taken the Norfolk tour so you see large aircraft carriers, and all kinds of navy facilities there.",
        "Dayton Air is Air Force, Hill Air Force Space.",
        "There's a new - when we're talking last half hour about the nuclear facility, the place up in Rapid City, South Dakota which is an air base that you can see a museum about nuclear facilities.",

        "You can't really visit any of the automobile factories except for one, and it is nothing less than fascinating, and it's the Ford Rouge Factory.",
        "And it's named after the nearby river, the Rouge River, I always wondered just where the name came from.",
        "It's the only one, you can visit in Detroit, you can visit the homes of the great, you know, iconic families, and there's the Chrysler Museum which is also very interesting.",
        "But the factory itself is magnificent, and it takes you along the assembly line.",
        "It was built in 1917 when a 100,000 workers manned the assembly line, and the goods would come in at one end of the factory.",
        "And the cars would kind of roll out the other end, and it takes you to the history, has films, you go with the guy that just brings alive that entire chapter in history, I think that's fascinating.",
        "I mentioned very briefly before the Corvette Factory, only half jokingly because people take it very seriously.",

        "And also following September 11th, quite a number of the factories across America shut down, or cut back, or closed entirely.",
        "The Corning Museum for example in upstate New York because they now manufacture most of their glass and their Stubin glass division, I think, as well in West Virginia which has an old history of glass making as well but it's true.",
