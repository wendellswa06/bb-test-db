        "You know, it's that kind of show.",
        "Once you're in, if you can give it a chance, it really hooks you because it has that soapy element, but we try to ground it in real issues and real relationship dramas and friendship dramas and work dramas.",
        "And it's the kind of thing that everybody can relate to it if you just get over that issue of it being about four black gay men.",

        "Darryl and Ian - Ian, you may want to pick up on this, that sometimes there's a line - and it's not always a bright line - between making characters recognizable archetypes and making them stereotypes.",
        "And I wonder whether you ever worry that you've crossed it, you know, playing into stereotypes - the effeminate - or Ian, even with the characters, you know, people who have - who are somewhat feminine in their affect, or one of the characters is struggling with a - how can we put it?",
        "A sex addiction.",
        "Is that fair to say?",
        "You know, one of the characters is…",
        "I think that's fair to say.",
        "And a couple of the characters are, you know, very kind of hyper-masculine.",
        "And now, do you ever worry that you're walking up to the line of stereotyping?",
        "Well, when I did the show, we were kind of at an interesting time -we still are, where, you know - before, in television and film, I think you used to always see the stereotype of the overly effeminate, queeny gay character that was there strictly for comedic effect that was very one-dimensional.",
        "You never knew very much more about that character.",
        "They were just there to kind of twist across the screen and say a funny line.",
        "And then it evolved into the politically-correct era, where it was suddenly like these hyper-masculine, you know - if they didn't say they were gay, you would never know that these characters were gay.",
        "And I think that's just as damaging as the one-dimensional, queeny stereotype.",
        "There is no space in between the persons.",
        "They stand shoulder to shoulder, touching of objects of religious significance.",
        "And when we pray, we prostrate on the ground where you would touch also the carpets or the floor.",

        "As long as, you know, you can really get to know who they are.",
        "And because the trend now has been this sort or - towards this sort of straight-acting hyper-masculine ideal, I purposely wanted to go in the other direction.",
        "I wanted Noah to be a character who was very feminine naturally, and he just embraced that in the way he dressed and the way he talked.",

        "Well, it was interesting.",
        "When I first started reading blogs -which is a bad thing to do, when the show first started airing - I was hearing a lot of people saying that they thought that the four main guys, Noah in particular, were basically stereotypes.",
        "And I thought, you know, my feeling was that I was playing a very specific character.",
        "And Patrik had directed me that he wanted the character to be, you know, soft and effeminate.",
        "And those were things that I took to heart.",
        "You know, I tried to make that as real as possible.",
        "And it was hurtful to think that those people were limiting the work that I was doing to just a stereotype.",

        "Some people really loved the character and thought that that was the first time that they had seen themselves, which was great - which is what I was hoping, you know, to do.",
        "Darryl, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask Patrik-Ian one last question about - there has been some opposition from elements within the black community.",

        "At one point, as I understand it, some members of the Nation of Islam hosted a demonstration and shut down production for a day.",

        "And I need you to answer very quickly, if you would.",
        "You know, there has - it's not all sunshine and roses.",
        "You know, we bear the burden of being the first and the only, and so you know, everyone expects the show to be something for them personally.",
        "And we can't do that, unfortunately.",
        "It's one show about very specific characters, and we do the best that we can.",
        "And if people can accept that, I think it's cool.",
        "The Nation of Islam thing, it really wasn't about us being a gay show.",
        "It was about what they saw as white productions coming into black neighborhoods and not hiring as many black people as we should.",
        "That was their perception.",
        "I think that, you know, we're one show, and unfortunately we're the only one.",
        "But hopefully we can encourage, and people will be encouraged to do more shows about other black gay characters.",

        "That was a great surprise for me, is the similarities between the Patrick Henry families and the families that I was very familiar with.",
