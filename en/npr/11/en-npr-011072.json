        "And now let's move even a little further to catch up on fighting involving Palestinians in Lebanon.",
        "These are Islamist militants battling a Lebanese army at the Palestinian refugee camp in the northern part of the country.",
        "They've been fighting for weeks and more than 130 people are confirmed dead.",
        "The army says it will keep up its artillery barrage and ground operations until the al-Qaida-inspired militants are defeated.",
        "The battle has revived questions about other armed factions operating in Lebanon, especially Syrian-controlled Palestinian groups operating outside the camps.",
        "NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Beirut.",
        "From the hills above the Nahr el-Bared camp, north of Tripoli, Lebanese army shells come whistling down on the primitive concrete structures in the center of the camp below.",
        "(Soundbite of explosions)",
        "For three weeks, the pounding is going on and the army issues regular statements about its progress, but the latest reports put the Lebanese forces only a short way into the camp at a cost of more than 60 military deaths.",
        "This battle has been a real boost for the army's reputation, with all Lebanese factions backing the army in its fight against the Fatah al-Islam extremists.",
        "But Lebanese officials say other groups have joined the Islamist side of the fight, including the Palestinian militia known as the General Command.",
        "Former lawmaker Ghattas Khouri, a government supporter, says this is a disturbing development.",
        "To be frank, the groups that are fighting now in Nahr el-Bared is not only Fatah al-Islam; all the other groups that were allied with the Syrians like the General Command and others are also fighting with them.",
        "I think what will happen is that when we finish with Nahr el-Bared, or soon they might trigger other incidents.",
        "The General Command was once part of the left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.",
        "It maintained strongholds in the Beqaa Valley and elsewhere.",
        "Its leader, Ahmad Jabril, is a former Syrian army captain who directs the group from Damascus.",
        "Khouri says the army has already encircled one General Command outpost in the Beqaa near the Syrian border.",
        "And there's also a potential flashpoint at Al-Naimi(ph), south of Beirut.",
        "MR.",
        "KHOURI: Also we have another problem, which is Al-Naimi, you know, tunnels and camp, which is full of General Command fighters.",
        "So we have two potential security threats in these two areas.",
        "And these are outside the Palestinian camps."

        "Al-Naimi is a hilly area several miles south of the capital where the General Command is believed to have a stockpile of weapons stored in a network of tunnels burrowing deep into the mountainside.",
        "After passing several checkpoints manned by young men with automatic weapons, a visiting reporter was escorted recently to meet a middle-aged man in green fatigues.",
        "He gave his nom de guerre as Abu Alamin Halad(ph).",
        "He pointed out the ruins of buildings which have been hit over the years by Israeli air strikes, most recently in last summer's war.",
        "And he said the Zionists are the enemy, not the Lebanese Army.",
        "Speaking over a nearby generator, he rejected the claim that General Command fighters are fighting alongside Fatah al-Islam in the north.",
        "(Through translator) I think this an awful thing to say.",
        "(Unintelligible) what's happening there.",
        "We're here with an agreement with the Lebanese government from 1969.",
        "We protect the camp and we take the brunt of the force of the Israelis.",
        "When they hit, they hit us.",
        "The tip of the spear refers to this idea that there is a large, young Christian conservative movement that's going to shape the culture and take back the nation.",
        "That's another phrase that you would hear repeated all the time.",
        "And the idea is that we are basically lost as a nation and that you need to train as vanguard to take the nation back, a young and pure generation.",
        "Hmm.",

        "Noa, thank you very much for being with us.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "Can you see why some people worry that you and other Patrick Henry graduates are out to kind of Christianize the country without people knowing it?",
        "Well, I don't know that any of us are out to Christianize the country.",
        "We have ideas.",
        "And just like everyone else, all we want is to be able to kind of talk about them.",
        "And if you happen to like those idea then great; and if not, that's fine.",
        "Now, certainly previous efforts perhaps by a Christian right may have sometimes come across as a little, shall we say, strong-willed.",
        "I think that's there's a difference in approach with the Patrick Henry College graduate, and I certainly don't think we want to force anything on anybody.",
        "But we do want to talk about it, you know, just like we talk about politics or anything of that nature."

        "The films that I have made over the four years I was at Patrick Henry College have ranged from a small student shorts to my first feature film, \"\"Smuggler's Ransom.\"\" The one thing, I'd say, they have in common is that they were very fun to make and, hopefully, very fun to watch for their various audiences.",
        "But they would surprise people who would expect a Christian film to be a bunch of guys in robes reciting Bible verse.",
        "Well, I guess it would depend, yeah.",
        "If by a Christian film you're referring to kind of what the traditional biblical epic, they certainly are not that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, we always liked to say we were Christians making films, and that's kind of how we approached it.",
        "Ms. Rosin?",
        "Yes.",
        "How is a Christian college student, committed Christian college student who says I want to go into government to change things, or a committed Christian college student who says I want to go into the movie industry to make that a better industry that shows better films different from Robert Redford saying I want to make a liberal film that wakes up America?",
        "In my mind, there is really no difference, and I think that's something that each side misses about the other.",
        "There is this idea that, you know, maybe that these kids don't understand the separation of church and state.",
        "And while that may have been true for an older generation, I think that this next generation is quite sophisticated and they pretty well understand what compromises they have to make if they're going to succeed in politics or maybe succeed in the movie industry."

        "But, you know, surely Robert Redford would highly disagree with them.",
        "Could you tell us about the young woman who stayed with you for awhile, young Patrick Henry student?",
        "There was a woman who was looking for an internship in Washington, D.C., and she needed a place to stay.",
        "And so we offered her to stay at our house, and she lived with us for a quite awhile.",
        "We were quite friendly and I got to know her very well.",
        "And the story I tell in my book is that one day, my husband finally asked her the question, which is, are we going to hell?",
        "And there was a long pause, and like I said we'd been pretty good friends by then, and she'd lived with us for awhile and our kids adored her.",
        "Finally, she answered, yes, but I'm not jumping up and down for joy about it.",
        "I was also struck as you recounted that relationship that you - I believe you had a friend who was impressed by her intelligence, her energy, her achievement and how nice she was that she said to you, well, if they're all like that, we're in trouble.",
        "Yeah.",
        "When I told them that a Patrick Henry student was living in my attic, my friends would have the usual kind of lefty journalist's reaction.",
        "They would say, you know, are you crazy?",
        "Why are you harboring Nazis in your attic?",
        "That was the basic attitude.",
        "And then when they met her, they were even more worried because she was so fabulous and so smart and so impressive and so incredibly successful and attractive and funny.",
        "And so that was the reaction a friend of mine had was if they're all like that, we're really in trouble.",
        "What was she scared of?",
        "I mean, that strikes me, I've got to say, is a very hardhearted reaction to call, you know, call someone living in your attic a Nazi just because what?",
        "She's Christian?",
        "Well, it's - yes.",
        "It's the sort of Stepford idea that people have when they hear of a place like Patrick Henry that it's a kind of training academy, and it's the idea that they're sort of turning out these perfect little soldiers to kind of fight the fight against the left.",
        "Mr.",
        "Noa, may I ask you a question, I don't want to personalize it with the sense of either Hanna Rosin or me for that matter, but let me personalize it in another way.",

        "Well, you know, it's funny you should mention that.",
        "There's an old fable.",
        "I read it in it might have a contemporary of Chaucer, I don't remember, but that the Dalai Lama, allegedly, had passed away.",
