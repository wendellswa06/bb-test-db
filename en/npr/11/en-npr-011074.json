        "With the governor ramping up, Fitzgerald says investigators were able to wiretap the governor's home phone and bug his office, catching brazen acts of corruption on tape, like him trying to get $100,000 out of a billion dollar tollway contractor, $100,000 for him to sign a gambling bill, and $50,000 from the head of a children's hospital for an $8 million state grant.",
        "When that check didn't come in, Fitzgerald says Blagojevich tried to pull back the grant.",
        "And as the financially troubled Tribune Company was looking for state financial assistance for the sale of Wrigley Field, the home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team which Tribune owns, Fitzgerald says the governor tried to force The Chicago Tribune to fire certain editorial writers for what he considered biased coverage against him.",

        "In exchange for putting in a person Mr. Obama favored for the post, Fitzgerald says Blagojevich tried to work out a deal in which he would get a high-paying job with the Service Employees International Union in its Change to Win campaign.",
        "And he allegedly also tried to get lucrative appointments to corporate boards for his wife and other jobs for himself, along with plain old cash from others seeking the Senate seat.",
        "Fitzgerald says there is no evidence President-elect Obama knew anything about the scheme, nor is anyone in his office accused of doing anything wrong.",
        "The governor appeared in court this afternoon, and a federal judge ordered him released on his own recognizance.",
        "He would not comment to reporters as he left the Dirksen Federal Building, downtown Chicago.",
        "But just yesterday Blagojevich did comment on reports that he had been secretly recorded by federal agents.",
