        "Yes, Neal, and really there are going to be multiple aspects of them.",
        "The first will be the criminal investigation.",
        "And, technically, I think that will cover both the incident at Haditha itself, as well as the potential of a cover up.",
        "But they really will cover two separate aspects of it.",
        "The first thing that they should do is get their hard evidence, that's who was on the patrol?",
        "What were their names?",
        "What time did they leave?",
        "When did they come back?",
        "Was there radio communications?",
        "Did they have any reports?",
        "Yeah, I appreciate it.",
        "After the incident, a couple of Marines were sent out to take pictures.",
        "You want to get those photographs.",
        "And then, on-scene, they should do much like an archeologist - set a grid, figure out what happened in what location.",
        "And from there, they can start doing their forensic analysis.",
        "According to the Time Magazine report, they have made 15 visits to Haditha to, you know, look at bullet holes and do the whole CIS, you know, crime investigation.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And once they have those things, then - and we also know that some of the Marines have already started to speak in certain respects.",
        "This morning on the news, there was a wounded Marine who had talked about some of his observations.",
        "Once you've got the hard facts, then you generally will start at the lowest level individual, that'd be your privates.",
        "And you'd start getting some information from them.",
        "Because, clearly, as other callers have indicated, one of the issues here is a break down in command and control.",
        "Once you start getting those statements, pretty soon you're going to be able to identify who you believe the most culpable, or most likely culpable individuals will be.",
        "And then you start taking the statements that you can use against those individuals.",
        "The other thing that's very important to remember is that the investigators, when they're conducting these interviews with the suspects - while they will have to give them their warnings, both under Miranda, if it's a custodial interrogation, as well as under Article 31 BRAVO, the UCMJ, for any military investigation - they basically can say pretty much what they want to try and get out any incriminating statements from those individuals.",
        "Now, that video we heard about from Michael Duffy, the one taken by an Iraqi journalism student.",
        "Is that considered evidence?",
        "Can that be used?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean if there are photographs that were taken on the scene, they're going to be able to use those in some way or another."

        "And how long does all of this take?",
        "Well, this is going to take a very long time.",
        "And, potentially, because there has been a passage of time from the time of the incident before the investigations actually began.",
        "So you run into some problems with whether or not the crime scene still exists as it did at the time that these deaths took place.",
        "Because these forensic investigations have come weeks or months after the incident.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And then also, I understand, that there are reports that there have been some fire set place in the building, so that can make it much more difficult.",
        "But, much as in an arson investigation, they should be able to still get beneath that and get a lot of information.",
        "Then the second investigation, of course, is into what happened after the fact, and the cover up that's been alleged.",
        "And that's going to become a very significant investigation.",
        "And I believe, in long-term, that is probably more critical to the image of the Corps, then perhaps even what happened on the ground.",
        "Because, at least on the ground, you've got the heat of the battle, you've got, perhaps, untrained, inexperienced individuals.",
        "They had just suffered the loss of one of their own and the heat of the passion sort of a thing.",
        "Whereas if there was a deliberate cover up, then that really goes way - much higher in the chain of command.",
        "You're not talking about privates and corporals now; you're talking about senior officers.",
        "And that significantly has a great impact on the Marine Corps.",
        "Michael Duffy was telling us that three officers have been...",
        "Administrative action has been taken against them; that's correct, Neal.",
        "How's - is that because they're under investigation - what do we read into that?",
        "Well, I think the initial - what you've got is, as soon as it appeared that there was some indication of a cover up, then the officers above those officers - the superiors in the chain of command - they lost confidence.",
        "That's an administrative term, and administratively they removed those officers from their positions of authority.",
        "The investigation was commenced and now they're going to be looking at not only in terms of the administrative side of that, but also potentially criminal charges."
