        "No, it isn't; it isn't.",
        "But it does explain the situations that our fine, professional military soldiers are put into.",
        "It's amazing that there isn't a higher probability or a higher number of outcomes like this because the situation engenders it.",

        "Well, it's a village full of VC, and then it becomes a VC village.",

        "There's a dozen cover ups happening right now.",
        "Because of that emotional disbelief, that happened in My Lai, in Vietnam, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo.",
        "And what's happening is we, in the U.S., have lost our moral high ground.",
        "And now we have the United Nations and China telling us that we need to get our acts right, which is correct, we should.",
        "But, you know, having people like China telling us we need to get our acts right is because we just continue to behave as unleashed bullies in the world.",
        "And that's why people bomb us, because we just don't know how to behave.",
        "Well, let's get a - address that on a couple of points.",

        "The Marines are the few, the proud.",
        "They're a very select, very unique group; they are very good at what they do.",
        "But, as the professor was just talking about, it does raise a question about what this administration is expecting the military to be able to do.",
        "They cannot do everything in all places.",
        "And, candidly, when you start thinking about putting military forces on our border with Mexico, you raise the risk that similar sorts of things may happen because our armed forces are trained to break things and kill people.",

        "That's their phrase, that's this administration's phrase in forced transformation in a matter of blocks.",
        "Well, that's a wonderful concept, but it requires enormous investments in human capital in the form of not only training, but also education.",
        "And the education that is required is a highly advanced liberal arts education that acknowledges nuances of culture, tradition, religion, and other sociological factors.",

        "That's the problem.",

        "It's a young person's organization.",
        "The Marine Corps has, I believe, the youngest average age of all of the services, 18, 19 years old.",
        "And when you're putting people with that limited experience and maturity and wisdom in this type of a situation - from rifleman to diplomat as Professor Camacho was saying - you're really asking too much for what they've been prepared to do.",
        "That's why there are corporals and sergeants and lieutenants and captains.",

        "And they take their cue from the people in charge, but those people in charge are not that much more experienced than they are, either in age or in actual combat experience.",

        "If somebody told me to go into a village and start shooting civilians, regardless of the situation, it was my responsibility to say no. That is not a lawful order.",
        "So the culpability is everybody who had a gun in his hand and pulled the trigger.",

        "And the higher in rank and position someone is, the more responsible they are.",
        "But if you're looking to get evidence against that more culpable person, then you generally will start at the lower level to get that information."

        "Well, eventually Neal, it won't be significantly different than any sort of a situation where you have a large group of individuals, because what will happen is initially there may be sort of a band of brotherhood; they're not going to want to talk against each other and incriminate someone.",
        "But eventually they will be facing their own responsibility, and particularly when their lawyers get involved.",
        "What we're trying to do is protect our client.",

        "It's a very complex procedure to go through.",
