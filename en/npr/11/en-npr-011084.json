        "It doesn't make a policy.",

        "And you can't point out all these good individual things and say, but don't those add up to something?",
        "No, they don't.",

        "Following up with what Professor Camacho had indicated right before our last break - when you look at the sequence of events in Haditha, you've got a difference, a distinction, between what you may look at, in terms of criminality with regard to the shooting of the occupants of the taxi.",
        "If they arrived shortly after the blast, clearly that would be much more of a quick call that you have to make, not knowing whether they participated.",
        "On the other hand, if you're talking about shooting women and children and babies in a room, that clearly is not going to meet any definition of acceptable conduct.",
        "So that goes back to what Ahmed was asking, in, you know, how are our troops supposed to be to know how to respond?",
        "And, again, you have to look at the factual distinction between what is taking place, who the individuals are.",
        "It's not that women and children are incapable of engaging them in hostile acts, but you can clearly distinguish between a taxi that's speeding up right at the scene of an explosion with four males in it.",
        "That is much more likely to have been a combat situation than after, when, according to the reports, these Marines went into the buildings and they found the women and the children huddling, begging for their lives.",
        "You don't need any special training to know those are not the people that you shoot.",

        "That's the general or the colonel in charge of those individuals.",

        "And, again, not everyone involved necessarily is going to face the exact same charges.",
        "So there will be another investigation called an Article 32 investigation, and that's the military's equivalent of a grand jury.",
        "The difference being is that the service member will be represented by an attorney.",
        "It's an open hearing, except if there are national security issues it'd have to be a closed hearing.",
        "They have an opportunity to view all the evidence that the government is going to use against them.",
        "And, at the end of that investigation, the investigating officer will file a report to the convening authority who sent the charges to the Article 32 investigation.",
        "That officer will then make a decision whether to go higher or to resolve it at the level that that colonel, for example, might be able to resolve.",
        "For misdemeanor or lower level offenses, the colonel will take care of it.",
        "If they believe they are more serious charges, then the colonel would forward it to a general, a general in command, who then can refer the charges to a general court marital, which is the military's equivalent of the felony trial, and for which a punishment to include the death penalty could be imposed.",

        "People at the Justice Center like, you know, Judge Calabrese, and even folks like Leroy Davis, who's a court officer and grew up in Red Hook, these are people who really started to, you know, care about this kid and demand that he follow through and pay attention to him.",
        "So I think by the end of the documentary what you see is even though he stumbles a lot, that the court, you know, keeps pushing him ahead and that he manages to come through at the end without a criminal record and, you know, still comes back to the court to show off a pay stub to the judge and stays in touch with people at the court."
