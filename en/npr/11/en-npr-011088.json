        "They collect on delinquent or defaulted student loans, and so they essentially have vertically integrated and are the single biggest participant in core areas of the student loan business.",

        "The University of Nebraska went on to choose the federal government's direct lending program rather than Sallie Mae, so he doesn't get those perks anymore.",
        "Munier jokes that his wife still pines for the old days.",
        "Sallie Mae also pioneered some of the marketing practices targeted by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in his probe of the student loan industry.",
        "Last week, Sallie Mae signed an agreement with Cuomo to stop some of those practices, such as having its staff work in schools alongside financial aid administrators without telling students they were with Sallie Mae.",
        "Other lenders got caught giving kickbacks to schools, and some school financial aid administrators got caught accepting stock options from lenders.",
        "There are critics who say the agreements Cuomo struck with Sallie Mae and others only deal with the most egregious violations.",
        "They say Congress needs to deal with the flaws and the potential conflicts of interest they believe are built into the student loan programs.",
        "Barnak Nassirian is with the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.",
        "Well, the real problem is that the party that picks up the tab, the borrower, is not really in the driver's seat.",
        "Nassirian says in reality it is schools that decide which lenders students can choose from.",
        "Usually competition's a good thing, but when the lenders win coveted places on campus by offering incentives to administrators, somebody has to pay, and most of the time it's the student.",
        "Now, when the lender comes in and does it, quote-unquote, \"\"for free,\"\" they didn't print money in the basement.",
        "What they're doing is they're offering it for free to the school precisely because they are going to make presumably more than that from the school's borrowers."
