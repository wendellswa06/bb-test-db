        "Walk into just about any coffee shop in California and you'll probably see a sign warning you that you could get cancer from chemicals in the store's products.",
        "At the top, the signs say Proposition 65 warning.",
        "You'll find similar signs in any number of places: parking garages, restaurants, apartment buildings.",

        "No. And does it deter me from going into buildings where I see it on the outside?",
        "No. It's just one of those things you see on the wall.",
        "That was Steve Hankins, Amneeta Chatha and Alana Serfati.",
        "The warnings are there to comply with a 1986 California law that requires companies to disclose if their products or facilities use chemicals that could potentially cause cancer or reproductive illness.",
        "And if a company fails to warn consumers, well, they can be sued.",
        "David Roe was one of the original architects of the law.",
        "The places where you see Prop 65 warnings tend to be things like gas stations, hotel lobbies where smoking is permitted, hotel rooms where smoking is permitted, things like that.",
        "It is important to be warned about it.",
        "It doesn't mean don't drink coffee.",
        "It means, is this a risk that you want to take among life's many other risks?",
        "Roe says when it was drafted in the early '80s, the intention of the law was to fix what many saw as a loophole in federal environmental regulations.",
        "The EPA only regulates chemicals when it knows exactly how much of a toxic chemical is too much.",
        "Finding that out requires an in-depth study, and that requires funding.",
        "In other words, if you could slow government down, then you could keep these laws from actually having an effect even though they were on the books.",
        "Roe says the California law has been a huge success.",
        "Consumers in the state are safer today than they have ever been."

        "Thousands of products have had toxic chemicals taken out of them, but you don't hear about it because most of Proposition 65's effect is companies deciding I would rather switch than fess up about exposing people to toxic chemicals.",

        "The law uses a citizen-suit provision in which anyone can sue a company that allegedly is violating the law.",
        "And then you can get some money if you're successful in the lawsuit.",
        "The problem with that second solution was that it does create an incentive for more and more people to sue.",
        "And we've seen an increase in those lawsuits over the years.",
        "And arguably, it's become a problem where you have lawyers targeting small businesses for some of these common everyday exposures like alcoholic beverages or cigarette smoke outside of a bar and using that to get some money but not actually producing useful information or useful reductions in toxic exposures.",
        "Prop 65 suits have helped make California the most litigious state in the union.",
        "And as Biber pointed out, those lawsuits disproportionately affect small businesses.",
        "John Kabateck is a spokesman for the National Federation for Independent Businesses.",
        "Businesses, mostly small businesses, paid about $22.5 million in Prop 65 settlements in 2012 alone.",
        "That's up $11.8 million since 2007, and the real problem here is the largest proportion of these settlement funds have actually gone in the pockets of plaintiff's attorneys.",
        "By some estimates, more than half of Proposition 65 settlement money has gone to lawyers.",
        "For virtually all environmental law in the U.S., it's the government's responsibility to go after businesses or products that are hurting consumers.",
        "Think of clean water laws.",
        "It's the EPA or state regulators that say, hey, hold on.",
        "This factory is dumping toxic pollution into a river.",
        "That's dangerous.",
        "But Prop 65 doesn't work like that.",
        "The state just puts out a list of chemicals that might hurt you.",
        "The responsibility is on businesses to warn consumers, and on consumers to sue if they don't."

        "That can also mean that it can be more costly.",
