        "Texas had a slightly better off--it's basically the same offense and a considerably better defense over the course of the year.",
        "Now USC had a lot of injuries on their defense over the course of the year, and that was a big reason that their defense underperformed.",
        "And a lot of those injured players should be back by tomorrow night's game, which would mean that the USC team that takes the field against Texas might be much better than the one that played over the course of the year.",

        "Texas or USC?",

        "Falwell was a pioneer televangelist, and then, during the 1980's, the founder of the Moral Majority, galvanized his evangelical organization into a powerful political force.",
        "Over more than five decades, Falwell became the face of the religious right and a champion of family values.",
        "Occasionally, he faced controversy over his views.",
        "And in a 1996 interview with NPR's Nina Totenberg, he explained how some of those views changed over the years.",
        "It was a spiritual osmosis.",
        "For me, it was in my personal study of the Bible, I had - at age 22 - completed six years of college and was pastor of a local church.",
        "And it took me a couple of - three years to buck the tide, come to my own conclusions, go against public opinion and began doing the unthinkable of opening the doors of the church and the grace of God to everyone.",
        "Reverend Jerry Falwell in an interview in 1996.",

        "Well, thank you very much, Neal.",
        "It's good to be with.",
        "And was Jerry Falwell influential on you in your career?",
        "No question about it.",
        "I mean, Jerry was somebody who was an enormously influential figure, frankly, far beyond his public persona.",
        "He was someone who was a friend, who was an associate.",
        "He was not a fair weather friend.",
        "I knew and worked with Jerry for, I would say roughly 24 or 25 years.",
        "And when I dealt with him, I always felt like I was not just dealing with a political colleague or a professional associate, but also someone who cared about me.",
        "And he had a pastoral personality.",
        "He cared about people.",
        "He counseled people.",
        "He was a great friend.",
        "And, you know, that's hard to appreciate at a moment like this, because the focus is as it should be, on - you know, on his political and religious and public persona.",
        "The people who didn't know him need to also appreciate that he had a huge impact on people in his interpersonal contact.",
        "Yet most people knew him via the television set, where he, of course, turned the TV set into a pulpit and was very influential in that whole movement.",
        "No question.",
        "You know, Jerry Falwell was clearly one of the most influential and historically significant figures of the 20th century.",
        "You know, other than Billy Graham and Pat Robertson and a handful of others, he's clearly one of the most important figures because he took a movement - namely, fundamentalism - that was at the outer edges and sort of outside margins of American religious and cultural discourse, and he moved it back into the mainstream for the first time probably since the 1920's, if not earlier.",
        "And then the second thing he did, of course, was he took those church-going folks and those religious conservative people who had also been really without a significant voice in the American political discourse, and he helped to transform them through the Moral Majority and the other organizations that came later into one of the most important and effective constituencies in the entire electorate.",
        "And both of those, Neal, are lasting historical accomplishments.",
        "Also with us to talk about the Reverend Jerry Falwell is Michael Cromartie.",
        "He's the vice president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Washington think tank.",
        "He directs their Evangelicals in Civic Life Program.",

        "I wonder if you agree with him.",
        "Well, yes, of course, I do.",
        "I think that Ralph is right.",
        "But what we have to remember about Jerry Falwell is that in the late '70s, when he founded the Moral Majority, he was a fundamentalist Baptist minister who was leading a movement of people who - at that time - believed, in fact, that politics was sinful activity, or at least not legitimate activity.",
        "He convinced millions of fundamentalists in America that actually things were otherwise, and that it was responsibility of conservative Christians to be involved in politics."
