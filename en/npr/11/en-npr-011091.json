        "Louisa Lim, NPR News, Tokyo.",
        "U.S.",
        "Interior Secretary Gale Norton is cleaning out her desk.",
        "She'll be leaving at the end of the month.",
        "Norton announced her resignation on Friday.",
        "She says she wants to catch her breath and set her sights on new goals.",
        "Her resignation came as a surprise.",
        "Some in Washington wonder if it has to do with the Interior Department's links to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who has pleaded guilty on corruption charges.",
        "Here to help us work through that question is NPR's correspondent who covers lobbyists, Peter Overby.",
        "Peter, let's get right to the point.",
        "Is Gale Norton connected to Jack Abramoff?",
        "Well, it depends on what you mean by connected.",
        "There was little direct contact between the two of them but she was the object of some really intense lobbying by Abramoff.",
        "This is based on a couple of hearings held by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, hundreds of emails that the committee released.",
        "We know that Abramoff did have pretty regular contacts with two people who were close to Norton.",
        "Who were those two people?",
        "One of them was Steve Griles.",
        "He was the Deputy Secretary of the Interior.",
        "That's the right hand man to the secretary basically.",
        "The other was Italia Federici.",
        "She is a friend of Norton and succeeded Norton as the head of a group called CREA, Council of Republicans for Environment Advocacy.",
        "That is a group that Norton co-founded before she became Secretary.",
        "I should say here that Griles and Federici emphatically deny any wrongdoing and at the committee hearings Senator John McCain, the committee chairman, said there's no evidence that Norton is involved in this stuff.",
        "So why are we talking about it?",
        "Well, we're talking about it because of Jack Abramoff and because of Indian casinos.",
        "A lot of this has to do with Indian casinos.",
        "In one big case Abramoff was trying to block a land deal for a tribe down in Louisiana.",
        "The reason he wanted to block it was that the tribe wanted to open a casino that would have competed with a casino owned by a tribe that Abramoff represented.",
        "You may have picked out a Boston accent from the character played by Tom Hanks.",
        "We were wondering what makes a good Boston accent.",
        "You saved some of the bricks.",
        "And he didn't just bring a few people.",
        "He brought, you know, millions of people who - I do want to emphasize, Neal, that millions of people who were committed for religious and theological reasons not to be involved in politics.",
        "And he came along and said, actually, he used to think that way and he criticized Dr. Martin Luther King for his political involvement, but then later discovered - apologized and repented of his views about Martin Luther King and said that and actually, it would be irresponsible not to be concerned about the great public issues of the day."

        "And we also need to remember that he actually had critics to his right.",
        "I know that will surprise some people.",
        "But there were people like Bob Jones who said that, you know, Falwell is a tool of Satan for getting involved in politics.",
        "So that's not a small accomplishment.",
        "And Ralph Reed, we also have to remember him as an educator.",
        "He died today at Liberty, an educational institution he founded.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And he was - again, for those who will look at his life as somebody who really changed the direction of the country spiritually, culturally and politically - he was at base, you know, a rural, independent Baptist preacher.",
        "I mean, that - it is amazing to think the impact he would later have, but he was first and last a preacher of the Gospel.",
        "And I think it was a subsequent evolution, which in his own personal biography reflected the evolution of millions of other likeminded Americans who moved from being outside the political process to being at the heart of it - from being someone who had really withdrawn from cultural and political struggle and focused almost singularly on salvation and personal improvement and spiritual development, who began to view impacting the culture as an extension of his ministry.",
        "And that is a huge change.",
        "And to have that change in this one man's life who, through his ministries, his relationships, his impact, his pulpit - as you said earlier, Neal, his really being one of the pioneering religious broadcasters, beginning to broadcast the \"\"Old Time Gospel Hour\"\" on radio in the 1940s and then later television in the 1950s, and then the rise of cable and the way that transformed our culture and our media and our politics - this was a remarkable human being.",
        "You know, agree or disagree with Dr. Falwell stood for, this was a consequential life that impacted America as few have, and it's an amazing story.",
        "Michael Cromartie, it was interesting to hear that cut of tape, that interview with Nina Totenberg where he talked about opening his heart and being much more inclusive.",
        "This was 11 years ago.",
        "There are some people who never felt that Jerry Falwell included them, homosexuals among them.",
        "Well, and then - and that would be people who didn't know Jerry Falwell, because the fact of the matter is, you can be a person who is inclusive with people and not agree with their lifestyle.",
        "And I know that many people will disagree with that, but my point is that you can say that people have equal rights and equal protection on the law and still disagree with, you know, their lifestyle.",
        "And so I think, you know, in the last 20 years of his life, Falwell was called up in the sexual ethical debates in our society.",
        "He took controversial stands, but, you know, in person, was a very decent and kind man.",
        "Yet, he said some things that some people took as hateful.",
        "Well, and he also - yes, and he also said some things that were theologically, I might add, incorrect.",
        "For instance that after 9/11, he'd made a statement which he later apologized for, which was that the attacks of 9/11 was a result of the lifestyles and behavior of many Americans.",
        "I happen to think that…"

        "Right.",
        "And I just think that - I think that it was theologically incorrect to do, and to get - religiously and biblically was an unfair and not the right comment to make because, in fact, what all people should be doing after 9/11 is not saying this was because of them, but we all should be saying Lord have mercy on all of us.",

        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "My respects to Mr. Falwell's family.",
        "But my comment is that Mr. Falwell and his fundamentalist movement are quite divisive in our country.",
        "And we are - we seem to be headed off in the same direction that as many of the Muslim countries have gone often, where it's a with-us-or-against-us philosophy.",
        "If you're not a member of the correct religious side of the right wing party, you're not even welcome as a Republican anymore.",
        "And I find that offensive.",
        "I think that that political movement - the pendulum is coming back on that.",
        "And I think that the social conservatives have painted themselves into a corner.",
        "Ralph Reed, would you agree with that?",
        "No.",
        "I wouldn't agree with that.",
        "I would certainly agree that the clarion call of faith in the free society is by necessity somewhat controversial and can be divisive.",
        "It would be hard to study the suffragist movement, the anti-slavery movement, the social gospel or settlement house movement or the civil rights or pro-family movement and not conclude that there's a divisive element.",
        "But it's a healthy division, because it is a voice of conscience speaking to power and to entrenched interests and eternal truth.",
        "In the case of the civil rights movement, of course, it was the eternal truth that all men and women were made in God's image and we're therefore equal in his sight and therefore should be treated the same under the law.",
        "There are few statements that were more divisive than that, particularly in the segregated South in the 1950s.",
        "In the end, which approach is better, putting the burden of consumer protection on businesses or on the government, has to boil down to a matter of perspective or political philosophy."

        "Yes.",
        "I think in terms of a modern pro-family movement that Dr. Falwell really helped to found and was present at the creation of, the voice of conscience said to a generation steeped in the sexual revolution and in the notion of if it feels good, do it and self-actualization to the sacrifice of all else, said that when someone ends a pregnancy that there's the taking of an innocent human life and that that precious and unborn life has a right to be protected.",
        "I would never dispute the fact that that's a controversial statement.",
        "What I would say is that as a free society and a democratic society that puts human civil rights first, we're all better off for that statement having been heard.",
        "The ultimate goals of the movement that Jerry Falwell personified have not yet been realized anymore than the civil rights movement has been realized.",
        "But who would deny that by having people of faith and conscience engaged in these issues that we're better off for the conversation, and I would argue, a lot of progress has been made to protect marriage, to protect the unborn, to restore values.",
        "You know, through the democratic process - I mean, the idea that this is somehow analogous to a radical Islamic dictatorship in the Middle East is, you know, I think somewhat incoherent.",
        "Matt, thank…",
        "Well, I think that what we've seen in the American political reaction -especially overseas - is direct result of a our-way-or-the-highway set of thinking that is present in the American conservative, basically right wing religious conservative thought.",
