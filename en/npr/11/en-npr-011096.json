        "It would get them through mid-January and cost more than $100,000 in interest.",
        "That would be the equivalent of two teacher salaries, a thousand textbooks, hundreds of computers.",
        "Instead, Erie asked for an advance on its state funding, but the state treasury and the governor said no. Last month, the school board authorized Badams to consider temporarily shutting down the district if needed.",
        "So far he hasn't taken that option.",
        "Joe Gorham at Carbondale has thought about similarly drastic measures - taking three-day weekends to save on heating costs.",
        "But both superintendents hesitate because high numbers of their students get free or reduced-price meals at school.",
