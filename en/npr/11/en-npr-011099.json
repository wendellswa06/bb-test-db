        "When you look at the history of black sitcoms, they're all predicated upon the, quote, \"\"black experience.\"\" And therefore, much of the humor is predicated on being black.",

        "Though it sounds like semantics, they're very different approaches.",

        "How does it look for the Giants this year, do you think?",
        "You know, this is - it's interesting because I know that some people want to view what they've done the last five years as sort of a dynasty, and the Giants were anything but that.",
        "The Giants were just - they barely got into the postseason all three of those years.",
        "They barely won each postseason series, and they were just scratching and clawing.",
        "But it's very impressive what they've done, but not a dynasty.",
        "And I would suspect that with the losses that they've had in the middle of their lineup offensively, it's going to be very difficult for them to reach the postseason again.",

        "The Cubs, of course, haven't won a World Series since 1908.",
        "They have a young, talented roster this year.",
        "They've got a new manager, Joe Maddon - hopes probably especially high for the Cubs this season.",
        "Without question and rightfully so.",
        "You know, they hired the general manager, the team president, Theo Epstein.",
        "And he, of course, oversaw the renaissance in Boston where Boston had won its first World Series since 1918.",
        "So they've taken a little bit of time.",
        "They've done it the right way in terms of fostering draft picks and minor-league talent and having it blossom to the point where it's ready to be in the major leagues.",
        "And then at the same time, this past year you saw them hit the free-agent market and go out and sign a Jon Lester for $150 million - 155, actually - go out and sign a manager with a proven track record, a winning record like a Joe Maddon.",
        "And it would not surprise me at all to see the Cubs reach the postseason either this year or next year.",
        "Reach the postseason - you're not going to go out on a limb and say this could be their championship season."
