        "Yes, I think in response to your direct question, there is no time to talk because Assad has shown that he can't be talked with.",
        "He's been thumbing his nose at the rest of the world any time that we negotiate anything, and his course is set.",
        "I think it's time for the rest of the world to set their course.",
        "And the only thing that I can see that we need to do, and this is as someone who opposed Iraq from the very beginning, now is the time for any coalition of the willing to come forward and dedicate themselves to removing this man from power because the primary goal here, and it should be the sole focus, is to stop the killing.",
        "The only way to do that is to stop the killer.",
        "Now, if we, you know, listen to the let-others-do-it argument, if we listen to the well-there-might-be-some-tragic-consequences-to-our-getting-involved, then nothing will ever get done.",
        "But I think Assad is not as strong as the rest of the world.",
        "The non-interventionists will say that he is.",
        "I think if a true coalition of the willing were to come forward, they could immediately neutralize his air force.",
        "They could neutralize his ability to strike against his people.",
        "We always said, over and over again, never again.",
        "We said this about the Holocaust.",
        "We said this about Rwanda and Bosnia, and now it's happening again.",
        "It has to be stopped.",
        "This has to be the primary goal involved, is to stop the killing now.",
        "Tom, thanks very much for the phone call, and we'll get some responses to your question when we come back from a short break.",

        "I don't know if you had a chance to hear Tom's phone call at the end of the last segment but pleading we keep talking about never again, yet we sit and watch it happen again.",
        "I did, and he is right that our overall focus for both moral and strategic reasons has to be to stop the killing.",
        "I think we are gradually moving in the direction of intervention for a number of reasons.",
        "First, I agree with Aaron and Steve that the current Annan plan favors the regime.",
        "I would love to see the outcome that Steve sketches, where in fact the supporters of Assad would decide he's a problem and negotiate his departure with us.",
        "Long-term, Anne-Marie Slaughter?",
        "Oh, Cameroon.",
        "Second thing is Aaron and actually agree the United States should not use force unless those countries in the region, particularly Turkey, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, are willing to authorize and take the lead in offering some kind of stronger defense against Assad.",
        "And the final point is what's going on here with the Annan initiative is as much aimed at Russia and China as it is at Damascus.",
        "This is about trying every last diplomatic track so that when it doesn't work, and I don't think it will, Russia and China will not be able to defend the regime and will have to abstain with a Security Council resolution, and the Security Council resolution is at that point likely to support the creation of some kinds of safe zones and to actually protect the people who are being slaughtered.",
        "You talked about asking the Arab states, Jordan and Turkey, to take the lead in intervention with Libya, a much less tough customer.",
        "The United States, in working with the Brits and the French, much more effective and sophisticated military forces, the United States had to lead the way and clear out the anti-aircraft defense systems.",
        "Certainly it would have to do the same with Syria.",
        "I think you're right that initial moves might well have to involve NATO air power, including U.S.",
        "air power, but it really would depend on what the strategy was.",
        "The strategy in Libya quickly became essentially stopping Gadhafi's army and then essentially that required getting him out of office.",
        "I think as the Turks have said repeatedly, there is a possibility of establishing a buffer zone on the Turkish border that would be much easier to defend than what we had to do in Libya.",
        "Similarly, you could do that in the south, on the Iraqi border, near the Jordanian border, where there are a number of tribes who are in fact very friendly to the opposition.",
        "So I don't think we're looking at the same kind of intervention that we saw in Libya, and the countries in the region have continually talked about doing this, but they don't want to move without the Security Council.",
        "The Security Council can't move without China and Russia, and we won't move without the people in the region.",
        "So somewhere this logjam has to break."

        "We always have to look at both sides of an issue, I think, and I'm old.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "I really believe that Assad, initially, when this revolution started, made offers of negotiating, and they were refused because I believe the people in rebellion are not organized.",
        "They had no one to talk - to speak for them.",
        "And, you know, it gets to a point where I think if we had the best interest of Syria at heart, we would try to organize the opposition, not the people who are outside now, who have lived away from the country for so many years, taking over and being spokesmen.",
        "I think the spokesmen should come from within the country, and I think if we had our heart in the right place, we'd try to get somebody to sit down at the table.",
        "Steve Heydemann, how do we do that?",
        "Well, I'd like to comment, if I may, on the earlier part of the caller's comment, in which she indicated that the opposition didn't accept the regime's offers to negotiate because it was disorganized.",
        "I think the opposition rightfully viewed those initial offers of reform as lacking credibility.",
        "And we have seen, as the uprising has unfolded and as the Syrian government has gone ahead and implemented some of what it calls reforms, that indeed the skepticism of the opposition was warranted.",
        "I think the question of how we move this regime toward negotiation comes back quite squarely to something that Anne-Marie said earlier, which is increasing the cost of loyalty to the regime on one hand among its core supporters and creating a level of threat and the possibility of defeat such that the Assad insiders themselves would begin to feel it necessary to begin to make an exit plan, to begin thinking about their own exit from a situation that they had accepted was no longer tenable.",
        "We're nowhere close to that.",
        "I tend to agree that force is one of the elements that will move us in that direction.",
        "But I tend to think that the kind of force that's likely to be more effective in doing that is internationally-backed support for those inside of Syria who are on the front lines of this struggle against the Assad regime.",
        "And I think that aspect, which is now gaining much more momentum through the Friends of Syria process in Istanbul over the last few days, together with the other elements of diplomacy, sanctions, international pressure, isolation against Syria, can combine to produce that - those conditions, those circumstances."

        "I do worry a little bit about the scenario that Anne-Marie mentioned, in which the failure of the Annan plan will persuade the Russians and the Chinese to get onboard with this kind of a trend, with this kind of diplomatic effort.",
        "My own sense is that we have to anticipate that they will not change their position and that we'll have to find ways to act without them, which tends to leave the U.N.",
        "something of a bystander as this continues to unfold.",
        "Rita, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Aaron David Miller, let me put to you: You've got a situation where the Syrian National Council says well, a ceasefire might not be such a bad thing.",
        "We need to rest.",
        "We need to recuperate.",
        "We need to rearm.",
        "You argue that the Syrian government thinks a ceasefire wouldn't be a bad thing because their troops need to rest and rearm.",
        "In the meantime, you have some opposition leaders inside Syria saying those outside Syria, the Syrian - they're sellouts.",
        "We need weapons now.",
        "This is precisely why what we're watching is a variation of the coyote-road runner cartoon.",
        "It's - I don't mean to trivialize, but you have, in the Assad regime, a group of people who are prepared to do just about anything to stay in power.",
        "They borrowed a line from Sam Adams, our Sam Adams in the 18th century: We have to hang together, or otherwise we're going to hang separately.",
        "I'm not sure that - the scenario Steve lays out I think will require a lot of time.",
        "And frankly, since diplomacy in my judgment will not work, unilateral American military intervention in my judgment would be a disaster, and there is no coalition of the willing capable of creating the kind of international coalition with political guarantees and an effective military response, we are left in - by default, in my view, and I think the Obama administration is quite prepared to accept this - with Steve's approach, which is incremental, long-term because otherwise, it seems to me, we're going to watch this movie play out for quite a long time to come.",
        "Well, I think that's what I said: We are incrementally moving toward actually intervening with some kind of force.",
        "And you can watch it.",
        "I agree completely with Aaron that I do not think these guys are going to get out.",
        "I think as long as there's any chance that they might, we have to keep pushing.",
        "But I agree with him that they have decided that they're going to do whatever it takes.",
        "They think they're winning.",
        "They're going to keep thinking they're winning unless they actually think there's a danger that they might be forcibly toppled, or at least some people do.",
        "So I think what you're seeing is that at each stage we move a little closer toward actually using force.",
        "This time, we said we would give them night-vision goggles and radio communications.",
        "And we're willing to let others arm them.",
        "When that doesn't work, it will take the next step, and people will start saying we have to create some safe zones.",
        "And beyond that, at some point people will say we have to stop Assad's tanks and mortars killing people within those zones.",
        "And that's where you're going to end up.",

        "Why don't we just put all sanctions in place right from the get-go?",
        "We did this with North Korea, Iran, in the past Iraq.",
        "Why do we incrementally do it?",
        "Why don't we just pull out all the stops?",

        "No.",
        "I think you're right, Neal.",

        "I think one of the reasons we do that is to try to calibrate a policy that will minimize the impact of sanctions on civilian populations and target the impact of sanctions on those actually responsible for violence.",
        "As we've come to appreciate more fully the resilience of the Assad regime and the determination that, I think, all of us on the line this afternoon recognize this regime has to do whatever it takes to stay in power.",
        "There has actually been quiet an extraordinary level of consensus among leading European powers, the U.S., Turkey and the members of the Arab League about the need for increasing sanctions.",
        "And if you were to look today at the scope of the sanctions in effect against Syria, I think it's actually becoming increasingly difficult to find new ones to apply.",

        "If we shut that door, perhaps it might make a difference.",
        "But I have to say that the scale of sanctions in effect right now is quite extraordinary, and it is having an effect.",
        "We should not look overlook that.",
        "The Syrian currency has plummeted against the dollar.",
        "There is an enormous impact on the Syrian economy from what we've done thus far.",
        "And it raises real questions about the sustainability of the regime and of its ability to continue this military campaign, which costs somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars a month."
