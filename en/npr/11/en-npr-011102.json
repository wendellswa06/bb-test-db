        "I wish we done that to send a message to the Assad regime that this has got to stop.",
        "The second thing is, if the Russians are in love with the Assad family so much, offer to put them up in a nice dacha on the Black Sea and have them removed from the country that way.",
        "A drone strike, of course, same problem as a blockade, it is an act of war.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think that's the problem with - and Anne-Marie is right.",
        "We are drifting ever closer to a set of incremental steps which will become a kind of combined military option.",
        "At someone point, however, there will - the proverbial tipping point will come.",
        "And someone is going to be asked to stand up, because these incremental steps, even if Steve is right, may not be enough.",
        "And in the end, it may well require a collective military response led by the United States or at least NATO to remove this regime.",
        "The problem and it's - as emotionally satisfying as it is, to send a couple of cruise missiles into the 4th Division headquarters, the problem with the caller's suggestion is that it will not bring down the regime.",
        "And the defiance of standing up to the United States will itself be a...",
        "Rallying cry.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's why it's, to some degree, a slippery slope.",
        "We either map out a strategy to do this with the international community in tow and a mandate to do it, or we're very hesitant about proceeding incrementally.",
        "And we're out of time, and there's so much more to talk about.",
        "And I guess we're going to have time to talk about it because it doesn't look like anything is going to happen soon.",
        "Steve Heydemann, thank you very much for your time today.",
        "Steve Heydemann of the Middle East - senior adviser for Middle East initiatives at the United States Institute of Peace with us by phone from The Hague, in the Netherlands.",
