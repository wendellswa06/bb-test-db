        "You know, another thing about Obama - go back to him one more time - is I do believe there's a faction or a great part of our American society that voted for him in 2008 because - the reason we're moving - the reason, I believe that we are moving forward is because there were people who voted for him and said, I think this guy - and I don't care if he's yellow or purple or green - I think this guy might be the guy that helps me put more money in my pocket.",
        "Because when you start - it can really concern - they voted for the person would appear that it seemed like, oh, my gosh, my life - who cares what color I am?",
        "I need my life to get better.",
        "I need my life to be more comfortable, and I think this person might be the person to do it.",

        "That gives Judge Koh the power, if she decides to, to increase the damages awarded by up to three times.",
        "So, this is a billion-dollar verdict that could end up being a three-billion-dollar verdict.",

        "For example, Apple said Samsung ripped off its technology, allowing a user to pinch the screen in order to zoom in and out on an image.",
        "The jury had to look at more than two dozen Samsung devices and determine if they infringed on any of several patents owned by Apple, and if so what the damages should be for each device.",
        "The jury agreed with Apple on most charges but did not accept every single one of the company's assertions.",

        "From the somewhat nuanced verdict, Stanford Law Professor Lemley concludes...",
