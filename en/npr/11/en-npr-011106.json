        "In a statement released last night, the South Korean company said in part: Today's verdict should not be viewed as a win for Apple, but as a loss for the American consumer.",

        "Here's why: While this verdict applies only to Samsung, other companies have also borrowed liberally from Apple.",
        "They're now on notice that if Apple sues them, they might well lose, so they had better change their products.",
        "Analyst Charles Golvin of Forrester Research cites as an example that pinch and zoom technology.",
        "This is something everyone knows how to do now, but all of Apple's competitors will have to figure out a way to let consumers do that zoom but do it in a different way.",
        "And that's going to be disruptive to those customers.",
