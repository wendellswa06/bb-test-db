        "Rob Scott is an economist with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
        "He's more than dubious of the skills gap.",
        "For instance, he says there's the argument that not enough people are getting college degrees.",
        "And yet, over the last decade we've seen an increase in number of college-educated workers and in fact, we've seen their wages fall so if there were really shortages of workers for highly skilled jobs - for jobs requiring college educations - you would see wages increase.",
        "Scott points out that there are three times as many people looking for work as there are jobs available and over the past few years, wages have only increased by about 2 percent annually, at best.",
        "Well, that's not evidence of a skills shortage.",

        "Those days are as far in the past as Studebaker.",
        "The kinds of companies that we're talking about, they employ people by the hundreds, not the tens of thousands.",
        "That's actually better from a diversification perspective, that's actually better from a risk perspective, but it means not one of those companies is really going to be at a scale where it makes sense for them, internally, to solve the skills gap.",
        "In order to grow business, Buttigieg says it's local communities that will have to solve this problem.",
