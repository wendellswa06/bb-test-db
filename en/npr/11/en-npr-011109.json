        "It caught us by complete surprise that they are actually up in the high plateau well before the Ice Age has started.",
        "About a million years before the Ice Age started, in fact.",
        "Wang, with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, thinks his discovery shows that at least some animals were prepared for the Ice Age.",
        "At least in the case of woolly rhino, it actually adapted itself in the cold environment in the Tibetan Plateau before the Ice Age has even started.",
        "Those adaptations included hairiness, of course, and a big body, which actually does well in cold weather.",
        "As you increase the volume of a body, say, what's inside the skin, the body's surface area doesn't increase as much.",
        "Less surface area per volume means you can retain heat better.",
        "And then that second, three-foot-long horn on the woolly rhino, it was wide and flat.",
        "The animal actually used it to sweep snow.",
        "Why sweep snow?",
        "So that they can get at the vegetation below the snow cover.",
        "Wang says he has Tibetan fossils of an ancient blue sheep - technically a goat but never mind - that eventually became another citizen of the Ice Age.",
        "So Wang thinks the Plateau was a sort of evolutionary cradle for cold weather animals.",
        "When the rest of the world eventually iced up, they moved out of Tibet and took over.",
        "Anthony Barnosky is a paleontologist at the University of California at Berkeley, and he says even now, these isolated cradles are important for evolution.",
        "The interesting thing is, on earth today, we have biodiversity isolated in certain spots, and you just never know which of those isolated places is going to be the cradle of evolution for the next big environmental change coming down the pike."

        "The Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League have done something remarkable.",
        "They've gone half of the current season, 24 games, without losing in regulation time.",
        "Here to talk about that feat and other hockey news is sportswriter Stefan Fatsis.",
        "Hey there, Stefan.",
        "Hey, Audie.",
        "So the Blackhawks are going for 25 tonight against the Colorado Avalanche in Denver, but I want to be clear because they're not undefeated, technically, right?",
        "I mean, this is not a winning streak.",
        "Correct.",
        "The Blackhawks have actually lost three games, but in the NHL, it's how you lose that matters.",
        "The league abolished ties in 2005, so if a game is tied after regulation, there's a five-minute overtime.",
        "And then if it's still tied, there's a shootout.",
        "The winner, by any means, gets three points in the standings, but an overtime or shootout loser still gets a point, which is known as a charity point or a loser point or a pity point.",
        "Chicago's three charity points all have come from shootouts, which means that the Blackhawks haven't lost when a bunch of guys are skating around trying to score.",
        "And that is amazing.",
        "So how have they pulled this off?",
        "Well, they've done it thanks to the revival of their young star Patrick Kane, who's got 27 points in the 24 games.",
        "They've also given up the fewest goals in the league and have great at killing penalties and they've eschewed the NHL's big hitting ethos.",
        "They rank near the bottom of the league in hits and penalties per game.",
        "Instead, Chicago's about skating and stick handling and as a result, they can be delightful to watch and very difficult to defend."

        "But fans have come back.",
        "People are watching on TV.",

        "There's also been some social media buzz, like a tweet the other day from NBA star Lebron James.",
        "He said, hey Chicago Blackhawks, you guys are awesome.",
        "Well, unfortunately I want to talk about a less feel-good NHL story because on Tuesday, a member of the New York Rangers was hit in the eye by a flying puck and this, I gather, has revived a debate about safety in the league.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The Rangers' defenseman Marc Staal, he was stuck by a ricochet slapshot that was probably traveling at, you know, 75 or 80 or 90 miles per hour.",
        "The issue here is that Staal wasn't wearing a protective visor attached to his helmet.",
        "The NHL players union has repeatedly rejected attempts by the league to make visors mandatory on the grounds that players should be able to choose what equipment they want to wear.",
        "All right.",

        "And it was, you know, Charlottesville and Dakota pipelines and Colin Kaepernick and the NFL and the police, and I was just thinking about all of that.",
        "It reminded me of what it was like when I was a kid and certain instances that I've had, you know, where people would come up to me with the Confederate flag and call me out of my name.",
        "And all the way up to last year, having a situation where I'm at my house and a neighbor comes up to me.",
        "And, you know, all is fine and well, and he asked me who lives here.",
