        "Well, I want to begin by saying that I'm not a luddite, and it's not that I don't like technology, but there really are so many things that are quite self-evident on the body if you only look and know how to examine a patient.",
        "And it seems to me a crying shame that we often subject people to expensive imaging when the body was telling us all along what was going on.",
        "And I think also, if you do a good physical, I find time and time again, I'm able to ask a better question of the CAT scan or the MRI, rather than what in the world is going on.",
        "I know the liver's enlarged, and I'm curious about the right lobe because I think there's something there.",
        "You know, it's a higher order of magnitude.",
        "And I think that's what patients deserve from us.",
        "You write that it also is a question of building trust?",
        "Well, you know, it's a strange thing.",
        "In the 20, 30 years that I've been practicing, I've become more convinced that a thorough physical in the context of a new patient or a patient at the hospital is a very symbolic act.",
        "I mean, if you think about it, here's someone telling you their deepest, darkest secrets and then disrobing and allowing touch - which, in any other context, would be assault.",
        "And I think that our skills have to be worthy of this very sacred ritual, and patients pick up at once when you're sloppy or you put your stethoscope on their nightgown.",
        "In fact, I spent time sort of collecting phrases people use to complain about us, and it's striking how often they say things like he or she never laid a hand on me.",
        "Huh.",
        "He or she never touched me.",
        "So even we - even if we, as physicians, have maybe, you know, think it's not that important - I can get the data this way or that way - clearly, to the patient, it's central.",
        "And I come to think of it as a way of taking their story and giving it body, in a sense.",
        "You're acknowledging and validating this complaint of theirs in the process of the examination.",
        "So how has it come about that, apparently, many doctors don't do the physicals anymore?",
        "Well, I think what's happened is the abundance of imaging.",
        "One of my colleagues here at Stanford, Alan Garber, used the phrase, you know, American health care is like a menu without prices - you know, filet mignon every night if you want it.",

        "And I don't think I or my residents really pause to think about how much does this test cost or that test cost.",
        "Somebody's paying for it.",
        "And I think that's brought about a sense of sloppiness about, you know, the cost of things, and more than that, a distrust of our own abilities.",
        "So I only (unintelligible) that in a hospital in America, if you show up missing a finger, no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan, MRI and orthopedic consult.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "You know, it's almost as though the skills of 150 years have atrophied when, in fact, they should be a hundredfold better because we now have ways of validating - well, this test is pretty useless and this physical diagnosis maneuver is actually pretty good.",
        "Well - and how accurate can a physical be?",
        "I mean, you know, I can understand saying, well - okay, maybe not if someone is missing fingers.",
        "But if you're looking at something internally and - why not go to the, you know, X-ray machine or the cam?",
        "How accurate is the physical for diagnosing things?",
        "I mean, I don't think one should make any pretentions about it being, you know, highly accurate.",
        "But the point is, you might not order the right test if you don't stumble onto something on the physical or in the history for that matter that might lead you to the correct thing.",
        "So I'm concerned, in America, that we have become obsessed about a certain kind of medical error, you know, the wrong limb getting operated on, the wrong medication.",
        "But there's a whole other kind of error that we're not beginning to compute or to capture and that is someone has a story to tell you that would immediately point to the diagnosis.",
        "But in your haste to get on with things, you miss it.",
        "Or more importantly, someone has a finding on their body, for example, tenderness when you palpate the abdomen...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...that shouldn't be there that should lead to the order of the correct image.",
        "I don't think the solution is, you know, run everybody through a giant machine no matter what their complaint is.",
        "But the physical often leads you to things - you know, to tie in with your previous session, you might find a breast lump in someone who has come to you for something else.",
        "And that might be the moment of discovery that could lead you down the right path.",
        "And my nightmare is that someone is going to come through my office with a diagnosable, treatable condition that I missed from sloppy technique.",
