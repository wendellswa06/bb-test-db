        "The house was packed, and tickets sold out almost as soon as the show was announced.",
        "Groucho had been out of the spotlight for many years.",
        "He decided, though, to do a limited tour of his one-man show, and the Carnegie Hall show became one of the most important on that tour because it was also the first and only time that Groucho played Carnegie Hall.",
        "Now, another legend, talk show host Dick Cavett, was one of Groucho Marx's friends, and he introduced Groucho that night.",
        "Cavett was nervous before the show began.",
        "He was worried that Groucho was too old and frail to perform.",
        "And despite the ticket sales, he also worried that maybe nobody would show up.",
        "But then, just as he was pulling up to Carnegie Hall, Dick Cavett saw a big mob full of young people..."
