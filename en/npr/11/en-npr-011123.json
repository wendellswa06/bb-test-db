        "Jim, obviously, the economy was a big story this year, but it's still unclear, at least to me, what exactly is meant by the economic crisis.",
        "A year ago, essentially, the economic crisis was everything.",
        "The financial markets were down, corporations were failing, the housing implosion was going on, and of course, unemployment was on its way up.",
        "And now it's striking how the economic crisis mainly means unemployment with the sort of corollary issue of the housing markets, where financial markets are up, corporations are having big profits.",
        "And so, the kind of all fronts sort of depression era feared, many people had in late 2008 and much of 2009, that for many people has been buffered and contained, and we're left with this very, very significant problem of chronic, very high unemployment for, you know, almost 10 percent of the public.",
        "For better or for worse, it concentrates our minds on unemployment as being the economic crisis, you know, as we look ahead.",

        "And I was in the modestly optimistic camp talking about how in my aviation life, you know, tablet devices had proven to be useful there.",
        "So who knows?",
