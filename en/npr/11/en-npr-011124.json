        "The Supreme Court has said the Constitution does not allow limits on how much a candidate can spend of his own money.",
        "So, if you are running against a wealthy candidate, the millionaire's provision allows you to raise money from individual contributors in larger chunks than normally permitted.",
        "NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has the story.",
        "The stated purpose of the millionaire's amendment is to prevent a regular candidate whose contributions are capped by law from being drowned out by a wealthy candidate who could spend unlimited amounts of his own money.",

        "There's no restriction on what a wealthy candidate can spend, said Roberts; he can spend much money as he wants.",
