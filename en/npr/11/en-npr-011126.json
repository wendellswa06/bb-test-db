        "It was just absolutely gut wrenching to see.",
        "And when you watch a race, your eyes capture the flow the race and you know instantly when that flow is interrupted that something bad has happened.",
        "And when it does in the home stretch like that in front of almost 120,000 people, it's even worse.",
        "From a personal viewpoint, there was a foreboding feeling when Barbaro broke through the gate before the start of the race, because you don't usually see that.",
        "And I was watching on the big screen from the infield, and one moment Barbaro was in a great position, and the next he was gone.",
        "So I turned around to see what happened and there he was on the track.",
        "And I could see him standing there with his right back leg just dangling, as if it was nearly detached from the rest of the leg.",
        "At first there was stunned silence, something that's - it almost like it was surreal, as if it's not happening.",
        "And then the mood changed abruptly when they brought out the ambulance and set up the screen shielding the horse from the crowd, because that usually is a sign that they're going to euthanize the horse.",
        "Well, let me ask about that, Mr. Haskin.",
        "I want to clarify that term, life threatening, because in the case of a horse, doesn't that mean that the owner might make the decision to put him to sleep?",
        "Well, the owner usually does make the decision, and it depends on insurance.",
        "But the owner is not going to put this horse to sleep unless he has to put this horse to sleep, because they have already invested tens and tens of thousands of dollars just for the surgery alone, and then there is the recuperative care.",
        "So there is no problem at all as far as keeping this horse alive monetarily."

        "Well, yes, basically.",
