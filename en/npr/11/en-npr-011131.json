        "(Through Translator) It is very, very different from a restaurant.",
        "In the restaurant, there's no employment security, no benefits.",
        "But here at Wal-Mart, there was employment security, there was medical insurance.",
        "There was a pension fund.",
        "They also give you a 10 percent discount on all the goods you buy in the store.",
        "There were holidays.",

        "Well, we all expect those people who are the brash, larger-than-life people to be the big success stories, because that's what we're told we're supposed to do.",
        "I mean, if you want to get a job, you're supposed to go in there and sell yourself and be the best thing they've ever seen or heard from.",
        "And yet, what this research shows is that as time goes on, it's the introverts who really perform better.",
        "Let's take just a minute to define our terms a little bit, your definitions for introvert and extrovert.",
        "Well, I think one of the things we do need to clear up is this study talks about neurotics, and it talks about introverts and extroverts.",
        "And, you know, an introvert or an extrovert is more about the person's personality, while being neurotic is a measure of their emotional stability or lack thereof, but you can be neurotic and introverted.",
        "And introverted people are often known for being very deliberative with what they say and do.",
        "They don't like to speak out, maybe, in meetings.",
        "They like a longer time to think about their answers and give them.",
        "Neurotic people are often anxious and afraid what other people are going to say about them.",
        "They're always afraid they're being judged harshly.",
        "So those are some of the things you need to think about when you talk about these terms.",
        "And an extrovert is what?",
        "Well, an extrovert, I think we all know those people.",
        "Those are the salespeople, the ones who make the big deals.",
        "They are energized by being around people.",
        "They're energized by talking and interacting with people.",
        "You'll see them, you know, they're the big networkers.",
        "They're out there sticking their hands out, saying hey.",
        "They aren't afraid to walk up to a complete stranger and introduce themselves and get a conversation going.",
        "So what you say in your column, which is quite interesting, is that it behooves the boss to, in a way, work with the introvert to bring out the introvert's talents and contributions and personality and to rein in the extrovert.",
        "I'm interested to go first to the second part of that.",
        "You just made the case for why extroverts are supposed to do so well.",
        "So why would a boss want to rein that in?",
        "Well, this particular study deals with a team setting.",
        "And what happens is with extroverts, what they've found in this study is that they often are not as collaborative.",
        "They don't listen as well.",
        "They kind of want to be out there, you know, seeing and doing everything and are not willing to stay and get the work done.",
        "So, say on a Friday night, you need somebody to stay till 10 or 11 o'clock and finish up a project, that's much more likely to be the neurotic than it is to be the extrovert who's probably out with his or her friends having a good time at a bar somewhere.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So you're saying, in a sense, that the extrovert sells a bill of goods, perhaps, and doesn't quite live up to it?"

        "Have you felt that in terms of selling yourself and getting attention and promoted and heard, that being an introvert went the other way for you ever?",

        "I would often attend these meetings with her whereas I found her to be - especially when networking with other hotels and hotel management companies, oftentimes, instead of just selling our property and the benefits of what we had to offer, a lot of times she was more or less selling her own career history, such as, for example, her resume to try to move herself ahead rather than move the property ahead.",
