        "The best way to communicate with someone is to start where they are and walk - slowly walk them home.",
        "So, look, I understand you're upset.",
        "I understand this happened, and you have to encourage full disclosure, and then a way that you can work out of the thing together.",
        "And accusations, though cathartic, are not helpful.",
        "A full understanding and a full disclosure and a full discussion is.",
        "So you have to get past the anger part first, and deal with the communication part.",
        "What do you think will strengthen marriages during tough times?",
        "Because we've been talking in the context of people who might be having troubles, interpersonal troubles as well as financial troubles.",
        "But what if there's a couple that's really tight, but their finances are also really tight?",
        "What are some things you might suggest for them?",
        "You first have to have the conversation, and you have to figure out what money means to each party.",

        "Others see it as power and control or status.",
        "Some people medicate themselves by shopping.",
        "So you've got to identify what kind of financial personality that you have.",
        "Then you have to identify the numbers.",
        "How much we have, how much we owe, how much we need to live.",
        "Then we've got - then you've got to decide what you're going to do, make a plan, make a budget and stick to it.",
        "And then, once you've done that, address the emotional needs for money that other people have.",
        "Like you medicate with shopping, or you do this for status.",
        "We can't do that now, let's find other avenues of pleasure that might substitute for that good feeling you get when you buy the new hat, or instead of getting the car.",
        "And dealing with both levels, but having the conversation, having a plan, a pen and paper, can do so much for a marriage, if it's used soon and well."

        "Some of them were evacuating their families to the convention because - well, hey, this is as safe a place as any.",
