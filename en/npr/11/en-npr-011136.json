        "Well you know, he brought up an interesting point that I was going to ask you about anyway, and it's this.",
        "Remembering to the convention last week, which you covered in Denver so well, the Republicans were very aggressive during the Democratic Convention, very present.",
        "But because of the hurricane and the situation now, it appears as if the Democrats cannot afford to return the favor and can't really become too aggressively partisan at this time.",
        "Can they?",
        "It doesn't appear that way.",
        "And it's really an all bets are off situation.",
        "Because on the one hand, some people argue, it makes Senator McCain look very presidential to essentially be on some level managing a crisis, or at least the Republican Party's response to a crisis in this kind of co-piloting role with the administration that's already in.",
        "On the other hand, as you heard from Ron, they're not going to get the media bounce.",
        "There have been many stories about how the big news television anchors have all gone down to the storm, and they've left this area.",
        "And then in terms of speaking, you know, one of the refrains from the Republican Party and the convention planners is, you know, we're beyond politics, this about America, this is not about the party.",
        "And so if the Republican Party is taking a non-partisan approach to how it frames this issue, then the Democrats it seems are not going to go partisan, because that's not really the framing around this right now.",
        "One of the things - you mentioned that McCain wasn't down there, but we understand that he, Farai, is in Mississippi, and that Barack Obama has returned to Chicago, where he has said that his party is willing and able to make volunteers available and to try to raise money if necessary.",
        "Here's a question I have for you about being in St. Paul without a convention to cover in terms of the way we anticipated, that convention having a full day's schedule.",
        "What do you do?",
        "What will the delegates do with all of this extra time that they have?",
        "Well, you know, it really depends on what delegates.",
        "Again, at this briefing today, there's now an effected states center inside the convention center.",
        "People who are from gulf states that are effected can go there and get help and really be in touch with their families.",
        "So if you're from the gulf, you may be taking care of business at home remotely.",
        "If you're from other parts, I mean there is any number of things to do in this fine city, like art centers and so on and so on.",
        "I think that people are, despite the gravity of the situation, trying to enjoy this city, even if they don't have the same agenda that they once had.",
        "Really briefly, we're going to be talking about the role of women in partisan politics, particularly as it relates to Sarah Palin, later in the program.",
        "But before we let you go, are you hearing her name much, and what are you hearing people say about her?",
        "Is there a buzz there for her?",
        "Women love here.",
        "The female Republican delegates and visitors absolutely adore her.",
        "Now of course, this is before we got the statement this morning from the Palin family that their 17-year-old daughter was pregnant, and I do think there are going to be questions about racial parity.",
        "If it was a pregnant 17-year-old black girl who was the daughter of a political figure, would you have the same sort of warm fuzzies about her being someone who is going to keep the child and plans to marry the father?",
        "I think that that debate is going to get increasingly heated over the week.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you very much, N - Farai.",

        "And this judge's ruling seems to uphold a familiar complaint from intern advocates, that many companies hire them to do menial labor - answer phones, take out the garbage, fetch coffee - otherwise, they'd have to actually pay somebody to do.",

        "You know, how do you know, you know, is it 51 percent benefiting one and 49 percent benefiting the other?",
