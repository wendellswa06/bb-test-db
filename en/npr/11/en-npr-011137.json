        "That's the idea.",
        "That's the intent, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it both eliminates the science and also is provocative with the science.",

        "I mean, to have a production company that specializes in science and the arts - as someone who has been covering science for over 30 years, you don't find - I haven't found many places that say we're going after that audience.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, Max and I, my partner and I, had this idea seven years ago when we wrote a song together and submitted it to the American Living Room Series at here.",
        "And it was accepted, and we said oh, we better write a show around that.",
        "We ended up writing a show about the four elements: earth, air, fire and water.",
        "And it sort of had sparked in us this inspiration.",
        "Science sort of became a muse for us.",
        "And everything else sort of followed from there to the point where, really, for us, it's about explaining the universe of science, explaining that body of knowledge to the public, in a way that as this poetry and science does with \"\"Seachange\"\", in a way that can emotionally connect to the audience.",
        "I think people would think that you have - they would have trouble or you would have trouble getting an audience for a science-themed theater or even readings and performances.",
        "I think if you have a strong enough piece, you can find an audience for it.",
        "And certainly, our audience right now tend to be people who are already interested in science, but that is changing.",
        "One of our shows - \"\"Galileo: The Emotional Life of a Spacecraft\"\" - was actually a rock opera about the Galileo mission to Jupiter sung from the point of view of the spacecraft.",
        "And it was quirky enough, and it was a rock opera.",
        "There was wonderful media elements.",
        "So it brought in a sort of different contingent of people, and it was - hopefully inspired them to see more shows about science."

        "And after a while, we've - when the performances that Roger and I are giving around the country, (unintelligible) in various places - it became clear to me that that's what was needed.",
        "We needed to the tools.",
        "So I self-published a little book with a friend, like a child's alphabet.",
        "And then Chelsea Green, who are one of the biggest publishers of sustainable books in America, happened to be in the next town to us in Vermont, and they picked it up.",
