        "And, you know, we had a wonderful example that's just absolutely terrific, which involved the Ford Motor Company, and then Ford began to crumble and collapse.",
        "So that didn't seem like such a good example and we had to modify that slightly, but there are happier occasions.",
        "Oh, we introduce green roofs, too.",
        "I mean, we - in a big way because I suddenly got passions about green roofs.",

        "But for exactly that reason - because in my book I have a whole section on what young people are doing.",

        "But it is certainly true that for me my passion is now the environmental work that I am doing with Roger.",
