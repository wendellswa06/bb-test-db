        "The people who would know where he is, or where he's gone to, wouldn't disclose any details.",
        "In England there are very strict rules--I suppose it's the same in America--there are strict rules regarding the confidentiality of patients, and that's what makes it so difficult to get to the bottom of a lot of this story.",
        "Well, presumably some dogged reporters will follow him back to wherever he's going and try to find out who he is.",
        "It's more than possible.",
        "Maybe we haven't heard the last of this by any means, if somebody sort of comes forward and suggests who he is, or somebody traces him and so on.",
        "There's such a large media here, especially with the national newspapers, who've probably got the resources to let their reporters work on these stories for days.",

        "And that's the only real way, I think, to justify the 9/11 fund - from the perspective of the American people, not from the perspective of the victims.",
        "Yet you also point out the purpose of that compensation - not just to demonstrate those things, which is true enough, but to avoid lawsuits.",
        "That's right.",
        "Congress was warned by the airline industry that if you don't do something, if you don't think out of the box and create a special program to compensate the victims, we will be inundated with lawsuits against the World Trade Center, the airlines, the airline manufacturer.",
        "And it doesn't matter whether we can win those suits or not.",
        "The mere fact that we're sued on the front pages all over the world will chill people from flying, passengers, and that will be the end of the airline industry.",
        "So there was a very practical purpose as well.",
        "And in the end, the amounts paid out averaged about $2 million for those who were killed, to the families of those who were killed, yet because Congress stipulated in the law it passed that you had to use tort law, this was in fact - in an attempt to prevent lawsuits - there was that problem you faced as the administrator of the fund, the overseer, of, well, the accountant makes - gets more in compensation that then hero firefighter or indeed the waiter at the Windows on the World.",
