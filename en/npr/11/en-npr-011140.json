        "They might have got those diseases in any event.",
        "So we had to figure out what is a good formula to be used in distributing the money, and a very creative, brilliant judge, Jack Weinstein in the Eastern District of Brooklyn - Brooklyn, New York - we worked out this formula by asking the Vietnam veterans themselves: How would you like to see the money distributed?",
        "And a lot of people expected people to come up and say send me a big check.",
        "And nobody did that.",

        "Let them do - who are you to tell them how the money will be directed?",
        "And the university wisely came around to that way of thinking, the money was distributed, and there were only two lawsuits, only two that arose out of the entire Virginia Tech murders.",
        "Because, I think, in part you concluded people thought the process was fair and got the chance to speak directly to the person administering the fund and vent their concerns and indeed remember their loved ones.",
