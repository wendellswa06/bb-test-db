        "Congress was concerned that if mental trauma was eligible, you might get five million people who watched it on CNN or listened on NPR calling in saying I was listening to Neal on Talk of the Town, some of these stories, Neal, I can't get out of bed as a result of Talk of the Town, so pay me.",
        "Congress carved out any mental anguish or mental injury.",

        "How do you compensate them?",
        "There we did compensate, but we made some rules because we only had a limited amount of money.",
        "If you want to recover a check compensation for mental anguish, you have to have been a student in the Norris Hall classrooms where everybody else was killed and murdered.",
        "If you - one young student came to see me, the only reason I escaped, Mr. Feinberg, is the student to my left was shot dead in front of me, the student to my right was shot dead in front of me.",

        "So I put an extensive case together, a three-ring binder, four-inch thick with photos and testimony and documentation, and I went to an attorney, and I said: I am not going to hire you to take my case if this goes to court, but I want you to tell me what you think my injuries are worth.",
        "And he listened to my story, told me $150,000 is what a court would likely give you.",
        "And so I - ultimately, I ended up settling with the oil company, the oil change company, the insurance company for $110,000, which is about a third less than what he told me, which he would have taken in attorney's fee to go to court.",
        "So I was very happy with the process.",

        "Which, Kenneth Feinberg, as you point out in the book, these kinds of decisions are made in dozens of places across the country every single day of the week.",

        "When the financial system was polluted by the banks and the lack of government control, not only was there no compensation, but many of us, like me, are paying the polluter through bankruptcy to compensate them for their loss.",
        "So, no, it is not fair.",
        "Nobody ever said it was fair.",
        "One word that is never used in the work that I do is fair.",
