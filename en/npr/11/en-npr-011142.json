        "Earlier this week, President Trump said Republicans should, quote-unquote, \"\"stop wasting their time\"\" trying to pass an immigration bill until after the midterms.",
        "Do you agree with that?",
        "Well, it's never a waste of time to try to bring parties together to look for a solution.",
        "But the president was recognizing how difficult this is in election year.",
        "But let's keep working for a solution.",
        "Congress has to address this because this really illustrates the challenge.",
        "You've got a president who's trying to get to a good solution where we're not simply having porous borders.",
        "And Congress is the one that has to really, one, devote money to build a more secure border, put the administrative law judges there.",
        "They're needed to process these cases.",
        "And then to look for a solution long term so that we can address those that are here - those children that we all are concerned about - we need to address that as the president has tried to do in the past.",
        "So this is a political question, but, you know, politics is the means by which government happens.",
        "This week, the longtime columnist George Will made a case in The Washington Post for voting against the Republican Party in the midterms.",
        "He said that Republicans have abdicated their constitutional responsibility as well as their moral authority.",
        "He's not the only one.",
        "Steve Schmidt, who's also a significant player - I mean, he ran John McCain's presidential campaign - has said essentially the same thing.",
        "I presume you disagree.",
        "I mean, how do you respond to that?",
        "These are not just kind of fringe players.",
        "These are people who've been significant conservative voices and have played significant roles.",
        "What do you say to that?",
        "Well, I presume that the most recent concern is the handling of this crisis along the border.",
        "Well, disagree with that policy and try to move it and express yourselves.",
        "It makes a difference because the president changed the policy last week.",
        "But to say you ought to change the course of America in terms of our courts and deregulation and lower taxes makes no sense to me whatsoever.",
        "That's the governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson.",

        "Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo used another term to describe the shooter.",

        "I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.",
        "A demented individual, a psychopath - these might seem like perfectly accurate ways to describe the 64-year-old Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock, but new social science research suggests we don't reach for those terms for all shooters.",
        "To understand more, we are joined by NPR social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam Hi, Shankar.",
        "Hello, Rachel.",
        "What does this new research say?",
        "It's ongoing work by the psychologist Azim Shariff for the University of California at Irvine.",
        "Along with Brett Mercier and Adam Norris, Shariff has run experiments with several hundred volunteers.",
        "So he gives them accounts of different kinds of mass shooting events with different kinds of perpetrators.",
        "These are hypothetical events, Rachel, and he asked volunteers to judge if a shooter suffered from a mental disorder.",
        "Shariff says that the terms we use are often shaped by our own attitudes, especially if the shooter is Muslim.",
        "For people high in anti-Muslim prejudice, people are very unlikely to perceive the Muslim shooter to be mentally ill.",
        "But people are completely comfortable in saying that the Christian shooter was mentally ill.",
        "So that's interesting because when you describe someone as being mentally ill, embedded in that is a sense of helplessness, right?",
        "Like, they're crazy.",
        "We can't do anything about it."

        "That's right.",
        "And of course, in the criminal justice system, having a mental illness can sometimes be exculpatory.",
        "We say that people shouldn't be held responsible because they're ill.",
        "Shariff and his colleagues also think that the terms we reach for have something to do with our own desire to distance ourselves from people who do terrible things.",
        "If you're a Christian or if you're an American and there's an American or a Christian or whomever does something, if you can paint them as aberrant, that means that now you have a different explanation for why they'd be a shooter.",
        "It does not reflect upon your group at all.",
        "So it would have nothing to do with one's race, ethnicity or religion.",
        "It would be this exception, this exception to the norm.",
        "Precisely.",
        "So at the same time, I think reasonable people can argue that anybody who opens fire or you know kills a lot of people is to some degree mentally ill.",
        "I think that's absolutely right, Rachel.",
        "In fact, given that we diagnose disorders like psychopathy by observing people's willingness to do terrible things, it's reasonable to say that Stephen Paddock's behavior seems psychopathic.",
        "Shariff thinks that one problem with the way we reach for these terms might be that we don't do it often enough.",
        "In fact, as many as 40 percent of lone wolf shooters may indeed have a mental illness.",
        "If we use such terms for all perpetrators, he thinks it might help us reduce the risk posed to us by emotionally troubled individuals.",
        "If part of what's causing these problems, these mass shootings, that are actually on the increase is mental illness and we're not taking that seriously because we have this inborn prejudice against a certain group, then we're less likely to solve these issues.",
        "You know, Rachel, the research is not saying that we are wrong to reach for psychological terminology when it comes to mass shooters.",
        "All that it's saying is that we use such language inconsistently and that our choices might sometimes be shaped by our own hidden biases.",

        "Yes, the kind of seminal document decision about interns is actually from a 1947 U.S.",
        "Supreme Court case.",
        "That's really the last time the Supreme Court really got involved in trainees.",
        "And it was some people working for the railroad, learning how to do railroad work.",
        "And it was very much a typical vocational trainee situation where in many ways, you know, the railroad wasn't benefiting at all."

        "These aren't people doing work that is to the advantage of the railroad.",
        "And so they're trainees, and they don't have to be paid.",
        "And the Department of Labor kind of has taken that ruling and set up these six criteria and said these are the six criteria, which in their view the Supreme Court would require that employers meet if they're not going to pay their interns.",
        "And those criteria are pretty hard to meet.",
        "They set a pretty high bar.",
        "And if you look at the ruling, though, it says they violated the minimum wage and overtime rules.",
        "Does that suggest that this also might apply to paid internships if they're not making minimum wage, and they're not getting overtime?",
        "So there's an - another reason why last week's decision is getting so much attention is right in its wake two other prominent companies were sued under the same theory.",
        "You know, Conde Nast, the very prestigious publishing house, you know, which publishes the New Yorker; and Warner Music, another prestigious music house, they were sued.",
        "And at Conde Nast, you know, Conde Nast in ways tried to get on the right side of things after the initial wave of interest in unpaid internships a few years ago.",
        "It announced it was going to start paying its interns $550 a semester.",
        "So it could say our interns are not, you know, unpaid.",
        "We pay them.",
        "But nonetheless, these two interns sued Conde Nast - one who worked for the New Yorker, one who worked for W magazine - saying, you know, I worked 100, 200, 300 hours during the semester, and even while receiving $550 during the semester, that did not meet the $7.25 an hour requirement of the minimum wage.",

        "But on the negative side, you know, I was an unpaid intern, which quite a few of us were a little unhappy about, and we got college credit through the University of Houston, but we did have to pay for our course, which was an internship agreement between U of H and the Houston Chronicle.",
