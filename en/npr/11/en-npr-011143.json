        "Well, the question really is: Does this mean the end of unpaid internships?",
        "And if an intern or a worker appears to understand what the situation is and has agreed to provide the services without being paid, does that make a difference?",
        "Those are a lot of the questions that I'm getting, and I think it's really important for employers to understand that an employee or a worker who provides services to them cannot waive their rights under, either federal or state, minimum wage and overtime laws.",
        "And so what we've been looking at is the issue of is the program that you are having the worker provide services under one that's a bona fide training or internship program?",
        "In effect, what the law says, and Steve has described it very well, is that if the primary benefit of the program is to really provide training opportunities, as opposed to compensation to the worker, that it may satisfy the federal and state laws regarding not having to pay someone minimum wage.",
        "But it's very few and far between, in terms of internships that are unpaid, that actually satisfy those rules for for-profit companies.",
        "So many of them are saying what should we do in terms of analyzing our programs, and some of them are looking to decide, given the types of work that we're giving these workers, maybe it is work that's very similar to work that we give to our regular employees - or they're displacing our regular employees - we may need to determine to, at least, pay these workers in compliance with the minimum wage and overtime laws because there's too much risk attached to whether or not there's sufficient benefit being given to the workers.",
        "And our previous caller, his job sounded a lot like cub reporter, which people used to get paid for - not much - but used to get paid for.",
        "If they're going to have to pay minimum wage or maybe a little more for this same kind of work, they're clearly going to have fewer people, young people, around.",
        "I mean, how did you decide to combine this giddiness and anger with this really almost prissy format?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, that's just who I am.",
        "(As Joker) Why so serious?",
        "That's correct, and there will be fewer internship opportunities available to students.",
        "That's the really - the rub in terms of the issue.",
        "But it absolutely is important for employers to understand that internship programs that comply with the federal law in terms of being unpaid have to be programs that provide robust training opportunities, training meetings, a situation where the employer is really providing a significant amount of mentoring so that even if the cub reporter is providing an article that may even be able to be used, for example, in the newspaper, it has to be the case that the benefit of using that article is almost outweighed by the amount of time and editing and coaching that is provided to that worker in the context of them learning the skills to be able to write that article.",
        "And of course that mentoring and that editing, that takes time and money, too.",
        "If you're an employer, are you changing your intern policy?",
        "And if you've applied for an internship this summer, what do you hope to get out of it?",

        "Today we're talking about unpaid internships.",
        "A federal judge ruled recently that Fox Searchlight violated minimum wage laws for not paying two interns, which calls into question this country's long tradition of hiring students to work for for-profit companies without pay.",
        "According to the Department of Labor, nonprofits like NPR can generally make use of unpaid interns who, quote, volunteer their time.",
        "But here, interns earn a stipend of about $350 a week and have for the last two years.",
        "It's an initiative describe by the head of talent acquisition as a way to broaden the candidate pool to a wider audience, not just those with the means to take an unpaid internship.",
        "So if you're an employer, have you changed your intern policy?",

        "Steven Greenhouse, labor and workplace correspondent for The New York Times; and Camille Olson, attorney at Seyfarth Shaw.",
        "And Steve Greenhouse, as we look ahead, roughly half of internships are paid, and half are unpaid?",
        "Yes, my sense - I'm told from some studies that there are more than a million internships a year, and according to a survey by the National Association of College and Employers, about 47 percent of them are unpaid.",
        "And, you know, there's a new article I read in The Atlantic saying that people who - members of the class of 2013 of this year's college crop who had paid internships had a much better likelihood of getting jobs, you know, 63 percent of getting a job offer, compared to just 37 percent for students who had unpaid internships.",
        "And I think a lot of employers are, you know, as Camille was saying, are going to have to rethink whether they want to kind of stick their necks out and continue using unpaid internships and perhaps risk being sued, being hit by a court, or whether they will, you know, pay the $7.25 an hour to make sure that they're good with the law.",
        "My sense is, you know, according to the Supreme Court decision back in 1947 about training internships, it kind of said the whole internship program almost has to be - almost use the word charitable, you know, kind of an industry effort to, you know, to train people so they're better prepared to work in the industry some day, not specifically to help your company but to help, you know, railroad employers or newspaper employers or publishing employees.",
        "And that's why there's that weird line saying that the internship should not be for the immediate advantage of the company.",
        "Now a lot of companies say that's kind of absurd; of course, you know, we're not going to do an internship, at least we get at least some advantage or else why bother.",
        "So, you know, there's this tension between what the Department of Labor's rules say, what the 1947 Supreme Court said, and what employees say makes common sense.",
        "They're saying there are gazillions of kids who want these unpaid internships, and yes, we the company, you know, gain some advantage from it, and if you require that we pay all these interns, we're going to have far fewer of them, and that's going to hurt all these kids who are dying for - you know, to get their foot in the door and to get some basic training."

        "Camille Olson, why bother?",

        "Yes, you know, as David, the first caller, said, Neal, you know, there's this I think - you know, to David, to David's point of view, it's kind of absurd that he probably had to pay $500, $1,000, $2,000 for course credit to do the internship.",

        "Yes, I learned some stuff from the newspaper, but, you know, I ended up, you know, ended up losing a few thousand dollars.",
        "You know, something else that's going on, Neal, is that some schools, realizing that some of these unpaid internships are very valuable, they're giving their students, you know, summer stipends of $2,000, $3,000 to enable them to work in summer internships, which are going to be unpaid.",
        "One frequent criticism of unpaid internships is that only people with rich mommies and daddies can afford to do that.",
