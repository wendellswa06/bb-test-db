        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "All right, Alex, thanks very much, good luck with that.",
        "Hey, thank you.",
        "Camille Olson, I wanted to bring you in here.",
        "This is - again, a lot of the time, people say they're willing to - I'd do anything to learn the tricks of the trade in the kitchen, and if it's unpaid, that's the system.",
        "If everybody is unpaid, that's the way it works.",
        "Six months later, they may not feel the same way.",
        "You're absolutely right, and again, you know, I have to go back to sort of a fundamental philosophy of both federal and state law, which is an employee or a person can't waive their rights.",
        "So the fact that somebody would walk in and say I understand it's unpaid, and I'll take whatever you give me in terms of the work because I want this on my resume, and I want to make some contacts in this industry is not a sufficient basis for an employer to say they knew it, they even signed an agreement saying they understood it was going to be that way.",
        "It is incumbent on the companies and the employers to ensure that they're setting up bona fide training and vocational-based internship programs that really are being set up for the benefit of the worker, as opposed to the company.",
        "Here's an email from Dustin(ph) in Deadwood, South Dakota: I'm a 33-year-old business owner, so not far removed from my own intern days.",
        "Although unpaid interns are pretty common in the ad industry, we've always compensated our interns with either a stipend or an hourly wage.",
        "However, we haven't offered many internships lately.",
        "It takes a good deal of our resources to train them, and many of them leave the area after graduation for larger urban areas that doesn't leave much incentive for our firm.",
        "And, again, Camille Olson, if you're going to have an unpaid internship program, you have to spend money to train those people.",
        "You do have to spend money to train those people in addition to your own managers and supervisors who are working with them because you want to make sure that, you know, on a case-by-case basis, someone who you've assigned as a mentor to that intern is somebody who understands what their role is and their responsibilities are.",
        "It's not just extra help for the summer.",
        "It's someone who you are saying you're not paying them, but you're going to be investing in them in connection with their learning opportunities.",
        "And it's not someone that you should be looking at as someone who's an extra hand to do the work.",
        "If that's the focus, you've got to make sure that you're paying them at least minimum wage."

        "I guess, for me, I think it's unfortunate for the students because we hear all the time that they prefer to work for a smaller firm like ours because they're working oftentimes directly with the owners, and we certainly try and be as educational as possible.",
        "I walk them through the steps of everything I'm doing, whether it's a menial task like writing a purchase order or, you know, ringing somebody out and make sure that they know exactly what we're doing.",
        "I think that they're more likely, especially the kids that are going into the field that we're in like retail, if they want to do brick-and-mortar, they're going to get more out of working with a company like ours than they are out of a larger company because we're...",
        "But are you now - are you rethinking it now?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, it's unfortunate because with us, we sort of have the sink or swim mentality.",
        "And so I'm more likely to bring a kid in, see what they're good at and help them hone those skills as they relate to my business, but definitely help them think about what they're good at and get better at it.",
        "We don't have the resources to develop a program, and so it's harder for me to answer those more ethereal questions if any sort of legal action were to occur.",
        "If somebody came in and said, well, you have been selecting brands, and that's the job of a buyer, so you are, in effect, you know, moving this job that would be paid to somebody else when what I'm saying is I think this kid's got a really good eye, and I want to help him develop that eye."

        "Ben Bernanke, the chairman of Fed, said maybe down to six-and-a-half percent unemployment by this time next year.",

        "He wrote that between 1993 and 2008, a 15-year period, 52 percent of the nation's income gains went to just the top one percent of Americans.",
        "And, you know, the top one percent now have 21, 22, 23 percent of all income, you know, which is more than double what it was in the 1980s.",
        "And you know, at the same time, people in the bottom, you know, 30, 40, 50 percent, their incomes have really stagnated.",
        "You know, household income is down from where it was 12 years ago.",
        "I think this is probably first time since the 1930s when household income has actually declined over more than a decade, and that's causing many Americans and their children to start questioning, what is the American dream?",

        "You know, I think some people are even questioning, is it worth going to college?",

        "Others are saying, you're crazy not to go to college.",
        "That's certainly the best way to secure your future economic advancement in this increasingly complicated, technological, globalized world.",
        "So things are getting better, but as, you know, Ben Bernanke said today, they're still not where many of us would like them to be.",
