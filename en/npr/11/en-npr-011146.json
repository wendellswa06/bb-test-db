        "I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "Since April 18th, there have been 54 shootings in the city of Chicago.",
        "Fifteen people have died.",
        "Many of the murders were gang related.",
        "Nineteen of the shootings happened on one night.",
        "So what's the cause, and how can Chicago stop the flow of blood in the streets?",
        "In a few minutes, we'll talk to two anti-violence advocates about their work in the city.",
        "But first, Dawn Turner-Trice, she's a columnist for the Chicago Tribune.",
        "And thank you for coming on.",
        "Hello, Farai.",
        "So what are the reasons behind the surge of violence?",
        "Well, one of the reasons is that in Chicago, versus other big cities around the country, there's something that happens when the weather starts to get warmer.",
        "You have these knuckleheads who are coming out of the woodwork.",
        "And they just start to, really, scuffle for turf.",
        "We've got some public housing issues going on here: Our plan for transformation, in which we had some gang boundaries inadvertently moved around as people were moved out of the housing projects.",
        "And so that's another reason.",
        "We're still trying to deal with that, trying to figure out where people belong and to try to find a way to make sure that the turfs aren't overlapping.",
        "So we've got that.",
        "And we also - there's a group called CeaseFire.",
        "And I can't talk enough about them.",
        "It's an anti-gang program that got caught up in a state budget fight, and it's got a wonderful proven record of success.",
        "And you can literally chart the increase in crime as their funding - as this group's funding, was decreased by the state.",
        "And they had to cut staffers.",
        "There were people who were on the ground and working with gang bangers to, what they call, interrupt the violence.",
        "A lot of the people who were on CeaseFire staff were themselves former gang members.",
        "Most corporations are trying to de-risk.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So, Android is the operating system, the largest mobile phone or smartphone operating system in the world.",
        "And demand for folks that can build using the Android platform, build smartphone apps, is soaring.",
        "There is a huge need for developers.",
        "Google is not training them themselves because these folks are not going to work directly for Google.",
        "So that's why they partnered up with this company called General Assembly to help them out.",
        "OK, so it's not job training where the company would pay for your training.",
        "You are going, and you are paying a for-profit institution to do what?",
        "So about $13,500 in tuition, by the way.",
        "Wow."

        "And what Google has done is offered input in the form of curriculum development, and General Assembly is taking the lead on providing the actual teaching and the actual program as well as career services on the other end.",
        "OK, for-profit education is already under a lot of scrutiny because the education is not always that great.",
        "The institutions are not always well accredited.",
        "How does this for-profit education model stack up?",
        "Well, I guess you could say that they are trying to be seen as being different, and many folks do see them as being different.",
        "So the coder boot camp industry - just a few weeks ago, the Federal Department of Education announced that they will be allowing traditional colleges to partner with these programs so that students can take these courses for credit.",
        "And that also means that they'll be able to pay for them with federal student loans and grants, which is unusual.",
        "You know, up to now, these programs have not been traditionally accredited, and so therefore, they're not eligible for Pell Grants or student loans.",
        "Does anybody know if those thousands of graduates of boot camps are getting jobs that are lucrative enough to be worth a $13,500 education?",
        "Well, it depends on who you ask.",
        "The boot camps will tell you they have very high job placement rates, 90 to 95 percent, and that people are getting jobs with six figures.",
        "And it's certainly true that there's lots of openings for, say, an Android mobile app developer making, you know, $75,000 to $115,000 a year.",
        "Whether that success rate can be upheld especially as boot camps grow and perhaps are forced to become less selective in their students, that's something that really remains to be seen.",
        "And we have a desperate need for more objective information about how this sector is doing.",
        "Anya, thanks very much as always.",
        "Thank you, Steve.",
        "That's Anya Kamenetz of NPR's Ed team.",

        "Miss Lebanon smiled but is now under criticism.",
        "Lebanon's Daily Star says some Lebanese want their queen dethroned because she was seen with an Israeli.",
        "Miss Lebanon insists she did not pose for the photo; she was just next to Miss Israel, sort of way Israel is next to Lebanon.",
        "It's MORNING EDITION.",
        "Google's self-driving car has hit an obstacle.",
        "That's actually not a figure of speech, it is a literal fact.",

        "She says the self-driving car was apparently trying to get around some sandbags in the street as the city bus was passing.",
        "So these buses on this particular product are extended, are what we call articulated buses, and they have sort of an accordion in the middle.",
        "And the driverless car sort of pulled out into the middle of the lane and it struck the middle of the bus.",
        "Pow (ph), right in the accordion part.",
        "Pow (ph).",
        "Yeah.",
        "Google admits the bus had the right of way, and they say they bear some responsibility for the crash.",

        "Google declined our request for an interview today.",
        "Last month, we spoke to Chris Urmson, the director of Google's self-driving car project, and Urmson told us that Google prototype cars are still learning.",
        "We can't program them for every conceivable event, there's an infinite number of them.",
        "And so the trick, really, is to have the vehicles generalize what they've observed in the past and be able to understand when they don't know what's going on.",
        "And in those situations, do the cautious thing.",
        "Google said in a monthly report from the self-driving car project that in the future, quote, \"\"Our cars will more deeply understand that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to yield."

        "I'll have to find a new job, and I'm OK with that.",
        "In all seriousness, Jason Fernandez says lawyers will have to hire computer experts to investigate accidents.",
        "He might even be less likely to take a case.",
        "If someone now is involved in an accident with a driverless car and they sustain very minor injuries, the answer is probably no because the cost of investigating such a claim would overwhelm the value of the case.",
        "Auto insurance might become more mundane, like product liability insurance.",
