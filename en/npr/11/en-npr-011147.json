        "You could say it's like Comic-Con but nerdier, where football fans from across America will come together in Brooklyn and meet with some of the elite global thinkers who are shaping the tectonic plates of football from the Premier League Chairman Richard Scudamore, Christian Siefert, who runs Bundesliga, the gentleman that runs Liverpool, Manchester City, Everton Football Club, as well as the U.S.",

        "They sent it to the president, and he signed it, and he is ignoring it.",
        "And he's going around the limitations in the law to allocate money for a purpose they haven't denominated in the legislation.",

        "That's what's most important.",

        "That's my first question.",
        "I think the answer is yes.",
