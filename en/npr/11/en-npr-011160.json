        "And the threats, the abuse, we just heard some of it.",
        "And that was just some of the stuff we could play on the radio.",
        "This was extraordinary.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was the tip of the iceberg.",
        "I mean, really, it is remarkable how one person got picked out, and the entire stadium focused their ire on him and almost tried to kill him.",
        "I mean, it was really a shocking thing.",
        "I decided to do this film when I took a look at the film and saw just how furious that crowd was and how they're trying to rip him to pieces for really doing the most innocent thing that a fan can do in a baseball game, which is to reach out and try to catch a ball.",
        "And as you point out, as the film shows over and over again, he's hardly the only one who reached out for that ball.",
        "No, at least eight other people reached up.",
        "And I think if the wind hadn't been blowing out, a guy named Pat Looney(ph), who's a bar owner we interviewed for the film, would've caught the ball.",
        "He pulled his hand back at the last minute, but nobody saw Moises Alou coming.",
        "The wall was rather high.",
        "I think it was just the natural instinct that took over.",
        "You see - saw this high fly ball drifting toward you and you reached up and try to catch it.",
        "But unfortunately for Steve Bartman, his hand was just inches above the glove of Moises Alou, who was poised to catch that ball and, I think, would've caught it.",
        "And we have to put this into context, as you do in the film, of the incredible frustration of Chicago Cubs fans who've not been to the World Series in a long time and not won one for more than 100 years.",
        "That's right.",
        "And they were so close.",
        "The score was 3-0.",
        "There was a one out.",

        "I think he obviously was since the floodgates opened after this.",
        "But it seemed certain that they were going to win, and then everything collapsed and collapsed so quickly.",
        "And the other thing that's interesting about this and one of the things I wanted to explore was how Steve Bartman came to be the scapegoat, because, yes, he reached out and deflected a foul ball, Moises Alou reached, I think, into the stands to try to get.",
        "But just a few pitches later, there was a, you know, lead-pipe cinch double play ball hit to Alex Gonzalez, a sure-handed fielder, and he just booted it.",
        "That would've ended the inning.",
        "There would've been only one inning left to go.",

        "And they rained hell on him, and it is not too strong a word.",

        "He wants to remain an anonymous citizen and that, I think, is both - it's a double-edged sword, but I think there's an aspect of that in our media-centric society that we have to admire this guy who wants to be left alone.",
        "He doesn't want the spotlight, and so he's trying very hard to avoid it.",
        "And, as you point out in the film, has turned down repeated offers to cash in on his notoriety.",
        "Well, the guy who did get the ball bounced over to him and he sold that for $100,000.",

        "He asked forgiveness of the Cubs and of the fans.",
