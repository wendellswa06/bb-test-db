        "Well, it was a very welcome, grace note on a very difficult year, I would say.",
        "You know, really, since 2003, with Lawrence versus Texas, when the Supreme Court weighed in to say that you cannot outlaw being gay and lesbian in this country, we've been in a process of figuring out exactly how we're going to get to full and real equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans in this country.",
