        "There's still a major issue and that is, until we have no tolerance for intolerance, so that you don't make gay jokes or knock down gay people in public - as reference, they wouldn't do the same thing about women or blacks anymore.",
        "We're sort of the last area where you can just have intolerance and speak as loudly as you want about it.",
        "I think until that changes, a lot of other things won't fall in line.",
        "And - you don't hear many gay jokes on the media much anymore, though.",
        "Well, you know, probably not from NPR, but there are a lot of other places you hear them.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And I wonder, Eliza Byard, what do you think?",
        "Well, I think a couple things.",
        "I think that in the national discourse, we had an election year where you had female candidates telling male candidates to man up.",
        "I think it's true that we have different kinds of depictions of lesbian and gay people in popular culture.",
        "But we also have a world in which nine out of 10 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender children face bullying and harassment and violence at school.",
        "One in five LGBT students reports having been assaulted at school.",
        "And about 30 percent of these students are skipping school out of fear for their personal safety.",
        "So we still know that words like faggot and dyke are weapons of choice for young people who wanted to demean their peers, whether or not they're actually lesbian, gay - lesbian or gay.",
        "So the language of disrespect in this country remains deeply homophobic and sexist, and that leaves us a lot of work to do.",
        "Obviously, the \"\"It Gets Better Project,\"\" I think, represented a tremendous outpouring from the LGBT community for young people who are suffering."

        "We heard a lot about suicides of LGBT young people this fall.",
        "It was a unbelievably sad time when the nation's attention finally turned fully to the question of bullying in our schools and the place of LGBT issues within that horrific crisis.",
        "And at a time when I think the community became overwhelmed and just deeply impatient with the failure to act to end this problem, we had this sort of end run around other forms of communication in this kind of direct address from the community to young people everywhere.",
        "And it was incredibly moving to see, but also frustrating in its origins because there's so much that schools could and must do to address the issues.",

        "And I think my name was also maybe familiar with Beyonce's team because I'd worked with Solange.",

        "You're not only the first African-American to shoot the cover for Vogue, but you're also one of the youngest.",

        "It's kind of - you can't really put words to it, right?",
        "I keep thinking about the moment they called me and told me about the shoot and they made me aware that I would be the first African-American to shoot the cover of Vogue.",
        "It was at once totally unreal and also felt like I had been living my whole life to receive that call.",

        "But I wouldn't quite say it's a complete end to the euro crisis because at the end of the day, those governments still have to be able to pay their debts or someone will have to bail out the European Central Bank.",
        "Well, if the European Central Bank buys up high-interest bonds that reflect the high borrowing costs of Spain and Italy, costs which were caused by those countries' shaky finances, who would actually end up paying the difference?",
        "Who would pay the cost of unburdening Spain and Italy of those high interest rates?",
        "Part of the cost just goes into thin air, because if people gain confidence that the euro's going to stay together - Spain and Italy won't be forced out, that they won't default - they won't demand the same premia, and the whole eurozone governments will save money.",
        "We could see Germany's borrowing costs creep up.",
        "Germany has been getting very low interest rates, and maybe people say, hmm, who's going to end up paying for Spain and Italy?",
        "It's going to be Germany.",
        "Nobody really knows, and it's a key gamble by Mario Draghi that mostly this is a win-win, and not just Germany transferring money to the impecuniary southern countries.",
        "What about this question that Jim Zarroli raised, which is: What exactly is the role of the European Central Bank?",
        "Because unlike the Fed, it doesn't have a mission to keep unemployment low, for example, which our central bank has.",
        "Is it really up to the task in terms of what it's chartered to do?",
        "Well, they're allowed to do lots of things in the name of maintaining financial stability, because if financial stability blows up, then you'll get price instability, maybe deflation, prices going down, maybe inflation, prices going up.",
        "And I think Mario Draghi's appealing to that.",
        "He said, look, if something comes to destabilize the situation, you're not going to get stable prices.",
        "So we've got to get it under control."

        "Yes, the Bundesbank, the German Central Bank has been protesting, but they must have the support of the Germans to do this, because if Germany didn't support it, they could threaten to pull out and then the whole thing would melt down.",
        "Draghi and the European Central Bank here are addressing the problems of the debtors, I guess.",
        "But does there come a point sometime in the coming months when the creditors of these countries take a hit and say, look, in order for Europe to continue and for you to continue to prosper doing business in the continent, you'll have to mark down some loans for these people.",
        "Well, I think everyone outside of Europe would like to see that.",
