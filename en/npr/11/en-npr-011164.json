        "The charge that al-Qaida is to blame underscores the government's claim that foreign agents and Islamist militants are behind the uprising - a point officials pressed on the monitors as they surveyed the gore at the blast site.",
        "The explosions in Damascus overshadowed continuing reports of a violent army campaign in the north that's seen some of the bloodiest events in the 10-month-old uprising.",
        "The village of Kfar Owaid was the site of a major massacre on Tuesday, say activists and residents, when the army shelled and machine-gunned civilians who had harbored army defectors.",

        "There were more questions from regional analysts after the Syrian government's almost immediate charge of who had carried out the attacks, says Salman Shaikh at the Brookings Center in Doha.",
        "I must say that I'm deeply skeptical about the regime's claims within 15 to 30 minutes of the blast, apparently, that al-Qaida was behind it, or an affiliation of al-Qaida.",

        "It started there as a place that - kind of imagined in my mind, in Havana that I didn't know existed.",
