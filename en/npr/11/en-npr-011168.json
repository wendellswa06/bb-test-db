        "Another reason for raising that question is a TV documentary series by National Geographic that starts on Sunday night.",
        "It's called \"\"Hitler's Hidden Holocaust.\"\" Sunday's program is about the Einsatzgruppen, the special forces of the German S.S.",
        "Before the Jews of Western Europe were transported to camps to labor and die, the Einsatzgruppen roamed through Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, murdering Jews and partisans.",
        "They killed an estimated 1.5 million people.",
        "The shooting operations were very much in-your-face killings.",
        "They were not by remote control the way gas chamber killing operations were.",

        "Holocaust Memorial Museum.",
        "He's in the documentary.",
        "In terms of record keeping, the Einsatzgruppen had instructions to keep statistics on the number of people that they shot, not only the number of Jews but also the number of communists and insurgents, as they called them, or agitators or resistors that they shot.",
        "We asked historian Timothy Snyder of Yale University to take a look at the National Geographic program.",
        "Professor Snyder wrote an essay in the July 16th issue of The New York Review of Books called \"\"Holocaust: The Ignored Reality.\"\" And he joins us from New York.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Glad to be here.",
        "Would you say that the Einsatzgruppen are part of the ignored reality that you were writing about?",
        "Very much so.",
        "When we think about the Holocaust, we tend to think about the three parts of it in reverse order.",
        "We think first about Auschwitz where about a million, maybe a bit less than a million people were killed.",
        "And then if we think on, we might think about Poland and Treblinka and the death facilities there, where more people died actually than at Auschwitz by carbon monoxide poisoning."

        "And then if we think on, or if we know anything about it, we might think about the Soviet Union, the Einsatzgruppen, and the Jews who were murdered by gunfire; by the Einsatzgruppen, by the German police, by the German army actually, as well with the help of local civilians who took up arms in local militias.",
        "The further east you go, in general, the less Americans and less West Europeans think about it.",
        "And so the Einsatzgruppen who were active the further east are indeed part of the Holocaust that we know the least about.",
        "You wrote in the New York Review of Books essay the very reasons that we know something about Auschwitz warp our understanding of the Holocaust.",
        "How is that?",
        "What are those reasons?",
        "Well, it's as though once we know about Auschwitz there couldn't be anything worse.",
        "And that's a very understandable perspective.",
        "Sadly, we know about Auschwitz because Auschwitz was a labor camp as well as a death facility, which actually makes it unusual.",
        "There were three facilities: Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, which were just death facilities, which did nothing but produce death.",
        "And more people were actually killed there than at Auschwitz.",
        "Because there was no labor component to those camps, there were effectively no survivors.",
        "There were very few, but effectively, there were none.",
        "And so there was no one to tell the tale.",

        "As all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well.",

        "Being part of the so-called ownership society, a society that claims homes, schools and other accouterments of middle-class values, was an important component in the last two Republican victories.",
        "The party appealed to voters across geographic and ethnic lines to join them and many black fiscal conservatives did.",
        "So did many black religious conservatives, who appreciated the Republican stance against gay marriage.",
        "But, says University of Maryland political science Professor Ronald Walters, the honeymoon between the Republican Party and these traditionally Democratic black voters may be coming to an end.",
        "Now we have with Katrina another extremely powerful emotional issue.",
        "And I think in the final analysis, that's going to arm Democrats and black leaders with the ability actually to trump whatever now was resonant in the religious issues.",
        "And if that swing away from the Republicans occurs, says Walters, it may present possibilities for the Democrats.",
        "On one side, I think the Democrats have the opportunity to stymie Republican outreach in a lot of places.",
        "And here, we're not just talking about blacks, because in a lot of places in the southern region, whites are also looking at the federal response, looking at their damaged property and saying that here was the administration and the president of the party, which left them out to dry as well.",
        "So that the enormous implications of this, if the Democrats are able to take advantage of it, really have regional political implications.",
        "The NAACP's president, Bruce Gordon, applauds Bush's stated good intentions, but, he says, following through on them is going to be a lot harder, especially with a war abroad that's draining America's finances and dividing its citizens.",
        "But if there's any silver lining to Katrina's devastation, Gordon says, it's that the storm took the lid off any illusions about America as a completely first-world country.",
        "Katrina has made it apparent to a lot of Americans who are offended and embarrassed--I'm not just talking about black Americans, I'm talking about white Americans who don't like what they see.",
        "So I believe the timing is everything and I would hate to lose the momentum, the self of conscience that has emerged in this country and sort of return back to business as usual because the budget crisis prevented us from taking on the poverty crisis.",
        "So it's a tough one to balance.",
        "And, says Diane Watson, Katrina's aftermath and the president's acknowledgement of it is a possible opportunity for her party and his.",
        "I think it's our opportunity to perform and it's their opportunity to put efforts behind their words."
