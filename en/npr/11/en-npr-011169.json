        "And by the end of 1941, the Einsatzgruppen, together with the police and the military and local helpers, have already shot more than a million people.",
        "So as many or more people then died at Auschwitz over the entire course of the war.",
        "The National Geographic program draws attention to that, and that's very important.",
        "It's a first kind of corrective that we need.",
        "It has the problem that it attends only to the Einsatzgruppen themselves.",
        "And so one is left with a question: how could 2,000 people shoot millions of Soviet citizens, which is an unanswerable question put that way.",
        "The next thing that one has to see is that the Einsatzgruppen were not acting alone.",
        "They weren't super villains.",
        "They didn't have the power to kill that many people themselves.",
        "In fact, the German Army and the German police were involved in very considerable measure.",
        "And it's important to see that, to see that the entire German war effort in the East had a kind of criminal character, and that it wasn't just limited to a couple of thousand people who were assigned these special tasks.",
        "Timothy Snyder, thank you very much for talking with us.",
        "Very glad to do it.",
