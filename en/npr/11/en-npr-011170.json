        "What can you do with a mogul whose favorite word was `wholesome,' yet who divorced his first wife to dally with starlets, who hated communism but ran his studio like an overgrown worker's paradise, whose symbol was a roaring lion but whose personality came closer to that of a greedy little boy adoring his mother and throwing tantrums and spending money like there was no tomorrow right up until the bankers bounced him out?",

        "If they don't make them like \"\"Singin' in the Rain\"\" or \"\"An American in Paris\"\" anymore, it's partly because they don't make them like Mayer, either.",

        "What made it all work was his tremendous eye for talent and managerial skills that Eyman astutely compares to those of a much bigger monster, Henry Ford.",
        "Were MGM's movies all worth the aggravation Mayer put himself and his employees through to make them?",
        "With the exception of the musicals and pictures like \"\"Ninotchka\"\" and \"\"The Wizard of Oz\"\" from 1939, that year when Hollywood could inexplicably do no wrong, Eyman's well-argued conclusion is that, no, it wasn't usually worth it.",
        "Warner Bros.",
        "pictures were more realistic; United Artists', more ambitious; Fox's, better written.",

        "Art never justified itself in Mayer's eyes.",
        "It needed an audience, and for 30 years, Mayer was the first audience every MGM picture had to satisfy.",
