        "This is Molly in Las Vegas.",
        "This I think is going be so hilarious to watch, because in Iowa, in New Hampshire, there's been the same diner, the same state fair, the same pancake breakfast people, every candidate has known that they had to go to for the last, you know, 40 years.",
        "In Nevada, we have no idea what the events and places will be, so the Democratic Party is trying to help candidates know when some small town is having, you know, some kind of steer roping or whatever, and the candidates are trying to figure out what's the place where the locals hang out and I can shake hands and grip and grin, is it Bagel Mania?",
        "Drop the gun, and step back towards us.",
        "Exactly, when you come through here, do you put a dollar in a slot just to show that, like, you're into it or do you avoid that?",

        "At this stage in the game, there are few public events, some forums and town halls, but even some of the photo op stuff is pretty limited.",
        "These are one on one things now, small groups, you try to - if you're a Republican you trying to court religious conservatives.",
        "If you're a Democrat, you're meeting with labor leaders.",
        "And so it's a lot of very low-key stuff at this stage.",
        "We heard so much about Senator Barack Obama this week, forming the exploratory committee, potentially throwing his hat on the ring.",
        "Does he start at a relatively flat-footed state because he's not spent a lot of time in Iowa as a candidate?",
        "No.",
        "Polls show him right near the top.",
        "He campaigned three times here during the election campaign in '06, and each time he had huge crowds.",
        "I find it very interesting at that, when I go to a Barack Obama event - and it is like a rock concert - you see a lot of people there who are not traditionally involved in politics, and they see hope, they see something different in this candidate.",
        "Now he can harness that and turn it out a year from now on a cold January night in one of 2,000 precincts in this state, he would do very well.",
        "And New Hampshire, what are candidates doing there?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting.",
        "We have Christopher Dodd.",
        "I just got his schedule yesterday.",
        "He's here Saturday and Sunday.",
        "He's doing a little bit of everything.",
        "He has a town hall meeting in Dover, New Hampshire.",
        "He's got a coffee at a small home in Henniker.",
        "He's got a breakfast with national Democratic activists.",
        "He's going to the celebration in the state senate just, where the Democrats did really well in November.",
        "He's doing the traditional stuff.",
        "And it's funny, when Barack Obama was here in December, he - they rented out a huge hall and he was like a rock star, as David said, but his aides in New Hampshire are cautioning that that - the next time he make a trip it's not going to be like that at all.",
        "He's going to try to do all the grassroots stuff that everybody else is doing.",
        "We'll see if he can, if he can manage to pull off small events without attracting 150 national media like he did on his first trip.",
        "It's early, one year before the primary season officially kicks off.",
        "I just want you to tell me quickly the issues that are most important at this point to the voters in each of your states.",
        "Sure.",
        "This is Felice in New Hampshire.",
        "I think here we had so many startling upsets in the November election here - the Democrats took over the government for the first time since the 19th century - that is definitely felt like an anti-war message, and that's what definitely what people are talking about.",
        "It's almost all their talking about lately.",
        "I've seen polling of caucus goers in both parties, and in the Democratic side, the war hits about 50 percent among caucus goers who say that's the single most important issue they want addressed.",
        "That's just off the charts.",
        "You know, the next one is maybe the economy, down at 17 or 18 percent.",
        "Maybe in a year that'll change, but right now, it's all Iraq all the time.",

        "This is the proposal to use a Nevada mountain site as a nuclear waste repository.",
        "It's been stalled for years, but it is the kind of thing that every candidate gets asked when they come here - are you against it, and if you're not, you can kiss your Nevada chances goodbye.",
        "And David, how about ethanol in Iowa?",
        "Do all the candidates have to come with their ethanol briefing book in tow?",

        "I think it's become more so around the country, though, as the nation tries to find some ways to achieve energy independence.",
        "And so they tend to package in the context of an energy issue.",
        "I might also add, these are rank and file people in the party.",
        "And yes, they're concerned about ethanol or Yucca Mountain or the Iraq War, but they are also concerned about picking a horse that can win the presidency for their party.",
        "And in these early states, the question of can you win the White House is one that's always on the minds of the activists.",
        "Felice in New Hampshire, yeah.",
        "And I think, you know, New Hampshire voters take their job as one of the early states so seriously, and I think David's just right that you don't want to squander that.",
        "There have been times when New Hampshire voters have sent what seemed like a protest message.",
        "I think, about the year that Pat Buchanan won in the New Hampshire Republican primary, it just seemed so crazy, especially considering how much this state has changed since then."
