        "You know, a week after \"\"Star Trek: Enterprise\"\" disappears into its black hole, \"\"Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\"\" opens, and at last George Lucas gives his fans what they have longed for: the asthmatic Darth Vader breathing out of his black mask, the furry Chewbacca growling into the heavens and glimpses of spaceships and planets first seen a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away--well, at least in 1977.",
