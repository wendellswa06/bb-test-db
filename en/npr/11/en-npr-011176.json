        "This weekend, several thousand people will gather at the Convention Center in Washington, DC, for the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as AIPAC.",
        "This year, like other years, a high-powered slate of speakers will address the conference, including Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and many members of Congress.",
        "But unlike other years, this AIPAC conference is being held under the cloud of a criminal investigation.",
        "NPR's Jackie Northam reports.",
        "The growing criminal investigation has all the makings of a great spy novel, including top-secret documents, wiretapping, sting operations and a powerful organization that shuns limelight.",
        "The saga first came to light about two years ago and initially focused on three men: Larry Franklin, a midlevel officer in the Pentagon's Near East and South Asia Bureau, and two members of AIPAC--Keith Weissman, its senior Iran analyst, and Steve Rosen, AIPAC's director of research.",
        "Ron Kampeas is the respected Washington bureau chief for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency who spent many years as a journalist in Israel.",
        "He said the turning point in the case came when Franklin met the two AIPAC men at an Italian restaurant in Arlington, Virginia.",
        "And an FBI agent was watching them.",
        "And whether they were tracking Franklin or whether they had been tracking Rosen, it wasn't clear.",
        "But certainly that's what led the FBI to move in on Franklin and the information that he gave, the verbal information that he gave Rosen and Weissman in that restaurant, which apparently had to do with a potential attack on US forces in northern Iraq.",
        "Franklin has been charged with a single count of disclosing classified defense information.",
        "A 10-age affidavit written by an FBI special agent assigned to a counterespionage team says that the disclosed information came from documents stamped with the words `top secret' in capital letters.",
        "More than 80 such documents were found in Franklin's home and office.",
        "FBI officials later confirmed that it was AIPAC's Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman who received the information from Franklin.",
        "FBI agents have since raided AIPAC's headquarters twice, searching Rosen's and Weissman's offices.",
        "The Justice Department confirmed that the investigation is ongoing, but will not add any more details.",
        "AIPAC initially backed Rosen and Weissman, but then in April dismissed the two men, and since tried to distance itself from them.",
        "NPR contacted AIPAC twice.",
        "The organization said it would not discuss the investigation on the record.",
        "But a source inside the organization said that AIPAC had been told by the government that neither it nor any current employees are targets of the ongoing FBI investigation.",
        "But the JTA's Kampeas doesn't by that.",
        "They're saying that they're not being targeted because they got rid of Rosen and Weissman.",
        "You know, Steve Rosen is AIPAC, AIPAC is Steve Rosen.",
        "And anybody in AIPAC would have told you that, you know, six months ago.",
        "There was no distinction.",
        "The 62-year-old Rosen is a larger-than-life figure who first joined AIPAC in 1982.",
        "Kampeas says before Rosen arrived, most lobbying was done through Congress, but that he started making inroads to the upper echelons of the administration--the White House, Pentagon, and State Department.",
        "Kampeas says Rosen's strength was the amount of information he was able to garner and solicit.",
        "That helped turn AIPAC into one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the capital.",
        "But Douglas Bloomfield, AIPAC's legislative director throughout the 1980s, says Rosen's arrival also marked another change at the organization.",
        "There was a culture of secrecy that descended over it in recent years, that considered lobbying some kind of nefarious night flower that could only operate or bloom in the darkness.",
        "I think that has created a lot of suspicion, concern and maybe even antipathy totally unnecessarily."
