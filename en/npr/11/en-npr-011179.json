        "He transitioned to more Hollywood fare, like the stoner comedy \"\"Pineapple Express,\"\" but \"\"Joe\"\" feels like a return.",
        "Green has crafted a quietly powerful film that allows Nicolas Cage to lose himself in this character; no small thing for an actor famous for big, theatrical performances.",
        "There's even a popular YouTube video, an insane greatest hits of Cage's most explosive movie moments.",
        "When we spoke with Nicholas Cage and David Gordon Green about \"\"Joe,\"\" Cage said it was the chance to do something different that attracted him to this role.",
        "I had been waiting for the better part of a year to find a script where I could be as emotionally naked as possible.",
        "I'd done several movies where I was experimenting more with performance style and operatic kind of style, but now I wanted to go into almost like dogma style of film performance, where I didn't have to think too much about it and I could just be and take my memories or my past experiences and flood them into a character that would be the right vessel for it.",
        "And so, when I read \"\"Joe,\"\" right away there was an implicit connection with the dialogue where I thought: Wow, I understand this man and I think I can play this part in a way where I wouldn't have to act."

        "The rehearsal process for me is just absorbing a lot of these conversations, and then just a little mental notes and saying, how can we infuse all of this into our movie.",

        "You know, one of the things too, when we're dealing with a movie like this that has very difficult subject matter, a lot of dramatic elements to it, I find it very healthy to find the humanity of these characters and find moments of levity.",

        "Gary Poulter was a man that we met at a bus stop, just got talking to him about his story and we brought him back to read for the third lead in the film and he just blew our minds.",
        "This is a man that hadn't been in front of the camera and he'd been living on the streets for a while and was a street performer, and he was looking to turn over a new leaf in his life and use this as a creative outlet.",

        "Not long after the movie was made, Poulter himself was found dead after a night of drinking.",
        "Nicolas Cage told us how hard it was to get that news.",

        "And, by the way, I want to stress that he was totally on point when he was filming.",
        "He had all his dialogue, he showed up on time, he was 100 percent there.",
        "He reminded me of like a Civil War captain or like he could have been in a great old Western movie.",
        "I said, just keep it together for a year, Gary, and I promise you your phone's gonna start ringing and your life is really gonna change.",
        "And he looked at me in this very vulnerable way, and he said, really?",
        "And I said, yeah, man, really.",
        "So when David told me a couple months after photography that he passed on, I was pretty upset.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, I never want to impinge on your personal connection with a movie.",
        "There's a secret there, and whatever you get from it is what is right.",
