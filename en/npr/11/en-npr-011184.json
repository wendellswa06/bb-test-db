        "The rise in homeownership that we saw peak at - over two-thirds of American households owning the homes in which they live also translates to anxiety, even in the best of times, because the home used to be a place where you retreated to and left the logic of the marketplace when you wiped your feet at the front-door mat.",

        "Plus, as much as we like to think of ourselves as an increasingly frenetic, moving-around nation, actually, over the last 100 years, we're more rooted.",
        "And that's partly a story of homeownership and the fact that we are more rooted and we often have two careers, and so, therefore can't - we don't have spouse that's just willing to follow us anywhere deems that commute times have just increased dramatically and extreme commuting situations, such as we've heard several of today, are more and more common.",

        "How common is that, historically, and historically, as you look along the great time line, very uncommon, but in terms of recent years?",
        "Well, we don't really have data about how many people are, you know, dating across datelines or even national boundaries, as we heard before, but you know, the sense is that has increased.",
        "But we have to also keep in mind that, in some ways, that's the return back to the future, so to speak, or return to the past, because the '50s kind of cultural reference point of the nuclear family, living in the self-contained unit, really was more the exception than the rule for most of history.",
        "And there was migrant labor, and husbands and wives were often gone for extended periods in the early 20th century and the 19th century, during - but mostly to do agricultural work that was seasonal.",

        "Right.",
        "And the marriage of a Ph.D. to a Ph.D. is also a part of this story, because back in the days of the 1950s, again, the partner would like to - was more likely to marry his secretary or marry somebody who then would opt out of the workforce.",
        "Maureen Dowd in her columns often likes to complain that the executive only wants to marry the secretary, and the highly educated, powerful women are left out in the cold.",
        "That's just - couldn't be further from the truth today.",
        "Today, what sociologists call assortative mating has increased.",
        "So, the more we earn, the more we work, and the more we earn, the more we probably married a spouse who also is a high earner, and that in itself has exacerbated the inequality, which in turn drives the anxiety and the need to keep up.",
        "So, in good times, we're falling behind, relatively ,because we feel like people ahead of us, the further up you go, the gaps get bigger and the rate of change gets bigger, and in bad times, we're worried about just holding onto what we've got and servicing all the debt we've accumulated to sort of keep up, and that is new.",

        "And then, I got laid off, and my last child left from home, and I just felt like - I've never been an addict, but I thought I just came off of an addiction.",
        "And it was hard to withdraw from, you know, the kids and the work, and I just felt, like, almost dead.",
        "Was it, like you say, coming off a drug because you didn't literally know what to do?",
