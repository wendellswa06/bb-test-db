        "I am a college student in my early 20s, so my childhood was a little bit before parents were hooked on their BlackBerries or iPhones.",
        "Although I remember when I was in high school, my dad starting to work more at home from his home office, and on the weekends, he would be working a lot, too.",
        "But without sounding too sappy about it, I feel like a lot of the new technology has actually brought my friends and my family and me closer together and stimulated conversation at the dinner table, you know?",
        "So, a lot of times, I'm checking my news on my iTouch, and I get 100 percent, I would say, of my news online, and I get to share that media with my friends on Facebook.",
        "So, we're, you know, we're often on the same page in terms of the news and information we're getting.",

        "It's the difference between technological touch-typers and hunt-and-peckers.",
        "Well, I think, it's definitely rewritten social relations in our social lives, that sort of always connected or the Facebook phenomenon.",
        "And - but it's also rewritten some other sort of long-held concepts or boundaries, if you will, and one of those is between public and private.",
        "The metaphor for the self used to be that we had a front-stage self that, you know, who we are on the street, in public, at work and so forth.",
        "And we had a backstage that we let certain people into; that was intimacy.",
        "You shared these secrets.",
        "You shared - you've kicked your feet up, took off your shoes, so to speak, and let people see the, quote, real you.",
        "And for much of American history, with this ethic of American individualism, the imperative was to find your true self, find your authentic self, and then use that as a lone star to guide of your choice of work, of marital partner, of your ethics and so forth.",
        "And now, we live our lives in this Escher-like bottle of social relations, where it's - everything is out in the open.",

        "And maybe the younger generation is OK with that, but I think, as I said, for those who are of the bubble generation like myself of living half our lives pre-digital and half post-digital, there is a disjunction between how - what the norms are now or the emergence of new norms and what we thought of as private and public before.",

        "And if you bring the homosexual aspect of that into the just out and about forth that, you'll increase the drama that much more, and take that much more away from mission effectiveness.",
