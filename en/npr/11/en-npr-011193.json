        "And we all got together and took a look at all of Wolf's files, and said to ourselves, we've really got to figure out how to make the music that we want to make and sustain ourselves while doing it because at that point, we'd hadn't gotten any money from any distributors to start the company again.",

        "And he said I want to put out good music, period.",
        "And I don't want to compromise to put that music out.",
        "And 10 years later, I feel like we're still pursuing that dream but every time there's a setback I feel like creatively we move ahead of it.",
        "So it stresses me out to no end knowing that if we have a bad three or four months, you know, this company could shut its doors.",
        "We've got to get this music out now.",
        "We've got to get this music out now because there's so much bad music out now and we're a team that all believe in that ultimate goal.",
        "And we might fight internally about what record to put out, but we never fight on why we're doing it.",
        "We're doing it because no one else is."
