        "And I'm not just saying that because I work there.",
        "But certainly that, you know - and that sort of played out in the interesting way, because the campaign wound up sending out a note that was attached to a fundraising letter, sort of, using it as way to raise money.",

        "But, you know, with the Lazio thing it's interesting because I've gone back and talked to people and said, okay, what was your read on that?",
        "Because he brought her this pledge, it was to ban soft money.",

        "Hillary, why don't you sign it - well, I don't know if he said Hillary - but why don't you sign it.",

        "Well, actually, the way I've been hearing it, it sounds like the Republicans want her to be the frontrunner because, according to what they have to say, they would love to run against her.",
        "And there are not too few Democrats who agree that perhaps they fear that the Republicans would mostly like to run against her.",
