        "Why is it okay for the media and most individuals to refer to Senator Clinton as Hillary?",
        "I've never heard anyone talking about John, Bill or Barack without using their last names.",
        "I'm sure Mrs. Clinton is not afraid of any of the Johns, Bills, Rudys, or anyone else who run against her.",

        "What will your economic policies do for him within the next year to be able to secure a job and have that American dream again?",

        "The quick answer to that - if you go to her Web site, if you talk to her campaign, it doesn't take Clinton, if you look at her posters, if you look at her buttons, it all - they all say Hillary.",
        "So if anybody is trying as the Hillary Clinton campaign itself, it's the first -she's a first name candidate.",
        "And you'll see that throughout her whole Web site.",
        "And part of that, I think, is to distinguish her from her husband and part of that actually is an advantage that women have.",
        "There are women who have run on the first name basis because there is sometimes perceived to be a closer, personal connection to a female candidate.",
        "And so that, they can kind of - when you see on yard signs sometimes, they can capitalize on that by operating on a first name basis.",
        "What's interesting is a lot of the subtle things that get said - I think there was a Bob Ulrich, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend debate a couple of years ago.",
        "And he kept calling her ma'am during the debate.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That's an honorific that she did not particularly like or at least that some female viewers felt was - and perhaps male viewers felt was -not the nicest.",
        "Still, you can really get into parsing the tiniest things.",
        "Is it ma'am, is it a first name that can be seen as insulting, you know.",
        "Jane, you ignorant slut.",
        "That would also be a bad thing to say.",

        "For the first time there's an African-American head coach on the sidelines.",
        "In fact, there are two, so either Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts or the Chicago Bears' Lovie Smith will be the first black coach to win pro football's ultimate game.",
        "In an op-ed in Sunday's Los Angeles Times, Dave Zirin says we have plenty to celebrate in their success, but he argues that pro football still has a very long way to go.",

        "Thanks very much for coming in today.",
        "Great to be here, Neal.",
        "Over the years, the barriers have fallen: first black quarterback, first black quarterback to win the Super Bowl, now the first African-American coach to win it.",
        "This certainly represents progress.",
        "Yeah, but I would argue that the progress achieved by Lovie Smith and Tony Dungy has occurred in spite of the NFL, not because of the NFL.",
        "I mean the NFL's hiring practices resemble the admittance policies of a 1950's country club.",
        "Still to this day in 2006 - 2007, excuse me, we're talking about six out of 32 coaches in the NFL are African-American at this point in a league that's 70 percent black.",
        "Three executives, three general managers, are African-American in the NFL.",
        "And compared to other sports, there certainly is a ways to go.",
        "And you also mentioned the fact that there is a - some of the progress that has been made is due to something called the Rooney Rule - named after the late head of the Pittsburgh Steelers - and they insisted that at least one African-American, one minority, had to be interviewed every time there was a head coaching position open.",
        "Yes.",
        "And, you know, the National Football League is the only pro sports league where owners have to be mandated to interview candidates of color.",
        "I think that says something in and of itself.",
        "And the reason the Rooney Rule is even in existence is because the late Johnnie Cochran and his legal partner, Cyrus Mehri, threatened a mass anti-discrimination lawsuit in 2002."

        "Now in 2002, the number of African-American head coaches stood at two.",
        "The number of general managers stood at one.",
        "So yes, there's been progress, but it's been absolutely glacial in pace.",
        "Though one of the things that a lot of people have pointed out, as you look at the careers of Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith and other African-American coaches, is that because of hiring practices in the past, they got a very late start.",
        "Father Michael says he could have asked that about any one of 50 families in his congregation.",

        "A very late start indeed.",
        "I mean Tony Dungy was named an NFL assistant at age 25, for goodness' sakes.",
        "And for years he was rumored that he was going to be the first African-American assistant coach; and yes, it did take years.",
        "And when Tony Dungy did finally get an opportunity, and you see this pattern often with African-American head coaches, it was with the lowly Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
        "See, often African-American head coaches - and there have been only eight hired in the entire modern era, only eight for goodness' sakes - they're hired to teams where they're the hire of last resort and they have to be twice as successful as their white counterparts.",
        "Of the 50 combined seasons that African-American head coaches have been involved in, 29 times they've reached the playoffs.",
        "They have a lifetime 546 winning percentage.",
        "So it's literally like the old saw that one would hope would be in America's past, where if you're going to achieve in a white-dominated field and you're African-American, you actually have to be twice as good as your competition.",

        "Yes.",
        "If we had all the NFL head coaches in a room right now, they would look like the Harlem Globetrotters compared to what you see in the college ranks.",
        "We're talking about seven, seven out of 116 NCAA head coaching jobs are held by African-Americans, by people of color.",
        "And this gap is just profound.",
        "So not only are African-American head coaches not getting the opportunity, they're also not getting the training at the college ranks.",
        "And you know, this is something that's actually I think going to need to change in the years ahead if the NFL is going to frankly continue to grow and be the king sports league that it certainly is right now.",
        "One of the things that has been happening of late, we mentioned the Rooney Rule, named after the late head of the Pittsburgh Steelers.",
        "The Pittsburgh Steelers went out after the retirement of their long-time coach this season and lived up to the Rooney Rule's terminology.",
        "They certainly did.",
        "They hired a gentleman, Mike Tomlin, who was a coordinator with the Minnesota Vikings.",
        "And I thought that was a terrific move on their part because actually it holds with their tradition of hiring 30-something coordinators.",
        "I mean the Steelers are really unique in that they've only had three head coaches.",
        "Tomlin's their third head coach since the late 1960s: the great Chuck Noll, and then Bill Cowher, and now Mike Tomlin.",
        "One of the things that was actually very nice was a gentleman who's one of the heads of the Black Coaches Association said that the best thing about the Mike Tomlin hire is when he heard about it, he didn't know if Mike Tomlin was African-American or not until he actually saw his picture in the paper.",
        "That's where we want to get to.",
        "But to say that we're there right now, as a lot of articles have said in celebration of Dungy and Smith, is just not the truth.",
        "Also, one of the star franchises in the National Football League, the New York Giants, hired a relatively young - I can call him relatively young; he might be old compared to you - but relatively young African-American man as their general manager.",
        "Yes, Jerry Reese, and that's the third in history and the third right now in the NFL.",
        "And as I said, as recently as 2002, the number of African-American general managers was one.",
        "And we haven't even talked about the ownership ranks here, which remains as, you know, as lily-white as a 1950's country club at this point.",
        "And I think the NFL just needs to do a lot more.",
        "Given the fact that the face of so many franchises is African-American, that needs to be matched not only in the coaching ranks, not only in the general managing ranks, but in the ownership ranks, as well.",
        "Other sports have begun to take these steps, and there's no reason for the NFL to lag so far behind.",
        "They should be trendsetters.",
        "They should be pacesetters for sports throughout the United States.",
        "Instead, they are lagging."
