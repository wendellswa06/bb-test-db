        "OK.",
        "What I can tell you is that when they have taken place, there has been immediately a crisis group taking action on it, containing it so that it doesn't become a series of incidents because that's what can make a cease-fire or a cessation-hostilities in danger.",
        "Well, let's talk about what this looks like in practice.",
        "I'm looking at Reuters news report from today, Feb. 29, saying that Syrian government forces regained control of a key road to the northern city of Aleppo after making advances against Islamic State fighters, ISIS fighters.",
        "So if I understand it, that's OK under this cessation of hostilities.",
        "They're fighting ISIS.",
        "But if they fought some other group, that would be wrong.",
        "Is that how it works?",
        "You are very close to the truth because obviously, one has to make sure that these are really ISIS and that - al-Nusra.",
        "But that's part of the cessation of hostilities agreement, that everyone should stop fighting each other among those who have accepted the cease-fire.",
        "And there are two exceptions, al-Nusra and ISIL, because both of them are listed as terrorist organizations by the U.N.",
        "Security Council.",
        "You're right.",
        "That's why when you have a news about air operations, both from the Americans, actually, and from the Russians, the issue is to verify whether they are actually hitting al-Nusra or Daesh, because in that case we should not consider that a breach of the cease-fire.",
        "Are you sure that the Americans and Russians agree on who's a terrorist and who's covered by the cease-fire?",
        "What I can say that they both agree that the only terrorists, according to them and frankly according to the task force, including 18 countries who are involved in it, are those listed by the Security Council.",
        "And the two main ones are ISIL and al-Nusra.",
        "Now, you mentioned trying to be more ambitious.",
        "Would you explain how that works?",
        "What would the next step be here if this cessation of hostilities holds?",
        "President Bush also today held an unusually long news conference, speaking for about an hour.",
        "The president defended his administration's handling of North Korea in the wake of its recent apparent nuclear bomb test.",
        "The president also strongly defended the war in Iraq.",
        "Most of these are when he was younger.",
        "It's somebody that I see every Sunday and I see his kids every Sunday and his wife every Sunday and I see them at our parish activities.",
        "Why him and not somebody else?",
        "I don't know, other than I know that this is what he was struggling with."
