        "What's the deal there?",
        "He is making a point that I think most people in Washington consider to be an undisputed point, and that is that while the Senate is willing to make a statement that it wants a timetable and it wants to set a target date, it isn't willing to play chicken, to use the senator's phrase.",
        "It isn't willing to play chicken with the funding of U.S.",
