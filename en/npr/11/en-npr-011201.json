        "Tronc says - points to financial headwinds - New York Daily News is among those papers that's been losing a lot of money for a lot of years - and says that it's positioning the paper for digital success.",
        "Those claims are belied by two things.",
        "The paper - the company has sought to extract a heck of a lot of money from its other properties, notably the Los Angeles Times, which it ended up selling off earlier this year, in cuts - and it's made cuts elsewhere - and also in tapes of conversations that the newly appointed editor-in-chief had earlier today with staff.",
        "He acknowledged they didn't really have a strategy moving forward.",
        "And it wasn't clear - another Tronc official acknowledged it wasn't clear what their strategy was, but they hoped to kind of catch up with the cuts they've already put in place.",

        "And those doctors went door to door interviewing people in the households about births and deaths and asking for death certificates.",
        "And in 92 percent of the cases, people were able to produce death certificates for people they said had died in the war.",
