        "And out of those 650 some thousand excess deaths, 600,000 were due to violence, and the majority of these were related to gunshot wounds.",
        "Related to gunshot wounds - so we're talking about people caught in crossfires, people executed, perhaps?",
        "Probably all of that, yes."

        "There was another sector that was due to other parties, but increasingly, people didn't know or they may have been hesitant to say, but it wasn't really clear who else was involved.",

        "And it's now time for the Iraqi government to work hard to bring security in neighborhoods so people can feel, you know, at peace.",
        "No question it's violent, but this report is one - they put it out before - it was pretty well, the methodology is pretty well discredited.",
        "And Dr. Burnham, indeed there was an earlier version of this story.",
        "As I understand it, you've gone back to get more data.",
        "Yes.",
        "We did a similar study in 2004, a somewhat smaller study, and we built on the findings and the experience of that to design this study, and I think this study clearly has more power and more strength to it by changing methods based upon what we found from the previous survey.",
        "And it's interesting that if we look at the data from this survey for the exact period of time for the previous survey, we get virtually the same results.",
        "So we have confidence in the methods.",
        "Other accounts, other attempts to count civilian deaths in Iraq - the Iraqi body count, for example, Web site, which is run in London, no friend to the United States administration.",
        "They come up with very much smaller numbers, still more than the United States government is willing to admit, but 50,000 not 650,000.",
        "Well, help us better understand these numbers compared to what most Americans pay in taxes."

        "Well, I think probably one of the most well known is in the Congo, where International Rescue Committee, with one of our study authors, carried out a series of studies and found that 3.6 million people had died as a result of conflict there.",
        "Another place where it was used has been in the earlier studies in Darfur.",
        "And there, I'm very proud of the fact that this was carried out by some of our Hopkins former students using the same methodology and using data that has been widely quoted by U.S.",

        "Critics said that the study you did in 2004 had too wide a confidence interval.",
        "First of all, what does that mean?",
        "And second of all, how did you address it in going back and doing more research?",
        "A confidence interval is a, are really two numbers, a low number and a high number, and between those two we would be 95 percent confident that the true number is in that figure.",
        "And the figure that we choose to represent our findings, in this case the 654,000, represents statistically the most likely number.",
        "And the chance of a likely number being less or more drops off fairly quickly as you move to either side of that number.",
        "Now one of the things that will reduce confidence intervals is to increase sample size, and we did increase the sample size substantially this time.",
        "So instead of having 900 households, we had 1,849 households.",
        "So it was a much bigger sample size.",
        "However, when you increase the sample size, you also increase the risk to your interviewers.",
        "So we have to do a trade off here about how much risk we want to expose our interviewers to for the benefit of having narrower confidence intervals.",
        "And so that's an ethical as well as a practical decision.",
        "And you would think that the greatest danger to your interviewers would be in many of the places where the incidence of death is the highest."

        "Well, we are comfortable with the methods, we are comfortable with our results, and I think we are comfortable with the principle message, which we want to come out of this, and that is that the population caught up in conflict is bearing a very serious consequence to this conflict.",
        "And with these numbers, we hope that it will stimulate discussion of how to improve the protection of people in conflict situations not only in Iraq right now, but in the conflicts that will come in the future.",
        "We in this country have an excellent method for monitoring what happens to our soldiers.",
