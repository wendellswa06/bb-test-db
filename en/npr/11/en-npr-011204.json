        "There was a guy name Joe Lieberman who defeated Lowell Weicker in 1988.",
        "Lowell Weicker was elected three - let's see, in '70, '76 and '82, all three times as a Republican.",
        "He later became an independent, when he was elected governor of Connecticut, but while he was in the Senate, he was always a Republican.",
        "Good try, Patrick.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Well, I think it was James Buckley from New York, but - and then the other one I thought was Wayne Morse, but I think he was defeated before Buckley got elected.",
        "That's correct.",

        "Morse was defeated in '68.",
        "For a brief time, Morse was an independent.",
        "He was a Republican who broke because he didn't like Dwight Eisenhower, was an independent briefly, and he was a Democrat, but again as you say correctly that it was before Buckley came to the Senate.",
        "Thanks very much, Dick, and let's see if we can go to Kate(ph), Kate with us from Landgren in Pennsylvania.",
        "Hi.",
        "I have Wayne Morse and Strom Thurmond.",
        "Well, Strom Thurmond actually was - is the only person in the history of the Senate elected as a write-in candidate, in 1954, as you well remember, but since 1956, he was a Democrat, and in '64, he was a Republican.",
        "He was never an independent and certainly not at the same time as Wayne Morse was.",
        "But there's something far more recent than Thurmond and Morse."

        "Right.",
