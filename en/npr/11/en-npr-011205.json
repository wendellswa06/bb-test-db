        "There were some great commercials, television ads on both sides.",

        "We're talking with Marc Mutty, the former chairperson of Stand for Marriage Maine, whose campaign was successful.",
        "Ken?",
        "Marc, obviously same-sex marriage has gone from Maine's state laws.",
        "What about the state legislators who voted for it?",
        "Is there going to be a campaign in 2010, by your organization or similar organizations, to defeat them at the polls?",
        "Well, let's back up a bit.",
        "I was on loan from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, where I work as public policy director, which in essence, I'm a lobbyist for the diocese, and I was on loan to run this campaign.",
        "So my concerns were wider than just the Catholic Church.",
        "But I am now back in the Catholic Church, in their employ as a public policy person, and the Catholic Church does not concern itself with partisan politics, does not get involved in partisan politics.",
        "So that's certainly not an area that you're going to see us involved in in any way, shape or form.",
        "But do you expect a similar kind of effort against these legislators who voted for the bill?",
        "I would think that others would be working that issue.",
        "I know that the National Organization for Marriage, which was very much our partner in this, is going to be working this from a partisan point of view and will be working for candidates who support traditional marriage.",
        "And do you see the lessons of this referendum, might they be applicable elsewhere?",
        "I think so.",
        "I think you look at any campaign like this, any kind of public campaign, you're going to see some trends, and you're going to see certain things that are more successful than others that in all likelihood you can carry to another state."

        "You know, obviously there are differences in fundamental culture from one area of the country to another, but I think fundamentally, people are very similar, and the kinds of things that motivate them are very similar.",
        "So I think, you know...",
        "What do you think actually worked?",
        "I mean, what were the - if you were going to recommend somebody in another state try this, try this, they seemed to work for us.",
        "Well, this is not - it's part art, and it's part science, I think -running campaigns.",
        "And whether it's this issue, and whether it's our side or the other side, we all run basically the same kinds of campaigns based on the same principles.",
        "You know, that first place is that you do extensive research on your audience and see what motivates them and what messages have impact on them.",
        "And that's exactly what we did, and I'm sure that's exactly what the other side of this issue did, as well, and we were able to isolate those kinds of issues that were hot-button issues for them.",
        "And for whatever reason, we found that folks who were very motivated when you spoke of the possibility of this being discussed in school, of this being taught in schools - that marriage would be taught as being either one of several equation, that's either a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, a man and a man, etcetera, and that they are all the equivalent of one another.",
        "And that was an area that people were very, very reluctant to see happen.",
        "So that's what got traction.",
        "I remember that ad.",
        "It got an awful lot of traction and became a very, very central issue in the campaign.",
        "And were you surprised on election night?",
        "Because some polls suggested this was going to go the other way.",
        "Our polling - and again, we did extensive polling, and I think the polling showed exactly what we knew was going to - well, we didn't know, but what we predicted would happen and what did indeed happen.",
        "So there was not a really big surprise.",
        "I think what may surprise some, I suspect that the other side was polling numbers very similar to ours, if not identical to ours, that there's a factor here that you have to throw in for the numbers you are getting.",
        "If you're showing 48 percent of the population is going to vote your way, you've got to throw in a margin of three to nine percent, additional, toward your side for folks who, quite frankly, lied to pollsters about how they're going to vote."

        "And I wanted to ask you a broader question.",
        "Obviously a loss in Maine, we're going to get more details about New York later; a bill shelved in New Jersey; yes a victory yesterday in the District of Columbia.",
        "But what looked like a string of victories, well, it's been a tough year.",

        "I see ourselves, sort of in the middle of a marriage decade.",
        "You know, we've got five states plus the District of Columbia that have marriage, which was not the case five years ago, but as you mentioned, it's sort of all about the ebb and flow of social change.",
        "And so if we've had a couple of losses - Maine and New York, as you pointed out - and we're in that ebbing period, I think the measure of who we are as a community and how successful we're going to be is that we use these times not to sort of walk off the field but to really rededicate ourselves and look down the road and think about what's next and be just as fortified as ever.",
        "Because, you know, for every setback that we have, we're going to find a gain somewhere else.",
        "Okay, Ken?",
        "Joe, every state that has had same-sex marriage on the ballot, 31 states, have all - voters have always rejected it.",
        "Is it a question of strategy for your organization, and is the way to go perhaps maybe state legislature and the courts rather than public referenda?",
        "You know, I think there certainly has been a history of, you know, not wanting to put the rights of a minority to the vote of the majority.",
        "I mean, we certainly saw that when the Supreme Court ruled on interracial marriage, the American people weren't there.",
        "You know, a plurality of people were against interracial marriage at that time.",
        "And so, you know, when I think about the fight for marriage equality that we're in now, you know, we're going down many different roads.",
        "And so it's a state-by-state strategy, and it is governed differently in different states.",
        "So you know, a state like Rhode Island or Minnesota, where we have the possibility, down the road, of moving that bill through the legislature and getting it signed into law, it's obviously the route we'll take.",
        "You know, other states, you know, we've had court cases, as was the case in Iowa.",
        "You know, we've passed it twice through the California legislature.",
        "So where there's an opportunity, we take it.",
        "But the strategy is defined a bit, you know, by state-by-state procedure.",
        "Although at the federal level, I would say that there are a whole lot of opportunities that we have to not necessarily get marriage but to close that economic gap that exists in the absence of marriage, like eliminating the taxes that people pay on their domestic partnership benefits, which is something we're poised to do in Congress right now."
