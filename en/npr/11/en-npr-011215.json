        "Their business model takes the franchise model of McDonald's, merges it with a tablet computer's efficiency at delivering information, automates daily operations through a smartphone, and then plunks the final product down in a Third World slum for $5 a month.",
        "A lot of the premise of Bridge really only works to get to that price point, if you start with the sort of crazy premise that you need to do this for a million kids.",
        "And that's their goal.",
        "Their target customers are the hundreds of millions of parents around the world who live on $2 day and yearn for better schools for their children.",

        "When I was a kid, hearing someone say you must read this actually made me not want to read the book.",
        "The truth is, none of the books I read growing up came close to the real-life stories my uncle, Tio Nico, used to tell me - like the time in the 1930s when the Texas Rangers almost shot his cousin dead along the border, or the one from the 1850s when Indians kidnapped my great-grandfather in northern Mexico and brought him to this side of the Rio Grande.",
        "So maybe you can see why books couldn't compete for the storytellers in my family.",

        "Another story is about a band of guerrillas fleeing from the army's forces, only later to be picked off by vengeful Indians aiming to break their spines like the rotten branches of the barranca, where they've taken cover.",
        "Rulfo wrote only two books, \"\"The Burning Plain\"\" and \"\"Pedro Paramo.\"\" Both classics of Mexican and world literature.",

        "I remember taking a copy of \"\"The Burning Plain\"\" with me to Mexico when I was researching some of the material for my own novel.",
        "To say I felt myself transported back to the time of my distant relatives sounds overly sentimental.",
        "But as I reread these stories, I did have the sense that I was listening to a corrido, a Mexican ballad, describing the injustices and hardscrabble life along the border region and to the south.",
