        "Consider us warned; we'll bear with you.",
        "OK.",
        "So in 2010, Romney had just about $22 million in income, and he paid about 3 million in taxes.",

        "The average tax rate paid by people earning more than a million dollars a year is 25 percent.",

        "How does that happen?",
        "Well, it all comes down to earned income versus unearned income.",
        "And much of Gingrich's income came either through wages - or he has some S-corporations that pass income through to him.",
        "And much of that was taxed at the top individual tax rate, which is 35 percent.",

        "He amassed huge personal wealth when he worked at Bain Capital.",

        "Not everybody was doing it, but just about everybody was aware that it was going on.",
        "So when these revelations came out, when I first heard about them, myself and everyone else that's on the job, we were not surprised.",
