        "The Snowden leaks so upset leaders of the U.S.",
        "intelligence community that they felt compelled to launch a massive damage assessment, to find out what effect the disclosures would have on intelligence operations.",
        "One official says it's by far the biggest such effort ever undertaken.",
        "At the NSA, the assessment has been led by Richard Ledgett, formerly the director of the agency's Threat Operations Center.",
        "He says the big concern is that potential terrorists, whose conversations were subject to NSA surveillance, might change to more secure communication now that details of the surveillance programs have been revealed.",
        "If there's disclosure that, you know, NSA can do this thing or that thing or that thing, then they can take action to close that vulnerability.",
        "But even if terrorists do change their means of communication because of what they find out about NSA surveillance methods, the intercept program, Ledgett says, might still serve a purpose.",
        "The question then becomes whether the existence of the program causes their operations to proceed more slowly or more difficult, less chance for real-time command and control.",
        "For example, when Osama bin Laden learned the NSA was monitoring his satellite phone, he started sending messages by courier instead.",
        "The messages could not be intercepted, but the change meant bin Laden's communications after that were slower and more cumbersome.",
        "The damage assessment itself has kept NSA employees from doing their regular intelligence work."

        "It hasn't caused any major right or left turns yet, in the path the organization is taking, but those things tend to take longer to resolve.",
        "So no redesign of the surveillance architecture; nor has there been any rethinking of the propriety of NSA surveillance activities in light of objections raised by privacy advocates.",
