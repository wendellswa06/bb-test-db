        "So now, many of the elements are there that were simply not there in 2001.",

        "It's very hard to imagine a partner for peace that refuses to renounce violence and refuses to recognize the right of the other partner to even exist.",
        "And so I find rather strange the notion that we should somehow try and engage Hamas, rather than to work with and strengthen the Palestinian president, who shares all of the values that will in fact bring about peace between Palestinians and Israelis; and by the way, a leader, who in his role as chairman of the PLO, has the mandate for negotiations for the Palestinian people.",
        "Why not do both, though?",

        "Well, Hamas is a little more than an enemy of the United States.",

        "We have found reasons to talk to Iran about a limited agenda.",

        "faces a greater terrorist threat now than it did in the past.",
        "Well, I just don't think that that's true.",
        "It's clear - al-Qaida is trying to adapt.",
        "It's not the organization that attacked us on September 11th in terms of its field generalship, in terms of where it does its training, in terms of the financial ties that it has.",
        "It's not surprising that they're trying to adapt and to reconstitute.",
        "But we are stronger, too, in the way that we can resist them.",
        "We are stronger, too, in the allies who are fighting them actively in Afghanistan, fighting them actively in Pakistan, fighting them actively in Saudi Arabia.",
        "They don't have the kind of umbrella of protection that they once had by the simple silence and incapacity of so much of the world to deal with them.",

        "Al-Qaida in Iraq did not exist before the U.S.",
        "invaded Iraq, and the National Intelligence Estimate finds that al-Qaida regenerated itself in Pakistan.",
        "Could you argue that we are, perhaps, engaged on the wrong front, that we're fighting the wrong war, that we should be focusing more on Afghanistan than Iraq, where we could truly strike at the heart of al-Qaida?",
        "We have to focus on all of these fronts, because — just to be totally accurate, Zarqawi, who is the founder - was the founder of al-Qaida in Iraq - was in Iraq prior to the war.",
        "But the al-Qaida in Iraq that has emerged has emerged as an enemy of the Iraqi people.",
        "And the Iraqi people are fighting back against it."
