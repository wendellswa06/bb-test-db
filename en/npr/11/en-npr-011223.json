        "Since the late 1980s, the literary reputation of Japanese writer Haruki Murakami has grown enormously.",
        "Alan Cheuse has a review of his latest story collection, titled Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman.",
        "In a brief but revelatory introduction to this new collection, Haruki Murakami makes clear the pleasure he takes in writing short fiction rather than novels.",
        "I find writing novels a challenge, he tells us, writing stories a joy.",
        "Thanks to the persuasive translations of Philip Gabriel and Jay Rubin, who have divided up the stories between them, most of these stories offer the same kind of pleasure for the reader as the writer had in making them.",
        "The sincere and simple title piece, for example, tells the story of two cousins who take an odd bus trip to a hospital ear clinic.",
        "Their journey along with, as it turns out, a group of strangely inappropriate fellow passengers, sets a tone somewhere between the off-hand and the fantastic.",
        "One of the story's many bizarre moments takes place when one cousin, who suffers hearing problems, asks the other to look inside his ear.",
        "I've never looked at anybody's ear so intently before, the fellow says.",
        "Once you start observing it closely, the human ear, its structure is a pretty mysterious thing with all these absurd twists and turns to it, bumps and depressions, surrounded by this asymmetrical wall, the hole of the ear gapes open like the entrance to a dark, secret cave.",
        "The other stories in this book are equally whimsical, magical and daring.",
        "In, for example, Man Eating Cats, a young Japanese couple takes an extended getaway on a Greek island where the wind blows from the edge of the world, and consciousness takes a peculiar turn for both of them.",
        "In the charming story The 1963/1982 Girl from Ipanema, the girl of the title takes time out from her samba-like walking to gulp a beer and stare at the hole in the top of the can as if the entire world were going to slip inside.",
        "The Iceman tells the story of the ultimate cold marriage.",
        "Jazz pianist Tommy Flanagan appears in one story.",
        "Another stars a talking monkey.",
        "Murakami himself appears in a few others.",
        "The best of these linger far beyond the reading of them, creating an aura about the world that for many of us just wasn't present before we read them in the dark secret caves of our inner ears.",
        "The book is Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami, translated by Philip Gabriel and Jay Rubin.",
        "Our reviewer, Alan Cheuse, teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.",
        "The United Nations and the World Health Organization released an update today on the global AIDS epidemic.",
        "There are alarming reports of HIV continuing to spread in southern Africa.",
        "More than 30 percent of the pregnant women who came to the clinics tested positive for the virus.",
        "HIV did decline in some countries, and overall anti-AIDS drugs slowed the death rate.",
        "NPR's Brenda Wilson has more.",
        "The number of people with HIV increased in every region of the world, except the Caribbean, and that includes the United States and Europe, where rates of infection were up among women and gay men.",
        "It's estimated that 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, an increase of two million since 2004.",
        "Dr. Jim Kim, the director of WHO's AIDS division, says the most worrisome news came from southern Africa."

        "There are six countries in southern Africa in which more than 20 percent of the pregnant women have been shown to be HIV-positive.",
        "There are two countries in which the percentages are greater than 30 percent: Swaziland and Botswana.",
        "Swaziland's a small country, but 43 percent of the women in the clinics are positive--the pregnant women are positive.",
        "These are just horrendous, horrific numbers.",
        "In Swaziland, more than half, 56 percent, of pregnant women between the ages of 25 and 29 years old were HIV-positive.",
        "Kim says that the reason is that in the push for treatment, prevention has often been forgotten.",
        "But many countries, he says, see the scale up of treatment as an opportunity to encourage people to be tested.",
        "The southern African country of Lesotho will ask everyone in the country to get tested.",
        "Congress let that happen the first year, but then it worried that if the cuts continued, doctors would stop taking Medicare patients.",
        "So lawmakers started voting to make the cuts go away, at least temporarily, only there the was a problem: budget rules meant that cancelling the cuts added money to the federal deficit.",
        "And the longer the cuts got delayed, the bigger the price tag got.",
        "Each year, the threatened reduction is so unmanageable that we can't even figure out how to pay for it.",
        "That led Congress shorten the delays from two years to one year, and now to a month or two at a time.",
        "But while it's a real emergency for those involved, Rother says the problem hasn't registered much on the national radar.",
        "So it's really hard to explain and really hard for anyone to understand, who's not in the middle of it.",
        "But those who are in the middle of it, like the American Medical Association, are furious with Congress for letting it get to the point where whether or not doctor pay will be cut is decided on a month-to-month basis.",
        "James Rohack is the AMA's president.",
        "From a fiscal standpoint, when they say, well, gee, we can't do it because it will add to the deficit, well, the reality is every one of these temporary patches has grown the deficit.",
        "They could have fixed this three years ago for less than $50 billion.",
        "Now it's over $210 billion.",
        "It'll continue to grow if they don't deal with the actual formula.",
        "But the doctor's proposed fix - to repeal the current formula in its entirety - isn't a good solution, either, says Rother of the AARP.",
        "We don't want to just remove all limits on what doctors can charge.",
        "That's a good way to get to bankruptcy."
