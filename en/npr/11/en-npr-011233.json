        "After waiting several hours in line this week to buy one bag of cement, Rabiya Garmout blamed the lack of Palestinian leadership.",

        "Most people want to finish the split between Fatah and Hamas because we are suffering too much.",
        "The leaders, I think they are the problem.",
        "His Fatah uncle was killed during the violence seven years ago.",
        "The family accepted $36,000 from Hamas as compensation then returned the cash in a public ceremony.",
        "El Hessy says that was a gesture of mutual respect that Palestinian leaders would do well to follow.",

        "Colin Kaepernick's legal battle with the NFL is over.",
        "The former 49ers quarterback, whose decision to take a knee during the national anthem in 2016 to draw attention to police misconduct sparked protests throughout sports as well as a fierce backlash, has signed a confidential agreement with the NFL.",
        "The agreement, which included former teammate Eric Reid, settles claims that team owners conspired to blacklist them for their activism.",
        "But the debate continues about the effectiveness of such a protest and the way forward.",
        "To talk more about this, we've called professor Harry Edwards, professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who's been one of the country's most influential thought leaders on the role of athletes in society.",

        "Professor Edwards, thanks so much for talking with us.",
        "Thank you so much for having me.",

        "Well, I think it's important that this be gotten off the road.",
        "One, the movement itself is in decline.",
        "These types of movements have a life of about six years.",
        "And if you go from 2012, when the Miami Heat and D Wade and LeBron first put on hoodies, up until 2018, you can see that pattern persist.",
        "So I think, one, the movement itself is in steep decline.",
        "Two, I think that it's in the interest of all involved that this be resolved so that, one, the league can go back, do an assessment of how this situation was managed in preparation for the inevitability of other issues coming over the stadium wall in a league that, by the middle of this next decade, would be somewhere between 82 and 85 percent black.",
        "And, secondly, I think that Colin has made a heck of a contribution, and I think that he should be able to exercise the full range of his options.",
        "It's interesting that you seem, in a way, to have sort of foreshadowed this because you wrote a piece last May, arguing that athlete activists should move beyond protests.",
        "Why do you say that?",
        "These types of movements are on the clock.",
        "The Black Power movement lasted for six years, from 1966 to approximately 1972.",
        "And if you're going to move beyond drama to actual substantive achievement, you have to begin early on to come up with plans, to come up with perspectives that will allow you to move from protest to policies and programs and progress.",
        "If that doesn't happen, then you get into a cycle of just protesting.",
        "And that most certainly is not conducive to substantive change.",

        "Federal agents have searched the home of Alaska Senator Ted Stevens.",

        "NPR's Martin Kaste has been following developments from Seattle and joins us now.",
        "Why search his home, Martin?",
        "Well, Steve, it all seems to date back to a remodeling job on Steven's house back in the year 2000.",
        "It was a pretty big remodeling job.",
        "They doubled the size of the house and there's some doubt about who paid for the construction.",
        "The suspicions seem to center on an oil executive named Bill Allen, and some people seem to believe that he oversaw the whole remodeling job and maybe even the billing.",
        "So right now investigators are going back, they're talking to contractors, they're trying to figure out who paid for what.",
        "And apparently yesterday they were paying close attention just to the amenities, to the details on the property and on the house itself.",
        "It almost looked like they were assessing the value of the job.",
        "So as they looked at the real estate, we have to look at the possible connections here.",
        "Is it significant that an oil contractor would be involved somehow?",
        "It's very, very significant in Alaska because this executive, Bill Allen, used to be the chief of VECO, which is an oil services company based there, and if you're a politician in Alaska these days, you don't want your name connected to VECO.",
        "That's because VECO executives have pled guilty to bribing state officials.",
        "And right now one of them, Bill Allen, is cooperating with investigators."

        "He's been there from the very beginning.",
        "He was apparently working in the Eisenhower administration during the campaign for statehood, he helped organize it, and he's been part of the territorial government, part of the state government, in federal government, and he's just been there from the beginning.",

        "But as to Senator Stevens, he did sort of go against his lawyers' better judgment and he talked about this with reporters two weeks ago, and he told reporters that he and his wife paid for every bill they got for that renovation with their own money.",
        "Can I just ask what Senator Stevens' constituents are saying, thinking, reading about all this?",
        "Well, there's some dismay because Senator Stevens has been such a big figure in the history of the state, and in his Uncle Ted role, you know, there's a lot of affection for him.",
        "They've named the airport after him in Anchorage.",
        "But as this investigation keeps broadening out to more and more officials, both state legislators and now it looks like members of the federal delegation to Congress, there seems to be some real disquiet here.",
        "And in fact the governor of the state, Sarah Palin, was elected last year challenging her own party, her own Republican Party, challenging the incumbent governor, in part on the ethics issue, and she was elected on the strength of that.",
