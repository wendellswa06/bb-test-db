        "And I'm Robert Siegel.",
        "During the Olympics, most people focus on the marquee sports: swimming, track and field, gymnastics, maybe basketball.",
        "But, of course, there are many less-watched sports, from archery to team handball, and in the past few days, NPR's Frank Langfitt has been paying attention to some of the contests that unfold away from the limelight, and he's on the line with us now from Beijing.",
        "So Frank, what did you see today?",
        "Well, tonight I went to see the men's saber final, and I saw China win its first fencing gold in about 24 years.",
        "The guy who won is named Zhong Man.",
        "He's a handsome, 6-foot, 3-inch fencer, and he's not really all that well-known on the international scene.",
        "In fact, afterwards at the press conference, the reporters were sort of asking, you know, where did you come from and sort of how did you pull this off?",
        "Well, fencing is certainly a minor sport in the United States.",
        "Is it big in China?",
        "Do people seem to know about it there?",
        "No, not at all.",
        "It's not well-known at all, but tonight, you know, people were completely into it.",
        "The scene was very festive.",
        "The two men were fighting on this big stage that was spot-lit.",
        "It was kind of theatrical.",
        "In between the matches, they played the \"\"Pirates of the Caribbean\"\" theme, and people were stamping their feet, waving Chinese flags.",
        "When the man who got the silver medal, the Frenchman - at one point he was behind in points, and he knelt to tie his shoe, and I think the crowd thought he was stalling, so they started booing him.",
        "Afterwards, I met a reporter from Tianjin Daily, it's a newspaper on the coast outside of Beijing.",
        "The woman's name was Su Ya Wei(ph), and she was so excited she was literally shaking.",
        "I asked her why, and this is what she said.",
        "(Speaking foreign language)",
        "She said, we Chinese have waited a long time for a gold medal.",
        "I believe everybody in the world will be proud of him.",
        "He's the best.",
        "Well, at least he'll be very famous in Budapest, I think, after winning a medal in fencing.",
        "But what other sports have you been watching, Frank?"

        "Well, a few days ago, I went to badminton.",
        "It's obviously completely different from fencing in the sense that it's really popular in China but not all that popular in the West.",
        "The match was between a Canadian, her name's Anna Rice, and an American, Eva Lee, and so you had these two North Americans in front of about 4,000 cheering Chinese.",
        "I only know badminton from a net in the backyard, and this is a completely different game.",
        "You had these looping serves that would go about 40 feet in the air, and there were some line drives, and I was reading a book - some of the drives go as fast as about 150 miles an hour.",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, how was the match that you saw?",
        "It was really exciting.",
        "There were long rallies.",
        "Just before the match point, Anna Rice hit this dink shot that sent Eva Lee sprawling, and then on the next one, she got her to hit it into the net.",
        "Now, this is a sport that the Chinese do see on television.",
        "They're familiar with it.",
        "How did they react to all of this?",
        "They loved it.",
        "I think they really love seeing people from Western countries kind of really take to a sport that they have dominated for years, and when Rice was walking by the stands, hundreds of people were cheering for her and reaching out to her.",
        "And frankly, I think one of my favorite moments of the games so far was when she took off this - she had a red sweatband on her wrist and she threw it into the stands, and everybody was cheering.",
        "It was just this sort of great moment between two, you know, really different cultures.",
        "On the way out, I asked her the difference between playing in China and playing in Canada, and here's what she said.",
        "Fast forward through the magic of radio.",
        "Richard Barrett has a long history of going to towns embroiled in racial controversies and protesting, he says, for local whites.",
        "On the Web site, he runs an excerpt from what he also says is an interview that he did with Jena's mayor, Murphy McMillan.",
        "In that interview, Barrett called protesters in towns like Jena, invaders.",
        "I asked Barrett about the interview."

        "And I noticed that he said to me - he thanked me for the support and he said, we're going to hold the line.",
        "And, you know, that's the real message of Jena that Al Sharpton can huff, Jesse Jackson can puff, but Jena is still there and the American flag - not the flag of the Republic of New Africa - is still going to be flying over that town.",
        "I think that's a lesson for America.",
        "Do you have any doubt in your mind, as you had this conversation with the mayor, that he understood that you were a white supremacist for a nationalist organization?",
        "Well, first of all, we are a nationalist organization and we're a pro-majority organization.",
        "Let's try to keep that - we're democratic organization.",
        "Well, the people in Jena, they've got a lot of backbone.",
        "And I don't know that they're going to need a whole lot of organization because they did just what the people in Budapest did to the Soviet tanks.",
        "They turned their back on them and that's probably the message of Jena.",
        "Did Mr. McMillan, the mayor, know that you were recording him or expect this to go up on the Internet?",
        "Well, I didn't record it but I have a very good memory and I just did it for memory.",
        "But he seemed like he knew who I was and he was very accommodating.",

        "The first read in part, we are grateful for your bringing this to our attention.",
        "I was contacted by Mr. Barrett Tuesday prior to the rally.",
        "We had no idea of who he is or of his affiliation.",
        "The statements you provided me are inaccurate and that I do not recall - him using the term invaders at any point.",
        "In terms of his wanting to use a portion of the town, to quote, \"\"oppose these colored folks,\"\" end quote, it was my impression in responding to him that regardless of his philosophy, if you wanted to exercise his rights of free speech, I had to be accommodating rather than oppositional.",
        "I did not know I was being interviewed.",
        "I do not want my name or my town associated in any way with any white supremacist group or any group that preaches race hate.",
        "Now that I know about Mr. Barrett's inaccurate statements contained in your e-mail, I will insist that the conversation be removed from his Web site immediately.",
        "We've then asked the mayor specifically whether he had thanked Mr. Barrett, the mayor replied with the following e-mail.",
        "To supplement my earlier response, I also take strong exception to the part where I am quoted as saying, quote, \"\"your moral support is appreciated,\"\" end quote.",
        "That statement was not made.",
        "For someone to try to twist my words to bring about a conclusion that I or my town would support a white supremacist group is repugnant to me.",
        "Again, that's the statement from the mayor of Jena."

        "We usually kick off the show with a few headlines and today is no different, though we thought we'd go back a bit to America in wartime past.",
        "We start with an edition of the Washington Post dated June 6, 1944.",
        "Up to that point Nazi Germany had occupied all of Europe, marching its troops to the western-most beaches of France.",
        "And it was on those beaches in and around Normandy that allied troops began a brutal but successful campaign to push the Germans back.",
        "The Post headline reads, \"\"Allies Land in France, Wipe Out Big Air Bases.\"\" Below the headline is a rough-hewn sketch of the English Channel showing all of the Allies' landing points.",
        "And to the left of the drawing, in far smaller print, small enough the average reader might altogether miss it, is a second story titled, \"\"Roosevelt Sees Costly Fight Ahead for Victory.\"\" Did he ever.",
        "Our next war headline is 24 years later, January 30th 1968.",
        "America was firmly entrenched in Vietnam.",
        "The North had vowed to observe a truce in honor of the sacred Tet holiday.",
        "But on that fateful day, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops began a massive assault on dozens of strategic locations throughout the country.",
        "The move caught American and South Vietnamese forces off guard.",
        "The January 30th edition of the New York Times picks up a very beginning of what would become the Tet Offensive with a surprisingly small headline, \"\"Viet Cong Attack Seven Cities, Allies Call Off Tet Truce.\"\" Few knew how big the story would become in the following days.",
        "Instead, the paper's main headline reads, \"\"Record $186 Billion Budget is Presented by Johnson; Tax Rise Required, He Says.\"\" Indeed, it was that one-two punch of looming tax hike and North Vietnam's striking show of force that helped turned Americans against the war.",
        "So all that leads us directly into today's Memorial Day headline.",
        "The global war in terror is in it's sixth year but it will soon be the second most expensive conflict in U.S.",

        "Late last week, Congress passed a long-awaited supplemental bill that will fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through September.",
