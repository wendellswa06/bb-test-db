        "The atmosphere had become one of, oh, mistrust among some of us.",

        "The Civil Rights Division has an outstanding record of hiring minorities.",
        "The voting section in the Civil Rights Division is one of 10 sections.",
        "And over the past five fiscal years, 27 percent of the new attorney hires in the Civil Rights Division were minorities.",
        "And an important point to make is that this is nearly triple the national average of minority representation in the legal perfection - profession, which the ABA says is about 9.7 percent.",
        "And, of course, we can do better, but we're doing very well now compared to the national average.",
        "And we certainly cast a wide net when we look for new attorneys, and always are open to people from all different diverse backgrounds.",

        "Do you know how many are African-American?",
        "Attorneys in the section, I don't think that Mr. Rich is incorrect in saying that, but it's also important to talk about the productivity of the section, which has been extremely good on behalf of all minorities over the last six fiscal years.",
        "So you've mentioned that the recruiting efforts and 27 percent minority hires in recent times - Teresa Lynn mentioned that she thought the quality of lawyers brought into the DOJ had lowered, and she said that the new attorneys don't have an interest in civil rights issues in the same way as the past.",
        "What are your thoughts on that?",
        "You know, that's completely unfounded and unfair.",
        "We hire the best and brightest attorneys that are available, and we will continue to do so.",
        "And when hiring attorneys, we certainly measure three important things among others when we're evaluating these candidates in the Civil Rights Division.",
        "And that's whether they've demonstrated a record of excellence, whether they are talented attorneys consistent with that excellent record, and whether they share a commitment to the work of the division.",
        "And that's very important to us.",
        "We certainly consider diverse backgrounds when hiring folks.",
        "Again, Teresa Lynn, who we spoke with - retired civil rights analyst - compared in an email the atmosphere to a plantation.",

        "I will say that in any large organization - there's some 700 employees in the Civil Rights Division - there are going to be individual grievances, and that we do have robust mechanisms in place to resolve allegations of unfair and untoward treatment."
