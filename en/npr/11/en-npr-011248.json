        "The TCAPS device looks pretty much like a pair of earbuds with some built-in electronics.",

        "She says using the device changes the way you hear the world and takes some getting used to.",
        "So that's why we are very careful when we issue the devices that we train the users on how to use them and we allow them time to adapt to them.",
        "Although the Pentagon knows how many TCAPS devices have been deployed, it's trickier to know whether troops are always using them in the field.",
        "Doug Brungart says troops can be wary of anything that could limit their hearing on the battlefield.",
        "We really need them to feel like they are still able to maintain their awareness.",
