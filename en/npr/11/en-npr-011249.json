        "We are indebted to The New York Times for news of Major League Baseball's latest adventure in questionable sportsmanship.",
        "The Times reports that investigators from Major League Baseball found that the Boston Red Sox at their home stadium, Fenway Park, stole signs from catchers on the New York Yankees and other visiting teams through the use of an Apple Watch.",
        "The Red Sox have since complained that the Yankees did something similar at Yankee Stadium.",
        "Well, joining us is the New York Times' Michael Schmidt, who broke the story.",
        "Thanks for joining us.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Let's explain first for the non-baseball fans in the audience.",
        "Catchers flash signals - finger signals - to the pitcher telling him what pitch to throw and where, and those signals are supposed to be out of the batter's view.",
        "What did the Red Sox allegedly do?",
        "The Red Sox were able to use video equipment to figure out which - what those signs meant.",
        "And they basically were able to relay that information to the - to a runner on second base who was then able to pick up the signs and relay to the hitter the type of pitch that was coming.",
        "All of that is OK under baseball's rules.",
        "There's no problems with that.",
        "Where the Red Sox ran into problems is that they had a trainer on the bench with an Apple Watch receiving information about what signs the other team was using.",
        "It's the technology that's the problem here according to Major League Baseball.",
        "Correct.",
        "You can do whatever you want with your eyes essentially.",
        "But you can't use binoculars, and you cannot use electronics in the dugout to communicate with people outside of it.",
        "That's against the rules.",
        "I thought when there's a runner on second, you change the signals because the runner is - the baserunner is trying to steal the signs.",
        "O'GRADY: You know, it's weird when you were saying he's coming back like that, I thought you were talking about the Messiah.",
        "How so?",
        "The - Somalia as a nation was the result of the merger of two former colonies, Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland.",
        "And this took place in 1960.",
        "When Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991 and chaos ensued, a section of Somalia, the former British Somaliland, seceded and set up a government in what they call Somaliland, which is not recognized by other countries on this planet, and it has not been recognized by the United States.",
        "What's happened very recently, however, is that noises have been made - particularly out of the Department of Defense, but also out of Congress - about recognizing Somaliland because of its alleged stability, but also because of its proximity to the Red Sea and the Persian Arabian Gulf."

        "And I think what we have to understand is that if the United States goes forward and recognizes Somaliland, it may, in fact, set a chain of events to unfold that over which no one will have any control.",
        "It's sort of along the lines of when Germany recognized Slovenia and later Croatia, which contributed to the dismemberment of the former Yugoslavia, that other groupings may look at this as a sign that the United States will give them recognition.",
        "And I don't mean just in Somalia.",
        "I'm talking about in other parts of the continent.",
        "So this is a very risky proposition, and I would say that it's better for the United States to try figure out how it could help to unify Somalia rather to splinter it.",
        "All right, let's move on to Rwanda.",
        "A Spanish judge recently indicted 40 Rwandan military officers on several grounds of genocide, human rights abuses and terrorism.",
        "Spain's high court has accused the officers of involvement in mass killings in the early 1990s.",
        "Now Rwanda does not have an extradition treaty with Spain, and officials in Rwanda have denounced the indictments as politically motivated.",
        "What, Bill, is the significance of these indictments?",
        "Very, very peculiar, Tony.",
        "These are indictments - not against the people that most of us would think would be indicted.",
        "These are indictments against those who overthrew the perpetrators of the genocide.",
        "So let's just go back for a second.",
        "In 1994, Rwanda was in the middle of a civil war.",
        "In that, there were peace negotiations, and at a certain moment the president, the then president of Rwanda, is killed when his plane is shot down.",
        "Almost instantaneously, a genocide carried out by the Hutu military against Tutsis and Tutsi allies took place in which somewhere between 800,000 and a million people were killed in roughly three months.",
        "The perpetrators of this genocide were ultimately defeated by the forces of the Rwanda Patriotic Front, and they were driven out of Rwanda, in most cases into refugee areas in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
        "The indictments are against individuals who were connected with the Rwanda Patriotic Front.",
        "And basically, the indictment seem to say that these individuals perpetrated crimes against the Hutus.",
        "Now they may have.",
        "I mean, that's something that a court will have to judge, but it's very odd in that you have outside of the borders of Rwanda, the equivalent of the Waffen SS.",
        "You have these four perpetrators of the genocide that are still free and are running around in - often in refugee camps and have not been brought to justice.",
        "And so in that situation, going after these individuals seems a bit odd.",
        "It's not to say that they are innocent of having perpetrated crimes, but it seems that the justice is a little bit unbalanced here.",
        "Well, you know, something else had caught my eye - and I'd like for you to explain to the audience - is this: the connection between Rwanda, and Spain and why Spain is prosecuting these war crimes.",
        "The technical reason that Spain is prosecuting them has to do with the murder of some Spaniards in Rwanda.",
        "And they may have been murdered, executed or so-called collateral damage in the war that was going on between the Rwanda Patriotic Front and the Hutu, perpetrators of the genocide.",
        "It's not quite clear, but basically, it's because of that reason that Spain is taking these actions.",
        "And that's not, that's not a ridiculous idea.",
        "I mean, that is, it is not unprecedented for a country to bring charges, as took place in Britain - or was about ready to take place in Britain - against the former dictator of Chile, Auguste Pinochet.",
        "So - because British people were killed when he took over in 1973.",
        "So that's not unusual that Spain would take such a step.",
        "What is unusual is that these were not the perpetrators of the genocide.",
        "When we're thinking about the Rwandan genocide, it is not about crimes that were committed against the Hutus.",
        "It really was the crimes that were committed by the Hutu military against the Tutsis and the Tutsis allies among the Hutus.",
        "So these indictments were brought against the people who fought against the people who caused the genocide."

        "It was then - it then confronted the Red Sox.",
        "And they admitted to this, but they said that the manager and the front office knew nothing about it.",
        "We're talking about one of the great rivalries in baseball - between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees.",
        "So it was probably inevitable that the Red Sox would say, they do it, too.",
