        "He's quite proud of it.",
        "He kind of flaunts it sometimes.",
        "And - but at the same time, this allows Maduro and his socialist government and their supporters to paint Guaido as a puppet of American imperialism.",
        "And as for some kind of military action, the enthusiasm for that seems to be waning within the Trump administration.",
        "But Guaido points out that this idea is catching on among average Venezuelans.",
        "(Speaking Spanish).",
        "And what he's saying here is that things are now so bad that if you talk to people here about regime change, they'll tell you that it needs to happen by any means necessary - including a U.S.",
        "invasion.",
        "John, that is really striking, given the United States' history in Central and South America, to hear that Venezuelans might welcome an intervention.",

        "So he's reproducing certain hospital sounds and playing them back to patients who spend the night in his sleep lab.",
        "So what we do is go around and record sounds: helicopter landing, toilet flush, people taking, doors slamming, beeps and boops of all kinds of alarms.",
        "And then we play them at strategic positions during sleep to see what are the rhythms of the brain that are responsible for protecting sleep.",
        "Ah, if we could tap into those elements and understand when sleep is disrupted from a sound and when it isn't, then maybe we can be much more nuanced about the neuro-scientific approach to helping people protect their own sleep in noisy environments.",

        "Now you see that riding on top of those, and interspersed in between, are faster signals.",
