        "It turns out that the stomach of a crab is a very, very complicated mechanical device.",
        "It doesn't just digest food.",
        "It also chews it and filters it.",
        "This requires the crab's nervous system to coordinate 42 different sets of muscles.",
        "So it's really sort of a biomechanical wonder.",
        "And Marder says the way a crab processes lunch has a lot in common with the way a ballerina does plies.",
        "Both actions rely on circuits of nerve cells that fire in a sequence."

        "Instead of sending instructions that include each muscle contraction needed to take a step, it just says, activate the walking rhythm.",
        "What's interesting, he says, is that the brain seems to use this rhythmic shorthand for some motions that don't appear rhythmic at all, like reaching.",
        "You start with your hand in one place, and you move your hand to another place.",
        "There's nothing rhythmic about that.",
        "But when Churchland took a closer look, he found something really surprising.",
        "That pattern of muscle activity is the sum of two rhythms.",
