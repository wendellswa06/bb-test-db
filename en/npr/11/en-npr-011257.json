        "Right, because there followed plans C, D and E as well, which you all lay out in your piece in Slate, involving or reacting to changes of commandant on the part of the U.S., the growth of the insurgency, the sectarian divide between the Sunnis and the Shiite Muslims in this unhappy land.",
        "So by your count, the surge is actually plan F.",
        "At least plan F, that's right.",

        "There are serious political questions about whether the Iraqi government is stable enough to support and whether the regional powers are going to continue to stir up trouble.",

        "Robert George, one of the things that we want to talk about, though, not just with major-league ballplayers, is the growing problem of steroid use in this country.",
        "It is, if you include illegal transactions, a billion-dollar industry, quite frankly outgrossing the domestic box office dollars for this country.",
        "Are we looking at this intently enough?",
        "Well, I think Rafael Palmeiro's statement to Congress may go right down with the first George Bush's `Read my lips' as one of the more embarrassing public statements ever made, but I think it is certainly something we definitely need to look at in terms of kids using it.",
        "My own concern is, though, that the congressional hearings we had earlier this year became a little bit too much of a platform for grandstanding on the part of Congress.",
        "And I was a little bit uncomfortable with the flurry of legislation of Congress trying to regulate major-league baseball.",
        "I mean, as embarrassing as the Palmeiro news is, in a sense, it actually does show that the policy that baseball has instituted is working because they've got a really big star that they've identified.",
        "Bev Smith, when we look at statistics that suggest that there are 4,000--4,000 steroid transactions that take place daily on the Internet, and that does not include any illegal transactions that go on, and close to 3 or 4 percent of steroid use in this country is by teen-agers, I ask you the question of whether or not we are focusing on this problem intently enough.",
        "I don't think we're focusing on the problem intently enough.",
        "I have to disagree with my friend Robert George, and he's probably not surprised by that, that it was an embarrassing statement.",
        "Hi, Robert.",
        "I don't think it was an embarrassing statement.",
        "I think it could have been that Jose did--Rafael did not take those drugs and was not taking those drugs at the time of his statement.",
        "What bothers me is that we have not investigated steroids enough, the impact, and a lot of women get steroids in medicine prescribed by doctors.",

        "It could have been in an acne medicine and it laid in his blood.",
        "And I think that's where we're missing it.",
        "We need a complete investigation of the impact of steroids and the prescribing of steroids legally before we condemn so many people for their usage.",
        "Pedro, what of the culture that we are growing our young people in, in relation to sports?",
        "Frankly, for those of us who played when we were younger and know and understand the want for winning that is bred in you, quite frankly, even before high school and you will, the serious athlete, do just about anything, that's a culture that's going to be hard to curb.",
        "Oh, that's a very good point, and I think the hypocrisy on this issue is really what the big problem is.",
        "We live in a society where drugs are pervasive.",
        "We know that for these athletes the stakes are so high, they're being paid so much money, they're being told that their careers ride on how well they perform.",
        "If there were politicians out there who knew that if they take a performance-enhancing drug it would improve their chances of being elected, they would take the drug.",
        "That's--it's simply an issue of these drugs being made available and the athletes knowing that it does, in fact, work."

        "Bev Smith, when you take a look at all that has occurred, including the leapfrogging economically of Hispanics over African-Americans--we should note that the most recent figures show the median income of Hispanic family, a Hispanic household is just under 8,000 at 7,932.",
        "That's almost $2,000 more than a black family, just under $6,000 at 5,998.",
