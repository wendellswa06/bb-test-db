        "But I do think there's other signs.",
        "The election of Villaraigosa in Los Angeles, potential election of--at least it's a Democratic nominee in New York I think all point to the fact that, on a number of issues, blacks and Latinos do recognize a common interest.",

        "In Kabul tonight, Mr. Obama signed a long-term agreement with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.",
        "At that ceremony, he spoke about the toll of war.",
        "Neither Americans nor the Afghan people asked for this war.",
        "Yet for a decade, we've stood together to drive al-Qaida from its camps, to battle an insurgency and to give the people of Afghanistan the possibility to live in peace and in dignity.",
        "The wages of war have been great for both our nations.",
        "But today with the signing of the strategic partnership agreement, we look forward to a future of peace.",
        "I think I would agree with that, and I also would have to say that, you know, we also say, you know, there's this rift between Hispanics and blacks.",
        "I mean, it may also be more appropriate to say, you know, some Hispanics in some cities, some blacks in some cities--I mean, I don't--which Hispanics are we talking about?",
        "I mean, if--in New York Puerto Ricans and blacks I think have a pretty good relationship partly because, as Bev was saying, you've got the sort of Afro-Latino background that goes on there.",
        "It's a little bit more complicated in Los Angeles, and it's always been a lot more complicated in Los Angeles.",
        "But I think also, too, you do have to be a little bit concerned when, you know, the president of Mexico can feel, you know, comfortable saying a racist statement about the fact that Mexicans go to America and take the jobs that blacks don't want.",
        "Where is he getting those kind of signals from?",
        "And if there is a certain kind of racist sensibility coming from the leaders, from the elected class, we as leaders ourselves have to speak out against that.",
        "Let me just interject...",
        "Well, you know...",
        "...this story, Bev, that we were going to talk about but it is part and parcel of what we're discussing here and that is recently we saw a Little League team file a protest against an umpire who ordered the players of that Little League team to stop speaking Spanish during a state tournament.",
        "The suggestion was that the umpire, because he did not speak Spanish, was concerned that they could potentially give illegal instructions to the players.",
        "Yet many see this as just one of those ideas of the hatred, quite frankly, that we see many what I call the ugly Americans in that they do not like, quote, \"\"immigrants\"\" who come here now and don't speak the language, though ofttimes their forefathers and generations before them did the same thing.",
        "Well, that's why, Ed, I kind of get upset when I hear the term rift being used.",
        "This is a multifaceted issue.",
        "You're talking about an issue of the American attitude of people who come to this country and speak another language.",
        "That has to be addressed.",
        "We need to look at that, not the fact that a person speaks Vietnamese but the fact that there may be signs in Vietnamese, not a fact that a person speaks Spanish, but the fact that ballots may be written in Spanish.",
        "That's one issue.",
        "And that should be looked at differently than the issue of the rift.",
        "I think again--and I have to say this, and I think there's a reluctancy for us to accept the fact that media has played a big part in the divide, if there is a great divide.",
        "When you position on the front page of the newspaper the term, `The Browning Of America,' just like you say, `The white men will be in the lesser of our society by the year 2010,' you're creating that kind of an atmosphere and I think a lot of this may be contrived.",
        "There are serious issues around the language problem.",
        "That should be separate from what we're talking about when we say that African-Americans and Spanish-speaking Americans don't get along.",
        "Yeah."

        "Well, I would just quickly say, you know, that headline of the `Browning Of America' was supposedly a kind of positive statement.",
        "And also actually, though, there was also a very nice little kind of story in The New York Times recently where Rick Peterson, pitching coach for the Mets, had to go out and talk to his Korean picture, looked around the diamond and saw a Venezuelan second baseman to a Polish-American first baseman, an Italian-American catcher and so forth and he was having difficulty speaking to his pitcher and he turned around to them and he says, `Don't any of you guys speak Korean?",

        "Yeah.",

        "Bringing justice to the al-Qaida leader was a big national security victory for President Obama.",
        "In some ways, though, there - many Americans were saying, well, if we've gotten bin Laden, what are we still doing in Afghanistan?",
