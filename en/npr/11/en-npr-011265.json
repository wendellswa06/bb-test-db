        "What felt different about it?",
        "Well, it's a remarkable thing because - for example, the park where I used to go jogging in 2003, it was a dead, dying, spooky, absolutely deserted place.",
        "I mean, really, really creepy.",
        "There were these checkpoints around.",

        "And actually it was dusk in Adhamiyah, again which was a complete no-go zone two years ago, absolutely under control of the insurgents.",

        "But what we saw last night looked like the popular notion of a filibuster for a little while, a matter of hours.",
        "But it was really more of a demonstration of extraordinary interest and impulse on the part of these senators with the intention of having an impact, in this case, on gun laws."
