        "We still have trillion dollar deficits.",
        "Beyond softening his own image and roughing up the incumbent's, Romney also wanted to come across as a reasonable alternative to the president.",
        "He repeated his pledge to replace Obamacare but promised to retain the most popular elements of it.",
        "He said he wanted to repeal the Dodd-Frank bank regulation law but promised to keep many of its reforms too.",
        "Asked how he would govern at a time of partisan gridlock, Romney presented himself as a moderate bridge builder, not the severe conservative he said he was during the primaries.",

        "The day after I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders - the Democratic leaders as well as Republican leaders and - as we did in my state.",
        "We met every Monday for a couple of hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in our state in that case.",
        "We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground and the challenges America faces right now.",
        "Look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country and we face - this deficit could crush the future generations.",
        "What's happening in the Middle East - there are developments around the world that are of real concern.",
        "And Republicans and Democrats both love America, but we need to have leadership, leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat.",
        "I've done it before.",
        "I'll do it again.",
        "Mr. President.",
        "First of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.",
        "And, Mr. Obama said, being a leader means having a plan and being able to explain what it is.",

        "What's important is occasionally you got to say no to folks both in your own party and in the other party.",

        "Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.",
        "When we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no - yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.",
        "And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it that you are for but also being willing to say no to some things.",
        "And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.",
        "During the debate, Romney seemed more energetic and forceful, and he looked like he was enjoying himself more.",
        "The president, by contrast, was less crisp and animated, and he often failed to pursue his own usual lines of attack.",
        "He never mentioned Romney's 47 percent comments, his career at Bain Capital, his tax returns, or his positions on immigration or abortion.",
        "Last night the instant polls of viewers and the expert analysis produced a consensus that Romney had, quote, \"\"won\"\" the debate.",
        "But it won't be clear for several days what impact that will have on the race.",

        "Yesterday, the governor won in a recall election and by a slightly larger margin than his first election.",
        "On the losing end was the Democrat Walker beat back in 2010, Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee.",

        "Wisconsin had never had an election like this.",
        "Exit polls at first called the recall a dead heat.",
        "Turnout was very high in strongholds for both Democrats and Republicans.",
        "So it was a huge surprise when less than an hour after polls closed, the big TV at Governor Walker's campaign party in Waukesha suddenly flashed the word winner next to his name on the screen.",
        "The crowd went crazy.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)",
        "An NPR poll released this past week shows that Democrats are in trouble.",
        "They hold a 39-seat majority in the House, but there's a strong possibility they could lose control of it after this November's midterm election."

        "I sat down with the former House speaker to ask whether he sees any parallels between 2010 and 1994.",
        "Oh, I think in some ways, it's a lot like 1994.",

        "In '94, they were irritated with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and they were tired of the Democrats being in charge of the Congress for 40 years.",
        "But there wasn't the underlying sense of national problems that you have today.",
        "Do you think that the Republicans can recapture the House and the Senate?",
        "Oh, I think there's a very high likelihood they'll recapture the House because if you looked at the latest - actually, NPR poll in the 70 swing districts, and you realize that 60 were Democrat districts and 10 were Republican, I mean, you go into any game where one side has 60 seats at stake and the other side has 10 seats at stake; you automatically know the bias is in favor of very real change.",
        "One of the lessons, presumably, you learned in 1994 was that being in opposition is very different from having real legislative power.",
        "One of those things was, you actually had to work with Bill Clinton to get things done.",
        "It seems as if today, Republicans tend to be punished by the party when they work in a bipartisan fashion.",
        "There's a huge difference between conservative bipartisanship and liberal bipartisanship.",
        "We were for welfare reform.",

        "People understood it thoroughly.",
        "It had 92 percent approval in the American people.",
