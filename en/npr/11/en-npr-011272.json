        "How much does that complicate things?",
        "I mean you got reporters asking questions as well as counselors and police officers and district attorneys.",
        "Well, it can complicate the situation only to the fact that, to the point that the families, you know, really have a difficult time, you know, not, sort of - not getting away from the press but having to deal with so many of the questions that are coming their way.",
        "What we would hope is that after a period of time when the families - when some of the dust has settled - that these families will be able to take the time that they need, you know, in a private way.",
        "And then they can, again, working with their treatment professionals, be able to do the kind of work that's going to be needed in order move their families both ahead."
