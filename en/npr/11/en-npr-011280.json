        "If Scott had just given his friend insider information, if he hadn't taken anything in return, he probably would have got in some trouble, but he would not have been guilty of insider trading because under insider trading law, the person providing the information has to benefit in some clear away.",
        "And so when the FBI showed up at his house not long after that, Scott immediately knew what it meant.",
