        "And Mara, as we look toward tomorrow, how do things stand?",

        "He has also a very big lead in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut - those are states where Rudy Giuliani once was strong and as we know, Giuliani has endorsed him.",
        "Mike Huckabee, who's still in the race has - very strong in the southern states like Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Tennessee.",
        "And, of course, he's aiming all of his fire at Mitt Romney, who still is in the race.",
        "However, California, where the polls are pretty close - that has where Romney's been spending most of his time.",
        "Although a lot of Republicans are wondering, why isn't Mitt Romney spending money like he really means it?",
        "In other words, not just seven figures on an ad buy, but 10, 20, $30 million plunked down on the table.",
        "Mara, if you could just remind us why the Republican race can be wrapped up much quicker than the Democratic race?",
        "Again, at least that's the way it looks right now.",
        "Yes, because they have winner-take-all primaries.",
        "And McCain not only has a big lead, but the structure of his party's primaries can magnify that lead.",
        "Because tomorrow, if he wins by one vote in New York or New Jersey or Connecticut, he gets all the delegates.",
        "And in that sense, if he does do that, the Republican Party will be finally reverting to form.",
        "It is an orderly party; it hasn't been so this year.",
        "But if he does wrap it up on Tuesday, he can turn his attention to trying to unify the party in figuring out how to reach out to conservatives while not losing his appeal to independents.",
        "You know, this is moving so fast.",
        "We go to one contest, it seems like we automatically set our sights on the next one.",
        "But the sort of overarching narrative here seems to be this amazing comeback by John McCain.",
        "There's no doubt about it.",
        "It's the most extraordinary story of the election.",
        "Nobody expected what happened including myself - and I'll order up my serving of crow here - but he was down to bare metal, he had to take out a loan, a bigger loan than any candidate has ever taken out.",
        "He needed an insurance policy on his life to get the loan.",
        "He still doesn't have a pollster to this day."

        "But if McCain is nominated, it would be a real revolution in the Republican Party.",
        "This is a candidate who doesn't have the support of the religious right establishment or the conservative establishment or the talk show hosts, and they are usually the building blocks of a Republican campaign, not the final obstacles to one.",

        "The argument here, based on some policy insider I interviewed actually yesterday, was that while General McChrystal was the face of the offensive in Afghanistan and the sort of re-commitment of troops there, he was also the face of the bargain that Barack Obama had made when he announced the escalation last winter, which was we're going to try this for a year and we'll see if it works or if it doesn't.",
        "And so that if, when the reassessment point came this coming December, it seemed the plan was not working, then General McChrystal was entirely committed in all ways to saying, okay, we've tried this and it hasn't worked.",

        "And Ronald Reagan, who was relatively big tent, although clearly a conservative on social issues where he didn't really push on the abortion front, on immigration where he approved a bill that have, you know, widespread amnesty for a lot of illegal immigrants and some other factors.",
        "He would have been seen as sort of too wishy-washy in a way to pass muster these days.",

        "This is something that happened to the Democrats, too, though, Jim.",
        "Sure.",
        "In the 1970s and the early '80s, I think many people observed the Democrats were trying to figure out, were they a party driven by interest groups, could they appeal to the mainstream of America.",
