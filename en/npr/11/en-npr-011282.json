        "First of all, it is close physically.",
        "There was all the time a train that was going from Haifa to Beirut.",
        "We had been always dreaming that Beirut, and especially Beirut of the last years, who after the civil war and after all the problems finally found its identity, and the secular aspect of Beirut, and the Christian, Muslim combination and the Mediterranean identity - all this are fascinating us and we are very much having desire to relate ourselves.",
        "We think that they're our friends, even when I speak with Elias Khoury and he's very harsh on the Israelis, and still we have a common language.",
        "So for us it is not just bombing, I don't know, a foreign place, and this is the reason why we say it all the time, we don't have to go so far because we have to live with the Lebanese forever.",
        "I think, though, you missed the point of my question.",
        "In this whole, you know, sort of looking at trying to come to terms with your humanity in dealing with civilian deaths, I'm wondering how Israelis reacted to the high numbers of civilian dead in Lebanon?",
        "But we had also civilian deaths.",
        "We had civilian deaths.",
        "The Hezbollah was shooting only on civilians.",
        "Only on civilians.",

        "So the question - of course the question of civilians.",
        "But who were - the Hezbollah did not have uniforms.",
        "They were hiding with civilians.",
        "So what we can do?",
        "There were 1,000 Lebanese that were killed, and we had about 160.",
        "Believe me, Israel could kill far more (unintelligible) capacity, for more civilians if we had the intention - intention to kill civilians.",
        "But this was not.",
        "This Hezbollah would be happy if they could kill 1,000 Israelis, because they meant to kill civilians.",
        "They were shooting on civilian cities.",
        "Mr. Khoury?",
        "Yes, I just want to say something very - something, something - although 1,000 Lebanese civilians were killed, and 47 Israelis only were killed, I feel sorry for the Israeli civilians, and I was expecting for Mr. Yehoshua to say the same, and not to say that he could kill more.",
        "As if he is giving us (unintelligible) favor not killing 10,000, for example.",
        "And I suppose that the role of the writer is not to defend his country.",
        "The role of the writer is to defend what is right.",
        "And I'm really astonished.",
        "I know the work of Mr. Yehoshua and I have a big respect for his literary work, and I'm really astonished how he is advocating anything done by Israel instead of just trying to see the complexity of the things and to say - how someone will dare to say that the children of Kana, the house (unintelligible) children of Kana, the katyusha were in the bedrooms.",
        "This is nonsense.",
        "Yehoshua went to war and he knows that.",
        "You cannot put katyusha in the bedroom.",
        "Mr.",
        "Khoury, please, this was evident...",

        "Actually, Khalil was telling stories and he was inventing stories, and he was creating the different versions of the love story of Eunice on one hand and the different versions of the Palestinians - of the Palestinian catastrophe of 1948 on the other hand.",
        "There's this one point in the novel where Khalil says to Eunice, We've made a shelter out of words, a country out of words.",
        "And through the telling and retelling of these stories, you figure out toward the end that many of them end up being myths.",
        "I wanted to ask about the stories or myths that have emerged about this most recent conflict.",

        "There is no one house which is not destroyed, and all the villagers were there walking up on the rubble of their houses, and they were holding the keys of their homes, of their houses which are no more; that is, you have the key and you don't have the house anymore.",
        "And I think this image of people with keys of houses which are destroyed is a big myth because keeping your key, then you have the house, even if the house is destroyed and you go back."
