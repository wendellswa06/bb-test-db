        "He said he would encourage states to do away with the death penalty.",
        "There was virtually no discussions around criminal justice reform, although the president did sign into a law the Fair Sentencing Act, where it narrowed but did not eliminate the disparities between crack and cocaine sentencing.",
        "So within that regard, when we look at his first term, it seems that there was much more focus on managing racial conflict than dealing with the legacies of racial inequality.",

        "I was very pleased.",
        "It's the sort of thing that I think will be so useful that I've been watching for it to happen.",
        "And the balance between the technological power to do it and consumer acceptance of the idea is really what I've chiefly been wondering about because it takes really both before an invention like that can get the money to really push it into all the things it can be.",

        "The kinds of things that can be displayed on Google Glasses, though, a little bit primitive from the point of view of your world in \"\"Rainbows End.",
        "Right.",
        "There's sort of two or three major steps that would have to be done forward from that announcement.",
        "For instance, if you look at the video, the clip that went along with it, which I believe was a simulated user's-eye view, the video augmentation was essentially a tickertape strip across the top of the field of vision.",
        "And so one of the first things that - improvements that one would really hope for would be very high resolution, say, 4,000 pixels by 4,000 pixels.",
        "And that's the sort of thing that actually is probably easier to do with very, very small displays than with very, very large ones.",
        "So if there were a market for it, I think we would start seeing that, which would mean that you would then have, in your eyeglasses, the capability that you now spend thousands of dollars for to hang a 100-inch flat-panel TV screen on your wall.",

        "The most advanced screen that a lot of people are talking about is on the new iPad.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's, right, a good example of doing that in the small.",
        "And as you're talking about the kinds of things that can be displayed, one of the principal applications of augmented reality in your book was communications.",
        "And I never knew how it was pronounced though.",
        "I read it in the book, these kind of instant text messages.",
        "I didn't - I never knew whether it was meant to be pronounced S-M-ing or sming.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So it was really - in addition to all the other things we're talking about, there was sort of added technology there, namely the ability to pick up on cues and sub- vocalizations so that you could be undertaking something, like what we do present day with cellphones.",
        "But those around you would not necessarily be aware that you were communicating unless you wanted them to know."

        "How is this close-focus problem going to be handled?",

        "Right.",
