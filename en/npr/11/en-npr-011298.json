        "Here's an email from Lisa in Fairbanks: How will I use increasingly mobile computers?",
        "As a photographer and writer, I look forward to be able to take photos with a computer that's able to see the world around me as I do and then add text to the image immediately.",
        "There's always a bit of a disconnect with older technologies.",
        "I can either be taking a photo or taking notes about the photo I've taken.",
        "It's never been simultaneous unless it's been video.",
        "I've used tape recorders while photographing and find the writing process and the speaking process are not the same for me.",
        "Neuroscientists confirm this too.",
        "They involve different sides of the brain, thus shape the creative process uniquely.",
        "I look forward to a future where my written thoughts and vision can merge and be shared in a more immediate form.",
        "Then again, as a shy person, this simultaneously terrifies me, but that would probably be another show.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Yes.",
        "I think - and I share that interest in those improvements.",
        "I think actually when people talk about improvements in computers, at least half of the game is improvement in the input-output interface that we humans have with the computers.",
        "So just as the things that she's talking about there that she's wanted all this time, that's exactly where an enormous amount of commercial effort is being put in order to make that easier and easier.",
        "And finally to have the facility that when you deal with these technological things, it's as easy as in the past it was for a human to remember their own memories or to reach out with their hand and pick up a, you know, a plate from the table.",
        "You want to make these things that we're getting with technology to be that easy and transparent to us.",
        "We're talking with science fiction writer Vernor Vinge about the world he envisioned in his novel \"\"Rainbow's End,\"\" a world that seems to be entering new possibilities as we talk about Google glasses.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And this email from Ivan in Conway, Arizona: As the father of the technological singularity, do you think Google glasses are pulling us toward it?",
        "And perhaps, you ought to explain what the technological singularity or what some people call the Vingean singularity is.",
        "Ah, the technological singularity, at least my definition for such a thing, is the possibility that in the fairly near future, that we humans using technology will either create or become beings of super human intelligence And that's a different sort of thing than talking about almost any other sort of invention.",
        "For instance, we've been talking about the head-up displays and what they could become.",
        "We don't know how that's going to turn out, but if somebody could come back from the future and tell us, we would understand what they're talking about.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"\"THE GOLDEN GLOBE AWARDS\"\")",
        "Aside from the fact that it's been hugely mean-spirited with mildly sinister undertones, I'd say the vibe of the show is pretty good so far, wouldn't you?",
        "On the other hand, after the technological singularity, you're dealing with creatures that are smarter than we are.",
        "And in that case, for them to explain to us what's going on would be a little bit like a human trying to explain to a goldfish what is going on.",
        "So that sort of an event is actually a very profound technological change, in my opinion, quite different from - in the past.",
        "And in answer to Ivan's specific question, I think that anything that radically improves our ability to deal with our automation is a step in that direction.",
        "In particular, it's a step in the particular path toward the singularity that involves our becoming the creatures that are super intelligent.",
        "As opposed to artificial intelligence becoming that creature, yeah.",
        "Right."

        "He has a follow-up question.",
        "What do you think about the amount of attention the singularity has gotten in recent years?",
        "Ah, I think that barring, you know, physical disaster, like a huge nuclear war or something, that sort of attention is bound to increase as time progresses, whether or not the singularity actually happens.",
        "I think the singularity will happen, but as we go forward in time and get these improvements in automation, the sort of promise of this sort of stuff becomes more and more visible, and the use of automation to do more and more complicated things continues - will continue to make this question a more intensely interesting question to higher and higher percentage of the people.",
        "And this email from Daryl: I used to be a student of Vernor Vinge, a wonderful professor.",
        "I'm legally blind.",
        "He writes, I'm wondering, how would this work with those individuals?",
        "We do have iPhone apps that can give turn-by-turn navigation, but all those other features of Google glasses would not be present.",
        "Sort of two possibilities there: One, is the sort of thing that I was talking about, learning to use the devices that you have and that you are wearing.",
        "That depends on the plasticity of the human brain.",
        "We're quite capable of learning new tricks and cooperating with the devices that we have to get results that we may be barred from getting in other ways.",
        "The other approach to this sort of thing is to actually look at where the blindness happens.",
        "If the blindness happens within the eyes, then you want to just go a little bit upstream from that and see whether the neurons behind that are still capable of responding to stimulus and then figuring out how to stimulate them directly without the light.",
        "If that's gone, then you're talking about something, perhaps, much harder, which is to go upstream from that and look at the beginning of neuron interpretation of sight that's happening within the brain and actually making your input at that level.",
        "Have you signed up for Google glasses yet?",
        "Ah, no, I haven't.",
        "I'm - however, I am watching it eagerly, you know?",

        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "Vernor Vinge, retired professor at San Diego State University, the author of \"\"Rainbow's End\"\" among many other books; \"\"Deepness in the Sky,\"\" you might remember.",
        "He joined us from NPR member station KPBS in San Diego.",
        "A spokesman for Dick Clark tells NPR the long-time television and radio personality has died.",
        "We do not, as yet, know the cause of death.",
