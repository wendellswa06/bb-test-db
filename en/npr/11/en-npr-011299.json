        "Wisconsin, which has been in the Democratic column since 1988 or rather that was the last time it was in the Republican column - oh no, excuse me, it has been in the Democratic column since 1988, and Pennsylvania which has gone Democratic the last four times running.",

        "Probably not given that the preponderance of polling seems to show that people thought Joe Biden did a better job in the debate overall or if you will, won the debate.",
        "Now, of course, everyone's been commenting on Sarah Palin's performance which was better than expected.",
        "But, it doesn't seem to be making a big game changer kind of difference because people in the end preferred Biden as vice president.",
