        "He was not part of the Roman nobility, and he was certainly not in line to rise to the consulship, to the highest office in Rome.",
        "Also, he was a bit shy and reserved, and he was not particularly good at associating, making small talk with people.",
        "So Quintus decided to give him this no-holds-barred advice about how to win an election - all the down-and-dirty facts.",
        "And there's one piece of wisdom at the beginning that I found most striking, and sounded to me most modern.",

        "I want to be consul.",

        "It was great advice for him to do every day because as an outsider, Cicero - Marcus Cicero stood very little chance of being elected as consul.",
