        "He said, how can the man establish friendships when he can't even remember anyone's name?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "That's one of Quintus' pieces of advice - is, always remember the names of your supporters.",
        "That was one of the tamer things he said about Antonius.",
        "He reminded Cicero to expose all of the sexual scandals that Antonius had been involved in, which were pretty bad.",
        "He got elected anyway but still, that was important - was to always keep in mind your opponent's weaknesses, and to exploit them.",

        "Campbell argued that in most cases, dealers are just helping consumers arrange financing with banks.",

        "They're arranging loans for their customers with banks or finance companies.",
        "But the transaction is a huge profit center for dealers, and there are lots of ways for dealers to make money in the process, says Shahan.",
        "You fill out a credit application and a dealer submits it to a lender.",
        "And what they're not telling you is they get a kickback in exchange for raising the interest rate on your loan.",
        "Michael Harrington, chief lobbyist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, says there's no need for the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency to oversee auto financing because it's already regulated by the states, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission.",
        "Less than 1 percent of the complaints to the FTC were auto- related, so it's really a solution in search of a problem.",
        "But David Vladeck, director of consumer protection for the FTC, disagrees.",
        "Most people who have bought a car that they're having a problem with complain to either their state attorney general or their county or city consumer protection authority.",
        "So the fact that we see only a small fraction of the complaints doesn't mean that this is an area that shouldn't be regulated also by the federal government."
