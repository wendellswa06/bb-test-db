        "But unlike western classical music competitions, where a panel of experts rates each performance, McGraw explains gamelan competitions in Bali rely mostly on audience reaction.",
        "You play for 10 minutes, and the other group's looking at you from across the stage, and they're trying to psych you out.",
        "And they're kind of giving you dirty looks sometimes.",
        "And the audience lets you know in real time exactly how they feel about your performance.",
        "And any slight mistake, this audience goes crazy and will hoot and holler.",
        "I mean, it's really - it's more like a soccer crowd.",

        "But we're saying that this is a crisis, and that there was an affordable housing crisis because most of the affordable housing was wiped out by hurricane Katrina and the breaking up the levees.",
        "So the federal government should be doing something very quickly and is obligated to do something very quickly to get their units back up online and to let people move back in.",
        "And so, again, it's about accountability, it's about, you know, government accountability.",
        "It's about whether or not there's the will to get these folks home.",
        "And then whether or not this city and the state will do something to kind of even out the market to ensure that the people who lived in New Orleans prior to hurricane Katrina can actually live there; instead of having kind of like a Cape Town, South Africa, where you can live outside of the city and work in the city, but you can't live in the city.",

        "And it's ironic and it's unfortunate because over the last seven years, John McCain has worked very hard to mend fences and to build bridges to conservatives who, in the past, have been very suspicious of him on any number of issues.",
        "And it looks to me at least from out here that all of those bridges and all of those fences that were built over seven years got destroyed during the immigration debate.",
        "And the conservatives who were angry with him in the past over campaign finance reform or global warming or the Bush tax cut may have been mollified on those fronts but were even angry about his role in the immigration discussion."
