        "Not just a role, a leading role; it was called the McCain-Kennedy bill.",
        "Oh, of course.",
        "And it's ironic because one of the problems that the senator's campaign, I think, faced early on is it attempted understandably to become the establishment campaign of the Republican primary.",
        "And I say understandably because historically, that's the way Republicans have nominated their candidates, by choosing the candidate who has the broadest and deepest support among the party's establishment.",
        "Is Senator Obama having any success, do you think, with his shift away from Senator Clinton and more to focus on John McCain?",
        "So in many ways there was not that much as a surprise, but more disappointment.",
        "You're hearing the voice of Frederick Harris, a professor of political science and director of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia University.",
        "I want to bring James Fallows into the conversation.",
        "He's a national correspondent at The Atlantic and also a weekly contributor to WEEKENDS ON ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, and he joins us from his home in Washington, D.C.",
        "James, nice to speak with you again.",
        "Thank you very much, Celeste.",
        "You've written about two conflicting narratives in Barack Obama's presidency.",
        "Do they somehow overlap with what Frederick Harris here was talking about?",
        "I think they do, and the two narratives you're referring to is I did a long piece about a year ago, which I then revised, essentially on whether Obama should be considered as a chess master who's thinking ahead 12 steps in his negotiations with foreign powers and with the domestic constituency and with the Republican opposition, or should he be considered a pawn who is behind the curve in thinking about how people are going to stand up to him.",
        "And I argued that on balance he was more ahead of events than behind them, but it's a very, very complex balance, where his presidency began in ways that he didn't foresee, with the financial collapse, and where any presidency is a mixture of very closely aligned pluses and minuses."

        "And in regard to the question of whether President Obama as the first nonwhite president has done enough on the racial justice front, one of the points I made is that almost every president ends up disappointing and, in a way, betraying the people who are his most fervent original base because once he gets in office - that when he's running for office, he can promise anything; once he becomes president, it's a matter of all the finely sliced compromises any president has to make.",
        "Let me go back to you, Frederick Harris, because I have to say, if there was one thing that surprised me, and maybe I've naive, after all these years of being a journalist, but I was surprised by the opposition, not that people would oppose his policies but that many of his policies I would consider to be centrist.",
        "Many left-leaning liberals were very upset at how centrist his proposals were, and yet sometimes it felt as though there was opposition simply to whatever he proposed.",
        "Right.",
        "And does that kind of temper your disappointment to any extent?",
        "Well, it does a bit.",
        "I mean as the first black president in an environment, in the political environment that's been not only polarized by partisanship but also polarized by race, and this happened before Barack Obama came into office, of course, certainly there's going to be that tension there.",
        "But again, I just want to go back to when the last Democrat was in the White House, who was called a liar, a cheat and was...",
        "President Bill Clinton.",
        "Bill Clinton.",
        "And was impeached.",
        "And the way he was treated, in fact, he was dubbed by Toni Morrison, the writer, as the first black president because of the way that he was being treated by the Republican Party and conservatives.",
        "So that's just to say that that environment always exists, particularly for Democrats, and this goes back from '64 campaign in opposition to the Civil Rights Act with Senator Goldwater, all the way to the '72, to the '80s with the 1988 campaign, where Willie Horton, the black man who was let out of prison and raped a white woman, was used to undermine that candidacy.",
        "So what I'm saying is, is that that kind of discourse has always been a part of the political landscape for decades.",
        "Yes, it was heightened under Barack Obama, but my point is, is that that should not be used as an excuse to address these issues.",
        "If it's always used as an excuse, nothing can get done.",
        "Well, let me go to you, James Fallows, and in the balance, is there a way to objectively weigh Barack Obama's first term?",
        "I've seen lists of legislation that Barack Obama's White House has passed, as opposed to others, the number of bills he's gotten signed.",
        "Certainly I think it was a surprise to everyone that Barack Obama's health care passed; it was quite a surprise to me, anyway."

        "How do you examine this objectively?",
        "Well, first let me make a meta-point about how objective we can be about presidents' first terms.",
        "And then my assessment would be - one of the reasons I wanted to do my big Atlantic piece before the elections last year is that once a president has either won a second term or been defeated in that quest, as the first George Bush was and Jimmy Carter was, who I once worked for long ago, everything about that president's first term is viewed retrospectively in a different light.",
        "the president was rejected, and therefore we think that the balance must have been negative, that it must have been sort of faltering steps.",
        "But if he is re-elected, as of course Bill Clinton was and George W.",
        "Bush and now Barack Obama, we tend to think there is a larger logic behind these things.",
        "But stepping aside from that, I think that in the purest objective way, we can say there were more successes for failures - than failures for President Obama: number one, the disaster that didn't happen in terms of the world financial crisis; number two, getting the health care bill passed.",
        "And now since he's been re-elected, that's going to be enacted.",
        "And I would say number three, doing something that did not seem a gimme four years ago, which is winding up the wars both in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "If you recognize how contentious and traumatic those were five and six years ago, and to have them essentially both on the exit path for the U.S., I think those are significant achievements.",
        "We're talking about Barack Obama's first term, as we are on the eve of his inauguration for a second term.",

        "I was surprised at the significant strides the president has made in improving race relations between Native Americans and the federal government.",
        "Not only in signing an executive order to increase coordination between tribal governments - the president has significantly improved health care for Native Americans with the Affordable Care Act and has provided a lot of funding for tribal communities in Indian country, and the signing into law of the Tribal Law and Order Act made reservations much safer.",
        "Well, thank you very much for calling.",

        "Yes, and I think on the Gitmo point, there's an - I would view this in a different way from the expansion of executive authority more generally.",
        "I think one area where I personally disagree with the Obama administration has been its continuation in general of the idea of executive authority for drone strikes or whatever, the fact that he didn't go to Congress for the limited Libyan intervention, et cetera, that we had.",

        "To place policy above rhetoric, Harris writes, is not to ask what the first black president is doing for blacks.",

        "There's been a collapse in the net worth of African-American families in the first term.",
        "It wasn't all caused by specific policy decisions in the first term.",
        "And also if you look at the way that basically after the stimulus money started to run out and states and local governments were laying off huge numbers of employees, you look at what's happening in the postal service, that a lot of the basis of the black middle class, economically speaking, is in these government jobs and post office jobs, and that employment has really been decimated.",
        "I don't think there's been nearly enough attention paid to what is actually the reversal, economically, of 30 years of economic progress.",
        "The gap in household wealth between black and white hasn't been higher in a generation.",
