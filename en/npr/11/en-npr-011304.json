        "But I do want to go back for a moment because I think there are some successes that I do want to mention that haven't been brought up.",
        "And that's particularly with the LGBT community and their pressuring the president around issues of gay marriage and the eradication of \"\"don't ask, don't tell.\"\" I think that that's absolutely important.",
        "It's a milestone.",
        "The president should get some credit in regards to that.",
        "And so I think, you know, looking back at that, that I think will be his most important civil rights milestone and something that he should be indeed credited for.",
        "So has this really stepped up this election year.",
        "That's Frederick Harris.",
        "He's a professor of political science and the director of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia University.",
        "He's also the author of \"\"The Price of the Ticket: Barack Obama and the Rise and Decline of Black Politics.\"\" He joined us from our New York bureau.",
        "Thank you so much for being here.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let me then go to you - James Fallows is still with us, national correspondent at The Atlantic.",
        "Do you see, as somebody who kind of stands back, do you see any intersection that's not politicized?",
        "I mean I assume once you take politics out of it, as Americans there are successes and disappointments.",
        "Sure, and I think that's the case for any president.",
        "We tend, especially the more they recede into the past, to say this person was all successful, you know, the sainted Ronald Reagan or the effective Bill Clinton, this person was all a failure, the first George Bush, Jimmy Carter, even though the failures accomplished lots of important things, and the successes had lots of setbacks along the way.",
        "I think the - if we have the reality, number one, that politics has become much more polarized over the last generation than before - and I think people on both sides agree with that - number two, that there was going to be resistance and challenge for the first nonwhite president - after Barack Obama's election four years ago, he had - there was a kind of surge in approval for him.",
        "Many people who didn't vote for him felt good about America, that America had crossed the threshold, but that did ebb.",
        "But I think what really is going on here in my view, it's been for a long time, as Walter Russell Mead has written over the years too, a very difficult time for the middle of American society.",
        "America as a whole has kept getting richer, but most Americans have gotten poorer over the last generation or so.",
        "And the public is under strain in all kinds of ways in the U.S.",
        "now.",
        "And so I think that President Obama has not been able to address that, as President George W.",
        "Bush was not able to and President Clinton was only in certain ways."

        "So I think that problem for America is reflected in some of the frustration we feel about our politicians of the moment.",
        "OK, our question for listeners out there is what you saw during the first term that perhaps surprised you.",
        "And on the line now from Panama City Beach, Florida, is Paul.",
        "Paul, what surprised you?",
        "I'm really astounded that the president expended so much political capital on health care in the midst of the worst economic recession we've seen in 80 years.",
        "I mean none of the people that caused the recession have gone to trial, much less prison.",
        "Nothing has changed.",
        "And thanks to Dodd-Frank instead of Glass-Steagall, the banks are still too big to fail.",

        "If you want to call in, you can dial 800-989-8255.",
        "So James Fallows, when the history books are written, do you think that people will look at Barack Obama's first term as the term of health care?",
        "I think they will.",
        "I think they will, and I actually had a fascinating time, about a month ago I was interviewing - or I was being interviewed by Bill Moyers, who of course had been a young aide to Lyndon Johnson when Medicare was being passed.",
        "And he was saying that Johnson told him at that time Medicare was ferociously controversial in 1964 or '65 when the struggle to pass it was going through, and Johnson was saying, you know, 20 years from now, people will assume this was part of the U.S.",
        "Constitution, they took it for granted.",
        "I think that once this bill takes effect over the next five or 10 years, people will come to rely on it in the same way that they did on Medicare.",
        "I think the emergency President Obama faced, of course, was the economic collapse.",
        "I think personally the biggest missed opportunity (unintelligible) a tradeoff in the medical care bill was any kind of climate legislation, which obviously he was not able to do in the first term and may not in the second either.",
        "Well, Walter Russell Mead, let me take this, the idea of the economic collapse back to you.",
        "What worked and what didn't, not just in terms of stimulus, but you heard that caller and his frustration over the fact that many Americans feel nobody was held accountable.",
        "Well, I think it's - you know, I mean as Jim said earlier, the fact that, you know, we didn't go into sort of full-blown repeat of 1933 is, you know - considering just how deep the crisis was when the president took office, is something to reflect on.",
        "That may end up, arguably, as his greatest achievement.",
        "But I think the stimulus, you know, was problematic in that it - the way it was set up, it didn't actually deliver a lot of stimulus right when the economic crisis was worst.",
        "You remember all the stuff about the shovel-ready projects.",
        "It turned out there - you know, there's no such thing as a shovel-ready project.",
        "So in a sense, when the emergency was at its worst, there wasn't a lot of money.",
        "And you end up getting the president sort of on the political defensive because the headline numbers for the stimulus were very, very large, but the actual impact in terms of jobs and employment was disappointing.",
        "So you know, I think that put him off-balance."

        "There's no experience...",

        "I think - but I think he's learned a lot on the job.",

        "That's Pat saying that in fact the bailout for the banks made it possible to get a bailout for the auto industry.",
        "They certainly were part of the same bailout moment in the first year of the administration's dealing with the financial markets...",
        "Although that was began during the Bush...",
        "Sure.",

        "Yes.",
        "Certainly, the banks were - what was interesting I think about the - while the bank bailout was sort of a reluctant all sides holding their noses - Republicans and Democrats alike - the auto bailout was a much more sharply partisan division where the Obama administration making a choice - this is something we're going to try to do when there were strong voices at the time as we recall of then ex-Governor Romney saying this was a waste, better to have the bankruptcy system just take it through.",
        "So I think that was - the car industry, I think the administration deserved to take as one of its successes.",
        "Again, it's a mixed record, but the fact that the industry is now relatively strong and that there are many more manufacturing jobs, especially in the upper Midwest, than there would have been if that decision went the other way.",
        "I think...",
        "Yeah.",

        "And then in the second term when - second half of the first term when he had sort of lost the 60 votes in the Senate and had lost control of the House, it was tougher, and there was - the Republicans felt at that point they had momentum, so they were harder to deal with.",
        "Now, we're in a new situation since where the Republicans still control the House, but really, you know, the Democrats won the popular vote for the House, the Democrats increased their strength in the Senate, and the president got a solid re-election, so what we've seen is three different negotiating environments in the three two-year segments of his term.",
        "Yeah.",
