        "Yeah.",
        "...since that, you know, you didn't hear a lot of Cabinet people going off and having even a big public profile, and there was definitely a sense that serious decisions about serious matters were made by the White House and then executed by the Cabinet departments.",

        "I don't either.",
        "You know, we've had, you know, we've had micromanagers, you know, no one has said that President Obama was trying to schedule the White House tennis courts, which is I guess what people said about Jimmy Carter at one point."

        "He's somewhere in between in management style.",
        "But I don't think it was the team of rivals thing that people talked about at the beginning with a lot of struggles between strong will people.",

        "Well, in the last couple minutes that we have, let me give you both the same question, which we touched on earlier, but James Fallows, if you were to look at one thing that you think will eventually define President Obama's first term, what would it be?",
        "Sorry for my medical absence a few minutes ago.",
        "That's OK.",

        "And the real question is, do they get better?",
        "And I think Obama is getting better.",
        "I think the fact that he was able, as Walter was saying, to avoid economic catastrophe - that is a significant achievement and be able to - I guess he will be seen now, it seems possibly, as presiding over the growth of a different sort of natural Democratic majority, something that would have seen very strange 10 or 15 years ago when the Democrats were on the run but actuarially in...",

        "Well, the least bad option seems to me is continued efforts to try and persuade Iran not to acquire a nuclear weapons capability, and if that unfortunate event were to transpire to rely upon the same strategy the United States relied upon throughout the Cold War against far more dangerous and far more powerful countries like the Soviet Union, which is a strategy of deterrence and containment.",
        "There is in fact no reason to believe that Iran is actively seeking a nuclear weapon at this time.",
        "They're clearly exploring having control of a full nuclear fuel cycle.",
        "They're clearly enhancing their enrichment capability, but we have no evidence, not even in the IAEA report, that they have made a decision to actually go ahead and build a nuclear weapon, which is what the non-proliferation treaty forbids.",
        "What we ought to be doing as energetically and persuasively as we can is try to convince them not to cross that particular line, and I think there are various ways we might be able to do that.",
        "You say containment worked with the Soviet Union and the United States.",
        "Would it work with Iran and Israel?",
        "Two nuclear weapons going off in Israel effectively ends that state."
