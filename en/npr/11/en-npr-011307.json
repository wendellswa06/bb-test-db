        "First, win a primary, get a trip to Florida where Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are today after victories in Kentucky and Oregon.",
        "Florida's primary delegates are still in question because the state held its primary earlier then Democratic Party rules allow.",
        "But Senators Clinton and Obama are both there today because regardless of who wins the nomination, that state is going to be very important in the fall.",
        "Joining us is Slate.com's chief political correspondent John Dickerson.",
        "John, what do you make of both senators, Obama and Clinton campaigning in Florida as though both are going to be the nominee?",
        "Well it gives you a sign of how still muddled this race that is all, but over still is because Barack Obama got the important number of majority of pledged delegates which moves him to the nomination.",
        "He's in Florida because they were taken out of the race by the Democratic National Committee.",
        "He's there to show that he's going to fight for it in the general election.",
        "Of course it has that important role, swing state.",
        "Hillary Clinton's there saying Barack Obama wants to win the nomination by basically disenfranchising Florida voters, not counting the delegates that were picked in the sort of quasi primary.",
        "That was not sanctioned by the DNC, but that went ahead and happened anyway.",
        "And so you've got a kind of general election fight going on, but the vestiges of a primary fight that's all, but over.",
        "It's very complicated, but it makes the point of course that Florida is just a very crucial state.",
        "At politico.com today chief political columnist Roger Simon asks, what is Clinton's argument now?",
        "Why stay in, he means.",
        "And he doesn't seem to be able to answer that argument.",
        "But I see you quoting the Washington Post today with a gender argument.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "The question is what is Clinton's objective?",
        "If she's still running for the actual nomination, which if you talk to people inside the campaign of all different kinds they say yes, she's still in this fight to win the nomination.",
        "There are people on the periphery who say she's in it to deal with her legacy, and she doesn't want to go out on a sour note.",
        "The question of gender is interesting, and the question is, if she has had a tougher climb because she's a woman, and whether the press coverage and the negative treatment she's gotten is the result of sexism.",
        "And this creates quite a problem for Barack Obama because if he tries to finesse her exit from the race, and maybe tries to hasten it, he runs into the problem that some of her supporters may see him as a part of this sexist case against her, and that hurts him.",
        "He needs those women desperately in the general election.",
        "John, Senator Obama is not very far away from securing the nomination, from getting the number of delegates that he needs to get the nomination.",
        "And wouldn't you think at this point for these remaining uncommitted super delegates the question arises, how much more opportunity do I have to be someone who will always get their phone call returned by Barack Obama?",
        "I noticed on your DotEarth site, speaking of the wacky weather we've had at the end of the year, people have been trying to decide: Is this global warming?",
        "Is it not global warming?",
        "Is it a sign?",
        "How do you get a cold, cold, snowy winter into a global warming scenario?",
        "So McCain consequently fell under a lot of criticism for not being the same kind of insurgent, the same kind of rebel that he was in 2000.",
        "So finally, here this past month or two, on an issue on which he felt strongly, he began speaking not as the establishment candidate but as an insurgent, challenging the conventional wisdom.",
        "And it ended up hurting him very badly.",
        "I wonder if you could argue, though, that the problems are deeper than that.",
        "He decided to actually campaign for his former rival President George Bush in the 2004 campaign.",
        "Do you think that that was when he started kind of clipping his outspoken wings?"

        "I don't, actually.",
        "If you look back at the discussions surrounding the Iraq war, if anything, John McCain was very critical of the administration, particularly from the right, because he did not think they were deploying a sufficient amount of troops there.",
        "In 2004, even though John McCain and George Bush obviously had very significant policy and political differences, I think McCain was pretty up front about where he stood.",
        "That even though he didn't agree with George Bush on everything, he thought that Bush was better equipped to fight and win the war on terror than John Kerry, and so he supported him.",
        "I guess the kind of thing I'm talking about might be the absence of an issue in this campaign, and that issue being campaign finance reform.",
        "In 1999 and 2000, as you know, campaign finance reform and ridding the process of special interests was not only the issue but the spirit that animated Senator McCain's campaign message.",
        "And although John McCain is certainly willing to answer questions when asked about campaign finance on the campaign trail these days, he doesn't go out of his way to bring it up.",
        "And without that issue around which to mobilize, he doesn't sound as different, he doesn't sound like as much of an outsider.",
        "He's still a very effective politician, but he sounds like a very effective conventional politician.",
        "And I think that might be the obstacle that we've been talking about.",
        "Do you expect him to withdraw?",
        "I don't know.",
        "Have they contacted you and asked you your opinion at all?",
        "No, no. I'm a friend and I'm a supporter, but I am not involved in the campaign.",

        "It's a welcome return to an approach that was very effective for him in the past.",
        "But given the amount of money his opponents have and given the challenge that the immigration issue is going to continue to present even if it's off the table in Congress, it is going to be a long road back.",
