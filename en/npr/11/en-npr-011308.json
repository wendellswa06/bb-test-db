        "Well, first of all, I think it's very important to note that if there's anything that has delayed and made sure that the Iranians actually progress with their program, it's the sanctions policy.",
        "We're talking now again about additional sanctions, and we see that the IAEA report says that the Iranian program actually is continuing.",
        "After more than 15, 20 years of sanctions, we have absolutely no indications that the sanctions are affecting their nuclear program in such a way that it would change its trajectory or in such a way that the regime would change its calculation.",

        "Well, there's an inherent contradiction, it seems to me, in the approach the United States has been taking for quite some time, which is to say we're trying to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear enrichment capability - and by the way, you keep using the phrase nuclear weapons program, and there's no evidence that they have a weapons program, properly defined.",
        "They are clearly pursuing a variety of nuclear research activities, and if I were Iran, I'd be thinking about getting a bomb.",

        "Why now?",
        "Why not a year ago?",
        "Stephen Walt, the IAEA report, as he suggests, has nothing dramatically new.",

        "As you said, no smoking gun about an Iranian nuclear weapons program.",
        "But do you hear a drumbeat for war and see no evidence whatsoever?",
        "I think the way I would put it is there's been a campaign over the last several years, and it really goes back a long way, to what I would call mainstream the idea of a military action against Iran.",
        "It's been clear that the Obama administration was not enthusiastic about that option, I think correctly, because they understood the costs and risks of that, and we may want to get into that eventually.",
        "Here's an email from Adam: Iran might seek nuclear weapons to balance other powers in the Middle East.",
        "Why not denuclearize the region by first focusing on Israel's nuclear weapons to deter Iran's ambitions?",
        "Stephen Walt?",
        "But for those who want the military option, who think that that's the way to go, what you want to do is keep bringing it up as often as possible, get people talking about it, run stories like The Atlantic did earlier this year, talking about how Israelis are thinking about going.",
        "There's a 50-50 chance of war.",
        "The more you talk about it, the more you raise it as an option, the more people begin to sort of scratch their heads and say, well, we may have to do that one of these days, maybe not this year, maybe not next year, but maybe the year after that.",
        "And when finally the stars do line up, as they did in 2001, 2002, for going to war with Iraq, when the political stars do line up, then you've got people thinking, well, you know, we've been talking about this for a long time, maybe we ought to go that route.",
        "So again, I don't think there's necessarily a big campaign for war right now.",
        "I think there has been a long-term campaign to try and create the political space where this option looks like the one to go with, even if people sort of do so reluctantly, without a great deal of enthusiasm, because they think they've exhausted all of the alternatives, when as I think Trita was saying earlier, we really haven't exhausted the diplomatic option at all.",
        "Well, Trita Parsi, we just have a few seconds left before we have to take a break, but where in the present climate do you see an opening for diplomacy?",
        "Well, the thing is this: If you want to have an opening for diplomacy, you have to create an opening for diplomacy.",
        "Steve just discussed how those who are proponents of war are actively working to create the political space for that decision."
