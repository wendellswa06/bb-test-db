        "They're kind of giving fuel to the fire of Iran's leaders.",
        "So I think allowing them to have a weapon and then that being a first step, it can open up a dialogue, and then from there we can move on.",
        "But at this time, I think that's the best option we have.",
        "Trita Parsi, should Iran, should that be their ambition, be allowed to have a weapon?",
        "I absolutely don't think that the Iranians should be getting a weapon.",
        "The non-proliferation treaty, which they have signed, essentially means that they're foresworn weapons.",
        "The problem is that it's not necessarily weaponization that we're focusing on right now.",
        "For the last decade or so, the United States' position has been to not permit the Iranians to have enrichment, which is a very preliminary step, but is also a step that is used to produce fuel for peaceful purposes.",
        "I think that we should proceed and through diplomacy, make sure that we get maximum amount of inspections and verification and insight to the program to make it next to impossible for the Iranians to diverge anything that they're doing toward a military direction.",
        "And by that, also ensure that we limit the amount of enrichment that they're doing.",
        "I think that remains a possibility, but if we continue to waste time by just going forward with sanctions, unfortunately, that opportunity may also be lost.",
        "Who's wasting time here?",
        "The Iranians have thrown spanners into the diplomatic works at seemingly every opportunity.",
        "They have rejected opportunities to buy nuclear materials from Russia, their - probably their closest friend where they might be able to get that safely, without a problem.",
        "This has been - this is a two-way street, no?",
        "Well, first of all, I think you're quite incorrect in saying that they have refused to buy fuel.",
        "They asked to buy fuel, and we came and said that instead they should give up their low-enriched uranium, and we would produce the fuel rods using their own LEU.",
        "Just a couple of weeks ago, they again said that they're willing to buy the fuel and stop enrichment at 20 percent if anyone was willing to sell them the fuel, but no one was willing to sell them the fuel.",
        "So I don't think that's correct.",
        "The Iranians have in no way, in my view, been particularly helpful when it comes to diplomacy, for various reasons, and it is not an uncommon thing.",
        "In every negotiation at some point, one of the parties, including the United States, will, for tactical reasons, try to waste some time."

        "That's always the case, and we shouldn't be surprised by that.",
        "But the thing is if we want to succeed with this, we have to go in with the level of political will necessary to sustain diplomacy for the amount of time that it usually takes.",
        "And in a negotiation like this, it usually takes more than four years to actually get to a final settlement.",
        "That's the case when the United States negotiated with Libya, for instance.",
        "But if we are in a situation in which we believe that it is actually politically easier, less costly, to send off young American women and men off to war than it is to send our diplomats to go and negotiate, then I think we're faced with a much, much greater problem than the nuclear issue of Iran, per se.",
        "Stephen Walt, a lot of people would say four years, Libya was not close to acquiring a nuclear weapon.",
        "Iran, given what we know about its program, would seem to be much closer than that.",
        "Four years may be too long.",
        "Well, remember the first prediction, I think, that Iran was going to get a nuclear weapon was back in the 1980s, where I believe Jane's Defence Weekly predicted they would have one within two years.",
        "And ever since then, there have been repeated predictions that Iran was about to get a nuclear weapon, and we've seen those steadily up until the present day.",
        "Given that it took the United States only two years to go from not having any nuclear capability at all to having one, during the Manhattan Project in World War II, why hasn't Iran gotten a nuclear weapon yet if they are so hell-bent on acquiring this particular capability?",
        "I think one possible argument is that Iran really has no interest in getting a nuclear weapon, that is to say crossing the line to actually manufacture one.",
        "I think it is far more likely that Iran would like to have the capability of getting one quickly if the regional security environment ever called for it.",
        "And there are two good reasons for that.",
        "One, right now, with Iran not having a nuclear weapon, if some nuclear terrorist used a bomb somewhere in the world, Iran would not be suspected of having anything to do with it, and that's good.",
        "Secondly, if Iran were to get a nuclear weapon, there is some danger that its neighbors would acquire them: Saudi Arabia, possibly Turkey, even Iraq.",
        "And that, of course, negates the fact that Iran is a much potentially stronger conventional power than most of its neighbors.",
        "And if it ever had a decent government, it would be in a dominate position in the region.",
        "Iran's strategic interests are probably advanced, in fact, by being close to having a nuclear weapon but not actually crossing the line, and that, by the way, is what American diplomacy should be trying to achieve, an Iran that is not crossing the nuclear line because we haven't pushed it to go ahead and weaponize."

        "people, actually Middle East, the whole Middle East.",
        "Well, let me extend Brian's point, and Trita Parsi, let me ask you.",
        "Some people say we should wait and hope, support the Iranian opposition and hope that they would be able to either starkly reform the government that's in power now or replace it.",
        "Well, I think there's certain things that the United States can do that would be helpful for the opposition.",
        "For instance, in the next round of negotiations, if they take place, I think it would be better not to just talk about the nuclear issue but also add the abysmal human rights situation in Iran on the agenda.",
        "I think the Obama administration has missed opportunities in making sure that he actually really made the human rights issue in Iran much a more important factor here.",
        "Other things that we could do and, in my view, should do is to, for instance, lift some of the sanctions that make it so difficult for people inside of Iran to be able to get access to technology that they need to circumvent all of the different filters and obstacles that the Iranian government puts on communication inside the country, as well, as with the outside.",
        "That's one of the key things that the opposition has been asking for, making sure that they have access to the communications tools that enable them to be effective inside the country.",
        "And unfortunately, because of our sanctions policy, that's become very, very tricky to do because these are technologies that for various reasons we have put on the list of things that they cannot get access to.",
        "So these are - don't sanctions, though, in general make it more expensive for the Iranian government and therefore make the Iranian government less popular?"

        "Oh, the Iranian government is extremely unpopular as it is.",
        "I mean, we all saw what happened in 2009, when they stole an election, and there was massive human rights abuses taking places in front - the entire world could see what the regime was up to.",
        "But the problem with the current sanctions is that they're putting a lot of pressure on the economy as a whole, and the government itself usually has far better tools to be able to circumvent the sanctions and shift the cost of these sanctions and this pressure onto the population, and that has now taken place extensively, particularly when it comes to these financial sanctions that the Obama administration and the Bush administration also pursued.",
        "It's not really differentiating between an activity undertaken by the revolutionary guard or an activity taking place by an ordinary citizen.",
        "So everyone is being hit by it.",
        "And it's not led to the type of situation in which people will say oh, we have to rise up against the regime because these sanctions are so difficult.",
        "On the contrary, the effect that you're starting to see is that people are saying you all know, the entire world know that we're not happy with this government, so why are you putting pressure on the people?",
        "You should be putting pressure on the regime.",
        "Instead, the people are being punished, and now you're starting to increasingly see that they're starting to vent some of their frustrations towards the United States and not just towards the regime.",
        "All right, big story.",
        "Gentlemen, lady, do you agree?",
        "Hi, Nathan, how's it going?",
        "Well, a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East would be a wonderful thing.",
        "I think it's unlikely that we're going to be able to get it, because I think for a variety of reasons Israel would be reluctant to give up its own nuclear arsenal; plus the fact for the Iranians, they have to at least think about the fact that there's a nuclear-armed Pakistan next door, a nuclear-armed India and a nuclear-armed Russia.",
        "So even if there was some larger movement in the Middle East to maintain a nuclear-free zone, you can imagine Iran being a little bit concerned about its other neighbors.",
        "I think that also tells us that regime change alone is not enough here.",
        "The idea of having a nuclear-enrichment capability and having control of the nuclear fuel cycle is something that even the Iranian opposition supports.",
        "The leader of the so-called Green Movement, Mousavi, was in favor, in fact was one of the leaders of the nuclear program.",
        "So we could get an end to the clerical regime and you would still have an Iran that was interested not necessarily in a nuclear weapon but having a full nuclear capability that gave them the potential to go nuclear if at some point they felt that was necessary.",
        "I wanted to explore the idea you raised earlier.",
        "Some of the consequences that might flow from a military strike, and again, whether it was by Israel or by the United States, likely the United States would be drawn in one way or another.",
        "And those - even those who say this may be the only option we have left, don't believe these would go unanswered, but nor do they think they could set the Iranians back if that's their determination for more than a couple or(ph) three years.",
        "Right.",
        "And I think that's one of the compelling arguments against the sort of preventive war here.",
        "It doesn't prevent them.",
        "In fact, it just gives Iran more incentive to want to get a capability so that it would be immune from being attacked in the future.",
        "They certainly have observed the difference between the fact that no one is attacking North Korea, and the West was willing to do regime change in Libya.",
        "And if we have then demonstrated that we're willing to attack them as well, that's just all the more reason they have to disperse the program, harden it and go back at it again.",
        "This would, I think, unify support for the regime, which is weakening over time, tarnish the American image.",
        "We would be seen, however inappropriately, as beating up on yet another Muslim country.",
        "There would be some retaliation.",
        "We don't know how significant it would be, but it could be significant, and it would undoubtedly cause a spike in oil prices at a moment where the world and American economy don't need it.",
        "Last point I'd make here is it's not, I think, it's not surprising that the loudest voices in the United States who are calling for the military option were also among the loudest voices calling us - for us to invade Iraq in 2003 on a similar set of suppositions, that this was a very bad regime that wanted to get some kind of weapon of mass destruction and couldn't be trusted to have them."
