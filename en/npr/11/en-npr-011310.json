        "I think, again, I have no love for the clerical regime, but to go to war with all the potential negative consequences on the basis of these kinds of future fears strikes me as a very bad bet indeed.",
        "It was Bismarck who said, you know, preventive war is like committing suicide for fear of death, and that would be a little bit like what the United States or Israel would be doing if they decided the military option was the way to go right now.",
        "Stephen Walt, professor of international affairs at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.",
        "Also with us, Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And John's on the line.",
        "John calling us from Flagstaff.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thank you, Neal, for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Once again, a very good show.",
        "I would like to suggest that we could do basically two things, that the least bad one is establish a more effective sanctions program and get as many of our allies to cooperate with that as possible.",
        "And secondly, I think - and this is as important, if not more so, get our ally, the Israeli government, to open up 100 percent Dimona for an IAEA inspection.",
        "If we could get Israel to abandon its nuclear warheads, we're in a much better position morally to get Iran to stop what they're doing.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, John.",
        "Israel, of course, not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and unlikely, Stephen Walt, to open its reactor to anybody.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "They've been pretty secretive about their nuclear program since day one.",
        "It seems to me if we're in a period where the United States is not able to get Israel to agree to even a settlement freeze, we're not in a period where we're going to be able to get them to agree to open up Dimona or uncover their nuclear program.",
        "And even if they were to do that, that doesn't help the problem.",
        "It would be only an Israeli decision to give up their nuclear weapons program, and I don't believe Israel will do that.",
        "And frankly, if I were Israeli, I would want to think long and hard before I did that, particularly if there were other political concessions I thought I might have to make down the road.",
        "Trita Parsi, as you look ahead, one caller mentioned the plot that the last time the president spoke about relations with Iran, he was talking about a plot where - alleged plot where an Iranian agent was attempting to set a bomb off in a restaurant half a block - half a mile from the White House that would kill the Saudi ambassador.",
        "As you look ahead towards any potential diplomatic openings, doesn't that sort of thing get in the way?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "If it turns out that this plot is true, it is a tremendous problem, and it's also at the same time an indication of how our failure to resolve this problem and pursue more serious solutions for it is causing the situation to deteriorate.",
        "Now, we don't know the end conclusion of that plot.",
        "But just imagine this.",
        "Imagine if that plot had been unveiled in the midst of an actual diplomatic effort.",
        "The most likely thing that would have happened is that we would have cancelled talks with Iranians as a result of the plot."

        "Now the plot is taking place in the midst of a sanctions frenzy, and our response to that is not to cancel the strategy but to actually double down on sanctions.",
        "Well, because they don't seem to be dissuading Iran from, again, if this is accurate, adventurism at the very least.",
        "It's true.",
        "If anybody wants that kind of personal head-in, they have a limited period of time in which to get that kind of attention.",
        "I think there are superdelegates who are waiting for other reasons, perhaps as well, which is that they have a certain sympathy for what Hillary Clinton is going through, and they don't want to short circuit the process or the race.",

        "Well, there's very little data that would show that this actually can be successful.",

        "We have sanctions on them for 50 years, and we've not seen the type of changes that we want to see.",
        "And again, it comes down to political will.",
        "If we really believe that this is a serious problem, then we need to muster the political will to come up with the solutions and pursue them patiently rather than going for the easy options.",
