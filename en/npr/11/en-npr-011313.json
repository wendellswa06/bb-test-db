        "And, you know, it's clear that there's some questions about the arsenic life finding, the microbe - was it sequestering arsenic, or is the arsenic actually incorporated into the DNA in a systematic way?",
        "It's - really.",
        "You know, but he's got it laid out, documented, and just a shout-out to John Fauber for doing the kind of investigative reporting that I wish I was doing more of and we could all do a lot more of.",
        "But, you know, I'm really interested, you know, not to completely be a NASA booster, but I am really interested to see how this plays out, as they say, in the literature, and to see, you know, what we find out with future attempts to poke holes at this, you know, systematically, you know, what scientists are going to find out.",
        "Andy, did you want to jump in?",
        "Yeah, well, there's some relationship between that story and what's been happening with climate, as well, where there are all these battles about whether peer review is biased or torqued toward the consensus - building and supporting a consensus.",
        "And then there's all this questions about the Web and the world outside of the formal journals, what role does that play.",
        "And increasingly, I think you're going to see, overall, I think a beneficial mix of things.",
        "It's going to be ugly sometimes, as you saw this year in so many realms.",
        "But I'm starting to see, even within - on DotEarth, which is just a tiny part of this actual conversation between real intellectual antagonists on points, whether it's about arsenic or about whether Antarctica was actually warming or not warming as much.",
        "So you're saying that peer review is going to be a wider audience than just the peer reviewers.",
        "Well, I think there's layers.",
        "Peer review is becoming a layered process more than it ever was, where it usually was behind closed doors, just happening as an idea was tested, put in a journal.",
        "And now with the Web, it's - there's dynamic, real-time peer review, as well, and more and more, scientists are putting their ideas out in that realm simultaneously.",
        "And that, you know, I think in the long run, it's going to be okay."

        "And we did that story, and we brought on someone who was a very famous scientist who disputed this.",

        "I mean, this is - it's sort of peer review, isn't it, in a certain way.",
        "WikiLeaks is huge because it calls into question, you know, the political sphere, the technology sphere, the media sphere.",
        "I mean, there's questions about, you know, whether journalists should even legally have access to the cables, to the material that WikiLeaks is releasing.",
