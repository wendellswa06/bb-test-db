        "This is a theory that came out earlier this year.",
        "Okay.",
        "And it basically said there's - we know we've got dark energy, we know we've got dark matter, and now there's a dark flow where this matter seems to be flowing in some mysterious direction for some reason.",
        "It was, you know, it was noticed by a few different people.",
        "So we'll have to keep our eye on it.",
        "Okay.",
        "I mean, one thing that I thought just was neat was that, I mean, the whole theory of cosmology, that the universe started in a tiny fraction of a second, it inflated to something from subatomic to the size to a soccer ball.",
        "We have all this invisible material, we think, dark matter that we think makes up 80 percent of the mass of the universe.",
        "And then this stuff called dark energy, which is the stuff which somehow is accelerating the expansion of the universe, just when you'd think that it would be slowing down due to all the gravity in it, that that theory seems to be more and more corroborated.",
        "We had the Planck mission, which looks at the ancient light called the cosmic microwave background, from the early universe.",
        "And we had WMAP, a satellite that's been around for a while, and just the patterns in this light just verifying more and more that this kind of crazy, bizarre, some people call it preposterous universe actually exists.",

        "I don't know him.",
        "I've interviewed him briefly for the Science Journalism Tracker, where I've posted several things about his work.",
        "He's sort of an investigative madman, which I hope he will take in the right spirit.",
        "Every month or two, he comes out with a story on such things as conflicts of interest.",
        "He's looked at spinal implants, you know, spinal fusions, jaw implants, a variety of things.",
        "And just about every case, he finds out that some researchers found much better results than others, and by -coincidentally, those who found better research or found better results were on the payroll of the company involved.",

        "You know, on the good news front here, in terms of science communication, I was at the climate talks in Cancun for a week but not so much to cover the talks, which were pretty darn inconsequential, but to work with a group of 36 journalists who came there from all around the world, from Katmandu and from Kenya.",
        "And they're young environmental journalists who, in this age of retracting sort of journalism, or - it gave me a great sense that there's a huge amount of growth going on, especially in developing countries.",
        "So it's great to hear - and actually, there was a guy named Sam Adams(ph), an environment reporter, who was there, as well.",
        "So there's still life in this thing called science journalism, which is fun."

        "Yeah, absolutely.",

        "There are things like AOL's Patch, which are local news sites, a lot of online - all the action, obviously, is online.",

        "It's been going on for about 10 years, and NASA - actually, today is the last day of the project.",

        "Unlike Kepler, Kepler will find planets, Earth planets that are about 2,000 light years away, SIM would have found them within about 10 or 20 light years away, which meant that other missions after SIM could, you know, study them a lot more easily than something that's much more distant.",
        "So NASA's canceling it, and I have not seen any press coverage of this whatsoever.",
        "Well, let me ask Ron Cowen.",
        "Ron?",
        "Well, no, that's true.",

        "It is a loss.",
        "And what's going on now, too, though, in NASA is that the James Webb Space Telescope, which is the successor to Hubble, is now - it's been going up and up in its cost, and the most recent figures are it's going to cost 6.5 billion, which is 1.5 billion more than it supposedly cost a year ago.",
        "No one knows where the money is going to come from, but people are very worried that a lot more missions will - that have been proposed will be canceled or just will be delayed for years and years.",
        "NASA itself is going through a lot of painful - I would call it misdirection.",
        "I mean, we're not going back to the moon as George Bush had proposed, and he didn't really give a lot of details at all when he said that.",
        "But Obama is saying, okay, we'll go to an asteroid but it won't be till 2025, and we don't have a new space transportation vehicle.",
