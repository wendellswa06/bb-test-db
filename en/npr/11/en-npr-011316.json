        "Right.",
        "I mean, it's amazing what's happening.",
        "The sequencing is getting faster and cheaper, and the possibilities are limitless.",

        "There's some rebates that will mitigate those costs, but it's still a little more than people are used to paying, especially for something that feels kind of experimental.",
        "And then there's also the infrastructure that we need for the charging stations - not just in our homes.",
        "That should be pretty easy, but, you know, what we really want are these really high-speed - one of these 440-volt charging stations that could be available, you know, in your supermarket parking lot.",
        "So, you know, we're waiting for that to happen.",
        "But I think there's a lot of excitement among consumers for these vehicles.",

        "Yeah.",
        "...in 2011, and I have to say I can't help but get really excited about the potential for the detector at the Large Hadron Collider to find evidence of either the Higgs boson particle, which may be responsible for conferring mass, basically, upon particles that we are already detecting, or something that could explain, as we were talking about, dark matter.",
        "We still don't really know what dark matter is, and there's a lot of prominent physicists who are saying, you know, this LHC, the Large Hadron Collider, could be the thing - and now that it's, you know, up and running and it's fairly stable, it seems - could be the thing that really can find some resolution to these longstanding mysteries.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "And it's finally running - I mean, it's running at half its speed.",
        "But that's still a feat at, each of the two proton beams has 3.5 trillion electron volts.",
        "It's actually supposed to operate at double that, but it won't do so until 2013.",
        "But, yeah, this year, I agree, is -another thing to look forward to is finding out, you know, what will the Large Hadron Collider see.",
        "I agree.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I always find it - that there - when I interview physicists about the LHC and the Higgs boson, there are equal number of physicists who rather not find anything."
