        "Some of them give out that microwave radiation.",
        "Well, you know, there's another analogy between the two things, too, which is that in both cases, the airport and cancer, people are looking at very, very high-tech solutions, which, you know, which sometimes provide the answer.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Does this really - you know, are we going to be able to afford this on a large scale, to screen the population that's at risk for lung cancer?",
        "Are there other ways that are more effective that are going to - you know, are there other kinds of public health and scanning approaches or other kinds of non-high-tech approaches that are going to be - you know, actually save more lives?",

        "But this year, there was an agreement among about a dozen countries to fund and construct something called the ITER facility, I-T-E-R, in the south of France.",
        "And this is the first facility that's actually most likely, I guess, to do nuclear fusion and actually bring it closer to commercial scale, and that the timeline after this - if this facility is successful, will be then to build an actual power plant that will have nuclear fusion providing real electricity."

        "One thing that's interesting, though, I always said, it does -that an arena where international cooperation is vital.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there are many chunks of the energy problem that are still being cast as a national imperative.",
        "In fact, Steve Chu, the energy secretary, got in trouble, sort of, in Washington, when he tried to cast - the reason we should push on green energy is because China has made this our Sputnik moment for energy, when there are others who say, that's actually the worst possible way to look at this.",
        "We're never going to out-manufacture windmills in comparison to China.",
        "But we could do some cooperative work with them to bring the best of the United States, which is this innovative capacity with China's manufacturing skills and start to do more international cooperation.",
        "So energy is an arena where, if you don't have international cooperation, you're probably not going to have big breakthroughs.",
