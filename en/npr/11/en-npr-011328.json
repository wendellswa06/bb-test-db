        "You know, there's a large difference between the time here and there, so I'm not really so much connected with them.",
        "But by Internet we connect like to each other.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because you had a really strong friendship with I think it was Mohammed.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, and that was a very sweet part of the film.",
        "Let me ask you about that, Laura.",
        "You showed this wonderful friendship between Ali and Mohammed and it was so sad when you had - when they had to part.",
        "Let me ask you first, Ali.",
        "Was it very sad for you when the two of you had to leave each other?",
        "Yes, so much.",
        "You know, a lot of people going out of their houses and so upsets when you leave all your friends, leave your house, your school, you know.",
        "Laura, let me go back to Laura for a moment and just ask her about what was part of the focus of this, you know, that you ended up following the story of Ali and Mohammed and their friendship and really illustrating how difficult it is for these kids, because Ali's family eventually moved north.",
        "They are Kurdish.",
        "They moved north.",
        "They had to leave the city.",
        "I think what Ali is probably trying to tell you is that, it's kind of like - it's difficult to even put it in words.",
        "They've known each other since they were little kids.",
        "They have been going to grade school, middle school and then most of high school together.",
        "And so, for them, to part is kind of like losing your family member.",
        "Mohammed was over at Ali's house almost every day, wasn't he?",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, and they are goofing around and they are hanging out and they get to be kids and all of a sudden, from - Mohammed his brother basically is leaving, the person that he spends all of his time with and shares all of his secrets and talks about girls and music and, you know, joshes around with.",
        "So it was really depressing and heartbreaking, and yet that is Iraq.",
        "That is what - it does happen.",
        "People have to move and they have to go to places that are safer and there are those - you know, there are people who are left behind."

        "Yeah, and something else that I think the film illustrated very poignantly, too, was the violence that goes on on a kind of regular basis and the fear that these kids felt.",
        "No, not really.",
        "OK.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Frank.",
        "It's every day, and I mean, Ali, I think, really illustrated it so wonderfully when he walks out and he stands there with the camera and there is a helicopter flying overhead and there is gunfire nearby, and he's just standing there going, I just don't know if I'm going to school today.",
        "I don't know what my friends are doing.",
        "I can't find them on the phone.",
        "I have no idea if school is even open today because there is a bomb that just went off.",
        "And that is something that they do have to deal - and that is something that parents also have to deal with.",

        "Yeah.",

        "One thing that was very intenerating is that the boys - you boys seemed to use the camera as a diary, as a way to talk about your feelings about what was going on.",
        "Is that true?",
        "Yeah, that was the idea.",
        "That was the idea that we have to show our feelings, how we feel at this situation, how the people feel about that life, you know.",
        "I think one of the directions that I gave, and this really kind of comes, I think, from my journalism training and also being a newspaper reporter and also a radio reporter for years, is that, you know, we always try and bring those things back to our audience.",
        "And something that is very, very normal for Ali to think or feel or smell or see in Baghdad is so complexly not normal to us.",
        "And so one of the things that I gave as directions to the guys is just tell us everything that you're doing.",
        "I know it seems kind of silly, but really for us, it's very, very new.",
        "And I have to say the boys really delivered on that.",
        "We are talking with Laura Winters.",
        "She's a co-director of \"\"Baghdad High,\"\" which is an HBO documentary, and you are listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "I couldn't help wondering, Laura, as I was watching that, how much editing did you have to do?",
        "How much film did you get?",
        "That is a really good and crazy answer and question.",
        "We got about 300-plus hours worth of tape and it was insane and difficult and we had a system down, basically, a sweatshop kind of concept of, you get these tapes and you have to get through kind of two to three tapes a day.",
        "You have to translate them, log them and then start putting together and finding those pieces that you want.",
        "So we would go through a cull and then I'd go back again, and with my co-director Ivan O'Mahoney, we would go through it again and cull it some more.",
        "And then my co-director and I would go through it again and cull it some more.",
        "And then we got it down to about 70 hours, but I would like to say that there is one boy, Mohammed Raed, who is responsible for one-third of those tapes.",
        "One-hundred hours one boy filmed..."

        "And what is it like now?",
