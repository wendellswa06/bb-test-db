        "Brady, or one of his cohorts, had been into Dakin's a couple of days before trying to buy a machine gun.",

        "He has almost a full head of hair, he still lives alone, and he grouses that his family won't let him drive his car anymore.",
        "And while he needs occasional prodding to remember events that happened a lifetime ago, he's sharp and funny, and there is a twinkle in his eye.",

        "You said that according to the hospital itself, the revenue it received from garnishing people's wages was only two tenths of 1% of more than $600 million in total revenue last year - that's 0.21%.",
        "So if that's the case, and they really don't even get that much money from doing it, and, as you saw, it burdens these people with, you know, thousands of dollars in debt - in some cases, twice their annual incomes - why are they so aggressive about doing it when they actually really aren't getting that much money from it?",
        "Well, we know that - from their tax filings in 2018 they brought in $86 million more than they spent.",
        "So I'm guessing and experts have speculated that this may be presented to the board as a bad debt issue and not as a some of the people that we're suing are low-income.",
        "Do we have thoughts about that?",
        "So you have not had an interview with anybody directly about this where you can put these specific questions to them.",
        "They did issue a statement.",
        "What exactly did they say about the totality of your reporting?",
        "So we, you know, of course went to them before this was published and presented them with our findings and sent them dozens and dozens of questions.",
        "And they just simply refused to answer many of those questions.",
        "But in their statement, they say that they believe in providing exceptional care to all members of the community.",
        "But their financial assistance policy, I think it's important to note, does not cover patients with insurance.",
        "And we know that a growing number of health insurance plans have higher and higher deductibles, and the cost is being shifted onto the patient.",
        "And so offering 0% interest plans to a woman who makes - like Ms. Carrie, who makes $9 an hour - that's probably not going to be of great help to her when she owes the hospital $33,000.",
