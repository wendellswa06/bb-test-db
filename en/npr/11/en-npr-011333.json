        "Hi, Liane.",
        "Did you see the crossword - the Sunday crossword in The New York Times last week?",
        "Not only did I see it, I tried to solve it, but I immediately looked -I'm sorry, I looked down the clues for my name.",
        "But it wasn't there and there weren't clues about National Public Radio because even though it was all about National Public Radio, it had nothing to do with National Public Radio.",
        "You explain this.",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, it was a puzzle by Bob Klahn and the long answers were all familiar names and phrases with the consecutive letters NPR.",
        "Like campaign promise and Jason Priestley and season premiere and things like that.",
        "Yeah, it was great.",
        "It was really, really good because it really exercised the mind.",
        "But oh man, I received some e-mails about it, they wanted to know what was up with that puzzle.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well what was up with the challenge you left us with last week, from a listener?",
        "Yes.",
        "It came from listener Gary Alvstad of Tustin, California.",
        "I said, think of a well-known U.S.",
        "city; the letters in its name can be rearranged into a symbol for a thousand, a symbol for 10, and two words meaning zero.",
        "What city is it?",
        "What city is it?",
        "The answer is Knoxville, which consists of K representing 1,000, X for 10, and the two words meaning zero are nil and love.",
        "We had over 600 entries from people who solved the puzzle and our randomly selected winner is Christopher Reese.",
        "He joins us from Lexington, Kentucky.",

        "I'm a graduate student at the University of Kentucky.",
        "All right.",
        "Now did this come easy to you?",
        "It didn't at first because I was trying to insist in my head that -because the 10 was the Roman numeral, that the thousand was going to be too.",
        "So I spent a lot of time working with M and getting nowhere.",
        "And then it just came to me with the K.",
        "Great.",
        "How long did - have you been playing this puzzle?",
        "Well, I've been kind of playing along in my head for a couple of years, but I've only actually started entering for about a month, month and a half.",
        "All right, Will, what do you have for us?",
        "Meet Christopher.",
        "Let's play.",
        "All right, Christopher, every answer today is the name of a famous person whose first name starts with J.",
        "I'll give you the first name and an anagram of the last name, you tell me who it is.",

        "And the president responded by saying, I didn't know she was nasty.",
        "Now, moments later, he also said he thought that she would make a very good princess.",

        "I mean, I - there's breaking protocol, and there's breaking protocol (laughter), I guess.",
        "It's all part of the Trump brand.",
        "But why, I want to ask you, is he so focused on Boris Johnson, the prime minister candidate, and Nigel Farage?",
        "Don, these are his kind of guys.",
        "They're brash.",
        "They're politically incorrect alpha males.",
        "But more importantly, all three of them support Brexit.",
        "Remember that Donald Trump is a Brexiteer of sorts.",
        "And the reason is that they don't like multilateral institutions like the European Union.",
        "These are groups of countries who have sort of strict rules.",
        "And people like Farage, Johnson and Trump feel this constrains their countries.",
        "And what they want to do is be able to chart a much more independent course.",
        "And this vision of basically Britain and the United Kingdom that they share is really at odds with aspects of the post-World War II architecture that the U.S.",
        "and Britain helped build.",
        "Well, Frank, that's the setup.",

        "The big thing tomorrow is going to be street protests.",
        "And what are we expecting there?",
        "Huge numbers.",
        "There are going to be buses coming in from around England.",
        "The streets are going to be jammed.",
        "Londoners, of course, very progressive - this is a cosmopolitan city.",
        "And they tend to really dislike this president.",
        "His anti-immigration policies, his things that he said about women - it just really rubs Londoners the wrong way.",
        "We'll be seeing a lot of things that - a lot of signs, clever signs, which is what British protesters are known for.",
        "And we'll also see Tuesday morning the Trump baby blimp make a reappearance.",
        "This is the blimp of Trump in a diaper and crying and looking - he's in the form of a baby.",
        "Very popular, and I'm sure we'll see lots of people out there when that goes aloft in Parliament Square."
