        "History is in the making in Iran this weekend.",
        "That nation faces its first run-off presidential election ever.",
        "A former Iranian president and the mayor of Tehran have reportedly finished first and second in a field of seven.",
        "Voters will make a final selection on Friday.",
        "NPR's Ivan Watson joins us from Tehran.",
        "Ivan, thanks for being with us.",
        "You're welcome, Scott.",
        "And what do we know about the results so far?",
        "Well, we don't have a final, published result, but it does seem that the expected front-runner, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, is in first place according to the last tally.",
        "He's the former president of Iran, one of the wealthiest men in Iran and a cleric who was one of the architects of the Islamic Revolution, so it was pretty surprising when he ran on a pretty Reformist platform pledging to open a new chapter of detente with the United States and to attract foreign investment and relax social restrictions on the youth.",
        "Now the next two places are still a bit up in the air.",
        "One of our sources at the Interior Ministry here, which is doing the count, says that the hard-line conservative mayor of Tehran has taken second place.",
        "His name is Mahmud Ahmadinejad, and he seems to have gotten the support of some hard-line conservative organizations here, like the Basij militia organization.",
        "And some of the Iranians who boycotted yesterday's election to protest against the regime say already now that if it comes to a runoff between these two candidates next week that they will vote for Rafsanjani.",
        "Now there's a third person here whose name is Mehdi Karrubi.",
        "He's a cleric who dubbed himself the sheik of reform.",
        "He had a surprise strong showing here, and he seems to have cried foul already, according to recent reports, demanding an investigation, and he's claiming that some military groups intimidated voters, that he should be second place.",
        "He promised $60 a month to each Iranian if he was elected.",
        "And the Democrats got even more upset and said we're going to take away all 156 delegates from the state of Michigan.",
        "And what's more, we're going to forbid the candidates to campaign there and we're going to tell them to take their names off the ballot.",
        "Ivan, let me ask you about the turnout, which I guess was north of 60 percent.",
        "There were people that thought the turnout would be depressed by the fact that you had a thousand candidates who tried to run; only seven in the end.",
        "Women were not permitted to run.",
        "And as you note, many reformers were urging a boycott of the election.",
        "What seems to have happened?",
        "I'm not quite sure.",
        "I was really quite surprised, and many Iranians have expressed surprise as well, because during the run-up to this election, during the last week, nearly everybody I talked to criticized the system here, criticized the Iranian regime, and many said there was little point in voting.",
        "And yet when I went to the polls yesterday, you had long lines.",
        "I didn't hear that same criticism.",
        "Instead, I was hearing message of unity, people saying it was their duty to vote, that they had finally made up their minds between the seven candidates, and some said they'd voted in response to criticism to the West, specifically a message from President Bush on the eve of the election calling it undemocratic.",
        "This was spun a bit by state-controlled media that said President Bush was telling Iranians not to vote, and so some people said, `I'm going out to--he doesn't have a right to tell me what to do.'",
        "Ivan, is there going to be a reformer in the runoff--or I guess will that be determined in the next couple of days?"

        "New details have emerged about the massive hacking of federal government data, revealing that it was several times larger than originally thought.",
        "The Office of Personnel Management has now confirmed sensitive information was stolen from around 22 million individuals.",
        "That includes nearly everyone who applied for a government background check in the last 15 years or were married or living with someone who did.",
        "Now officials are moving to the next step - the question of whether hackers did not just steal, but also left something behind.",
        "NPR's Dina Temple-Raston reports.",
        "The extent of the breach is stunning.",
        "The director of OPM, Katherine Archuleta, provided an unsettling official list of what was stolen.",
        "Social Security numbers, residency and educational history, employment history, information about immediate family and other personal and business acquaintances, health, criminal and financial history and other details.",
        "Other details, like the result of background interviews and the fingerprints of some 1.1 million government employees.",
        "Officials said they discovered two breaches.",
        "Hackers were in one network for nearly a year and were active in another with sensitive information for seven months.",
        "And that's a long time, says Joel Brenner.",
        "He's a former inspector general of the National Security Agency.",
        "They do have a gold mine.",
        "There's no question about that in what they stole, but nobody seems to be paying attention to what they might've left behind.",
        "As investigators continue to gather information, they're also looking for signs that these records could have been altered or deleted and not just stolen.",
        "That's a difficult thing to do, but it's not beyond thinking.",
        "Once you're in a system, you not only can steal things from it, you can change what's inside of it."

        "That's a concern because according to the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, China is the leading suspect in this attack.",
        "Another thing investigators are looking for -whether the attackers left malware in the system to use later.",
        "What you'd call sort of passive, go-to-sleep kind of malware that might then wake up later on after we think we've cleaned it out and begin exfiltrating data yet again.",
        "Administration officials say they haven't found signs of that yet, but they are looking.",
        "And there's another worry beyond the stolen records.",
        "Officials say the information collected can be the basis for a very effective spear-fishing campaign, which could help the hackers get back into the system.",
        "Spear-fishing is an email that appears to be from someone you know, but is in fact from someone who is trying to get unauthorized access to your computer.",
        "I've been on the receiving end of that kind of spear-fishing campaign myself where the attackers actually went so far as to open a Yahoo Mail account in my name.",

        "You open it, read it, and the hackers are in.",
        "So far, none of that has happened.",
        "In fact, one of the reasons why officials believe that a state actor like China is behind this hack is because the things you'd usually see - personal information for sale on the dark web, spear-fishing campaigns - are conspicuously absent from this cyber attack.",
        "We have not been notified of anyone being affected by this.",

        "When you think about what's going on with Michigan making this move unilaterally, do you think that the political parties will actually go through with all of the threats that they've threatened Michigan's delegates with?",
        "I think that the national committees, the Republican National Committee, the Democratic National Committee, will hold fast.",
        "But we'll probably - what we'll probably see happen is somewhere between now and the conventions, which come at a very end of the summer, the candidate who appears to be on his or her way to being the nominee of the major parties will say we want Michigan to come home.",
        "We want to have all those Michigan delegates come and they will welcome them in.",
        "Now, that will happen so long as there is a candidate who is clearly going to win the nomination at the convention.",
        "If, on the other hand, either party has the kind of situation where the convention will have to choose between several candidates who have a chance of being the nominee, still, at that point, then we're going to have a very sticky situation because, then, who you bring from Michigan and whom they are going to vote for is going to make a potential difference to the outcome of the convention.",
        "And then, whether or not they're seated will be a very hot controversy indeed.",
        "Very briefly, Ron, is this a make it or break it for any of the candidates, Republican or Democratic?",

        "I don't think it has a great deal of meaning on the Democratic side because of what we've just discussed.",
        "But on the Republican side, either Mitt Romney or John McCain is going to be in serious trouble after losing today."
