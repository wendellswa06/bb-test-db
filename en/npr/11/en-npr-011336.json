        "Well, primarily because these are such vexing manifestations of schizophrenia that are so - still so poorly understood.",
        "And then along with that, there are so many theories and ideas about what might be causing these problems.",
        "So what we ended up doing essentially is developing an artificial neural system implemented on a computer, an artificial brain simplified but basically - and then inducing a wide range of hypothesized illness mechanisms and to see which one actually seemed to produce the better fit in terms of what we are seeing clinically and experimentally with actual patients.",
        "And so do you have any idea what's behind the, you know...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, that's the big question.",

        "We simulated about eight different core disturbances and -with this system and compared it, as I said, to human behavior.",
        "And both the artificial neural systems and the humans were given tasks of remembering and recalling stories.",
        "So - and actually, what surfaced was a clear cut, at least a statistical winner, in terms of the problem that did the best in terms of simulating these patients.",
        "And that was what we now term as hyperlearning.",
        "So you had some - you had one.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yes, hyperlearning.",
        "And what does that mean?",
        "Well, what it means really is that in the artificial neural system that particular modules, networks within the system, were engaged in a learning process.",
        "So they were essentially fed stories of certain sorts and they had to learn the stories and put them in an abstract form that enabled the stories to be actually downloaded into essentially a permanent memory in this artificial system.",
        "And then the system, it kind of unwound that process in the other direction, was able to take these memory traces and recreate the stories.",
        "Yes, I am.",
        "But I think we should start with some listener mail.",
        "So what we found is essentially is if this memory consolidation process was accelerated to an excessive degree that the system began to confuse different stories or memories and to corrupt these representations in very specific ways.",
        "It seemed to be suggestive of certain language manifestations of schizophrenia.",
        "And the reason why this is of potential importance is that - in the real human brain, that when we have experiences interacting with others, seeing things on television, whatever, that the common way that we parse these experience and organize them and remember them for ourselves and to tell other people about it is through stories.",
        "So stories are critical kind of organization for information, particularly social information, and really makes us who we are as individuals, the stories that we tell in some sense.",
        "So these stories, like other episodic memories, when we experience them and register them in memory, take a long, long time to become incorporated into a permanent store.",
        "So - and we don't - so that - so what the study really suggests essentially - so we're talking weeks to months.",
        "So initially, when we have these experiences and have memories in our minds about what we've gone through and what we've experienced or seen that it's kind of a snapshot or a set of snapshots of these experiences.",
        "But then, gradually, these are incorporated into more abstract story structures that are related to other stories that we have learned and remembered.",
        "So there's a generalization process and an efficiency-making process.",
        "Is there anyway that you can incorporate what you've learned from your computers into helping people?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, let me - just to finish out this story.",
        "So what it really says is the reason why the human brain has to do this so slowly is that if it actually speeds it up that memories become intermingled and corrupted in certain ways.",
        "And it might actually -we're hypothesizing - produce the manifestations of what we call schizophrenia."

        "And as far as helping people now, you're using what you know?",
        "Well, what we need to do is press on and we need to some, I mean, we have, I think, an interesting hypothesis and some preliminary supporting data, because this study was actually done in comparison to a group of actual patients.",
        "And what we need to do now is to look directly in the brains of these individuals and to see if this hyperlearning process can be confirmed, not just through their manifest language behavior, but using certain kinds of neuro-imaging.",

        "So Robert George, here's my question to you: Given all of the discussion that the Democrats have held so far about whether they, number one, are able to, and number two, would in fact fund the president's call for the surge in Iraq, how does this request for funding differ?",
        "And what might they do?",
        "Well, what I think they're going to end up - they will end up supporting it.",
        "Ironically, the president will be able to use the Democrats' own words against them in that they have been arguing for quite sometime that the focus on Iraq has distracted us from where Democrats see, quote, \"\"the real war on terror\"\" being in Afghanistan.",

        "There's also serious questions about the commitment of Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, to control the Taliban from their insurgencies across the war into Afghanistan as well.",
        "So the fact is the Taliban are back there.",
        "They seem to be working hand in hand once again with al-Qaida and it really is a - it's one rare area of agreement, I think, between the Democratic Congress and the Republican White House.",
        "Callie Crossley, do you share that view?",
        "I believe that this may be the one instance that's, you know, money may be well spent.",
        "Though I have to ask the question: Where is all these money coming from?",
        "You know, going in there to beat back the Taliban was a really serious issue, and that's a real serious security force, not just for the region but I think it does have some long-range implications for the United States.",
        "However, I mean, I'm just completely suspicious about, you know, the request for any new money.",
        "And I think that's because - I don't think I'm alone in this.",
        "I think as people keep hearing about more and more requests for money for Iraq, it makes you suspicious about there being any legitimacy to these kinds of efforts."

        "Marcelo, the points that are being made that the Democrats would probably fall in line with regard to giving this money to the president for Afghanistan raises an issue that I'd like you to address, and that is whether or not the Democrats are really, although they are technically in power, are they really in control with regard to how they could spend money either in Afghanistan or in Iraq because of the political capital that's at stake?",
        "Well, control is the key issue.",
        "So technically, of course, from a constitutional point of view, Congress will have a big say in the ways in which appropriations for the war effort are made.",
        "But this now has a life of its own and, as Robert suggested, we're going back to where we began, really facing, however, a very, very different set of coordinates.",

        "It's deep winter in the mountains, and we are in for what will likely be a new substantial offensive in the spring by the Taliban.",
        "We have an increasingly clear failure on the part of the Pakistani apparatus to control the Taliban operatives, al-Qaida operatives, working from the Pakistani-side of the border.",
        "So we're facing really what has become an increasingly dangerous set of coordinates in that region of the world.",
        "And I think the Democratic Congress will have very little room in terms of making political statements about this.",
        "This is one point where the gravitational force of the war is such that there will probably be alignment between the president and the Democratic Congress.",
        "And part of the problem you do have, of course, which touches upon something that Callie just brought up, is that, you know, money is fungible.",
        "I mean, in terms of - you can approve $10 billion to go to Afghanistan, but once it gets into the - I mean once it actually is authorized, the Defense Department obviously can spend it wherever they see fit.",
