        "I am happy that one of the minors is being released, but I'm also saddened that there are nine children that are still going to be incarcerated and away from their families.",
        "So here's my question to you, Callie Crossley, about what is feeding racial tension in 2007, particularly for young people.",
        "Long Beach, for those of you who do not know, is a racially diverse port city of about a half million people.",
        "What's driving this kind of behavior?",
        "Well, I think there's all kinds of forces and that - even if it's racial - even if you're in a racially diverse community, difference is difference and it's always approached with some kind of skepticism.",
        "That whole the other thing sets people off.",
        "And I think you have an especially volatile situation here when you're talking about a group of young people, because if there's a slightest spark of tension, groups then get negative energy inside.",
        "And that propels folks in a group to do - to some action that they would not have taken perhaps by themselves.",
        "And I think there was a lot going on.",
        "It was Halloween night.",
        "There was, you know, here I am with a group.",
        "I'm feeling very feisty.",
        "I got the backing of my little posse and I want to say some things.",
        "But I would wonder if any of those kids expected it to take the turn that it did.",
        "Now having said that, a hate crime is a hate crime, and I do believe that it needs to be addressed in the sternest way possible.",
        "Though it seems very sad to me that a lot of the kids in question here had no history of any kind of violence or problems and were in fact quite good students at their schools.",
        "So it's very sad.",
        "That's one of the arguments that was made.",
        "And in fact - if you are just joining us, you are listening to NPR's NEWS & NOTES.",

        "And we are talking about the verdict in the Long Beach hate-crime trial.",
        "Robert George, what's your take on it?",
        "Well, my take is - you know, two observations.",
        "I'm one of those people who is skeptical about the entire idea of hate crimes per se.",
        "I think that any kind of an incident should be judged specifically on the incontrovertible facts.",
        "If you got one group that is - one group of young people, regardless of their race, beating up another one, it's an assault situation.",
        "And I, just generally speaking, don't like the idea of an add-on because one is white and one is black, or whatever the case may be."

        "Well, let me just ask you, would you feel the same way had the race roles been reversed in this case?",
        "Oh yes, absolutely.",
        "I mean, I don't like the idea of hate-crime statutes where you have an add-on because an individual - now if you're like, for example, if somebody is, you know, burning a cross on somebody's lawn, you certainly can charge them in terms of intimidation or arson or whatever you want.",

        "I mean, we had a similar incident here in Brooklyn, not too long ago where a young - a young group of black girls came to a public basketball court, and there were some young white girls from the local Catholic school playing, and they decided to, you know, decided to start beating them up as well.",
        "One of the things that is increasingly disturbing, I think, frankly, is a lot of these kind of incidents are involving young girls as opposed to just young men, and that's something - what we - I think society also needs to take a look at as well.",
        "Marcelo.",
        "Yes, if I may, two issues.",
        "First, there is a very well-established legal precedent for the category of crimes, where really the purpose of the crime is to target entire groups of individuals.",
        "And to in a way multiply, let's say the terror or the fear that is perpetrated in the crime.",
        "That's the legal philosophy behind the idea of a hate crime, that you have a victim, but that you also have a category of people that become immediately targeted by - let's call it the symbolic aspects of the crime.",
        "But the issue in Long Beach is also in the context of increasing gang violence.",
        "In Southern California, we've seen the pattern of killings between Latino gangs targeting African-American.",
        "So this is part of a general dynamic of violence, a general dynamic of dystopia that really gets at the heart of the problems we're having in our schools, in our job sites, in our community centers, in our churches, around the kinds of conversations that are culturally-plural democracy needs to have for all of us to get along.",
        "And especially troubling is the issue that young people are so involved in these crimes.",
        "All right, let's move on to our last topic of the day.",
        "Well, one of the last two.",
