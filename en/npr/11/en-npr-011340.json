        "Yes.",

        "I want to be really careful, but its name, Balaur bondoc, means stocky dragon.",

        "We didn't name it.",

        "It has two claws, one on the first toe and on the second.",
        "So it's small - it's about the size of a Labrador, they say, but it's fearsome, scary.",
        "Wow.",
        "So it's - it is - and you went up there and you got a good tour of it.",
        "And it's on - it's Flora - it's Video Pick of the Week, up on our website at sciencefriday.com.",
        "And you can see it, and it's kind of interesting.",
        "Yeah, check it out.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "It's got a whole history.",
        "It comes from Europe, which is a place we don't think a lot of, you know, all these - this era dinosaur existed.",
        "It's - yeah.",
        "I didn't know this, but about 70 million years ago Europe was a set of islands.",
        "And so the interesting part about this study is that these islands sort of bred weird dinosaurs like this one.",
        "I mean, this is a top predator and it's pretty small.",
        "In North America at the time, this is when T-rex is roaming around.",
        "So you can get a sense of the contrast of the types of predators in these two ecosystems.",
        "Thank you, Flora.",
        "Thanks, Ira.",
        "So if you want to see a really vicious-looking tiny little dinosaur the size of a Labrador retriever - what's the size - well, we have to come up with these sizes to measure, because there were reports that it was the size of a turkey, at one point.",
        "Now when you actually look at the size of the dinosaur, they said it was like, six or seven feet wide.",
        "Well, unless you're having like 50 people over for Thanksgiving.",
        "A big turkey.",
        "A big turkey - this is not going to be something that you can - able to, you know, it doesn't go well.",
        "But the interesting part is that this actually had this extra claw in it, and they were excited, the curator was pretty excited himself, wasn't he?"

        "And first, the formula that you've worked with here tells us how long it takes them, how much shaking it takes them, to get to the state of complete dryness or just to begin to shake the water off?",
        "Basically what we've derived is a formula that will predict how fast an animal will shake, not how long, not how many shakes just at what frequency they will shake.",
        "And this formula is based on how much centripetal force can be generated on the water on a dog's body.",
        "If you can imagine you're on a merry-go-round, standing in the center, the forces on the body are going to be very small.",
        "As you move out towards the outer radius, the forces are going to increase.",
        "So for smaller animals, they have to spin faster to achieve an equivalent amount of force on the water on their bodies to get it to release.",
        "So bigger animals don't have to shake as fast as, say, smaller animals like mice would.",
        "And the way you measure the speed of shaking is by hertz, by cycles per second.",
        "Right.",
        "So basically, we'll just wet an animal and use a high-speed video camera to record it shaking off water.",
        "Now, I'd like to give you an opportunity to impart the most surprising facts that our listeners will hear today, which is the shaking speed of, you know, some of the animals you looked at.",
        "Okay.",
        "I'll say the bigger animals, they all seem to shake around four hertz, say the bear and..."

        "That's about four shakes, rotations of the body, per second.",
        "Right.",
        "But as you get smaller, the exponential factor will basically raise that for shaking frequency for of, say a mouse, close to 30 hertz.",
        "But you're saying that when a mouse shakes itself, each shake is just a few hundredths of a second.",
        "Right.",
        "So a mouse gets in approximately 27 shakes per second.",
        "And what let you into this widely neglected field of research?",
        "Well, our lab is basically interested in bio-inspired design and understanding mechanisms that happen in nature.",
        "And the original thought was that we could use what we find in this research to design a more efficient washing machine or design something that we haven't even thought about yet.",
        "And there's no chance of really extrapolating to humans here as to how we might or would we just have to shake ourselves so much that it would hardly be worth it?",
        "Well, humans certainly can't shake this fast.",
        "If you were to get down on all fours and try to shake off water after a shower, your efforts would be most unfruitful.",
