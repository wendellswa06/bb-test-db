        "We should note, Tara Setmayer, that Arlen Specter, Republican Senator from Pennsylvania is on the judiciary committee, and a very well-respected, quite frankly, on both sides of the aisle, Senator, but one of the things we're seeing is some suggesting that there are people who want it both ways, that you want to allow, because you know the boost in the economy that America receives from these workers, you want to allow them, quote, \"\"guest worker status,\"\" but you don't want to give them some of the benefits that should come along to those that work full-time in this country."
