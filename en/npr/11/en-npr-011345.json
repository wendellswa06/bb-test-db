        "I mean, it's designed to be the big inter - you know, the big superhighway or power - ideally, a lot of clean power, but power overall.",
        "But also, the other end of the spectrum is, if someone has a solar panel on their roof like I do, or someone has a fuel cell in the basement, we'll often upload that power from a given home and step it up to transformers all the way to the big lines, and it could come down at your neighbor's house.",
        "And so, in some sense, you'd like to be able to make smart decisions about routing power based on demand.",
        "And so, it really is a grid kind of with the brains of cell phones and neural networks and things build into it, but it means a lot of different things.",

        "Well, I think it can - we can simplify it.",
        "Like all things, words tend to get used to serve special interests.",
        "Smart grid is exactly the definition in the dictionary.",
        "It is a grid that is able to quickly learn from experience and adapt accordingly.",
        "It is simply the overlay of an electronic control system and real-time telecommunications over the existing infrastructure.",
        "It is not about stretching new lines or new hardware of that sort.",

        "Right.",
        "And it is certainly the opportunity to bring in new technologies, renewable energy.",
        "Today, the use of clean, renewable energy is fundamentally limited by the dumb grid.",
        "The clean energy portfolios that states are passing, frankly, aren't worth the paper they're written on in today's power grid because the power grid cannot reliably or cost effectively include any of that or very much of that new generation.",
        "So, the intelligence here is fundamental, not only to our economy and to our energy future, but also to our environmental future.",
        "Speaking of that, Dan, can the current grid manage increasing renewables, like wind in the Dakotas or solar or thermal that might be out in the Southwest?",
        "Well, the simple answer's no because the grid simply doesn't go to many of the place where you might ideally like to build those new power plants.",
        "I mean, it's not surprising, because we built the grid around the power plants in the cities that we had.",
        "We didn't build it necessarily to go to some of the desert areas or the high plains, windy areas.",
        "So, in terms of just where it's physically laid out at size, it doesn't reach those places.",

        "It's also the fact that some of these a new renewables are intermittent.",
        "They go on and off when nature turns them on and off.",
        "And so, you need to have, not just the wires, but also the smart aspect, the control, so that if you suddenly get a surge of power or a big drop, you're able to route things around.",

        "It is an ultimate achievement, but it's one that's all sort of physical relays and clickers.",
        "It's not the kind of thing that reminds us of a brain that routes power and uses neural network systems and learning to really optimize where you send it, especially if we're going to have something, which is much more responsive.",

        "Well, our system is also centralized.",
        "Would a smart grid, Kurt, be better to decentralize it, so that the different areas of the country won't be blacked out when one other part goes in - goes out?",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "Well, let's divide that question into two pieces here.",
        "One, a smart grid is one that is able to self-correct or self-heal itself instantaneously at the speed of light.",
        "The system detects a problem before it occurs or - and corrects accordingly.",
        "That is not possible today.",
        "So, if you have a very small local outage, it can often magnify itself and cascade over a whole state or a whole region.",
        "We recall the big northeast blackout back in 2003.",
        "That really came from a relatively minor incident in Ohio that cascaded because the system could not control itself.",
        "But the second part - and I think very important - is the ability to introduce what is known as distributed power.",
        "This seamless integration of the supply and the demand side of the system, eliminating what I call the iron curtain of the electricity meter today, and instead, providing a seamless connection of supply and demand, with a smart grid allows us to use distributed generation sources to augment the power - bulk power systems.",
        "So, if the bulk power system for any reason does go down, the system can self-island itself and use distributed power in that to fill the gap.",
        "And even more importantly, I believe this is where we're going to see the big breakthroughs in clean, renewable energy.",
        "The idea of converting our buildings from what might be called power pigs today to power plants.",
        "Net-zero-energy buildings is a reality that's being done in many parts of the world.",
        "The building produces as much energy as it consumes.",
        "And so, affordable tanks on the roof, efficiency smart buildings and homes that are very efficient and under the control of the tenant or owner of the building is really the way of the future.",
        "This is the real payoff of a smart grid.",
        "We will - wherever this is done, people save considerable sums of money, and they use much less energy in the process.",
        "Dan Kammen, do you agree with that definition?",
        "Yeah, I think it's right.",
        "And what's, I think, interesting about this idea of turning buildings from just sinks of power - places that consume it - to generators is that you get a lot of benefits.",
        "One is that you get this added reliability, this robustness against problems.",
        "You can island areas if there's a problem outside.",
        "But you also introduce market forces in a very useful way, because if the solar on my roof and the heat plant in another building or the wind turbine in another area are all on the grid and essentially are allowed to compete, you can do two things.",
        "One is you can bring more entrance into the game of selling power.",
        "But you can also introduce the other rules we might like.",
        "So, it's not just cost per kilowatt hour, it could be cost and reliability and low carbon, so you could essentially set up bids and auctions where you're trying to reward those things.",
        "The more reliable, the more green and low cost can all be competed in.",
        "And so, you move to a system that - I do think that the eBay is an interesting analogy, but you really have to set up good rules for it.",
        "And those are all possibilities, and as Kurt said, we're already seeing bits of this here and there.",
        "There are some local experiments, and Europe is working on a system now.",
        "Japan has it.",
        "It's also opens the promise for a lot of developing country communities that may never get decentralized grid in the ways we're describing for a long time, but could begin to build regional ones around cities or around - there's one in Kenya that's being built around a beer factory, because they have excess power when they're not brewing, and so they use that, and they sell in the local area.",
        "So, these technologies can be very low-cost.",
        "What - does that mean we don't need to invent anything new - maybe super conductors or a transmission lines or things like that?",
        "Does it become second nature after a while?",
