        "The search begins and 10 of the best candidates have been chosen.",
        "We can certainly do a huge amount today by marrying what we know about electronics with essentially the hardware and the smarts in the new information technology.",
        "I mean, a lot of the chips and a lot of those things in your cell phone go a long way, but not the whole way.",
        "There's real questions that are going to be faced by the current administration about - some of the questions, like should we be installing big DC lines that are essentially very efficient for transporting power long distance, but it's expensive to get power on and off?",
        "So, if you want to bring power, say, a thousand miles from really rich wind or solar areas into metropolitan areas, do you go with that route with some amount of controls, or do you really try to build something that looks more like today's system?",
        "We need a good deal of better power electronics, better switching, a lot of the smarts to - as just Kurt said, to sense a lot of these problems.",
        "A great deal of the down time we get in our grid is because it was slow to react, and you block out a whole area, as opposed to having the grid sense it and say, well, let's avoid that area and let's get in there and fix it.",
        "Is there money - I'll ask both of you - is there money in the new stimulus package to bring all of this about?",
        "Well, not all of it, but there's a good start.",
        "There's about $11 billion in there, which some people say is just a bit of a down payment.",
        "But because this is really the first big push to get smart grid going, it can hopefully be used well to set up a number tests to develop some of the hardware.",
        "And because we've known for a long time that we're going to need to invest in the grid, hopefully this is, you know, this is - don't let a good crisis go to waste.",
        "We can use this to start that process.",
        "But in time, we're likely to need a great deal of money, and the estimates now range from 200 billion to 400 billion or more to really make the grid widely smart.",
        "But the local consumers and producers benefit, so there's really distributed benefit, like having more Internet connections turned on.",
        "Kurt, you want to jump in?",
        "Yeah, I'd like to underscore that the cost here - this is not a situation that requires a bailout.",
        "(Laughing) We may require a leading hand from the federal level, because the system today is primarily regulated at the state level, and the regulations today at the state level still reward utilities - the people who own and operate the power system - primarily for - on how much electricity they sell.",
        "There is not an incentive today in their compensation, if you will, for efficiency and reliability.",
        "And therein lies the fundamental problem.",
        "So, the federal level really has to step in, almost as we did in the Interstate Highway Act back in the 1950s, and say, look, we will put in some seed money to help here, but the savings are so immense, the societal benefits are so great, that you need to take leadership in raising the performance bar on your system.",
        "We are working with a number of communities in different states who, as communities, are prepared to have bond issues to help raise the quality of power, because it's costing them jobs.",
        "Companies are leaving their communities because the power service is so poor.",
        "So, we talk about $200 billion or more to fix the grid, that's true.",
        "But we will save - it's costing us today over $1 trillion a year as a nation, and everyone who is a citizen in this nation is paying for that bill in the cost of goods and services, in lost jobs, in lost productivity and lost competitiveness.",
        "We're talking about the smart grid this hour on Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow, talking with Kurt Yeager and Daniel Kammen.",
        "Just a couple of minutes to go before we got to go to the break.",
        "Where would you start, Dan, where would you start on this giant project?",
        "Well, I think you want to start with getting some good ground rules in play.",
        "And we've already got a couple that sort of help to deal with some of the issues.",
        "A number of states have done something to decouple the total sales of electricity from the revenues for the big utilities, which sounds a little bit counterintuitive, but what it basically says is, you, as a utility, forecast your sales, and if you sell more power than that, you get the same amount of money, you just got paid less per kilowatt hour, if you sell less, you get pay more per kilowatt hour.",
        "That's a rule that encourages and incentivizes efficiency.",
        "We could be setting up rules that encourage reliability and that essentially say, buy efficiency and low-carbon sources first.",
        "And those rules, if applied to utilities and the grid operators, which are sometimes the same but not always, start you off in this way.",
        "And I would certainly also want to see a couple regional experiments at the city scale at the larger scale to figure out which are the really critically missing pieces of the technology by demonstrating it, and then really incentivize that and some of this new spending."

        "Boulder, Colorado, is a community that gets a good deal of attention, Austin, Texas, smaller communities - we just completed the transformation of the campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology to what we call a perfect power microgrid, and that has received a substantial Department of Energy grant to accelerate it, because it's a model for doing it on a national basis.",
        "And I would point out here - again, I think we're both saying that while this interstate transport and, if you will, a national superhighway system for electricity is useful, it is only useful in the context if we transform the local system.",
        "Otherwise, we have an interstate highway system dumping the electricity into communities whose power system is the equivalent of a dirt road, one path, one direction without any traffic signals - would be the ultimate in gridlock.",
        "Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was John McCain's economic advisor in last year's presidential campaign, is also skeptical of the effect of the stimulus.",

        "Holtz-Eakin says today's release of job numbers is important politically for the administration.",
        "So, we really have to focus on the local areas, and of course, that means the federal government has to challenge, in some cases, a little bit of states' rights here, which is a difficult political problem, but one which I think the federal government, if they're really serious about this transformation and its critical nature for the sustainability of our country, have to say then that states' rights are great, but not when they interfere with the national good.",

        "They're more than welcome to surf over there.",
        "Tell us how you did this, Dr. Kuiken.",
        "Well, there's two parts to this study.",
        "The first is that we have moved the nerves that used to control an arm to different muscles in the body and used these muscles as biological amplifiers, if you will.",
        "So, imagine a patient with a shoulder disarticulation.",
        "My colleague, Dr. Gregory DeMonion(ph), a surgeon, went into the arm, found the nerves that used to go to the arm and then transferred them onto the chest muscles of our one patient.",
        "The nerves then grow into these muscles, and when the patient thinks, close hand, now a little piece of his chest muscle contracts.",
        "If he thinks, bend elbow, a different piece of his chest muscle contracts.",
        "And we can detect those contractions, because every time you use a muscle, it lets off a little bit of electricity.",
        "So, we pick up that electricity with electrodes, or little antennas, sitting on the skin.",
        "And we've been successful with this technique using commercially available arms in quite a number of patients to be able to control hand opening, closing and elbow bending.",
        "The second part of the study - and what this paper is about - is now decoding those signals more.",
        "So, if you think about it, the nerve that closes your hand actually does lots of things - it bends your fingers, it moves your thumb, it bends your wrist.",
        "And so, what we've done is, using those antennas and a computer decoding program called pattern recognition, we can determine the intent of the amputee to do more things.",
        "So, they think about bend their wrist, we can recognize that wrist flexion pattern and make the artificial wrist bend.",
        "They think about doing a fine pinch using their thumb and first finger to pick up a small object.",
        "Well, now we can recognize that they want to be doing a fine pinch versus a power grasp for holding a baseball bat, and go into different modes with the hand.",
        "So, you had to define what the signals were for each of these fine movements and then get a computerized control of them with the hand?",
        "Correct.",
        "So, what we do is first train the program.",
        "We have a - all these antennas or electrodes on the skin, and we ask the patient to try and do these different movements - bend your wrist, make an OK sign, bend your elbow, et cetera.",
        "To think about them?",
        "Well, it's more than thinking about it.",
        "It's actually they're trying to do it, so I - you can sit there and think and not move your arm."

        "Right.",
        "You can think about it, but when you actually try and do it, you make your muscles contract.",
        "So, they're actually trying to do this in making their newly reanimated muscles contract.",
        "So, as they do this series of movements, we record the data, and then the computer program sorts it out and tries to figure out which pattern goes with which movement.",
        "It's a lot similar to the technology used for voice recognition, for example.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So, once we can figure out what pattern or what movement they're trying to do, then we can have the prosthesis do that movement.",
        "Well, you definitely get better at it.",
        "So, compared to current technology, where you just use whatever muscles are left to operate your arm, it's a big improvement.",
        "So, with an above-elbow amputee, for example, you can use your biceps and triceps muscles to control everything.",
        "And it works pretty good for the elbow, that's natural.",
        "But it's not real natural to then have to use those muscles to control your hand.",
        "You don't flex your biceps to try and close your hand.",
        "Here, we're at least letting the person do the natural motion - try and do the natural motion to make the arm move.",
        "Now, it's a long way still from the ability of using our real arms and our real hand, but it's a marked step forward for the science.",
        "And how many separate movements can you do now?",
        "Well, we so far have demonstrated with the real arms that a patient can control shoulder out, shoulder up, rotating the arm, and those are done with complex switches, as well as EMG signals.",
        "And then the re-innervated muscles can control elbow bending, wrist bending and extending, wrist rotation and up to four or five different hand grasp patterns.",

        "And can you get to that refinement?",
        "Well that would be a wonderful goal.",
        "But that's a real hard one, because to have really fluid motion, you need to be able to feel your arm in space.",
        "And these prosthesis have no ability to feel their arm in space.",
        "We do have some related science where we get the hand sensation nerves to grow into new skin, so for example, the chest skin, so that when you touch these patients on their chest, they feel like you're touching their missing hand.",
        "And that's some exciting work that may allow us to get, you know, the ability to know when you've grabbed a cup or how hard you're squeezing it and also be very important to make the arm feel like it's really your arm.",
        "So, that cutaneous sensation is exciting, but we're still missing what we call propre(ph) reception or the ability to know where your arm is in space.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Let's see if we can get a couple of calls in here.",
        "1-800-989-8255, Thomas in Flagstaff.",
        "Hi, welcome to Science Friday.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "You guys keep saying that the patient's think about moving the prosthetic.",

        "Do you understand my question?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "So, in going down to pick up a cup, you just pick up the cup.",
        "Well, our patient still has to think about how to position their arm one at a time.",
        "So, you have to think, OK, I want to straighten my elbow out, and you watch them straighten out the elbow.",
        "And then I need to open my hand, and they think about opening their hand.",
        "And then I need to rotate my wrist a little bit to line it up with the cup, and they do that.",
        "And then they think, I'm going to just close it with a power grasp.",
        "OK, so…",
        "Wow, that's amazing.",
        "They have - but you know, as opposed to you really not thinking about it - you reflexively almost do it - they do have to position each movement and watch it to close the loop, because they can't feel it."
