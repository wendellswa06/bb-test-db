        "All right.",

        "You're welcome.",
        "And you know, the arm and the hand looks very real to life, also.",
        "Yes, that's true.",
        "Do you work on that at the same time?",
        "Well, the arms were created by the Defense Advance Research Project's agency program.",
        "So, one was built by Decker Research Corporation, and the other is being built at a program at Johns Hopkins University applied physics lab.",
        "So, they are truly pieces of art and engineering.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And what about other limbs?",
        "I guess the arm and certainly the hand must be the most difficult of all the body limbs to be working on.",
        "Well, we don't do as well as we do with legs.",
        "Patients who've missed - who are missing a leg, we do better with prosthesis.",
        "They aren't as complicated, in terms of the dexterity of movement.",
        "That's not to say that there isn't room for improvement, but we don't do nearly as well with artificial arms.",
        "In fact, only about half of people who have one arm amputated bother to wear a prosthesis, because it's not good enough as they currently exist to make it worth the while of putting it on and having that weight and all that carrying it around.",
        "But now with this new kind - the new type that gives you so much more movement, do you think more people will demand this?",
        "I hope so.",
        "I hope people - I consider it success if more people want to wear and use the arm.",
        "If it's of value, it's good enough to be used.",
        "And we're seeing that.",
        "Again, it's still small and early, but in the regular prostheses that we've modified to use the targeted re-innervation so far, the feedback is very good.",
        "But this is not something paid for by insurance, is it?"

        "It matters enormously which is why we're seeing this approach of bringing out numbers as quickly as possible and as often as possible to show tangible results for the bill.",
        "Regular arms - motorized arms with hands and elbows - are usually paid for by insurance.",
        "And now, at the Rehab Institute of Chicago and Northwestern University, we can do this surgery to allow a person to use a regular arm better.",
        "In terms of these very advanced prototypes that you see on the video, those are still on the research phase.",
        "Those are still being developed through the DARPER Program, and we hope to see versions of these arms make it to the market to help our wounded warriors and the rest of the public.",

        "Hello.",
        "I want to say, this sounds just absolutely wonderful, the work you're doing.",
        "What I'm really curious about - it would seem like - I know nothing about the complexity of the technology you're working with or how much more complicated what I'm about to suggest would get, but is there application or possibility of application for work with paralysis?",
        "No, and I wish it were, because there's a lot of people who get paralyzed arms from nerve injury.",
        "But what we need is for the nerve to be intact, because the nerve is essentially the data channel that we get all the information from.",
        "And if the nerve is damaged, it's like having the cord to your phone cut, and it just won't work.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "So, you could not go down below - just speaking off the top of my head - the damage site where the nerves may still be working?",
        "Well, nerves are like phone cords.",
        "If they're broken in the middle, then they just don't work.",
        "Right.",
        "They don't work beyond that.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "In the case of the amputee, it works from the neck down to where it was cut, and we can use that portion that's left and swing it over to a new amplifier.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And you work with the lower limb amputees also?",
        "Yes, we do."

        "We do better, especially with people who've lost their leg below the knee.",
        "The prostheses have gotten much better over the last 20, 30 years with lighter materials, more energy storing materials and more comfortable materials.",
        "It's still - we still would like to have better control and power for legs, because you know, our muscles are down there for a good reason, and we would like to replace that lost movement.",
        "But we do - relative to arms, we do better, because you can essentially walk on a passive device fairly well.",
        "Yeah.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "We have lots of improvements to make to make the control system more robust so that, you know - right now the patient has to think, OK, I'm going to bend my wrist, but they have to remember to bend it the same way they did last time.",
        "Ah.",
        "And so, you have to train the patient as well.",
        "So, we need to get our computer programs more robust and get our training down and our interfaces better.",
        "And then, the motorized devices need to be refined.",
        "They need more work to get down to a more acceptable weight and robustness that can withstand a patient.",
        "Patients are very hard on these devices."
