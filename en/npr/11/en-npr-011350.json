        "Or to be more precise, why does he want the rest of the company he doesn't already own if he's just going to turn around and sell it to Disney?",
        "Well, it helps to keep in mind, of course, that the Disney offer is more recent than his own.",
        "And it helps to keep in mind a lot of history going back more than a generation.",

        "And then he's been trying in recent years to rebuild it.",
        "There have been a lot of regulatory blocks to that in the U.K.",
        "And he's been trying to get around it, most recently promising to insulate Sky News, which is a part of Sky, from his editorial interference for about a decade.",
        "That's a big promise.",
        "Nonetheless, he wants it to sort of build up what he had to give his sons, Lachlan and James, as they continued.",

        "You look at Netflix - such a big buyer of major entertainment.",
        "You look at Apple, Amazon, other players coming into the market that might wipe out some Hollywood players.",
        "They thought, better to team up with Disney and try to compete with this growing surge of streaming services.",
        "And Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, didn't seem all that interested in Sky until today when it submitted this bid - is part of Comcast's motivation just trying to block a deal that might benefit its rivals?",
        "I think it's a bit of a twofer.",
        "You thwart Disney to some extent, and you take over something that has an opportunity to help them build their international stake as well.",
