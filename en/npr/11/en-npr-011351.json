        "What the federal government in the United States essentially does is take money from the wealthier states, pass those on to the weaker states which run deficits with Washington, but we don't think of it as surpluses and deficits because they're all part of a fiscal union.",
        "In Europe, it's not like that at all.",
        "Until now, the center has not been able to borrow on its own at all.",
