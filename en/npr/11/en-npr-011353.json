        "But airlines couldn't or wouldn't pass those costs along to consumers.",
        "There was, in the summer of 2005, and has been for the last couple of years, just a terrible collision of the young carriers and the low-fare, low-cost carriers, holding prices down, and the legacy carriers, the traditional major airlines, wanting to hold on to market share, so they held the price down even though it meant that they carried people around at a loss.",
