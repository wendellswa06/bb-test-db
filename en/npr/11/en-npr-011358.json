        "As he talks, pictures of Obama and his family and Grand Park play behind him.",
        "On November 4th, these images were broadcast live into Iran.",
        "Next week, same job, more money.",
        "What happens when a worker moves up from a low-wage to a living wage.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "In fact, you have a complicated situation where, as part of her enterprise, she will have, as you mentioned, black henchman who are with her at all times.",
        "What was it like to get into this space where you could portray not just slave and free but also these nuances of allegiances?",
        "Well, I'm a little embarrassed to confess it.",
        "It wasn't that hard to get into Cannon's head or into the head of her henchmen because people were starving.",
        "People were hungry, and people will do a lot for money, irrespective of how it affects others.",
        "Now you have scenes of violence, combat, brutality.",
        "At one point near the end of the book, you say simply it was all hands and teeth now.",
        "You say it wasn't that hard to get into the mindset of, you know, the struggles that people throughout humanity have had.",
        "What was it like to write combat scenes?",
        "It was not easy.",
        "The combat scenes that you speak of involve a character named the Woeman(ph), who was a black slave who lives out in the woods and who even black people are afraid of, and he lives free, and he ends up fighting Patty Cannon and others to try to free his son, who's been captured.",
        "And those scenes were difficult to do partly because the Woeman, although he is kind of a wild person, he's basically a shy man who is afraid of people.",
        "And I've never written about violence in a way that, you know, that is superfluous or meaningless.",
        "These battle scenes, these fight scenes, had to take place in order for the characters to free themselves of the inner and outer demons that plagued them."

        "Why do you have so many strong and differentiated female characters?",
        "I mean in your memoir, you also are telling a woman's story.",
        "Why do you seem to gravitate towards female characters?",
        "Listen, I was raised by a strong woman, and also women have a kind of emotional makeup that men don't have in that, without generalizing but at least in my life, I've seen women take the kind of emotional hits that would shatter men into a million pieces.",
        "Women simply get up off the canvas, and they come back at you again and again - not necessarily with fists but with a will and a determination and a sense of desire and boldness and courage that sometimes men just can't drum up.",
        "I mean men, it seems kind of a testosterone element, you know.",
        "But women, they just seem to be stronger.",
        "They have a lot more emotional business that you can manipulate as a writer, and they're deeper.",
        "And also, they're not spoken for in the context of historical novels.",
        "Historically, women have done so much more and are a lot more interesting to deal with rather than, you know, the Jesse Jameses and the John Waynes, and so forth that we've become used to mythologizing.",
        "What about the code?",
        "You have this running theme of signs and symbols that enslaved people can show to each other in different ways, clothing and items that are hung from trees and all sorts of lines drawn in the dirt.",
        "How much of that comes from research, and how much of that is something that you invented to hold this story together?",
        "I don't know.",
        "A lot of it is real.",
        "Look, when I went to Oberlin Conservatory, one of the first classes I took was an African-American music history course.",
        "Now anyone who's taken an African-American music history course from anyone who knows what they're doing, will see that a lot of what was handed down historically in terms of black history, musically, has to do with the messages that people gave each other through the music.",
        "So in terms of the codes, I think the music is quite evident that the codes existed, at least in terms of the music.",
        "In terms of the other things, quilt signs that were made on quilts, blacksmithing, blacksmith hammering at certain tempos and times and so forth - I think some of that existed.",
        "How much of it, I don't know.",
        "You know, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, they never told.",
        "They never revealed how they got free.",
        "In fact, Frederick Douglass, he criticized those like Henry Box Brown and so forth, the guy who shipped himself North in a box.",
        "He criticized those people for telling folks how they got free because he knew there were millions of others who were trying still to get free.",
        "I don't think the codes were like a book, like you know, an army manual, like this was code, but I think in certain regions, in certain areas, there's no question that there were codes, unwritten codes, that were used by those who worked the trade.",
        "How much?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I mean, some of the business I cooked up on my own, but most of it I found from other places.",
        "You have a physical space where you write and you also perform, practice your music.",
        "What is it about being a musician that also stimulates you, and what different flavor does it bring to your life than writing?",
        "Well I - you know, I have a little spot in Manhattan, Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen, that I've been going to for years that I share with a guy who fixes saxophones, and I go in and chat with him.",
        "Musicians are different.",
        "They like to talk.",
        "They're a little bit like journalists.",
        "They're like cheap intellectuals.",
        "They know a little bit about a few things, but..."

        "So I mean, the camaraderie of music and being with musicians, and the collaborative process that is involved in the music process is something that helps me as a writer and as a screenwriter.",
        "Because even to write a book like \"\"Song Yet Sung,\"\" you have to interview dozens of people.",
        "You have to involve people in the collaborative process or you won't get the material that you need that will make your story go.",

        "If you're a creative person, there's always a next, a next, another idea.",
        "What's the worst part to you about doing what you do?",
        "Probably having to get up at 3:00 in the morning because you heard someone say something, and you need to write it down, or you get an idea, you need to write it down, also the notion that this is easy work.",
        "And also, you become a target.",

        "So you have to kind of shut yourself off from the world a little bit, and that hurts you artistically, a little bit.",
