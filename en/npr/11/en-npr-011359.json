        "So, how did we get from one of the safest activities on the planet, insurance, to one of the riskiest, gambling?",
        "Well, there's one key difference between an insurance policy and a credit default swap.",
        "Again, here's Gregg Berman.",
        "The way that I first described the credit default swap is that you own the bond and you'd like to transfer that risk to someone else.",
        "But what if I want to buy protection, but I don't own the bond?",
        "So why would I buy protection on a bond I don't own?",

        "It is exactly like buying insurance for a house that you don't own.",

        "When that happens, what you're doing is you're betting on the house.",

        "A CDS allows people to get paid off by insuring something they don't own.",
        "Not a house in this case, but a bond.",
        "Here's how it works.",
        "A credit default swap is what they call an over-the-counter instrument, meaning it's not something that's traded publicly on an exchange, like a stock.",
        "It's a private deal between two people.",
        "Those two people can be anyone.",
        "Well, anyone with more than $5 million.",

        "It doesn't say that.",
        "In fact, it says quite the contrary.",
        "But, you know, that can be mincing words at the end of the day.",
        "Once again, this is the - Robert Mueller, by all accounts, you know, a person highly qualified to conduct this investigation and found no basis to charge and, you know, did not make any suggestion to Congress that there should be impeachment proceedings.",
        "And, finally, can I just ask you to reflect on the question I asked the former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales a few minutes ago, which is the - Robert Mueller's decision to leave the question of obstruction to the attorney general to decide.",
