        "Well, the thing about Asia is that it has an extraordinary number of unresolved disputes: border disputes, territorial disputes and disputes over the status of nations.",

        "I think these are the likeliest causes of conflict, combined with there's the fact that out of natural suspicion of one another, all three countries are seeking to strengthen their militaries.",
        "Right, and of course that is a cause for concern among some national security policymakers in the United States.",
        "But the argument you make is that the United States actually needs to stop focusing so much particularly on its relationship with China as the only thing that counts and sort of develop a foreign policy that sees China as part of this region with a distinct set of internal dynamics, relationships and histories."

        "The creation of Asia, an area which really didn't exist before because it was so divided up into small regions of influence of different countries, now these countries are looking across the whole of the region, all as one military and economic space, and the United States has the opportunity of treating the region as a region and trying to balance the powers against each other, a process which it has begun to do through its developing relationship with India under both Bill Clinton and, much more strongly, under George W.",

        "Well, it's a striking one, isn't it?",
        "Of course, George Bush's visit and his deal was not as revolutionary as Nixon's visit to China, but it was a major strategic move of the same magnitude in that what Nixon was doing was getting China into a relationship with the United States in which it could be a balance against the Soviet Union.",
        "In George Bush's case, he did a deal with India of a nuclear energy cooperation and a defense framework, which was aimed to bring India into a position in its relationship with the United States so that in the future, it too could be a balance against China.",
        "So it had the same kind of intent as the Nixon visit, even if it wasn't as revolutionary.",
        "It's fascinating because it's a largely forgotten trip, of course even here in the United States.",
        "Also actually because unusually, the Bush administration chose not to make a great fanfare about it, and the reason for that is because it is, essentially, anti-China.",
        "It is a containment move.",
        "But the Bush administration, understandably and sensibly, did not want to antagonize China as it was doing it.",
        "It sees this as part of a long-term strategy to get India as a card against China and doesn't want to cause Chinese opposition and criticism and stir up a fuss with the first major move.",
