        "What did that letter say?",
        "Well, that letter, it went on for two pages, but it essentially said no, you can't talk to them.",
        "And it also was a political document, because in it the President's lawyer essentially slapped the Democrats in Congress on the wrist for their tone and the - their political discussion in talking about the subpoenas and trying to talk to these two White House staffers, former White House staffers.",
        "And these two former White House staffers are Harriet Miers and Sara Taylor.",
        "Why did Congress want to subpoena them?",
        "Well, this stems from the congressional investigations into the dismissal last year of the nine chief federal prosecutors.",
        "And the House and Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to talk to Taylor and Miers because the big question is what role did the White House play in making political calculations that led to the firing of these nine federal prosecutors.",

        "Well, the White House essentially said no, they're not going to - we're not going to let you talk to them because there is a fundamental interest of the presidency at stake here.",
        "And that is that the president needs to receive candid advice from his advisors and that those advisors in the future be able to, both for this administration and future ones, be able to speak freely, speak their mind to the president and with others inside the executive branch, and know that some day they won't be called in front of Congress to talk about those discussions.",

        "Well, the White House says, yeah, you can talk to them, just you can't talk to them on the record.",
        "Why isn't that enough?",
        "Well, members of Congress say that's not really real, that you can't talk - the White House has said you can't talk to them on the record, there can be no transcripts, it has to be in private, and that, members of Congress - Republicans and Democrats - say, you know, that's not a serious way to go about business.",
        "People have different recollections.",
        "In fact, that's what this whole case has been about, is that people's recollections get so fuzzy and there's nothing more helpful than having an actual transcript where people can be held to account for what they say out loud.",

        "Has this happened before?",
        "Well, it is rare.",
        "I mean, the most famous one, of course, is Richard Nixon, and there's a question about, politically, the President has - has - since the beginning of the administration, the president and Vice President Cheney have asserted that the executive branch needs to stand firm in its debates with Congress and have always said, you know, Congress has too much power, and they want - Bush and Cheney want to reassert the power of the executive.",
        "But this kind of fight is rare with this administration.",

        "I would be researching every piece of precedent I could on the proposition that the judge could allow vigorous cross- examination, and I would be probably trying to write that instruction that I would urge Judge Brinkema to give.",
        "When Judge Brinkema returned from the break, she said she wants to hear from the seven FAA witnesses tomorrow.",
        "She could deny the government the right to seek the death penalty.",
        "In that case, Moussaoui would spend the rest of his life in prison.",
        "She can also instruct the jury about the coaching or refuse to allow the seven FAA witnesses to testify.",
        "Former prosecutor McBride said it would be difficult for the prosecution to recover if that happens.",
        "The prosecution has been trying to prove that people died because Moussaoui lied when he was picked up on immigration violations three weeks before the attacks.",
        "I think that's a very, very serious blow to the government's case, because these are seven witnesses who I think the government would use to establish the proposition that had Zacarias Moussaoui told the truth in August, there would've been measures taken that would've stopped at least one of those planes from taking lives on September 11th."
