        "One of the products of this two days of conversation in Upstate New York was a list of resolutions and an historic moment.",
        "It was completely historic, and it was Elizabeth Cady Stanton who was one of the five women who helped organize this convention, who drew up sort of what became the guiding document of the women's rights movement initially, called the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments.",
        "And used, as her model, the Declaration of Independence, which was kind of ironic.",
        "But instead of blaming George III, she blamed men for women's subordination.",
        "And her opening statement was, of course: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal.",
        "And in that document, she laid out all the injustices, and then offered resolutions to - for women to gain equality - to equality in this country.",
        "And, of course, the more - as mentioned, the most controversial demand of all was the right to vote.",
        "Which would come, what, 70 years later?",
        "Seventy-two years later it took women to finally gain the right to vote, with the passage of the 19th Amendment.",
        "So it was a long struggle, and these women were absolutely amazing, so dedicated.",
        "Just - they just never gave up.",
        "And, again, how did you feel yesterday when you heard President Obama cite Seneca Falls?",
        "I really was - as I said, I was delighted.",
        "It meant a lot to me, and I'm sure it meant a lot to women.",
        "The only thing that makes me sad is probably a lot of people don't know what Seneca Falls was.",
        "But I hope that will change.",
        "Sally McMillen, thank you very much for your time today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Sally McMillen, professor of history at Davidson College, joined us again from member station WDAV there in Davidson.",
        "More than a hundred years after Seneca Falls, another struggle for voting rights was under way: 1965, and civil rights demonstrators in Selma Alabama attempted to march peacefully to the state capital in Montgomery to protest the violent disenfranchisement of black voters.",
        "Here to tell us the story of what happened is Clayborne Carson, a professor of history at Stanford University where he directs the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute.",
        "And good of you to be with us today."

        "Good to be with you.",
        "And take us to the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7th, 1965.",
        "Well, that was one of the main confrontations of the struggle for voting rights.",
        "It was the climax of a long campaign that has been going on for a long time, with the students and the student non-violent coordinating committee, with Martin Luther King and many other groups that were there.",
        "And of course the idea of the march to Montgomery came after the killing of a civil rights worker in Marion, in Alabama.",
        "And this was a protest march to get the attention of Governor George Wallace who had been - pledged to continue segregation now and forever in his inauguration address.",
        "Segregation today, segregation forever.",
        "And the marchers reached the bridge and tried to cross.",
        "Yes, they did.",
        "And they were confronted on the other side by state troopers who were sent there by Wallace, with orders to prevent them from marching from Selma to Montgomery.",
        "So when they got to the base of the bridge, that was when they had that confrontation that was televised and became one of the iconic events of the struggle.",
        "What happened?",
        "Initially, I think the idea was that they were just going to sit down.",
        "And then the mounted troopers began charging them, firing teargas and beating them with billy clubs, forcing them back over the bridge.",
        "I think from - the major thing that was somewhat of a surprise is that King wasn't there.",
        "He wasn't aware that this was going to be this violent confrontation, and he went back to Atlanta to preach in his church.",
        "So the marchers did not have him at the front.",
        "But that would have made it even more of a, I guess, a confrontation, because of King's presence.",
        "But even without his presence, you know, this was something that was broadcast throughout the nation.",
        "I remember seeing it on television and immediately getting involved in protests.",
        "Where I was a student at UCLA, we went to the federal building, and many people throughout the nation went to their local federal buildings to demand federal intervention in this conflict in Alabama.",
        "It would be eight days later that President Lyndon Johnson introduced the Voting Rights Act.",
        "And was that a coincidence?"

        "Well, he had said that he didn't want to introduce voting rights legislation.",
        "As you'll recall from that time, he was introducing his Great Society legislation, and he thought that after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that it was time for - to take a breath and to step back from further legislation.",
        "And the Selma-to-Montgomery march put that back on the agenda for immediate action and forced his hand.",
        "And there would be other marches on that route.",
        "Really?",
        "Well, we'll have to figure out that out.",
        "Yes.",
        "Eventually, King came back and eventually got a court order allowing the marchers to go to Montgomery and the marchers arrived later in the month and - at the state capital.",
        "And a few months after that, the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed so that this was the major victory of the struggle, because King had always felt that once black Americans got to vote, all the other gains of the civil rights struggle would be protected because they would now be voting and being able to exercise their political power.",
        "And if it sounds all like ancient history, the Supreme Court is reviewing parts of that 1965 Voting Rights Act in this term.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well one of the things is that the Voting Rights Act only applied to states that had legal barriers to voting, and that was mostly in the South.",
        "And I think, since that time, there's always been resentment in the South that they should not be covered by the Voting Rights Act anymore because those kinds of conditions no longer exist.",
        "But I think the counter-argument for that is that there's other ways of preventing people from voting other than just making it impossible for black people to register.",
        "And the Voting Rights Act provides for federal clearance when changes are made in voting laws.",
        "And we know from the last election that there was efforts to change voting laws.",
        "And one the things this does is it says you can change your voting laws, but you have to make certain that these changes are not meant to disenfranchise certain groups of voters.",
        "Clayton Carson, thank you very much for reminding us about Selma.",
        "Thank you."

        "Well, the Stonewall Inn was a pretty shabby place, generally believe to have been mafia-run like most of the gay bars in major American cities at the time.",
        "The people who went out were not the equivalence of the Elizabeth Cady Stanton, nor of the well established civil rights leaders.",

        "There were some bottles and cans thrown, and there were some people injured.",
        "And it continued down for several days.",
        "But it's a quintessentially American kind of event that didn't emerged from a movement, but the movement tried to capture the sentiment of that early morning.",
        "And when they rose up and said, enough, this harassment is going to stop, at least for tonight.",
        "That also forced that gay establishment you were talking about a moment ago to broaden its outlook.",

        "And in that sense, it was a much more existential act that was captured - probably for the good, but often that these things kind of papered over, and it's put... I find it fascinating that Obama should mention it, courageous surely, but in a certain way odd because it doesn't fall exactly in the footsteps of Seneca Falls or someone.",
        "And which were much more conscious proceedings.",
        "But if you were to pick a moment in the gay rights struggle that emblemizes the movement, would that be it?",

        "So, you know, when you talk about these things, the context is always more important to me than whether event launched a movement.",
