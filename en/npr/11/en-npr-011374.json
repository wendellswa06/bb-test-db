        "Thank you, Neal.",

        "And China's first statement ahead of the Security Council's meeting seemed awfully low-key.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think, so far, what we're seeing is a mixed picture from Beijing on this.",
        "You know, their initial statement when the test was first announced was to sort of repeat a lot of their standard rhetoric, you know, resolutely and firmly opposing the test, while at the same time, calling for calm and no escalation of difficulty or problems on the Korean Peninsula.",
        "There was an interesting sort of development, though, where the foreign minister - the Chinese foreign minister summoned the North Korean ambassador to Beijing in - for a pretty stern talking to.",
        "So, so far, it's clear that China is trying to make up its mind about how to proceed.",
        "And I think it's trying to send signals to all parties right now, again, with that fundamental goal of maintaining stability on the peninsula on their mind.",
        "Maintaining stability, so China will do nothing that might threaten the implosion of North Korea, an ally but a difficult one, and went on the brink, at some point, of economic collapse.",
        "Yes, a very problematic ally and increasingly so, it seems.",
        "And China has got to be very embarrassed by this process.",
        "As you pointed out in the intro, they warned North Korea repeatedly not to do this.",
        "So they've lost a fair amount of credibility.",
        "On the one hand, it does in some ways, though, sort of move forward Beijing's case that they often make to the United States and its Asian allies, Korea and Japan, that they only have so much leverage over the North Korean regime.",
        "And clearly, here's an instance where Beijing's limited leverage was very much on display.",
        "If they have limited leverage and North Korea is going to continue with such programs, including ballistic missile test as they did in December, the United States says, China, I'm terribly sorry.",
        "But we're going to have to put some ballistic anti-missile systems in northwestern China - Asia.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's right.",
        "And this is a major concern for Beijing in terms of how that would alter the security - the broader security landscape.",
        "And they're trying to walk this fine line, and it's a very difficult one for them, between this - what is clearly a judgment by them that's something called North Korea.",
        "You know, as you pointed out, Neal, they're not happy with this regime.",
        "It's an often troublesome relationship, even for China.",
        "And I think we're really seeing some serious divisions, actually, between the two leaderships right now in terms of their approach on these issues.",
        "But at the same time, Beijing is also fundamentally concluded that for their own security and stability, there it is more valuable to have something called North Korea on their border than to have a unified Korea under American influence in South Korean auspices.",
        "So they're continually playing this game where they want to do whatever they can to maintain that status without them provoking these additional responses from the United States.",
        "And I think there's some serious questioning on the Chinese part as to how serious that U.S.",
        "commitment is.",
        "My own sense is that they're going to be surprised on that, that the north really has crossed another one of these Rubicon with what looks like a major advancement in their miniaturization program, of their nuclear weapons.",
        "And as you pointed out earlier, the test seemed to show that their delivery system capability is getting much better, as well.",
        "So Beijing increasingly has to worry that, now, the closer the north gets to something that could actually - at least in theory - reach out to the United States, the more likely that this heavier, stronger, you know, U.S.",
        "responses that Beijing really fears may come to light."
