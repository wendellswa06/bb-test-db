        "They're exquisite.",

        "That needed to be cleaned off, and some of the paintings have peeled a bit from their backdrops.",
        "They need to be reattached.",
        "But having done that, they're as good as human craft can make them now.",

        "We have a beautiful diorama of bison herds from some indefinite time in the 19th century when they still had large herds, and that is so realistic that you think, if you just saw an image of it, that it had to have been taken yesterday somewhere in Wyoming.",

        "But as he also points out, there needs to be some improvement to it.",
        "Is just being able to have some work and make a little money an improvement for someone who is struggling and is just looking for any way to bring in some cash?",
        "Yes and no. So it is an improvement in the sense that it can help them to start making some money.",
        "In fact, there's an individual I interviewed who was long-term unemployed, and he talks about being depressed and how this actually got him out of the house and making money.",
        "And it really improved his life.",
        "But the downside is that these jobs have no protections.",
        "And so workers can find themselves exposed to dangerous situations that actually leave them worse off than they started.",
        "And what about the argument that they know that going into jobs like this, like, that you know that you're going into a type of work where there are none of the standard protections?",
        "So workers are told upfront that they're independent contractors.",
        "But they're also very much marketed this entrepreneurial ethos that they are their own boss, and they can control their hours, and they have the freedom to determine their own paycheck.",
        "So the risks that they encounter - although they might sort of know it intellectually going in, it's very different to encounter these firsthand.",
        "You know, I interviewed TaskRabbits who were propositioned on the job.",
