        "But the segment that you have - had on the show, tells us how much most people - most people never heard anything about British blacks, or the runaway slaves and their story, and the institutions that they established -because they were so well known by 19th-century leaders too, And the torch was sort of passed along - is an important story.",

        "Mm hmm.",

        "Yvonne, save a couple of people like Frederick Douglass and a few others, one would believe the only history that happened - if you only go to books often taught in elementary school - that Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King - as Mary said, when these narratives get told and told and told again - were the only black people of note in America.",

        "So that being said, I think there's a lot of black history that we simply don't talk about.",
        "Black people don't talk about, and certainly, the mainstream educational system really does not promote as well.",
        "Part of what I've always been taught is that, unfortunately, the victors write history.",

        "But the idea of what we want - while I believe what Mary suggests is true, I'm not sure how big of a market that is, in terms of what African Americans want to read, by virtue of the fact that we don't tell our own stories - these narratives - to our children, without necessarily the help of a book, or otherwise.",

        "So I think we have a lot of work to do, at a sort of global macro, but also at a micro level, within our own community - making sure that those stories that we have contained within our families, that are part of the larger story - begin to be weaved together, so that we can have a fuller appreciation of who we are in this country.",
