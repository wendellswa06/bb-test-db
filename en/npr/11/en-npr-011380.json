        "Well, it may, because Jakes is considered to have moral authority, because he's a mega-minister.",
        "And I welcome anybody saying it, but I think Cosby - with whom I had the pleasure of going down to Dillard, to University, with their first commencement after the hurricane on Saturday - I think Cosby is mostly right in what he says.",
        "But, you know, the issues that come up whenever we discuss Cosby, people start talking about his personal issues.",
        "So maybe Jakes has more moral authority.",
        "But the point I would make about it is, of course its good rhetoric and of course people jumped up and said amen.",
        "You can't listen to T.D.",
        "Jakes preach without saying amen, I mean, whatever he's saying.",
        "But the point is, that Marian Wright Edelman and the Children's Defense Fund has been working on this for years.",

        "There are organizations in every community that's trying to get us - and we know - to do this.",
        "And we know what the answers are.",
        "The answer is, one part of it is, what we do ourselves - that is what we individually do to try to help other people - whether it's tutoring somebody or whether it's taking a child in hand.",
        "But the other is the policy issues, which we seem - the systemic policy issues like jobs.",
        "It's okay to say fathers ought to take responsibility for their children.",
        "Some of them are on drugs, and some of them don't have jobs.",
        "And if they do have jobs, they don't make enough money.",
        "So, what we have to do is work on - put the policy and the self-help, and the individual effort things together, and support the organizations that have been doing this work for so long - and continue to try to do it.",
        "Walter, the idea of the brass tacks of it.",
        "Yvonne mentioned it.",
        "We've heard a lot of this, and not to say that we shouldn't continue beating this drum.",
        "But we have heard a lot of this for a long time, with little movement, quite frankly, in terms of the overall picture.",
        "What has to be done?",
        "Well, I think, you know, we shouldn't casually dismiss a lot of efforts have already been underway in communities.",
        "I mean, there are groups in communities across the country, that have really tried to tackle this issue.",
        "And I think Dr. Berry's absolutely right in terms of the larger, global, systemic issues.",
        "I mean, some things like, what do we do about reentry, in terms of individuals who were formerly incarcerated - particularly young black men who come back?",
        "How do we make them whole again?",
        "How do we provide proper training to individuals who haven't completed high school, but still need to work, you know, in an economy that's changing rapidly.",
        "So there are some larger systemic issues that we have to confront.",
        "So we really have to almost do this simultaneously.",
        "We have to have an on-the-ground strategy, in terms of what's confronting us on a daily basis in our neighborhoods, but we also have to have a larger, macro strategy, that talks about public policy and how we change public policy to make it fair - to make it more equitable, to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to support not only him or her self, but their children.",
        "But Ed, I'd like to chime in for a minute and just say too, black Americans are going to have to become more consistent also with their public message.",
        "You know, you can go to the BET Awards, and Terrence Howard gets an award, for you know, his movie about being a pimp.",
        "So, I mean, if we're putting that out there; if we're celebrating certain messages; certain content, if you will; then that is inconsistent with all the good work that's being done by the organizations on the ground, in these various communities.",
        "So, at some point we're going to have to reconcile what do we really believe in.",
        "If we believe that we're going to support strong families, if we're going to promote self-determination and responsibility; then that's inconsistent with some of these messages that we are celebrating in the popular culture, that have these…",
        "Isn't that really about the diversification of images, though?",
        "The idea that if you want to celebrate Terrence Howard, if he did do a fine job in that portrayal.",
        "The problem is that the image of black men in particular is not diverse enough for us to really embrace and accept the role of a pimp.",
        "Well, that's true, but I guess if we're at war, you have to decide, you know, what your targets are.",
        "And at this point, is Terrence Howard's portrayal of a pimp worth fighting for?",
        "I mean, I think that's a big question and we have to have - certainly I would love to see more diversity, but if this is all we have right now, you know, maybe we need to focus on the larger issues and let him and Hollywood deal with that."
