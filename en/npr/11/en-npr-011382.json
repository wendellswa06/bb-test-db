        "All right.",
        "Let's move on to what is an interesting defense that we're hearing out of the defense team for a white man accused of a racially motivated beating of a black man in Howard Beach last summer.",
        "What the defense team has done, is they've called a Harvard University professor, who has written a book about the N-word.",
        "And what they're trying to say now, that the word has become so complex, that the word now takes on many different meanings and connotations.",
        "It can be pejorative.",
        "It can be friendly.",
        "Marcelo, and what they're suggesting here is this white man used it in a way, not in the old sense that whites would use it, but in today's form, a kinder, friendlier, N-word, if you will.",
        "Well, this is social...",
        "And the ironic part here is the professor is African-American, the Harvard professor.",
        "Yes, this is Professor Kennedy at the - Professor Kennedy at the Harvard Law School, a very eminent scholar at the university.",
        "Well, this is Sociolinguistics 101.",
        "Sure - surely all words have a social life, and for all words context matters.",

        "And what is the intended target?",
        "What is the meaning the intended target of any word is supposed to have?",
        "So, in a way, it seems to me that this will have to be placed in the context of the allegations against this gentleman, and the jury will have to make up its mind as to whether we're really talking about a somewhat esoteric, sociolinguistic exercise, or whether the intent clearly was racially motivated and marked.",

        "And the concern that the power of the word has been softened, if you will, in the sense of how it affects African-Americans on a visceral level.",
        "And we should note that Professor Kennedy has written a book entitled - I'm getting ready to say the word; I'm not going to use the N-word because this is the title of the book - Nigger, the Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.",
        "Go ahead, Joe.",
        "Well, I was wondering if we were allowed to say the word, even during this conversation.",
        "I find the word personally offensive, and I think we also might want to have a debate over whether or not the defendant in this case even can be called a gentleman, even though he hasn't been convicted of anything, yet.",
        "But according to one article, it says that he reputedly spewed the epithet in anger, while chasing Mr. Moore and beating him on the head - and this was with a baseball bat - but at the same time, his defense is that he was just using this in the same way he might call somebody pal - I guess while beating his pal on the head with a baseball bat.",
        "I mean, I think that...",
        "Prof. SUÁREZ-OROZCO: Doesn't look like a good pal to me!",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think it shows the intent behind this word, given the context in which it was used.",
        "And I also think it speaks to a larger issue, that the word now has become more available to the public, if you will, through its use in a lot of hip-hop and rap records.",
        "Many of these records clearly are purchased by white music fans, and their purchase of the records is certainly okay.",
        "But the word, using the word by black people, presumably as a term of endearment for other black people...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...then allows it widespread currency, and on a personal level."

        "On the bus, on the subway, walking down the street, there's no question about it.",
        "I don't know how many times I heard it yesterday.",
        "Well, I was always taught that the power of life and death is in your words.",
        "And, what happens - you can't expect white America to understand the stigma attached to this word in this day and age when you have a younger generation of African-Americans making millions of dollars in hip-hop videos and everything else using this word freely, as if it were a term of endearment, as we've already said.",
        "It sends a confusing message.",

        "When - do we have any idea, do people realize what the origin of the word, the N-word has come from?",
        "It's a word that originated in hate, and it goes to show the hip-hop hypocrisy that we've allowed to take place within our own communities.",
        "I mean, who's responsible here, really, for the change in the connotation of this word?",
        "We are, because we've turned a blind eye, for the most part, because it's become economically beneficial to hundreds of young urban blacks who are making millions of dollars in the music industry and in the pop culture.",
        "Well, but let's be realistic there, Tara, too.",
        "The people - the real people that are making real money on that are not just the performers, but more so the record companies, and those who control that end of it.",

        "DeLores Tucker was selling out her own people because this was a form of expression.",
        "So there needs to be consistency here.",
        "And in the Minucci case, I don't think that's - as deplorable as his actions may have been, he's facing 25 years in prison, potentially, because of his use of the N-word, which makes this crime a hate crime as opposed to a regular assault case, and I think, you know, there's too much at stake.",
        "Prof.",

        "But in that same vein, to go back to something you raised earlier, Ed, I think that we cannot allow the hip-hop artists, the rap artists, and the others to use this word to kind of escape any responsibility and put that on the companies, because the companies are making money.",
