        "But her advocates have always maintained that the Muslim farmworkers were angry that she was trying to drink out of the same drinking vessel as them.",

        "What has happened since?",
        "Right.",
        "So this has been a case that's roiled Pakistan, and it's spent about eight years - since she was given the death penalty, it's been working its way through the courts since.",

        "So it was a provincial governor.",
        "He was killed by his own bodyguard in an upscale cafe just a few miles from where I'm standing.",
        "That bodyguard was later executed, but now there's a shrine to him right outside of Islamabad, and he's revered as a near saint by the religious right.",
        "And in that, you can kind of see the power that these accusations can wield.",
        "And you can imagine there why Pakistan's Supreme Court would have taken its time before announcing this ruling freeing the woman.",
        "What was the scene like as they finally did make the ruling?",
        "Right.",
        "So we were in the courthouse at the time, and it was very, very terse, which is unusual for the Supreme Court here.",
        "The judges walked in, all three of them.",
        "They sat down.",
        "And within a minute, they'd announced their verdict.",
        "She'd been acquitted.",
        "She was free to go.",
        "We rushed out.",
        "And as we rushed out, we could actually see security forces rushing into the direction of the Supreme Court to shut down the area so demonstrators couldn't reach there.",
        "They've been on high alert since yesterday because they were worried about violence.",
        "And even on the roads to the Supreme Court, we could see these big containers.",
        "They're big trucking containers that they use to block roads.",
        "So we raced, actually, to an intersection that's a few miles from the Supreme Court where we knew there were demonstrators from the extreme religious right, and they were chanting there against Asia Bibi already.",
        "You can have a listen here.",
        "(Chanting in foreign language)."

        "And they were even saying the judges who ruled to acquit Asia Bibi deserved to be killed because their judgment was against Islam.",
        "Diaa, when you say the judges came in very quickly, gave the ruling and left, I mean, I have this image of Supreme Court justices knowing they have to flee pretty quickly after that.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "That's right."
