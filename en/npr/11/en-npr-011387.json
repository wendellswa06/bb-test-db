        "And I understand you're in your first life studio.",
        "What made you want to open one in Second Life?",
        "Well, it seemed to us producing the Infinite Mind Public Radio show and other public radio and television programs that, you know, as a lot of media, we've tried to connect in the most in-depth and experiential way with our listeners and viewers.",
        "And this provided a chance for us to create an environment where we could really interact in a much more thorough way than I think the Internet has provided up to now.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "A lot of people involved in Second Life and other worlds like this talk about transmitting experience, yet you're sitting in front of a computer.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "And, in fact, that came from an essay that we did for - we did a series of four broadcasts live from Second Life, and one of them featured a live performance of Suzanne Vega, which made it the first performance by a major artist and the first broadcast out of Second Life.",
        "And what we noted was that what we were actually transmitting was something different than almost any media had previously and that was experience, that you're really not just seeing something or hearing it, but you're able to actually experience something.",
        "And when it hits your eyes and ears and your brain, it actually feels more like an experience than almost any other media experience to date.",
        "Because you have this identification with this avatar figure that wonders around in this - well, what a lot of people would believe, say, was a make-believe world.",
        "Well, or the way that your brain might process sitting on a beach and the sun's going down and the sand under you and the waves are rolling in and there's a palm tree.",
        "And looking at that, you know, conveys, say, a relaxed feeling, while possibly, you know, walking through a very crowded clothing store with people bumping into each other might give you a different kind of feeling.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And those are experiences that really up until now couldn't be conveyed through a film or television or the Internet.",
        "But being in an immersive environment where you're actually there and able to walk around and experience things allows you to transmit experience."
