        "I'm not experienced with it, so maybe I can't be so critical, but I just feel that there are so many real problems in the world and real things that maybe this creative energy could go toward solving a lot of the basic problems and things that are going on in Africa, and I just - I don't know.",
        "I just feel that - I'm sure there's some good coming out of it, and a lot of people are getting some creative, maybe like new car designs or other things that I just - I don't know.",

        "Well, I think one of the things that it's important to remember is it's often tempting to compare media to the real thing.",
        "So is it better to take a trip to the rain forest or a trip to Paris or read about it or see a film about it?",

        "So for example, you could create a classroom environment for children in Africa or in underdeveloped countries where they could experience things that they couldn't otherwise.",
        "And I think one of the big promises of Second Life is while the first iteration of it was very heavily focused on entertainment and diversion, one of the things - and one of the reasons we wanted to go in there with the public radio broadcast and I think one of the great opportunities is to be able to use this medium for education, for health, for social organizing, for all kinds of things where, you know, a conference call or a photograph or a book or leaflet doesn't do it.",
        "But being able to bring together, for example, public health officials from around the world and play a video for them or share information in a way that is much more real and dynamic I think has huge possibilities.",
        "You say it could be useful to those children in Africa, if they had computers and a high-speed connection.",
        "Well, if there were one computer and a high-speed connection - which I think the promise of the $100 laptop, which is an evolving, you know, effort to bridge the digital divide.",
        "But I think, you know, there is a social, a huge evolving social value of this that I think is yet fully untapped.",
        "We should point out that the host of the Second Life program that you do is John Hockenberry, who used to be the host of this program.",
        "That's correct, and I think he - you know, one of the things we really try to do is explore, I think, what some of those, you know, uses are and to encourage others - you know, at the Harvard Law School, for example, is teaching their first course in cyberspace, and that allows them to bring guests in from around the world as an example of the kind of (unintelligible) activity that this provides.",

        "They've been touting the number of being a million people.",
        "They've gone over the number one million registered users, but that's the number of people who signed up to try it out over a period of years.",

        "According to reports, there were 25 people who were there.",
        "So, you know, but it got covered in the media and it's been written about, so there's been - it seems to me there's been more media attention than reality to what's going on there.",
        "I think that it's a really interesting societal thing to have people in there living their lives in this Second Life way, and the way that it bleeds into reality is really interesting from a cultural perspective.",
        "But as far as a business perspective, I think some people are making money, but I think it's a little bit overblown that everyone can get in there and start a business and make a lot of money.",
        "Adam Pasick, would you agree with that?",
        "I agree that the media attention and the growth in the number of registered users - I think those have fed each other quite a bit.",
        "So last week when we saw tons of media attention, there were 120,000 people that signed up.",
        "So like you said, they're not all on at one time.",
        "It tends to be 10-15,000 people on at one time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "�'89 was a massive relief and I think it's a fantastic step forwards for Europe.",
        "But in any given month, you're up in the couple of hundred thousand number in terms of how many people have gone in.",
        "And so, they do kind of feed on each other.",
