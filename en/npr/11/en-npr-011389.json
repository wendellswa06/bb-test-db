        "So I completely agree that, you know, that million number, you can debate about how important that is.",
        "But if you do look at - if you look at the growth, I don't think that there's any doubt that Second Life is kind of hitting that really steep part of the curve and seems to be getting more and more important.",

        "Are you a user?",
        "I'm not a user of it, I have to admit.",
        "However, I did use some of the earlier virtual worlds, like the AlphaWorlds, which came out in the mid-90s when I was writing more about online gaming and Ultima Online.",
        "So I saw some of the earlier versions of it.",
        "And what I noticed then and what I'm hearing about now a lot is that people are having some technical difficulties with the game in that the requirements are pretty high.",
        "You have to have a certain kind of video card, you have to have -if you have a Mac you have to have a G4.",
        "If you have a PC, you have to a Pentium III.",
        "And I think a lot of people are hearing about it and getting excited and then realizing they don't have the requirements or they go into the game and they're having difficulty getting around, it's really slow performance.",
        "And that's been something that's dogged online gaming for a long time.",
        "And, you know, especially this talk about people in Africa - kids in Africa -being able to go on and have a classroom experience.",
        "I think that's really unrealistic, because you really do have to have not only a broadband connection, but pretty high-end computers to see everything and experience it in a really good way.",
        "Here's an e-mail question, this from Brian.",
        "Is there crime in the Second Life world?",
        "I guess that's to Adam Reuters.",
        "You'll find just about everything in Second Life that you find in the real world, and that includes the darker side of human behavior.",
        "There's certainly crime in Second Life.",
        "There's sex in Second Life.",
        "There is even terrorism in Second Life.",
        "In the last couple of months, people have been creating these objects that self-replicate.",
        "So one becomes two becomes four becomes sixteen.",
        "And pretty soon, there's so many of them that they crash the entire world.",

        "And in September we had 17 show up, and in October we had 27.",
        "But literally, we were sitting across from people living in Australia, San Antonio where I am, New York, San Francisco, you name it.",
        "We're all sitting there looking at each other and having a discussion about the ramifications of this new world and what kind of communication strategies we're going to have to have to operate there.",

        "No.",
        "In fact, I'm still on a free account there, haven't spent a dime while I'm there.",
        "And I think what's really interesting about the place is that I think that this technology will be incorporated into other kind of Web technologies over time.",
        "The style of Second Life is interesting, but I also think that there's another interesting aspect in that this kind of technology will help us to have better communication with each other over distance and that kind of thing.",
        "So, anyway - but, yeah, and Adam I'll be seeing you tomorrow.",

        "Can I meet up with people?",
        "Can I sell something or market something?",

        "And what we really need is enough people of different ethnic backgrounds, ages - I mean, I'm 60, almost 60, and I tried to get into Sims a few years ago and I think my age sort of knocked me out of the profile they were looking for to set up this virtual world.",
        "But it's really an exercise in what the future will be, and we need input to develop this because without it - if we leave it to a specific type of person, specific country, a specific thing, we're going to, we will essentially lose control of the future.",

        "Right.",

        "But I haven't been in, obviously, because I'm not under the age limit, but from what the people at Linden Lab say, there are a lot of very smart kids in there learning how to basically program, how to build things, 3D design, so it must be a pretty fascinating place.",
        "I'm hoping to find a way to write about it without breaking the rules.",
        "Mark Glaser - we just have a few seconds left - but I wanted to ask you, if this world isn't the one that's going to make it big, somebody else is going to design a new one that is much easier to use than I understand Second Life is.",
        "Is this an unlimited future here?",
        "I think it could be.",
        "The one that I was talking about earlier that was called AlphaWorld and was part of Worlds, Inc. They were basically trying to create a browser that would see the Web in this 3D way with 3D objects.",
        "So there's always been this idea - well, always meaning the last 10 years, which is a long time in Internet time - but there's been this idea that you could go out and experience the World Wide Web in a 3D virtual way.",
        "So I think it's something that will evolve over time and get more exciting.",
