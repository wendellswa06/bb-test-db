        "But the effects went on long after the Soviet Union fell, two years afterwards, in places like Cuba, Central America and of course in the Balkans.",
        "We're talking about that ripple effect with former secretary of state Madeleine Albright.",
        "Of course, we want to hear from you.",

        "In a piece you wrote for The Washington Post, you said the real story behind the fall of the Berlin Wall was not, as you put it, very tidy.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "I have to say as a preface, that, of course, there are a lot of long-term forces coming to fruition on that night.",
        "The Cold War, of course, was a competition on nearly all level of military, economic, social, and so forth.",
        "So it's a very long-term competition.",
        "But what's amazing is the way it all comes to head in what is possibly the worst press conference ever.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "The East German Polit - excuse me, the East German Politburo had not really had much use for press conferences during the Cold War, as I'm sure you can imagine.",
        "So it was only under the pressure of the example of Mikhail Gorbachev and the Soviet Union with his calls for greater openness that they somewhat hastily decided, in November 1989, that they ought to have press conferences after the Politburo meetings.",
        "And the guy who drew the short stick on the Politburo was this hapless man named Gunther Shabowski.",
        "And so, he was very new at this.",
        "He'd had no incentive to developing media skills and it really showed.",
        "And so, he was sent out there� He was supposed to announce a relatively minor liberalization of travel rules.",
        "And he messed it up so completely that wire reporters thought that he had said the wall was open.",

        "So it's clear that was coming.",
        "But it's significant the way that it happened, because it was, number one, accidental, nobody was prepared for it.",
        "And number two, when it happened, those capable of organizing military resistance were either in the Soviet Union, basically asleep because of the time difference, or in East Germany, they were locked in central committee and various other meetings.",
        "So it was only later, when they realized what had happened, that they started to try to reseal the border - which is something people forget.",
        "There were some attempts made to reseal the border and they were partially successful.",

        "In other words, it's not clear that they would have obeyed an order from Gorbachev to stay in the barracks if there had been some kind of bloodshed on the ground.",
        "And I think that was actually possibility because the border guards that night were armed as on all night and there seem to have been a few or a fraction among some of the border guards that maybe use of those weapons would have been helpful."

        "It's about how we got post-Cold War Europe.",
        "And what I saw is that the Berlin Wall coming down was basically the starter's gun being filed - sorry, the starter's gun being fired - on a very intense competition to create the order of post-Cold War Europe.",
        "And it was very disorderly, it was very chaotic, a sort of violence hung over it.",
        "Gorbachev's hold-on power was uncertain.",
        "He was committed to non-violence, but it was not clear how long he was going to be in charge.",
        "And it was not clear what will come after him.",
        "And so, there was a really heated competition between the people who had created the revolution, the protesters in East Germany with their contacts in Poland and Hungary, basically; and also, Gorbachev - there were multiple competitors competing with the professionals in the West, competing with George H.W.",
        "Bush, James Baker, Brent Scowcroft in America; Francois Mitterrand, in Paris; and of course, Helmut Kohl with his close advisor Horst Teltschik and Hans-Dietrich Genscher in Bonn.",
        "And in my book, I describe the various phazes of this competition, it becomes clear that the West wins.",
        "And the way the West wins is with a model that I called prefab.",
        "In other words, they basically decide to take the pre-existing or prefabricated institutions that had served the West so well - NATO, the basic law in West Germany, (unintelligible) European community - and transfer them to the East.",
        "And it works really well, but then the problem is, with prefab, is, if the, you know, the original design doesn't fit the new site, then you'll have longer term problems.",
        "I think we're seeing some of the consequences of those today in Europe."
