        "But what's the most remarkable, I think, in the immediate post-Cold War period in Africa is the lack of competition.",
        "The United States basically turns its back on Africa the very time when there were people's revolutions and democratic movements and civil societies sprouting up very energetically in a lot of places.",
        "And one of the most famous consequences of this, of course, was a little bit after the immediate post Cold War period, but the Rwandan genocide, which we ran away from.",
        "We have acknowledged that, but then subsequently a much greater tragedy in Congo and more broadly in Central Africa that has killed several times many more people.",
        "And why is this the product of the post-Cold War era?",
        "Well, it's the product of the post-Cold War era because a system had been maintained and nourished by virtue of rivalries between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies here and there in Africa.",
        "You mentioned Angola and Mozambique, these were two of the most famous places.",
        "This - the Cuban army actually was deployed in Angola and fought obviously on the East bloc's side in a very complicated proxy fight there.",

        "But let me - I agree that a lot of problems were masked by the Cold War that people didn't fully understand, all of the things that were going on in Africa.",
        "And there was kind of the sense that there were various leaders in Africa that had started as nationalist leaders, who all of a sudden found the Soviet model more attractive than the Western one.",
        "It's a very long and complicated story.",
        "And that also some of them masked all the problems within the countries themselves.",
        "That they were basically countries that had no functioning state structures, that wasn't evident until the assistance and the competition went away.",

        "Ah, yes.",
        "And eventually that was more than adequately made up in the years that followed, but the immediate years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, what in Cuba is known as the Special Period, was disruptive and destructive in many ways.",
        "Was there any moment of self-doubt do you think in Cuba, at that moment, as they watched the socialist system that they had grown up among collapse around the world, I guess, with the exception of China?",
        "Well, it's a mixture, I think.",

        "And one of the questions I've always had in my mind, and maybe Secretary Albright could address this, is if the fall of the Soviet Union somehow then emboldens Saddam Hussein to feel like he could then take steps he did to invade Kuwait because supports - various people might have had in the Middle East, might not have been there any more or because, you know, the attention might have been diverted elsewhere.",

        "And the answer sounds very simplistic but I think is true.",

        "And then the other is that it's an island.",

        "And there's a constant flow of people from the island.",

        "I would - I mentioned the Rwandan genocide earlier and you asked what this has to do with the immediate post-Cold War era, but in fact if you look back at the press coverage of the Rwandan genocide and the official responses and the pundit commentary of the time, people said, essentially, that the United States has no interest in a place like this.",
        "The United States - went so far as to say no interest in Africa whatsoever.",
        "This is an amazing turnabout from just a very short time prior, when in fact, to reprise Secretary Albright's image, the continent was a series of boxes arranged according to who's ally or proxy or client you were.",
        "I'd like to just add one other thing, and that is that although it's very much true what the secretary said about countries that whose problems were masked by this Cold War system and that fell apart subsequently and that this was all very complicated and process of discovery for us, it is also true - and I think this is often, too often forgotten - that there really were people's revolutions and popular movements for democracy in many places in Africa during this period - places like Mali and Benin and Zambia, just to name a few, where contrary to the sort of normal notions of political science, poor and substantially illiterate societies demanded democracy and achieved democracy.",
        "In other places like Zaire in Nigeria, civil society had uprisings of various sorts, and in the case of Nigeria, a democratic election.",
        "My complaint is that unlike the intellectual energy that was invested and other kinds of energy, peace dividend, kind of resource energy invested in Europe, we turned our back on those phenomena in Africa and we left Africans to their own devices to very tragic results.",
