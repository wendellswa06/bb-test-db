        "Those were groups that obviously received money from Cuba or at least support weapons.",
        "And that went away, so they had to turn into kidnapping and drug trafficking.",
        "So that evidently created a whole new order in terms of the cartels relating to - or better using guerilla as the private defense system.",
        "Lou Perez, does he have a point that the leftist guerillas in Colombia previously reliant on outside aid had to turn to internal sources like the -like drugs.",
        "Well, certainly, they receive moral support.",
        "The degree to which they receive material support from the Cubans really is yet to be determined.",
        "So it's unclear that this was part of a knock-on effect because they certainly did get involve in the drug cartels.",
        "It would appear to be a cause and effect, but I'm not quite certain where the regional material support was coming in for the Colombian guerillas.",

        "And with 53 countries, you get a whole universe of different sorts of compositions and realities and societies.",
        "And there are, in fact, many societies that emerged from the Cold War, in precisely the state that the caller described.",
        "And the outcome, if they tried to proceed quickly toward elections with no other sort of processes involved, it would, in retrospect, seems pretty predictable.",

        "And in some ways, it also masks the problems that are now taking place in Central and Eastern Europe itself or in various former parts of the Soviet Empire.",
        "But I also would like to - maybe a little bit in defense of having been in the government at the time is that all of a sudden, every county was heard from and that there - it was very hard to get your head around all the various issues that were going on - and some because it was a moment to celebrate what had happened.",
