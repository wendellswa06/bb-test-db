        "Well, in the 1980s, China was coming out of the Mao era, and they were very closed.",
        "It was a very closed society.",
        "And by the time they came out of that, there was quite a reluctance in the West to work with them.",
        "No one knew how, no one knew what their intentions were.",
        "So in 1992, they initiated this 30-year, three-step program that they are now in the middle of, and they did work with whoever would work with them.",
        "They actually bought quite a bit of equipment, life-support equipment in particular, from the Russians.",
        "But they were left to do an indigenous program because there was a great reluctance from the West.",
        "And in fact isn't there a prohibition in America from the U.S.",
        "cooperating with China in Space?",
        "There are legislative prohibitions for bilateral cooperation between NASA and China.",
        "There are some multilateral cooperative projects going on and discussions, but right now, legislatively, NASA cannot work with China.",
        "Jonathan McDowell?",
        "Yes, I think the - this is a real issue right now because while it does make sense for the United States to be a little protective of some of its advanced technology, really we're losing an opportunity to work closely with the Chinese, and this blanket ban sort of goes against the scientists' natural tendency to walk to talk to each other in this very international and globalized world.",
        "But I think that the Chinese are - you know, would like to work with us, but in fact, given that we're not willing to, they're going to just push ahead, and you see Tiangong, it's not the International Space Station, but it's all-Chinese.",
        "They are going step by step, and they are slowly catching up.",
        "But wouldn't it be to our advantage, you know, to work with them, and this way we're close to them and know what they're doing?",
        "I certainly think it is.",
        "If you believe that we need to work more with China, and we need to understand how they work, then it makes sense.",
        "If you believe that Chinese is a potential near-peer competitor or potential enemy, then the adage, you know, keep your friends closer and your enemy closer comes to mind.",
        "So yes, I think we are losing major opportunities in many different areas, including national security."

        "Right, and I think...",
        "Where does this ban come from, Jonathan?",
        "Well, it comes from Congress, and I think there's a - it's a very easy card to play, to make people afraid of China.",
        "I think China, you know, is both a national security competitor and an economic competitor.",
        "But I think there's also a lot of miscommunication between the United States and China.",
        "When you actually go and talk to the Chinese, they are a little bewildered at the idea that they pose a danger to the United States.",
        "So I think the more we communicate, the less the tensions will be.",
        "I agree, and I think I would also point out that at this point, the Chinese do want to work with the United States very much, but there are a considerable number of their space scientists, especially in the manned program, who feel that their program is going along quite well right now, and working with the United States could jeopardize their program because we have a reputation of being difficult to work with.",
        "And I think the International Space Station partners would attest to that, that sometimes working with the United States, you have to be prepared for U.S.",
        "dominance.",
        "Is it true that they have a two-track program, one is for manned space flight and another is for robotic space flight or going to the moon or Mars with probes?",
        "Well, the manned space program is bureaucratically under the People's Liberation Army, whereas the research program, like the lunar probe program, is organized under a more civilian aegis.",
        "But that's really a bureaucratic issue rather than there being a true military aspect to the Shenzhou program.",
        "Let's talk about realistically where they might be headed.",
        "Let's look at the next five years.",
        "Jonathan, you said that they might be able to have their own space station in the next five years?",
        "Right, well, we've been arguing about whether Tiangong counts as a space station.",
        "It's really - I've called it a dwarf space station.",
        "It's got some of the properties.",
        "Very soon, maybe next year, they'll launch Tiangong 2, which will be like the Russian (unintelligible) that went up in the '70s that's more of a serious space laboratory."

        "But they've said that what they really want to do is something more along the lines of perhaps not the International Space Station but something much more ambitious in the early part of the next decade, and I think that's well within their capabilities if they can get their much-delayed new rocket to fly.",
        "And they've been talking about a much bigger rocket for many years now, and it still hasn't made an appearance.",
        "So I think that's the key pacing item for them in doing something more ambitious.",
        "In the 30-year plan that they laid out in '92, that large space station was always the culminating point.",
        "It wasn't the moon.",
        "It was first demonstrating human space flight, which they've done, second demonstrating more advanced spaceflight capabilities like maneuvering and docking, which is where they are now, and that includes Tiangong.",
        "But the third step is clearly this large space station that Jonathan was referring to that they simply are not able to launch until the Long March 5 launcher comes online.",
        "Which would be when?",
        "Well, it's in development, but it's already behind schedule.",
        "So I think it's somewhere in the next 10 years.",
        "He says he's having just as much fun here.",
        "How is this going to sit with - let's say you look at Congress 10 years now.",
        "If the Chinese have a space station, the U.S.",
        "no longer is orbiting in the space station, it's not invited to go to a Chinese space station, let's say, or is not allowed to have anything to do with the Chinese space program, are we going to see, do you suspect, some reversal in Congress saying where the heck are we, why were we left out of these things?",
        "I think you're exactly right.",
        "I think there will be a loud cry of how did this happen.",
        "But you already see members of Congress try to use the Chinese space program as an impetus to get more money for the U.S.",
        "space effort, but it's very difficult to do manned spaceflight in a democracy because while we all like spaceflight, we like watching it, when it comes to funding from government funds, it simply doesn't get the priority that things like jobs and roads and education and defense gets.",
        "In China, they have an authoritarian government that can keep funding it to whatever level they choose, as long as they choose to do it, and they will do that as long as they get successful results from it."

        "They're really kind of playing with the technology to see what they can get out of it, and personally I think that's a good thing.",

        "Yes, I think that was the Air Force trying to see, you know, how far could they push that technology envelope.",
