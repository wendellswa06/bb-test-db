        "So I think you cannot conflate the scientific purposes and other legitimate purposes that a country may have.",
        "One last question: Where then does the United States' manned space program fit into all of this?",
        "Well, I personally think the Obama administration made the right decision when it decided to stop with the plans for the moon that were not really feasible, it had never been funded to a level that made it realistic, and instead make the very hard decision to take a new direction, which was going to take time, so it was going to be painful because the American people are not really quite very patient, and become more of a public-private partnership so that eventually the private sector will deal with low-Earth orbit and NASA can use its exploration funding to go to more distant places.",
        "Jonathan, do you agree?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "NASA should not be doing the taxi driving between the ground and low-Earth orbit, because that's a solved problem.",

        "If Congress can make a decision, because there's still this back-and-forth between Congress and the administration on where to go, what to do, what to fund.",
