        "It has seemingly raised the stakes by declaring this Israeli-Hezbollah conflict as part of a larger war on terrorism.",
        "What's been the impact of that?",
        "Well, the impact is quite a disturbing one, I would imagine, for policy makers in Washington, in the sense that because the stakes were raised so high, first by, in fact, American politicians and then later countered by Iranian politicians and Iranian leaders, both sides have kind of made this very, very explicitly a proxy war.",
        "I mean, you've got - you know, in the sense that Israel's primary patron is the United States and Hezbollah and Iran, too, has always felt that if you're able to attack Israel, that is a blow to the United States, likewise the calculation in Israel and the United States has been very explicitly that if you hit Hezbollah hard, then you are also delivering a blow to Iran.",
        "So if both sides look at this, then it means that the stakes are much, much higher.",
