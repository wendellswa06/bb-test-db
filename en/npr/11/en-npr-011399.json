        "I think what people don't understand is, is that a multiracial person, by being multiracial, does not automatically disassociate themselves with being involved in the struggle for racial equality, or the anti-racist struggle.",
        "I think there's perception that somehow or another, there's a contradiction between saying you're multiracial, and being engaged in that struggle.",
        "You can't have that identity, and be seen as someone who's engaged in the struggle for racial equality.",
        "But of course, that's people's perception - maybe because of individual cases.",
        "But to assume an automatic rejection of agency - or to assume an automatic rejection of an interest in that struggle, on the part of a multiracial-indentified person, is pretty reductionist - and very inaccurate.",

        "But right - currently, right now, I'm married to a blonde-haired, blue-eyed guy with Swedish descent, and we have a beautiful baby daughter.",
        "And I don't get the same kind of social awkwardness, I guess, that I would've got in high school.",
        "I mean, that might just be a high school problem, too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it's never been an issue for me.",

        "But back in high school, you didn't know where to sit in the cafeteria?",
        "Back in high school, we had a very, very mixed group of people.",
        "And I've always been in a very mixed crowd, where it's never been very apparent, like, oh, Kaye's mixed or, you know - it's never been an issue.",
        "But in my mind, I guess, it was always like, well - you know - I like that guy but he's Indian, or he's white, you know.",
        "So I don't know; that might look strange to some people.",
        "And you know, that was probably my own self-consciousness playing into it.",

        "And so that's a continuation of a longer-standing history of identity, and particularly a relationship to black and white people, that shows that there's a strong retention of that identity, even in the face of the option of perhaps identifying as biracial and multiracial.",

        "Well, as I started on my working career - in Michigan, in the early '80s - I had the opportunity to move in to a training job, where I actually designed a diversity program.",
        "Within that program, in teaching people about stereotypes and such, I felt like people were really more open to me than they would be to a white person or a black person - in that people were able to identify with parts of me.",
        "And because of that, I was able to learn a lot, and teach a lot, about how to deal with your own view - about how you deal with other people being from - looking at it and be stereotyped, and such.",

        "In a lot of individual cases and contacts, yes.",

        "We don't know those histories, and all of us actually have an original family that evolved in Africa before the dispersal.",
        "So one of my whole tools - at least, in the classroom context - has been to try to help students negotiate new kinds of (technical difficulties) in terms of dealing with each other and dealing with difference, by thinking about new ways of connecting.",
        "There have been many other individual circumstances where I've had to mediate opposing positions.",
        "But I'm not one of those people that thinks that multiracial folks will automatically be able to achieve that.",
        "I think a lot of people, no matter what their identity, can achieve that.",
        "But certainly, you could think that a multiracial experience - because you have to navigate sometimes seemingly hostile terrain - may be imbued with ways, exploring that.",

        "But certainly, if there are - if they operationalize some of the things in their life experience in a way that leads to conflict resolution, or reduction of tension, certainly that's great.",

        "And also, one thing I wanted to say - I was not being critical of people like President Obama, or the people who maintain a black identity in the face of, perhaps, having the option to identify as biracial.",
        "I have to be very clear about that.",
        "But what I'm saying is, is there is a different alternative.",
        "But the retention of blackness among - particularly among people of black and white - is very strong; for political reasons, in many cases.",
