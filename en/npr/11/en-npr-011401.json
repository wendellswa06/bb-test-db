        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "You know, there's been a tendency on the part of this administration to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there's something a little shaky that's taking place.",

        "Well, it appears to be based in the Constitution.",
        "The courts have said that it's implied in the Constitution, though there's no mention of it.",
        "And in the very first Congress, the Congress clashed with President Washington in its very first investigation of the executive branch, over the botched war against Native Americans led by General Arthur St. Clair.",

        "And in that case we quoted at the beginning, Fast and Furious, it's somewhat relevant to the Comey testimony because the judge said that the public statements of the administration had undermined the claim to privilege.",

        "That is the ability or the brain's response to obvious differences in stimuli that are expected, that deviate from the expectations.",
        "The two that we looked at are called the mismatch negativity, which is generated about 200 milliseconds after the deviant note is presented to the subject.",
        "And the P300, which is generated a little bit later.",
        "They are generated in different portions of the brain, but both are very unambiguous responses to change, to violations of expectation, and have been seen to be generated by these source of deviations in melodic structure in normal subjects.",

        "That didn't surprise us, but we were sort of floored by the fact that the later response, the P300, which is very robust in control subjects in response to the deviations, was just as robust in the tune-deaf population.",
        "So, that's the question.",
        "What does it mean that the brains of these tune-deaf people were responding almost identically to the wrong notes as the brains of people who clearly heard the errors and yet, one group says, yes I heard it and the other group says, no I didn't?",
        "Well, it means, just as you said, that they are clearly processing the differences.",
