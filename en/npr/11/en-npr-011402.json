        "I guess that's a possibility.",
        "Oh no, did you change key or something?",
        "Is that what happens?",
        "Then tell them nature of the errors, Dr. Braun.",
        "Well, the errors in what you played are from the distorted tune test, they're a little more varied and a little more dramatic than the errors we used in our studies which were deviations about one or two semi-tones only at the end of the melody.",
        "But your caller is a little bit atypical in that most of these subjects don't really appreciate music.",
        "They don't tell us that they enjoy listening to music.",
        "So, that's a little atypical.",
        "But when your caller said that's important is that he heard all the stimuli, all of the notes, and that's an important part of this condition that auditory processing - primary auditory processing is intact.",
        "It's the ability - inability to recognized melodic structure that's what - that is the problem in these cases.",
        "Well, John.",
        "I don't want - I'll keep one more second because I'm just curious, have you - have you ever - I mean, are there any parts of your life like I don't know, you know, is there any time when you think, oh gosh, there's thing that I can't do that other people seem to do easily or you just...",

        "But my hearing comes and goes.",
        "And right now it's really, really good.",

        "Yeah, we made sure that the patients we - the subjects we studied had no problems with hearing and clearly the woman that just called with Meniere's disease presents a different picture.",

        "But tell me a little more about that Dr. Braun.",
        "What is this continuum that you're talking about?",
        "Well, if you just mark the scores the subjects have on this test, the distorted tunes test, it goes from a 100 percent down to 50, down to chance, as though they were selecting at random and a fairly linear fashion.",
        "So, the population - some of the population is modestly impaired, some as very impaired, and some as unimpaired.",
        "And you said, you're beginning to use these data to help look for genes.",
        "Have there been genes that seemed to be associated, in other words, is there a physical difference in the brains between people...",
        "Well, there's nothing that we can see and there - we certainly can use the data we've generated as a phenotyping tool.",
        "But we are dependent upon sort of classical methods of gene mapping to try to identify what the gene or genes are that are abnormal, what the gene products are, where the structural regulatory proteins, which will give us a clue on as to what is going on in these brains.",

        "I'm curious, you know, one of the things when I read this paper that it made me think about was there are other phenomenon where, like in other sensory systems where people will, you know, people who are so - are blind, are definitely blind, you can flash things in front of them and you say to them, well, did you see anything?",
        "They say, no, no, we didn't see anything.",
        "Well, think of the first word that comes in to your mind.",
        "And you've just flashed the picture of a shoe at them and they'll say, well shoe, you know.",
        "Is that a similar - they call it blindsight I think",
        "Yes, that's blindsight.",
        "Yeah, is that a similar phenomenon?",
        "Well, it's not similar in one important way and that is, there is structural damage to the brain in those subjects.",
        "So those subjects have damage to the primary visual cortex, V1, usually unilaterally, so you can test things in both visual hemifields.",
        "And as he said, you can ask them to make, force them to make a choice and they're often right, sometimes up to 90 percent correct.",
        "But they are absolutely unaware.",
        "So, it's the same phenomenon but it's based on a structural lesion in the brain.",
        "Which makes it difficult to study these conditions because there's a variability across subjects with - what's interesting to us about tune-deafness is that it occurs in an otherwise intact brain that is very common in two to the four percent of the population.",
        "And if we really are able to say that these subjects are perceiving, without being aware of these auditory stimuli, these auditory deviations, it allows us because it's a very heritable condition to use the tools of genetic research to study conscious awareness.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Let's take one more call now and go to Pierro (ph) in Montpelier, Vermont.",
        "Pierro, welcome to the program.",
        "Hi.",
        "This is a great conversation for me because I'm a conductor and I work with singers all the time, and I've definitely had experiences where they don't know if what their singing is right or wrong.",
        "But I'm wondering if you had the experience - I definitely see progress, like you know, I might be working with a singer in the beginning of the season and they'll be singing a little out of tune or they'll be singing wrong notes, but by the end, it improves."

        "Oh, up for grabs.",
