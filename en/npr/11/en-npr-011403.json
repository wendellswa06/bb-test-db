        "If you have comments, questions or corrections for us, the best way to reach us is by e-mail.",
        "The address is talk@npr.org.",
        "Please let us know where you're writing from, and give us some help on how to pronounce your name.",
        "Well, you know, Madeleine, what's $39 billion among friends?",
        "You know, that only represents the price I was figuring this morning of one million fully loaded Chevy Impalas or what Microsoft is offering to buy all of Google.",
        "But, you know, some experts and analysts are saying we should think of that number in a different way.",
        "It's a sign that the patient is recovering, they say, and let me give you a few reasons why.",
        "First of all, there are a lot of one-time losses baked into that number.",
        "So they won't happen again.",
        "It's also about as tough a sales environment for cars here in North America as we ever see.",
        "It's been particularly tough on cars that are GM's strengths.",
        "But the company is moving toward changing that.",
        "OK, so those are some of the negatives maybe.",
        "They may be going away, but what about positive signs?",
        "Any positive signs for GM out there?",
        "As a matter of fact there are.",
        "Outside of North America, GM sales are growing in places as far-flung as China, and Latin America, and Eastern Europe.",
        "And then there is what may be the biggest factor of all: labor costs.",
        "You may remember that GM hammered out a new agreement with the United Auto Worker's union last fall, so GM now has a system in place where new workers coming in will earn substantially less in benefits and pay than current workers.",
        "The longtime industry watcher Marianne Keller(ph) told me today that has a huge impact on GM's future.",
        "Having been able to reach an accommodation with the UAW, that effectively converted labor from a fixed cost into a variable cost.",
        "It gives GM tremendous flexibility and I think changes the risk profile of the company.",
        "Now, at least they can build to the market instead of building to satisfy that labor component of their cost structure.",
        "And, Steve, that leads us to the final piece of today's news from GM, and that's their offer of buyouts to each one of their unionized employees.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You know, you can see how the lawsuits, plus the new labor agreement, plus the new buyout offers are all part or a piece.",
        "You know, GM wants to switch over to those lower cost new workers as soon as possible and they're offering generous buyouts to get there more quickly.",
        "And you have to say that both the union and the company recognized, painfully, that the world couldn't remain as it had been.",
        "And both sides did what had to be done.",
        "So does this all mean that the worst is behind them?",
        "Not yet.",
        "This is still a weak company, Madeleine.",
        "You know, those losses really do hurt.",
        "That's not, you know, pocket change.",
        "And worldwide competition is exceedingly fierce and the industry may have more cuts coming, but General Motors knows how to build cars.",
        "They're creeping up the quality of mileage ratings and they're still number one in worldwide sales or very close to it, so that's not the worst position to launch a comeback from."

        "He's also the founder of Music Works studio in Kingston, and he was tapped by the Ministry of Culture to help make the case for reggae.",

        "Well, thank you for that.",
        "But the world already knows about reggae.",
        "So why was it important for reggae to get this official recognition?",
        "As with any innovation, recognition needs to be placed at the head of those who created it.",
        "So, as a country, we are somewhat of a cultural powerhouse.",
        "So we felt that it was appropriate for it to be, you know, recognized, as with many other things we do, that we were the innovators of this genre of music.",
        "So, for the three people who might not be familiar with reggae already, could you tell us a little bit about what makes reggae reggae?"

        "I mean, reggae is so much an individual culture, and it can extend to the wider culture.",
        "For example, if we have the same set of musicians today playing a same song, and tomorrow, they are playing the same song but feel in a different mood, you will get a different song and not the same."

        "If they can get some kind of agreement on limiting the 20 percent uranium enrichment, that would be a small step forward, hardly enough to resolve this issue, but maybe a reason to keep the negotiations process going.",
        "Peter, the pressure on Iran has been escalating dramatically over recent months because of the ever more punitive sanctions approved by the EU and by the United States.",
        "Do you think that that is what might be softening Iran's position?",
        "It's possible, although officially, the Iranian position is unchanged, which is to say the more you punish us the more defiantly we will cling to our nuclear program, which is, of course, a source of national pride in Iran.",
        "But these latest sanctions, by many accounts, have done serious damage to the economy in Iran.",
        "So, while it's unlikely Iran would ever admit to responding to pressure, if a face-saving way to make a concession is presented, Tehran might be more likely to go for it now than it was, say, two years ago.",
        "Peter, not present at these talks but very much a factor is Israel, which has been contemplating a preemptive strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
        "Do officials there believe these talks can reduce that risk?",
        "That is exactly the hope, Linda.",
        "There's U.S.",
        "presidential elections coming.",
        "Any Iran crisis would be greatly magnified.",
        "There are serious risks of regional destabilization, a possible huge spike in oil prices.",
        "Israel says it can't afford to wait until this enrichment site at Fordo is so well-fortified that they can't reach it with their bombs.",
        "So, they have a much earlier deadline than the U.S.",
        "So, both sides, both Iran and the international players, have a strong incentive to keep the focus on negotiations now and not the military possibilities.",
        "The question is whether they can accomplish it.",
