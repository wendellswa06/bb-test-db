        "I mean, it is certainly the thing that propelled me to the point of making the announcement and taking that next step in announcing for - of announcing for the office of president.",
        "But once you do that, you should - and I certainly try periodically - to broaden the discussion base but it always does come back to immigration it's true, because I have spent a long time on it, and it is the thing that got me to the point of doing it, of making the decision.",
        "And the reason is because I think that there are so many aspects of this that touch every single part of our life.",
        "I mean, if you want to talk about health care, which I certainly can, I'm happy to and tell you about a variety of different ways that we should address the issue, but of course, you've got to come back at some point in time to talk about the fact that we're spending billions of dollars every single year on caring for people who are here illegally and are certainly not paying for - they are not paying for that service.",
        "We taxpayers are.",
        "You want to talk about education?",
        "We'll talk about the impact of illegal immigration on our schools.",
        "You want to talk about the environment?",
        "Absolutely, I would love to talk about environmental issues that are intrinsic to the issue of illegal immigration into the country, and immigration in general.",
        "I mean, do we want a country of a billion people by the end of the century?",
        "Because that's where we're heading.",
        "How about national security related issues?",
        "There's porous borders.",
        "You cannot begin to talk about national security without discussing porous borders and what that means to us in terms of our ability to protect the nation.",
        "So when you think about it, although it's often characterized as a single issue, it has various dimensions that I think are enormously important and certainly deserve to be debated at the highest level and that's what I'm trying to accomplish.",

        "Most of them get paychecks that they get their taxes taken out just like you and me, and so they are feeding the system.",
        "So I just wonder, what about immigrants are so threatening?",

        "Well, it seems like you probably sort of made up your mind about it when you say I'm xenophobic.",
        "The fact is that it is - when people come here, you're talking about - I assume you're talking about people who are here legally although I don't know, you say immigrants and certainly, all of us, or at least most of us in this country can trace our roots back to some immigrant who made the decision to come to the United States.",
        "And so immigration in and of itself is nothing that I fear.",
        "And most of the time when I talk about this issue, I'm talking about the problem with illegal immigration, what that means to the whole concept of the rule of law.",
        "How are we - if we don't address it, if we keep pretending it doesn't exist, then I think that that's problematic from a variety of standpoints.",
        "But there is the issue of the balkanization of the country too.",
        "When - if you look at the nation's history, we have always had a period of time of - where there's been high immigration rates, then followed by low immigration rates.",
        "It's really always been cyclical.",
        "We have used the period of time when there have been relatively low rates of immigration to assimilate the people that came during the periods of high immigration rates.",
        "And you did mention that eventually - even though we have high CO2 levels in there rising - that that will eventually lower itself as people are gone.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "And that has not happened for 40 some years that we have not begun that downward cycle so that we can start the process of assimilation and it's not going on.",
        "Not to the extent that it should, and that is worrisome to me.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",

        "You're absolutely right.",
        "I mean, if you've got huge numbers of people in an area, particular area, that speak a language other than English, you bet that the economy, I mean, anybody opening a business, wanting to do business in that area is going to take that into consideration.",
        "So numbers do become an issue.",
        "But the question you have to ask yourself is whether or not, as a nation, it's good to have a bilingual nation, if it's good for the society to be a bilingual nation or not?",
        "And I think it doesn't work as well.",
        "I think we actually need a language to hold us together.",
        "It is part of the glue that holds us together because we are so diverse as a nation.",
        "Because we come from so many different places, so many different backgrounds.",
        "One of the things that's, it seems to me, that's important to hold us together is a language.",

        "And how many others who would never do it themselves, who would never actually take an act, I mean, take that step, but would think to themselves, yeah, it's not such a bad idea?",

        "It's one of those, again, a strange sort of situation because it's a question that I think does not really lend itself to the simple active response by raising your hand, but that's the only way we could do it.",
        "I mean, the fact is that I believe that evolution is certainly something that can describe the change that occurs in the human species and all species.",
