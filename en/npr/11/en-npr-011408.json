        "Yesterday, from his stronghold on the West Bank, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, a Fatah, denounced Hamas as murderers and terrorists and declared that negotiations were not possible.",
        "The split is forcing all of the other players in the Middle East to choose sides.",
        "Daoud Kuttab is a columnist for several papers, the director of modern media at Al-Quds University, and joins us now from the studios of Amman Net radio station in Jordan.",

        "It's the worst thing that can happen to the Gazans.",
        "But it seems that all the players have been waiting on the sidelines and finally decided to join in and do something about the situation.",
        "Well, obviously, the invitation to Israel limits the guest list.",
        "Egypt and Jordan, of course, have peace agreements with Israel as well.",
        "But what about the other Arab states, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States?",
        "Well, they have a peace plan that the Israelis have yet to accept.",
        "The Arab initiative, which the Saudis are the main backers of, says that they are willing to have normal relations with Israel, once Israelis agree to withdraw to the '67 borders, and doesn't even call for the right to return, but talks about some kind of a settlement over the refugee problem.",
        "The Israelis have yet to deal with that, to accept that or to, you know, to agree to negotiate.",
        "They are saying that, it's an interesting proposal that we are willing to talk about, but they have not accepted the main principle of it.",
        "Well, that - and that explains why the Saudis and the Gulf States are not going to Sharm El Sheikh next week for this meeting with Israel.",

        "At the same time, our agricultural fields - I trace in this book what the succession back to a natural force environment, for example, would be in fields that have both never been fertilized before such as in New England - parts of New England, essentially where I live in Western Massachusetts, where farmers moved on better soils and longer-growing seasons as the United States march westward and also places that have received liberal amounts of herbicides, pesticides and chemical fertilizers over the years forest succession would proceed differently in those cases.",
        "But in any event, a lot of those crops that we have planted, they would be gone and some of the vegetables and things that we are used to - like cauliflower and broccoli and carrots - they would revert back to wilder forms that wouldn't be very recognizable to us.",
        "Well, carrots are an interesting example because they would revert back to Queen Anne's lace, which we know is a flower, not as an edible root.",
        "You start out with New York City, I guess, because it's a really interesting place to watch what happens when the people disappear, and you talked about how important - what happens with water when it's allowed to get into places that we have no control over anymore?",
        "Well, in the previous chapter, I show how our houses are something that are certainly vulnerable to water.",
        "Anybody who's ever had a roof leak knows about that.",
        "But even our big cement cities, same thing happens.",
        "But in the case is New York - and I imagine several other cities - it would actually start underneath the city, not on the roof.",

        "New York used to be a hilly city.",
        "The name Manhattan refers to hills - it's an old Algonquian term Manahetta(ph) - and there were 40-some streams and rivers on the surface that would, of course, drain water away to the sea.",
        "When those hills got smashed down to superimpose the grid on the cities, the rivers were pushed underground.",
        "And even on a sunny day, they're pumping about 13 million gallons of groundwater in a rising water table, up, out of the city into the sea.",
        "If the power went off, nearly 800 pumps would go silent and the subways would flood.",
        "And then the columns that are holding up the streets would start to rust, then start to corrode, and they give it about two decades before they would start to collapse.",
        "And the streets would start to crater and some of that water would then become surface water once again.",
        "And at the same time the foundations in a lot of buildings would start to become waterlogged and they would also corrode and eventually become destabilized, because they were built to be standing in water.",
        "Then you say that eventually our skyscrapers would be just blown over by the wind.",
        "Well, a destabilized skyscraper would be very susceptible to high winds and of course New York, being a coastal city, has been hit by hurricanes before.",
        "There's some speculation that we may be seeing more hurricanes around the East Coast and perhaps more powerful ones in the decades to come.",
        "And a destabilized skyscraper - we all know that skyscrapers will sway in the wind -this will - if it topples, it will probably do the same thing as the big tree does when it topples in the forest.",
        "It takes down some other trees standing around it with it.",
        "And that's actually going to be kind of good for the succession of forests in the city.",
        "New York was once completely forest that, of course, and trees will be already colonizing in the streets.",
        "They'll be growing in the leaf litter that will be filling the gutters in the streets, because no one will be raking the streets, and no one will be unclogging in the sewers that will probably have plastic bags stuck over the top of them.",
        "And the crumbling concrete will have a line to the soil, which will make it less acidic, so more and more plants, types of plants will be able to colonize.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And you also talked about how quickly, you know, New York is famous, also for its majestic bridges.",
        "How quickly the bridges will crumble?",
        "The bridges will not exactly crumble, as they will begin to fall into the bodies of water below them.",
        "Because a bridge has to be maintained all the time.",
        "That means painting it and that means clearing the debris that will gather in the expansion joints.",
        "Now, bridges which are made up of metal usually - except for the very old ones, the stone ones, they expand and contract.",
        "And in the winter time, they expansion joints are open and if they fill with debris, or if they filled with rust, which occupies a lot more space than metal does, they will clog and in the summer, there'll be no place for the bridge to expand.",
        "But it has to, so it starts draining at the very bolts that - connected to piers of concrete or connected to the bedrock on either end on the mainland or Manhattan or Staten Island.",
        "And eventually, when those bolts sheer off, the bridge it will just start to walk around until finally one end of it collapses.",

        "Good question.",
        "That is a good question.",
        "And I have a whole chapter on that, Wendy.",
        "The - our atomic bombs aren't going to be much of a problem because they need propulsion that only we can provide to slam a couple of pieces of uranium together or to implode plutonium fast enough so it will explode.",
        "And therefore, when corrosion finally exposes the radioactive materials to the elements, they will just be very radioactive.",
        "But the plants are much more of a concern to me because there's a lot more radioactive materials in them.",

        "Palo Verde is very typical that if the plant suddenly were to shutdown, if a human personnel we're not there, it would shutdown, but a failsafe generators, diesel generators would come on to keep the water circulating around the reactors, which cools them.",
        "That diesel is only about a seven-day supply.",
        "So once that stops, if there were no human beings, the water around the reactors would start to evaporate because the reactors are very hot and depending on how much fuels in the reactor cycle, it would either catch fire or it would melt down.",
        "Marilyn, the economy is still in the tank and inflation is low.",
        "Why are interest rates going up?",

        "So, those would be a lot of Chernobyls that the ecosystem would have to deal with.",
