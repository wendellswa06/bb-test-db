        "It's just in smaller bits.",
        "And in the ocean, smaller and smaller creatures are mistaking it for something organic and they're eating it.",

        "Also, I'm assured by plastic experts that because of the hydrocarbon with various added elements to give it different kinds of properties, eventually, microbes will figure out how to digest it, but this could take thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of years.",
        "And it's, you know, just like it took microbes that long to figure out how to digest the lignin and cellulose in trees, until that happened, trees didn't decay.",
        "They eventually got buried and eventually got so compressed by what buried them that they turn into coal.",

        "But, if the seas keep rising because of global warming, how much of Manhattan, for example, will be above the water.",

        "Some of them believe that we could be ushering in an ice age very quickly, particularly if cold freshwater from Greenland inundates the ocean conveyor and suddenly shuts that down or slows it down considerably.",
        "So, I looked at a few different models like this and tried to speculate or - I got experts to speculate, I'm just a journalist myself - and some of them also pointed out to some models that suggested some of these things might cancel out each other…",
        "Hmm.",
        "…if the temperatures stay stable for a while.",
        "A dispute, discussion, something breaks out at that meeting.",
        "We haven't even come in yet.",
        "Well, if we were gone and smokestacks tomorrow stopped issuing more buried carbon into - or formally buried carbon - into the atmosphere, that would be an enormous relief, I think, for the ecosystem as we know it.",
        "I mean, the Earth has, in the past, have this much carbon in its atmosphere and it was a really different planet at that time.",
        "I think the last time was about 700,000 years ago and we know that there were, you know, tropical vegetations growing in Greenland and in Antarctica.",
        "Possibly, we would be looking at that again.",
        "But the consensus that I got from atmosphere scientists I talked to is that it would probably take around a hundred thousand years for all the carbon that we have put into the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution to be absorbed by a combination of ocean, the action of the biosphere plants, et cetera, and geologic cycles itself.",
        "You know, rain will dissolve carbon dioxide and then the carbolic acid will then dissolve rocks and eventually the stuff precipitates out in the form of limestone, shells, all sorts of things.",
        "Most of that would probably happen during the first thousand years, it takes the sea a thousand years to turn over, but again, we're looking at models of something that no one has ever witnessed before.",
        "So scientists are doing their best to try to get in all the variables into this huge ecosystem model, to predict what's going to happen.",

        "I know that Northern Europe has a tremendous human imprint left on it and I was thinking of places like The Netherlands, with the dykes, and so many places.",
        "Have you thought about the impact there, how long will it take the dykes to collapse or erode?",
        "My best guess, because I did not get to The Netherlands for this, but I did look at other dyke and dam systems elsewhere, is that all the dykes and the dams require human maintenance.",
        "And if human beings would not maintain it - for example, I went to one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure on Earth, the Panama Canal.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And a tropical river, which - you know, this is the rainforest there, which runs into what is the canal is being held back by a series of earthen dams.",

        "These dams will all fail without human maintenance.",

        "…has to be opened from time to time to let currents through or let the tides through, or they will erode and - if they are not being maintained.",
        "And yes, Holland will definitely eventually flood again, if those dykes are not maintained.",
        "But…",
        "We haven't built anything permanent that will hold back the sea.",
        "Well, let's talk about what you saw as the most permanent, most permanent kinds of structures.",

        "Probably much more, but its going to get steadily, steadily lower.",
