        "Interest rates are still low by historic standards.",
        "It's in the ballpark of five percent.",
        "So if you want to get a low price on a house, you can lock in at a rate that's still relatively low, and you can protect yourself from inflation if real estate prices start to rise again.",

        "But I think, if you want to look at the relations of this administration to science, you have to look at two areas, and that's where all the action is taking place and where this administration has been able to offend the scientific community to a degree I've never seen before.",
