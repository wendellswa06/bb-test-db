        "Thank you.",
        "One of the things that I'm curious about is the fact that scientists are - and inherent interest group within these controversies, especially - I was reading about stem cells and various other matters.",
        "And when you think about scientists giving advice to politicians in terms of policy issues, I think it's difficult for us to be able to actually - as much as we want to depoliticize science and perhaps think about the democratization of science, that in fact, scientists starting interest group and the way in which they influence policy actually is directly reflected of the fact that they have a desire for certain elements of science to actually move forward, especially looking at the human embryonic stem cell controversy.",
        "So I'm wondering if you could just comment on the fact that when politicians are seeking advice from scientists, how is it possible for us to actually separate the interest that scientists have and being able to actually extricate sort of this democratize position when it comes to policy making?",
        "My observation over many years is that when politicians seek scientific advice, they're not looking for wisdom.",
        "They're looking for support for their preconceptions.",
        "They know where they want to go.",
        "They've made their decision, and they're very happy to have scientists with the proper credentials and say, yeah, you're right.",
        "That's really what we should do.",

        "And I'm just wondering how you see that playing out in the coming years, possibly the upcoming elections, and I'd see a lot of influence obviously in the younger generation in their response to environmental issues."

        "They don't vote as a block.",

        "I think a lot of these dramatic pictures of the mountainside that was once covered with snow and now it's just, you know, plain rock has had some effect on public understanding.",

        "And the Congress refused to ratify Kyoto, so Bush backing out of it really wasn't that much of his decision.",
        "Hmm.",

        "But he certainly - he instigated the notion that it might be okay for the federal government to spend research dollars on embryonic stem cells - making the distinction that embryonic stem cells weren't embryos, which that was a fight he didn't want to have.",
        "But he let things languish so that by the time they got around to funding, he was out of office.",
        "So it was actually, I think, to some degree ironic that it was President Bush -George W.",
        "Bush, who actually was the first president to fund embryonic stem cell research with federal dollars.",
        "Well, he split the difference in sort of interesting ways saying that the existing cell lines could be used and federal funds would be available for a research on them, but no more could be created.",
        "But as a matter of fact, the country is large and resilient and diverse and a great deal of stem cell research is going on with state funds, philanthropic and foundation funds.",
        "What about this issue about - the current administration has come under a lot of heat for some of its appointment to advisory committees, where they take people with very strong ideologic positions and put them on advisory panels.",
        "For example, there was someone who is opposed to contraception on the FDA's panel that was making judgments about reproductive drugs.",
