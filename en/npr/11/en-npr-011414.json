        "In the dazzling score, by composer Jule Styne and lyricist Stephen Sondheim, and the coruscating script by Arthur Laurents, Rose is a woman boiling over with her own frustrated ambition and she channels all her energies into turning her daughters into stars — woe be it to anyone who gets in her way.",
