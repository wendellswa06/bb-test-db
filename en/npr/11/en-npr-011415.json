        "And I wonder - the needs here, as you saw them, as you documented, are bottomless.",
        "Nevertheless, I wonder, do you have any concern that once you start following the stories of children who are going to become the subjects of your documentary film, did you feel any ethical pull to say, we have to make sure these children are fed, that they're safe, that they're taken care of?",
        "Or did you say, wait a minute, we're just journalists following their story?",
        "Oh, no. There's constant, you know, ethics and dilemmas and things you question along the road.",
        "I mean, children are our subjects, so our thought was also their safety first.",
        "Because - I mean, and we had asked and did research about how we could behave in the field.",
        "And, you know, we were told very explicitly, you cannot transport them.",
        "You cannot pay for them.",
        "You cannot feed them.",

        "You're just giving them an incentive and a free ride to go.",
        "So legally, you're not able to do that.",
        "And we understood that, and the children also that worked and participated with us understood that.",
        "But at the same time, you know, all along the train route, every time we're around children, and we thought if they were in a dangerous situation or going into a potential one, we would always tell them about the risks, warn them about things and say to them, listen, if you decide you don't want to go, just let us know and we will help you get home.",
        ": Right.",
        "So we were always making them aware of that.",
        "Also, as we met subjects, we immediately wanted to talk with their family members and parents to get permission, so that their families knew that we were wanting to this and if it was okay for them that we were filming their children.",
