        "(Laughter) And carrying all the bags.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Often the confirmation process can be like that no matter who is the nominee.",
        "And so the Sherpa's job is really to first of all bring that person around to see the senators and to introduce him to the senators and also help prepare him for what particular senators might be interested in.",
        "And so you kind of do a little bit of everything of helping him through the process.",
        "And is there, like, a game plan that's tailored to each individual senator?",
        "It sounds like there is.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't think it's - I have to say I don't think from my experience it's that calculated.",
        "But it is important that you know what a senator's background is and what particular issues that they have focused on in their legislation or may be important to their states.",
        "If you think about Judge Kavanaugh, he's been on the D.C.",
        "circuit for 12 years.",
        "He hasn't necessarily been focusing on what each senator is interested in.",
        "Is there a moment that stands out in your mind when people were being people and the one-on-one was a more comfortable place to say things that maybe didn't happen in the open hearing?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "There were actually many personal moments when I brought Justice Gorsuch around to meet the senators.",
        "We had close to 80 meetings, so there was a lot of personal discussion not so much about cases but just, you know, about family backgrounds and different experiences that the senators and the judge had had in his life.",
        "Was there a story that stands out in your memory?",
        "Well, one story was interesting that I will tell you.",
        "You know, I know Senator Feinstein didn't ultimately support Justice Gorsuch, but they had a conversation about horses because Justice Gorsuch - you know, he comes from Colorado and, you know, kind of has a history.",
        "One of his daughters rides horses.",
        "And actually, Senator Feinstein, when she was a girl, used to ride horses as well.",
        "So, you know, it's things like that that you wouldn't even think of that they develop a personal connection over.",
        "Though a connection that did not turn into a yes vote.",
        "It did not turn into a yes vote.",
        "But, you know, it was certainly a very personal moment."

        "Were there any uncomfortable moments?",
        "Well, I think there's uncomfortable moments when the senators sometimes expect the judge to answer questions that he's just not able to answer within his judicial ethics.",
        "And so sometimes that can get uncomfortable.",
        "So you're saying some senators treat the one-on-one meeting kind of as a dress rehearsal for the hearing.",
        "Yeah, some do.",
        "You know, I have to say that Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was very aggressive and making it very difficult for Justice Gorsuch to even answer the questions.",
        "How did Gorsuch respond in that case?",
        "Did he say, just wait till the hearing?",
        "No, Justice Gorsuch actually is a very calm person and just tried to patiently respond in any way that he thought was appropriate.",
        "You know, judges are used to dealing with people who often are in their most difficult moments, right?",
        "So treating people, no matter how they're coming at you, very calmly and with respect, that's almost - shows what kind of demeanor you're going to have on the bench.",
        "And that's how Justice Gorsuch handled himself.",
        "And I would expect that Judge Kavanaugh will handle himself the same.",
        "That's Kelly Ayotte, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire and Justice Gorsuch's former Sherpa.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "NEAL CONAN, host",
        "In the year 2154, human kind has figured out a way to travel to distant planets and project human consciousness into artificially grown alien bodies.",
        "Well, at least we have in James Cameron's sci-fi epic \"\"Avatar,\"\" which recently went past the $1 billion mark at the box office.",

        "Just to review the recent history, it feels like a long time ago, but it was only 2016 when Antonin Scalia, who was on the court, died.",

        "It's been getting more and more conservative, and this was our chance.",
        "And now I think they look sort of at it - the court in terror because you have a situation in which Justice Kennedy looks almost affirmatively liberal compared to someone like a Neil Gorsuch or a Samuel Alito, the most recent conservative appointees.",
        "And so Justice Gorsuch has turned out to be as conservative as liberals feared?",
        "Probably more so.",
        "I made a list of the things he did in the last few weeks of the court term.",
        "There's an emerging pattern of Gorsuch voting with his new best friend, the court's most conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, and to some extent also Justice Samuel Alito, the other most conservative justice.",
        "The three of them would have let the Trump travel ban go into effect completely while the other members of the court sort of split the baby.",

        "In the campaign finance area, Gorsuch and Thomas filed similar dissents when the court refused to hear a challenge to the so-called soft money ban in the McCain-Feingold law.",
        "And finally, in yesterday's major decision on religious rights, the three - Thomas, Gorsuch, Alito - all would have gone farther than the rest of the court majority.",

        "And for the last week, if not longer, there has been rampant speculation over whether he is planning to retire soon.",
        "Well, Kennedy had his clerk reunion.",
        "He moved it up a year, which even made everybody even more crazy about the potential for retirement.",
        "And I'm told that at the reunion he got up and said, I understand that there's been a lot of speculation about a big announcement here, and there is one - the bar is open.",

        "And he told applicants when they were applying for, again, not this coming term but the following one, the 2018-'19 term, that he was thinking of retiring.",
        "And it's entirely possible, I think - I have a hard time imagining that he would stick it out for the rest of the Trump administration.",
        "Tom, how significant would it be if President Trump appointed Justice Anthony Kennedy's successor?",
        "Well, ideologically the earth would tremble because Justice Kennedy is really the limiting agent on the true break to the hard right of American law because you have Justice Kennedy, for example, this term voting with the left in a whole series of 5-4 cases, including, for example, about racial gerrymandering.",
        "He was critical to recognizing a right to same-sex marriage and the like.",

        "The last time the court dealt with this in the early 2000s, Justice Kennedy was - said he was willing to consider that there was a limit to how much partisan gerrymandering there could be.",
        "But he couldn't figure out a good test that would not be too subjective.",
        "So now the people - the progressives have come back and said - have some suggestions for tests.",
        "Well, we'll see whether they're buyable or not.",
        "That decision really could reshape the House of Representatives and state legislatures.",
