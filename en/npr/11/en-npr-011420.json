        "What I am seeing is an elder population of work force who is unable to retire, although they may be reaching retirement eligibility.",
        "And I'm wondering if there are some statistics that counter this information in any degree where what we're still facing is age discrimination, plain and simple; where a younger work force needs to be absorbed, they can capture the knowledge they need to do the job, but the older work force is, you know, taking on the Wal-Mart jobs; they really can't afford to retire and don't wish to, but they're, through various programs, being asked to or forced to.",

        "We are going to have many older baby boomers who frankly can't afford to retire because they're relatively low-skilled and they don't have retirement savings and they're going to be in a difficult position.",
        "But at the same time, there are many boomers also who are going to be ready to retire and whose knowledge is going to be critical to the organization sustaining its performance."

        "One point I want to make sure that gets understood here--this is not some benign issue about some older workers going off into the sunset to play golf.",
        "This loss of knowledge in this era has some major implications for the safety of organizations, for profitability and for their sustaining and continuing to improve performance, for the ability of the economy to grow.",
        "And the caller's right, though.",
        "There are people, and there are going to be stories of older workers who should retire--this is not about full employment for older people.",
        "This is about identifying the key people in your organization who have critical knowledge that is essential to sustaining operations.",
        "Can I give you a couple of examples?",
        "If you would.",
        "For example, I was told not long ago about a chemical plant explosion down on the Gulf Coast.",
        "Unfortunately, we're watching a hurricane right now.",
        "And that plant had an explosion.",
        "Fortunately, nobody died, but when the company went back and did a postmortem, they found that nobody in the plant had been with the company for more than a year, and the senior engineer was out of college less than a year, and the human resource manager said to me, `I'm afraid this is going to happen more often as we have less experienced people running these highly technical, complex operations.",
        "NASA lost space probes in 1999, lost two space probes which they can directly attribute to the lack of expertise on the project teams that launched them.",
        "They made mistakes that cost millions of dollars in space projects because of the lack of experience.",
        "Susan, it sounds like a lot of the people you're talking about are in a different category.",
        "Well, first, let me say, I have stated emphatically today that I have not had a physical relationship with Mrs. Mason.",
        "Well, possibly.",
        "But I still am curious about the whole age-discrimination category for skilled and non-skilled workers.",
        "You know, I recognize that air traffic controllers and NASA space scientists make the premium, and that's recognizable and understood, but, you know, the combination of percentage of population that will be eligible for retirement but unfortunately, whether skilled or unskilled, whether talented or untalented in the view of their employer, are then left into the general population of work force to blend with the younger group coming in.",
        "They're still not going to be selected over the young, perky, assumed by employers trainable, to bring them into the company and build revenue and generate enthusiasm.",
        "So I'm curious about those statistics.",
        "I recognize they are certainly valid, but my personal experience, and probably a lot of others', is that what we are seeing is an aging population unable to retire from various walks of life and professional capability, who are just going to be left out there with no health care coverage or limited resources.",
        "And, you know, your guest is right, it's a multi-layered experience for those people.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks for the call, Susan.",
        "Yeah, go ahead, David.",
        "Let me suggest one other thing that's going to happen is, one thing that is misunderstood is that a lot of the people and a lot of the industries that are going to be most affected are traditional industries, like government, the power industry, energy sectors, manufacturing, where people actually do qualify for pensions.",
        "And a lot of these people are going to take those pensions when they qualify for them and they're going to run because they're tired of the way they've been treated in organizations.",
        "So they're going to take it and they're going to leave with their knowledge.",
        "And they're going to go on.",
        "They're not going to stop working.",
        "Susan's right.",
        "They're going to keep working.",
        "But they're going to redesign a career or jobs for themselves that are much more to their liking, maybe three days a week, maybe start a new business.",
        "There are a lot of options for boomers, for those who have some access to pensions and to retirement benefits.",

        "Well, a big part of what's happening, of course, is the work force is aging, just as your caller pointed out, at the same time that businesses, particularly health care, government, manufacturing and the energy sector, the transportation sector, are losing some of the most valuable institutional memory.",
        "But it's not just institutional memory and skill and knowledge and wisdom.",
        "You're also losing the oldest, most experienced people who have followed the old-fashioned career path.",
        "The reason they're eligible for pensions and might actually go on and re-invent retirement is because they've actually paid their dues and climbed the ladder and done it the old-fashioned way.",
        "And a big part of what we've been looking at is the shift in norms and values in the workplace.",

        "Employees pushing back, making demands, not just listening to what their boss has to say but pushing back.",
        "A lot of this shift that has been happening over the last 10 years is--you're going to see this accelerate as the oldest, most experienced people with the last vestiges of the old-fashioned work ethic start to move on.",
        "You seem to be talking about a much more free-lance future.",
        "Well, whose idea was this, right?",
        "It was business leaders who decided that everything had to change.",
        "Remember, downsizing, restructuring, re-engineering, these things that have become the norm in the business world have had a real impact on the mind-set of the work force.",
        "And while the oldest, most experienced people may not be the squeaky wheels, they may be waiting until they qualify for their pension.",
        "And as Professor DeLong says, you know, they may take the money and run.",
        "But the younger, less experienced people, they've never known it any other way.",

        "And what you're seeing is that the workplace revolution that we thought was about the late '90s about magical business models--the real workplace revolution is about an environment where business is going to be very lean and flexible, and the premium is going to be: Recruit better people, get them up to speed faster, get more work and better work out of every person.",
        "How you manage a short-term transactional employment relationship is very different, and you see this in health care already, where nurse managers are forced to hire temporary nurses.",
        "They're forced to go back and hire their retired nurses.",
