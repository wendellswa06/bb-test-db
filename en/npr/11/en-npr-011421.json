        "But there are companies in the Midwest and in places that are harder to attract young people to, and the market, actually, for people in your field is going to just explode in the next five or so years, because there are so many engineers and chemical engineers leaving the workplace.",

        "They're putting themselves in a very awkward position because it's not likely that people are going to follow that path, and it's not likely going to serve their interests over time.",
        "And yet if you're a young person coming out of school and you want to get a job, you humor the employer and say, `Oh, yeah, I'm going to work here for my whole career.'",
