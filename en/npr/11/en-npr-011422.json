        "Yes.",
        "The idea is to basically put people into a sort of a cryogenic freeze, put them into hibernation.",
        "And that way, you don't have to worry about so much keeping them fed and keeping them occupied for the journey, which takes about six years, given how fast the spacecraft in \"\"Avatar\"\" goes, which is about 70 percent of the speed of light, they say.",
        "Which is a lot faster than anything humans have managed to (unintelligible) go that far yet.",
        "Nevertheless, there's a lot of questions about that.",
        "Any of that in the even distant future?",

        "This is something that is certainly have been looked at a fair amount.",
        "NASA has been looking at it over the years, time to time.",
        "And the idea is to basically find a way to generate enough thrust to really get going, you know, as fast as you can.",
        "And the best bang for your buck is really when you combine matter and antimatter.",
        "Antimatter is basically, it's - just as it sounds, it's the opposite of the matter that we're all used to - the microphone in front of me, the desk here, under my hands.",
        "It's - when matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each other and�",
        "A big boom.",
        "�a current, exactly.",
        "Pure energy.",
        "Obviously there's not a lot of antimatter around.",
        "We're talking - all times, they've only really made of something on the order of nanograms, so...",
        "So you'd have to find a way to manufacture it and control these explosions so that they wouldn't blow up the ship too, and channel all of this stuff.",
        "And, well, even when you get going fast, you got to slow down too.",
        "And that's the other�",
        "Not to mention, in this whole thing, I mean, if you really can't think of a more volatile fuel than antimatter.",
        "And we do have ways to confine it using electromagnetic fields.",
        "But the promise in whatever storage container you have, it's really impossible at this point to make a perfect vacuum.",
        "So even if there's just a few stray molecules of real matter in there, the antimatter will hit those molecules and will annihilate.",
        "So it's not a very good fuel tank.",
        "You're losing fuel as you go.",
        "And then the other part, the cryogenic state which allows people to basically sleep their way off to Pandora.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, there's been some work on that.",
