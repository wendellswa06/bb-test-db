        "A really neat example - this was done just about two years ago, a scientist at Duke University working with scientists in Japan, they trained a rhesus monkey to walk upright on a treadmill in North Carolina.",
        "And they had electrodes implanted in his brain, and they were able to take these neural signals, send them over the Internet to Japan, and they took some video too as well.",
        "And they got a robot in Japan to synchronize its movements with this monkey.",

        "What is it, four months?",

        "He really talked about these things as an extension of a tank, for example, that had...",

        "That's actually a very interesting question.",

        "Hmm.",
        "Adam, could you think of any movies where the technology predicted a science fiction movie of the past has - well, seemed impossible but come to pass?",
        "Definitely there are examples.",
        "I'm drawing a little bit of blank right now, but, well, certainly if you - \"\"Star Trek\"\" came to mind, and no, we're not really doing anything you've seen there.",
        "But one example that you can sort of draw from that is if you think about 12(ph) cell phones - we saw on the original \"\"Star Trek\"\" series, they would reach into their pocket and, you know, call the Enterprise.",
        "True.",
        "Yup.",
