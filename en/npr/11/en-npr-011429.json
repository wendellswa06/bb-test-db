        "Yes.",
        "The books and stories and TV show takes place in a fictional world, a continent called Westeros, which has a lot in common with kind of high-medieval Europe - the same kind of swords and knights and tourneys and castles setting that seems to be familiar to - with all of fantasy.",
        "For some reason, high fantasy gets set in, like, circa 1300.",
        "OK.",
        "And brilliantly, they have physically realized this world using a combination of costume design, art direction and a lot of CGI.",
        "I mean, they use real settings, everywhere from Iceland to the coast of Croatia, but they added a tremendous amount of CGI so it looks like a real place, this vast continent called Westeros.",
        "And also another one called Essos.",

        "I'm thinking of the famous phrase jump the shark, the moment in a series where they kind of run out of sensible ideas and start doing silly things just to keep it going.",
        "Has the series jumped the shark?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I think that they have, in fact, more so than almost any other TV show that I can remember, kept true to the things that made it good from the beginning.",
        "In fact, when this world was invented by George R.R.",
        "Martin, he had this rather complete vision of both the world he was writing about - this incredibly complex, fake world - and where he wanted it to go.",
        "So he laid out rails for them that the TV showrunners have kept on, even though now they've actually gone beyond where the last published book is."

        "I've heard people use the phrase in ordinary life, in a business situation or talking about news events, it's like \"\"Game Of Thrones.\"\" And I think they mean it's a situation where it's brutally competitive and people could be killed off - really or metaphorically - at any time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But you've really thought really hard about this series.",
        "I really have, Steve.",
        "Is that what it's really about, is - just the ruthless human competition?",
        "Or is it about something bigger and deeper?",
        "One of the exciting things about \"\"Game Of Thrones,\"\" both as books and as a TV show, it reflects a world, the world in which we live in, in which good guys do not always win, in which the just result - the result that you wish for - is not the result you get, in which justice is completely arbitrary and in which basically anything can happen at any time.",
        "And I think - well, I don't need, I think, to refer too obliquely to current events...",
        "(Laughter).",
        "...To indicate that maybe...",
        "Can't imagine where you're going with this.",
        "...That it is a more realistic view of the real world than we've been heretofore offered in our entertainment."
