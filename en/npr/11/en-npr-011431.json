        "These deliveries to these besieged towns are being carried out in addition to WFP's regular operation to which it delivers food to 4 million people in (unintelligible) Syria (unintelligible) every month.",
        "So we have a huge operation besides these convoys, which is the regular 4 million people that we support.",
        "Many of the people you encounter during these convoys, what sense do you get that they are willing and hoping to hold out where they live and also perhaps in some cases, you know, with rebels who they would be sympathetic to?",
        "When we talk to them and I ask them normally, what message do you want me to come away to the rest of the world?",

        "It's an opportunity for Bishop Jakes to tackle some hard topics outside of his sermons, and I started by asking him if he hopes these kinds of conversations will help bridge the kinds of divisions that have become so apparent.",
        "I think it absolutely helps.",
        "However, the conversations alone will not facilitate the kinds of change that causes people to march in the streets.",
        "They don't just want to talk about it.",
        "They want to see action.",
        "And what I really learned in Charlotte, whether I was talking with the president of the Urban League, or whether I was talking with Chief Putney or whether I was talking to the neighbors of Lamont Scott - people understand that this is more than a one-dimensional crisis in the community.",
        "It is a multilayered problem that encapsulates many things that we need to resolve, a criminal justice system that is not as just as it ought to be.",
        "Not just on the street, but the whole comprehensive understanding of the criminal justice system has fallen prey to politics and special interest groups to the detriment of minorities.",
        "There is bipartisan interest on this issue, both Republicans and Democrats admittedly suggesting that the criminal justice system needs to be overhauled.",
        "So conversations - that's part of it.",
        "You talked about the fact that there's growing bipartisan interest in this, but it is also among the most racially polarized discussions that exists in this country.",
        "I mean, if you look at those surveys on this, you know, overwhelmingly African-Americans say that something is broken in the way our criminal justice system operates, that it is biased.",
        "Overwhelmingly, white people who are polled on this issue will say that they think by and large the criminal justice system is fair.",
        "And I'd like to ask you what you feel you have to offer in addressing that?",
        "I don't think that is so much that I have anything to offer.",
        "I think what we need is to continue to push so that the people who have the power to make decisions can do so, and I think it's important that we don't confuse what we're seeing on the streets with the problem that we're having with criminal justice - goes much, much deeper than the men who were wearing blue uniforms.",
        "And we have turned criminal justice into big business, and we're building prisons in such a rapid pace that they have replaced plantations.",
        "And the fact that we're polarized - I think that's a result of how the coverage is done and how the public is only seeing one dimension of a huge problem.",
        "Well, talk to me a little bit about that if you would.",
        "I mean, you have quite a platform now.",

        "The opportunity for me to do \"\"T.D.",
        "Jakes Show\"\" is to have a broader, comprehensive discussion on other issues about life, about families, about communities, about dysfunctions.",
        "We just did a show on the mental health systems and the crisis that we're seeing in mental health and all of these disparities.",
        "I really applaud the platform.",
        "I don't think that the talk show by itself will change the world or anything like that, but it does create a platform to which I might be able to disseminate information to people who are underserved and provide an opportunity for those who are not in touch with the people who are under-served to better understand that we are in this fight together.",
        "Before we let you go, I am recognizing that you were talking about your show and not the - your preaching, but you are kind of in the hope business.",
