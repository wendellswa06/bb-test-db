        "Hey, Arun.",
        "So this sounds good for Brian Williams, but what about NBC?",
        "What does the network have to gain by giving Brian Williams another chance?",
        "Well, you could argue there are two things; one very specific and one much larger.",
        "The specific thing is, of course, he had a big contract, and it just had been extended last year.",
        "And this gets them out of having some sort of messy litigation or negotiation to pay him off to go away without raising a huge stink.",
        "The larger issue is that strategically, Brian Williams, even damaged, is one of the biggest names and one of the best-known properties NBC News has to offer.",
        "You know, he's been somebody that they promoted.",
        "He's been on the air in front of millions of people, five times a week for over a decade.",
        "He's been their main guy for many, many years.",
        "And so the idea of simply exiling him in total for what were things that he largely did - although not entirely - but largely did off the air seemed, to many people internally at NBC, disproportionate and self-damaging to the network.",
        "Well, Hamas is facing a myriad of problems.",
        "You have the security problem from the Israelis, who are maintaining the pressure on them.",
        "You have clashes on the border.",
        "You have Palestinian casualties - which, by the way, if we're talking about a referendum that will recognize Israel, albeit implicitly, this kind of Israeli pressure and the death of civilian Palestinians will probably play into Hamas' hand in the foreseeable future.",
        "Hamas would like nothing but to be left alone at this stage, so that they will consolidate their control and their grip on Palestinian institutions.",
        "And remember, these institutions have been manned for decades by Fatah loyalists, or loyalists to the former President Arafat, late President Arafat, and now President Abbas.",
        "So Hamas is facing all these problems, and they have a dearth of friends in the region, or in the world.",
        "They may get promises from Iran or other players in the region, like Qatar and others, but even those financial pledges cannot be delivered because of the reluctance of the international banking system - including the Arab banks - being involved, because of the potential threat of being boycotted by the American banking system.",
        "And this is something no bank in the region would like to see.",
        "Hisham Melhem is the Washington correspondent for the Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar.",
        "Thank you very much for your time.",
        "Thank you.",
        "From NPR News, this is WEEKEND EDITION.",

        "That's what I think.",
        "Yes.",

        "Only way to go.",
        "Well, I know our on-air challenge is, you know, your annual puzzle that you give every year, but before we can get that into our--the winner of last week's challenge, let's repeat that challenge that you gave everyone to work on.",
        "It was a holiday-themed challenge.",
        "Yes.",
        "I said name something in nine letters commonly seen around Christmas; I said change the first letter to the previous letter of the alphabet, change the third letter to the following letter of the alphabet, and the result will name part of the human body.",
        "What words are these?",
        "What words are they?",
        "Well, the first is mistletoe.",
        "Change those letters, you get `little toe.'",
        "Oh, classy.",
        "We had over 1,400 entries from people who tried to solve the puzzle, and our winner, randomly selected from the correct answers, is Kathy Emerson.",
