        "The exchanges have a complicated scheme of including, by law, at least one plan that does not include coverage of elective abortion.",
        "That was the deal that got the law passed, so that abortion opponents could avoid policies that cover the procedure.",
        "But he says that not only is the information not on the website; sometimes it's not easily available by calling, either.",
        "We did what we were recommended to do, and that is call the individual insurers.",
        "And in many cases, they don't have plan documents in front of them as they talk to you on the phone.",
        "Now, it should be noted that in 23 states, there is little question.",
        "Those states have passed laws that ban all plans in the health exchange from offering coverage for elective abortion.",
        "Eight of those states have also banned private insurers outside the exchange from offering coverage for abortion as well.",
        "Most, but not all, include exceptions for life endangerment, rape or incest.",
        "Some of those states allow abortion coverage to be sold as a separate policy - called a rider - but so far, there's no evidence that any plan is offering that.",
        "Judy Waxman, of the National Women's Law Center, says this is a major change from what's traditionally been the status quo for abortion coverage in private health plans.",
        "Abortion has generally been covered because it is treated like any other medical service, and is just part of outpatient care or doctor care and really, has not been singled out very much in private insurance.",
        "But the fight over the Affordable Care Act changed that.",
        "In order to ensure that no taxpayer money went to pay for elective abortions, it created a very complex system by which insurance companies would have to separate out a portion of each premium if they wanted to continue to offer abortion as a covered benefit.",
        "Waxman says as a result, there's at least anecdotal evidence that some insurers are dropping coverage - at least, for this first year - just because of the added hassle.",
        "We had heard that some plans are saying that they are not going to offer it now because they have so much to figure out; and this little, extra administrative activity they have to be involved in is something they want to figure out when things kind of calm down a little."

        "Chuck Donovan says it will help those on both sides of the debate.",
        "It's designed so that people have information about elective abortion coverage, whether they're looking for it or they're looking to exclude it.",

        "They discovered that the number was small but rising.",
