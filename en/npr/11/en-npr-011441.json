        "(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)",
        "He's got a white urethane skin, a flat head sporting an array of camera lenses, a laser scanner in his throat, jointed arms with grippers for hands, and he moves around on caster wheels.",

        "Jake is one of Willow Garage's PR2s, that stands for personal robot.",
        "In robotics' jargon, the PR2 is a robot platform for experimentation and innovation.",
        "In other words, it's a vessel for developing new applications with Open Source software, so people all over the world can use it.",
        "And the idea is that the robots developed here will be in your home in the future.",
        "So far, the PR2 has been programmed to fold towels, shoot pool and fetch a beer.",
        "Today, Jake is hard at work trying to a refrigerator door and take out a bottle of juice.",
        "It, he, Jake has raised his arms, right?",
        "So they're poised.",
        "If you look at the weight set up right now, I'm not sure he's going to make it, because his arms are not long enough..."

        "Her specialty is human-robot interaction.",
        "She's got a background in psychology, so she observes people, and then figures out how to make robots more personable.",
        "Can they be in an environment with people?",
        "And that's not just, you know, don't kill the people?",

        "Less intimidating, for one.",
        "You could pose it as this big, big robot that's very scary and very capable and smart.",
        "Or you could pose it as something that's sort of more humble and smaller in personality.",

        "Now some urban designers want to change this.",
        "They say in this age of climate uncertainty and drought, a downpour should be captured - used for drinking water or for irrigation.",
        "But most of the time, it's banished to a river and on out to the ocean, which is where we find Amy Standen from member station KQED."

        "Today, it's more like a 51-mile-long bathtub that empties out here, at the port of Long Beach.",

        "Almost 80 percent of California is an extreme drought.",
        "That's a technical term, by the way - just one not shy of exceptional drought.",
        "And so there's a call now to build cities like sponges, which brings us to Elmer Avenue, a working-class neighborhood, where Rick Martin is out on his morning constitutional."
