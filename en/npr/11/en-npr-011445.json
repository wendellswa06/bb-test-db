        "Well, there's this great quote by the science fiction writer William Gibson who says that the future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed yet.",
        "And so, the sense in which there are many kinds of robots already in the home and increasingly in hospitals and even small businesses.",
        "But, you know, we're a few years out.",
        "I mean, a couple of years ago, Bill Gates wrote an op-ed in Scientific American, called \"\"A Robot in Every Home,\"\" where he said that we are in a stage today in personal robotics that we were with personal computers in the '70s.",
        "And so, you know, if you think about that, the Apple II didn't come out for a few years.",
        "It was, you know, early '80s.",

        "But once you get past that initial hurdle, it's going to be like a mobile phone, where you just constantly come across new apps that are useful to you.",
        "And then everybody wants one of these things because of the potential that they have.",
        "If I understand this right - how the PR2 works - basically, the operating system, which is given to anybody who wants it for free - they say: OK, this is how this robot works, this is how it moves, this is how it's manipulated.",
        "It's kind of the nerve center, the brain of the robot.",
        "And then anybody else can take that and program it to do all kinds of things.",
        "Is that the idea?",
        "That's right.",
        "And what's great about having a common ROS or robot operating system is that when you write code for that system, it can be run on any machine that runs ROS.",
        "And so, it's a real boon to the entire robotics industry to have this common language.",
        "Well, when you think of the places where robots are used all the time, say, in industry, on assembly lines - why does it seem that home use, personal robotics, is so far behind?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "So, the history of robots has been that they have been domain-specific, meaning that they're operating within a particular environment that you can control the parameters, right?",
        "And they're extremely good at that.",
        "Robots are very, very good at doing the same thing over and over again very fast and very accurately.",
        "The challenge of personal and service robots is that they're not domain-specific.",
        "They have to negotiate all kinds of different environments.",
        "I mean, think about how different your friends' houses are.",
        "And the second thing is, you know, the safety considerations, right?",
        "I mean, if you go onto the floor of a factory, these large robots have a zone around them that you're not allowed to pass within because it's dangerous.",
        "Sometimes, they're actually physically fenced off, whereas the notion of co-robotics is the idea that robots will be working alongside us or helping us in our homes.",
        "And that's a real challenge.",
        "You know, this past year, the Obama Administration committed about $70 million to the study of co-robotics, again, because the challenges are so serious.",
        "We heard Leila Takayama in our story say that she wants robots to be unremarkable, right?",
        "How far away are we from that, do you think?",
        "When will that point come?",
        "I think we're far from that point.",
        "You know, that said, there are also plenty of places where robotics is absolutely mainstream.",
        "I mean, chances are that if you've purchased something from Amazon, it was a robot that went and retrieved that item from the warehouse.",
        "So, for certain people, surgeons, those who are operating eCommerce, they already are part of the background and they already are boring.",

        "It's just that, for the rest of us who don't encounter them on a daily basis, they're still going to be exciting.",
