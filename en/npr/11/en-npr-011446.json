        "If you're a pessimist, you probably believe everybody's doping and nobody's getting caught because the positive rates are very, very low.",

        "Well, I'm kind of somewhere in between.",
        "I think we're catching some of them but some of them are using compounds that are escaping our ability to catch them at this particular point.",
        "He says every new drug that comes on the scene requires developing a new test, giving athletes who dope a window of opportunity.",
        "We're getting closer to them.",
        "As they change their doping patterns we can detect lower concentrations.",
        "I think we're picking up more cheaters.",
        "The problem is with new compounds as they come out, things that are extremely difficult to pick up, even if you have the technology.",

        "The testing is out there.",

        "With his research supported by the world anti-doping agency, Pitsilatis looks at the evidence of doping in the genetic sequence of RNA, the partner of DNA.",
        "It's at almost at the highest level of sensitivity because what we're looking at is the switching on and the switching off of genes as a result of taking a particular drug.",
        "We develop this profile or signature of a particular drug and then that's what we try and find.",
        "So at this genetic level there's a molecular footprint left behind?",
        "That's the idea, yes.",
        "We can find consistently in everyone we have tested up until now; we find the same molecular signature to the same drug.",
        "So how do you learn to recognize what the signature of a particular drug is at this genetic level?",
        "OK.",
        "So what we've done up until now is we've actually taken volunteers, healthy volunteers who are athletes typically who are not permitted to actually compete during the trial because obviously they would have an unfair advantage because they take a banned drug."

        "You're having them dope.",
        "Well, I wouldn't use the word dope here because they're basically agreeing to do this, but they're taking the same kind of drug that athletes in the past and now may be taking but under controlled conditions.",
        "So we administer the drugs, so we're present when the drug is being injected.",
        "And then go into the laboratory subsequent to that and look at the genes that are being expressed.",
        "And doing that we've identified these molecular signatures of, in this particular case, the drug EPO, erythropoietin.",
        "With this test, how long are you able to trace the effects of the drugs?",
        "So far we've achieved a four-week identification, which is fabulous.",
        "The current detection window is typically 48 hours after taking an injection of EPO.",
        "Four weeks is an incredible improvement compared to what we had up until now.",
        "In terms of things that could generate false positives, are there things that you might misidentify as a signature for one of these drugs that's actually from something else?",
        "Yes.",
        "And the most important one is going to altitude, especially middle- and long-distance athletes, endurance athletes will spend a significant amount of time often living for prolonged periods of time in training at high altitude.",
        "And the changes which occur when you go to altitude, for example increase in red blood cells so you can carry more oxygen, these are the same kind of effects the drug that they tend to take also produces.",
        "So we've got to make sure that going to altitude, while it still has a similar effect on the red blood cells, isn't having the same molecular response.",
        "My prediction based on the work that we've done to date is that none of these confounders will have anywhere near the same kind of molecular signature as the particular drug of interest.",
        "You're testing with your subjects with already existing substances that we know about.",
        "Say though, in six months something else comes on the market, there is some new molecular footprint.",
        "You have to spend the time learning that new signature, right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Athletes that are currently doping should actually be having sleepless nights because the bottom line is those samples that you collected for anti-doping purposes are being stored.",
        "So we can go back to those samples, apply these molecular signatures as we develop them and be able to identify them even years after they've done this.",
        "So the beauty of this kind of approach, this kind of molecular signature approach is that it's almost uncheatable in the sense that there are so many genes that are being switched on that if you wanted to manipulate the test, you couldn't do it because there's far too many genes to try and manipulate.",
        "And if you ended up trying to do that you'll probably end up killing yourself."
