        "And yet, says, Joe, even he was surprised by the Volkswagen ad.",
        "After this ad had such an impact and really multiplied the sales, annual sales of Nick Drake records, I met the team, the creative team who put the ad together.",
        "And they were a bunch of, kind of, slackers from an alternative Boston ad agency.",

        "And he came in the next morning and played it to the rest of the team.",
        "He said: Let's go with this.",
        "And at the very last minute, sort of minutes before the Volkswagen ad execs arrived, they switched the whole ad.",

        "Well, Vashti is a fascinating character because her story is so similar to Nick's.",
        "You know, she was a very delicate, shy, soft-voiced singer, who I heard, actually, before Nick in the '60s - 1966 - and eventually made a record with her in 1970 which didn't sell, sold even less than Nick's.",
        "But at one point, I introduced them to each other and tried to get them to write a song together.",
        "And it was a complete flop because they were both so shy that neither of them said a word, I think, in the entire time they spent in a room together.",
        "And, of course, her story is that she had a record that didn't sell.",
        "She was living in a caravan in the outer Hebrides, had children, moved to Edinburgh, remarried, never told anyone that she'd had a career, was so crushed by the failure of the career, very much like Nick.",
        "But then the internet came along, and she discovered there was this huge following for her one album and the, sort of, 200 copies that had been sold had been copied on tape and circulated around the world.",
        "And eventually, it was reissued, and she's had this whole new career and a whole new following of people.",
