        "I think that at some point he was going to have to put away the olive branch and unsheathe the sword.",
        "And I guess this is it.",
        "Earlier this summer, Mr. Obama was willing to trim Social Security benefits and even raise the eligibility age for Medicare.",
        "His new plan includes neither of those concessions.",
        "So we will reform Medicare and Medicaid, but we will not abandon the fundamental commitment that this country has kept for generations.",
        "While the president's tougher bargaining stance delighted some on the left, it left deficit hawks disappointed.",
        "Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says the relatively modest cuts to Medicare in Mr. Obama's proposal don't go far enough.",
        "The president talks about going big, which is exactly what you want people to be saying, but he doesn't quite get there.",
        "He goes biggish, or maybe he goes medium.",
        "Diane Lim Rogers of the deficit watchdog Concord Coalition complains Mr. Obama's tax proposals also fall short of what's needed.",

        "It's a day of rage in Saudi Arabia on the Web on March 11.",
        "But the prospects for that aren't very likely, because I've been talking to a lot of Saudis about this, and they say we don't know who that is.",
        "It is an anonymous call so nobody knows who they're going out with.",
        "And there many people here, human rights activists, who say Saudis aren't ready yet to go out on the street.",
        "This is all new, this kind of politics.",
        "And Saudis don't know each other - there's no organizing permitted.",
        "So you have no civil(ph) society, no town hall meetings, nothing like that."

        "Well, for any city, the real challenge is trying to balance all those different nodes.",
        "And one of the interesting things that's changing in the world of transportation planning is now cities are taking a multi-modal approach, not just measuring how long it takes a certain number of cars to get through an intersection, but how many pedestrians are going through the intersection, how many people on a bus or on a train are going through the intersection and how many people are biking through the intersection.",
        "So as they do that, they're making their jobs a little bit more complicated but they're also thinking about how people behave in the real world.",
        "If you're trying to time the lights, right, for drivers, sequentially so the traffic can keep flowing, there's a pattern.",
        "They're going to start turning red in sequence, right, so you can kind of move through and they can turn red behind you, but you can still make connections without speeding too much.",
        "That depends on what kind of the street you have.",
        "This street, on H Street, this is a particularly challenging street to accommodate all the different needs because a couple blocks away is the entrance to an interstate.",
        "And normally on a feeder road, you might want to time the lights sequentially to allow the cars to quickly get onto the interstate.",
        "That is a difficult thing to accommodate at this particular intersection because of all of the land use that's here.",
        "You have a lot of employment.",
        "You have a lot of entertainment.",
        "You have a Metro station.",
        "You have a lot of pedestrian traffic.",
        "So you probably wouldn't time the lights to allow the cars to gradually speed up and get faster as they get to the interstate.",
        "So you're going to get some stacking here, particularly at rush hour, as a result of that.",
        "Now, stacking can be a good thing from a pedestrian safety perspective, 'cause it means the cars are going to be going slower.",
        "Gideon, do you think - is there an ideal time for a pedestrian crosswalk; number of seconds?",
        "You know, I think the thinking on that is sort of evolving.",
        "Because as our society, as we become an older country, we're really starting to have to think about how long it takes older folks to get around.",
        "And so, there are standards that are put together by the traffic professionals, there are national standards.",
        "Every city has, if not codified standards, then guidelines that their public works or transportation departments enforce.",
        "They're different in every city.",
