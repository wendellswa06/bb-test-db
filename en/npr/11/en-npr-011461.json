        "Much of what Sam's unit did was hearts and minds stuff, checking in on locals in Kandahar to see if they had adequate water, whether they were safe.",

        "Five days later, Sam Brown was in the intensive care unit at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.",
        "And almost immediately, to prevent skin infection, he was taken to a shower room where his skin was scrubbed by nurses.",
        "This is a regular, often daily part of burn care."

        "They called it SnowWorld, and the Army was interested in trying it out with troops burned in battle, including Sam Brown.",
        "I was quite skeptical, but I was also at a place where I was willing to try anything that might help.",
        "That's because on a scale from one to 10, Sam's daily pain level often spiked at eight.",
        "So he put on the goggles and entered SnowWorld."
