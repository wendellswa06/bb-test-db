        "Seems a group of MIT students, armed with a rental truck, a forklift and fake moving company documents, were able to get away with the 130 year old piece of artillery.",
        "All of that sounds very familiar to David Somers.",
        "He's now an assistant professor of psychology at Boston University, but he was once a prankster at California's Harvey Mudd College.",
        "Twenty years ago 11 of us at Harvey Mudd College road off to CalTech early in the morning and with a forklift and a flatbed truck and some forged work orders, posed as a moving crew and lifted the cannon from the CalTech campus and drove it back to our campus sort of fooling everybody along the way.",
        "Now this thing is what, like 1.7 tons, something like that?",
        "Yeah, it's not just stealing the goat from another college, this is an antique that's more than 100 years old that weighs more than 2 tons so it is an engineering project in itself just to move this thing without breaking it.",
        "Past efforts, the weight of the cannon had broken off the axel on a flatbed truck.",
        "I believe on this effort they broke off the bumper on their rented U-Haul.",
        "It's quite a massive piece of artillery."

        "Of course, a good prank is like a good engineering project, you've gotta prepare for all the contingencies and the success of the prank really depends on how well you've planned and how well you've taken care of the details, so in our case, we had forged work orders and sort of managed to convince campus security that we really belonged there and that the work orders were valid and we were doing what we were supposed to be doing.",
        "A good prank also has a lot of social psychology involved, with our prank we brought students along to pose as CalTech students, so people would stop and look and say, gee, are they supposed to be taking the cannon?",
        "And then our decoy students would look up and pretend like nothing was wrong and they would sort of get their social cues and go, okay, well I guess this is all okay and they would walk on.",
        "Well it sounds like the pranksters from MIT took a page directly from your book.",
        "They had phony work orders, their company was called How and Ser Moving Company.",
        "Howser if you put it together and they were confronted I guess by police at CalTech and gave them these work orders and off they went with the cannon.",
        "Yeah they copied each of the little pieces that we did, the flatbed truck, the forklift, the forged work orders as a moving company and they put all that together, so doing it on the 20th anniversary of our prank was, you know, if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I'm feeling very flattered.",

        "In the world of pranks I think you have to be able to take it as well as you dish it out and I think MIT was pranked by CalTech a year ago and I think they took that pretty well, sort of said, okay you got us and then immediately began planning the retaliation which they accomplished this week.",
        "I think the MIT students' opinion is, look CalTech, you were dumb enough to fall for the same prank twice, so I think repeating a prank sort of had that extra slap in the face appeal that is always nice in a college rivalry.",
