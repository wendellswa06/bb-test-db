        "And as NPR's Martin Kaste reports now from Seattle, the idea is catching on.",
        "Washington's secretary of corrections, Eldon Vail, says he's not thrilled about releasing illegal immigrants from prison early.",
        "But with the state facing a $5 billion budget deficit, he has to make cuts somewhere.",
        "The idea is that we would identify those who have been convicted of either drug or property non-violent offenses and deport them.",
        "Of course, it's not the state that would deport them.",
        "It would release the inmates into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which would then initiate the usual legal process for deportation.",
        "Arizona has been doing something similar since 2005, and they saved $26 million.",
        "It seems like a good deal all around.",
        "The state saves money.",
        "The immigrant gets out of jail early.",
        "But immigration lawyer David Leopold recommends caution.",
        "Many of these people may have the right to stay in the United States notwithstanding their offense.",
        "We could be talking about breaking up families, separating parents from children forever.",
        "But when you talk about sending somebody away to save money, we need to make sure that everybody's rights are protected.",
        "Leopold is vice president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.",
        "One of his colleagues, Kathleen Walker, says she also worries about fairness for another population, the American inmates.",
        "We will have basically discrimination here set in our state law, where U.S.",

        "This is actually a rare point of agreement between opposing sides in the immigration debate.",

        "Ira Mehlman is spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that generally argues for the prompt deportation of illegal immigrants.",
        "But, he says, not if it means giving them special breaks on prison sentences.",
        "People who are in the country illegally ought to be deported at the end of their sentences.",
        "But the penalty for having committed a crime in the state of Washington shouldn't simply be a ticket back to where - whatever country you came from.",
        "I think the key is creating melodies that people can really understand, and if they can hum it, I think that you've got a better chance.",
        "The fact that this sense of unfairness cuts across political lines like this is certainly on the mind of Washington state secretary of corrections.",
        "We asked him if this program meant that an American inmate would have to watch immigrants with similar sentences get out of jail ahead of him.",
        "Yes, he would.",

        "So Russian interference in the 2016 elections is something we've been talking about for a couple of years now.",
        "Does this report add anything to what we already knew?",
        "Well, we knew most of the specifics already.",

        "But it's kind of interesting how they characterize it.",
        "They characterize this as like almost a reconnaissance effort, that they were, quote - one official said - trying to \"\"establish a presence so you could come back later and actually execute an operation,\"\" which is one reason they're so concerned about the future.",
        "Come back later - those are worrying words.",
        "Is it any clearer after this report what the Russians actually want to do to the United States?",
        "Well, I think it's not necessarily so much changing the actual votes, but it's sowing discord and confusion, possibly, on Election Day.",
        "A lot of these intrusions or efforts to hack involve state election websites, voter registration databases, the kind of things that people rely on information for on Election Day.",
        "All they had to do is maybe change some of the records or, you know, where you're supposed to go on Election Day to vote.",
