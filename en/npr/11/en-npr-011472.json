        "He's also former special assistant to President George W.",

        "I'll be part of the conscription army.",
        "But before that, let's move on to Barack Obama.",
        "So Democrat Barack Obama says he's humbled by the support that pumped $25 million into his campaign fund so far.",
        "He's also proud, he says, that they've raised the funds without taking money from either political action committees or federal lobbyists.",
        "And he raised just a million dollars less than Senator Hilary Clinton and surpasses the other candidates besides Senator Clinton.",
        "What do you think is the significance, Julianne, of his robust fundraising?",
        "Well, given that he started later, that he had less of an infrastructure, it really is a rebuke to Senator Clinton.",
        "He got lots of smaller contributions than she got.",
        "She got the big contributions, which suggests more of a groundswell of support for Senator Obama.",
        "It's a really exciting development, but, of course, it's just the first quarter.",
        "We're 10 months away from the first vote being cast.",
        "If he can keep up this momentum, though, it says an awful lot about - literally, about what he's doing, about the kind of support that he's getting and really raises lots of questions about whether or not we'll have an African-American in the White House in 2009.",
        "Walter, just a few months ago, people were saying, oh, that Obama guy, he is just such a sweet little darling, but, you know, he can't run.",
        "It's too soon.",
        "Does this put the nail in that coffin?",
        "Oh, not only puts the nail in it, it buries it about six to eight feet deep.",
        "I mean, I think there are four significant things about what he achieved in this first quarter.",
        "Number one, he is a neophyte compared to the rest of the field - we have to remember that.",
        "Everyone else has much more experience, particularly at federal level, than Barack Obama.",
        "Number two is the breadth of donors.",
        "As Julianne even mentioned, 100,000 different people contributed, and no political action committee money.",
        "Also, the conduit used.",
        "He raised almost $7 million online.",
        "And then there's a force that he's convened that I think not only speaks to his campaign, but sort of the next generation of black political leadership.",
        "He, along with Deval Patrick and Cory Booker, when he ran for mayor of Newark, they're campaigning were really grassroots insurgencies.",
        "They are bringing back retail politics in new clothing, in new technology, and I think it's fascinating that as black candidates that are using these new tools to gain an advantage in political campaigns."

        "Is it going to be very important for him to have not only this breadth of donors that Walter was just talking about, but also high-profile figures?",
        "I think so, but I think that what Walter and Julianne have both had said is absolutely correct.",
        "The Obama movement is an insurgency.",
        "If you look at the numbers as my colleagues just said - 100,000 donors.",

        "And last year, Cotton was sentenced to seven years in youth prison for pushing a hall monitor.",
        "And when Cheryl spoke with Shaquanda's mother, Creola Cotton, Ms. Cotton said children of color are held to a different standard in our schools.",

        "And the white kids can do things and are not written up.",
        "But any little thing that our children do, as far as roaming their eyes or anything like that, they're written up and sent to alternative school for it.",
        "Now, Walter, do you believe that Ms. Cotton is right, that there's a higher burden on black students and students of color for behavior?",
        "Oh, absolutely so.",
        "I mean, your first segment talked about human rights issues, and I think this is one of them.",
        "You know, black children get targeted because they have attitude problems, when oftentimes white teenagers in particular just acting out."
