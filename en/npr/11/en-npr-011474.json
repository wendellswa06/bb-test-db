        "Now, from what I've heard, she was not John McCain's first choice.",
        "His first choice was either Joe Lieberman or Tom Ridge, but both are pro-choice, and that wouldn't have gone over well.",
        "He had been clearly contradicted on this by some of the elements in his campaign and people telling him, if you do that, if you pick someone who is pro-choice, you will lose the enthusiasm of the convention because so many of the people here at the convention are very strong social conservatives and beyond that.",
        "And, more importantly, you'll lose their enthusiastic participation this fall and in the November vote.",

        "What might change the court's mind to make that happen?",
