        "I think for a lot of us, we are expecting to hear the same rhetoric, we're expecting the same church visits, we're expecting that same type of persona, and these are very different type of candidates.",
        "He shied away from talking about new black politics, but in effect he is part of that.",

        "So pick up, please, if you will, on what you think about blacks being viable candidates for statewide office.",
        "Well, as far as I'm concerned, what's interesting here is that we see that there may not necessarily be the tough problem of appealing to both white and black voters at the same time because it's getting to the point that issues that should be most of interest to black voters are ones that are going to be of interest to a whole lot of other people, too.",
        "So you can talk about white voters, but you can also talk about Latino voters and, in general, immigrant voters who are starting out at the bottom of the ladder.",

        "So I think what we're seeing is that somebody who's a viable candidate for governor and is also black American is often someone who we wouldn't necessarily recognize as uniquely black-concerned civil rights crusader.",
        "Often, it's somebody who's just a committed generalist, and that's what I think we see in Patrick.",
        "And I think we also see that in somebody like Michael Steele, despite the fact that he has the standout trait of being a Republican.",
        "These people are new era black people rather than the sorts of people who were most effective and necessary 40, 30 and even 20 years ago.",
        "Eric Deggans, here's what doesn't change in that equation, and that's the voter who has to actually cast the vote on the ballot, the idea that there are still a lot of whites in today's society who will not, for the sheer fact that it's a black face, pull that lever.",

        "He's not an elected official, let's put it that way.",
        "yeah.",
        "...yet, but he's adept at politics and he has wide support amongst Americans.",
        "What I would say is that when you look at the Barack Obamas or the Herold Fords, what you see is a black politician that has figured out how to craft a message that speaks beyond black people without making black people feel like they've been left behind.",
        "And I think that is the key, to craft a message that white voters or Latino voters that resonates with them but while also presenting a vision that doesn't turn its back on civil rights gains and other things that are important to black constituents as well.",

        "He's been to Africa and volunteered his time.",
        "He has sort of that sense that he is still grounded in things that are important to black people, but he also knows the whiter world and can speak to issues that are of interest beyond black communities.",
        "And that's the kind of politician I think we're starting to see emerge, and that's the problem that some black Republicans have--is that they don't necessarily have that trust from the black community.",
        "Yvonne, let me ask you this before we move on.",
        "What I found most interesting in the conversation with Mr. Patrick was the idea that he said, and you won't always here this from a politician, that he understands why black America checks out of civic life, if you will, and he understands that it has not always reciprocated in kind to black America.",
        "Yeah, I think that was an interesting and relevant point: that people don't just not vote or not get engaged into the political process because they're not interested; they don't see where there's a benefit to them becoming involved.",
        "So I think it was very important that he put that on the table in the forefront.",
        "I think it's also important to talk about crafting a message that will resonate with all type of voters.",
        "But I think we need to not be naive, that within the black community there are still people who will get out and say that you are not black enough because your bonafides are not the traditional civil rights type of credentials.",
        "So although that voice is waning, we have to be cognizant that it still exists...",
        "So to a great degree Harvard will trump the idea that he was born on the South Side of Chicago?"
