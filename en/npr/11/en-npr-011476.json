        "Yeah, please.",

        "You could also say that what the...",
        "...is what Deval Patrick suggested, and I'll lay this to rest and move on to the next topic, but I think the bulk of the African-American community or at least a great deal of it has checked out what he called the, you know, civic life by virtue of the fact that they don't believe either one of the parties has any real interest in making things better for the bulk of African-Americans in this country.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to move on to President Bush.",

        "Certainly some of it was not accurate, but I think he did get other intelligence he decided he did not want to follow.",

        "Yeah, that's right.",

        "As far as the illegal immigrants we have here, the plan to give them kind of guest passes may seem kind of dicey, but it's probably a good idea because we've seen in study after study that people who are illegal and living below the radar screen with bad health care have a way of spawning young people who join gangs and do bad things and especially because there are so many Latino immigrants in California, that's a problem given the kind of atmosphere that was encouraged by civil rights heroes such as Stanley \"\"Tookie\"\" Williams, etc.",
