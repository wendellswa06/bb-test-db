        "They have Barack Obama's field operation there.",
        "Remember, he won this state in 2008.",

        "A lot of his supporters are young.",
        "They're college-age.",
        "The problem with them is that they're all concentrated in a few different places.",
        "He's winning more than a quarter of his vote right now in three counties.",
        "They're actually encouraging a lot of these kids to go back home so that they can filter out the vote in the rest of the state because the way delegates are picked, they need a little bit more of these kids to go back to other places.",
        "Otherwise, Hillary Clinton could wind up winning in rural counties and wind up beating Bernie Sanders, even though he might have a lot of vote concentrated in those cities.",
        "All this concentration on Iowa - and I don't regret a moment on it...",

        "Yeah, maybe even before that, right?",
        "I mean, it's more like the scorecard at the beginning of the game and filling out the lineups or something because, like I said, there's a very small slice of delegates here at stake.",
        "This is not going to be determinative if you're just looking at the numbers.",
        "But what often happens is the people who don't perform well in Iowa or New Hampshire wind up having a very difficult time later on.",
        "In fact, we've only had one person win who hasn't won either Iowa or New Hampshire in the last 40 years on the Republican or Democratic side, and that was Bill Clinton.",

        "And yet Baby Einstein and other similar videos mesmerize babies.",

        "How did you conduct your research?",
        "What we did was a survey of 1,000 parents of children under the age of two years in the states of Washington and Minnesota.",
        "And we asked them how their children spend the typical day.",
        "Specifically, we asked them how often and for how long they watch such videos as Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby.",
        "We also asked them how often they read to their child, sing to their child, and play games with their child.",
        "And what did you find?",
        "What we found was after adjusting for a variety of factors, that for children eight to 16 months of age, the more time they spend watching such baby DVDs, the lower or the slower their language acquisition was.",
        "In other words, quite the opposite of what these videos claim.",
        "They claim both implicitly and explicitly to promote language development and cognitive development.",
        "And in fact we found the opposite.",
        "But these are parents reporting their children's vocabulary levels.",
        "So does that call into question the accuracy of the findings at all?"

        "Well, actually, parents are the best judges of what words their children actually know.",
        "And for very young infants, many of the children's pronunciations are not recognizable to anyone but their parents.",
        "So do you have a hypothesis as to why?",
        "Is it just that these kids are just spending more time not speaking or not being spoken to, and that's what's causing the delay?",
        "I think that's exactly what's going on.",
        "We certainly need to do more research, but the prevailing wisdom amongst developmental psychologists and pediatricians is that children acquire language early in life through direct interactions with parents.",
        "Even videotapes of native speakers of languages fail to teach children as well as live speakers do.",
        "And in the case of these videos, as you've said at your opening, there isn't even the attempt of the naturalistic dialogue that children desperately need.",
        "And when you consider that in our study, children who are watching these videos, spent between an hour and two hours a day doing so, you realize that they're spending about 10 to 20 percent of their waking hours watching TV.",
        "And you can't help but wonder what are they not doing that they otherwise would be doing during that time?",
        "And is this irrevocable; in other words, can the babies make up their delay in language acquisition?",
        "Well, actually, it appears that they might, in fact, because what we did find in the same study was that the older kids did not have the same language deficit that the younger ones do.",
        "So it is in fact possible that they do make up that deficit.",

        "And I think people, as they get older, really get this format, because there's less talk and they gel with the music.",
