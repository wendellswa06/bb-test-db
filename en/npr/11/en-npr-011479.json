        "Oh, there's no question.",
        "I mean, that's down everybody's mind and, of course, John McCain was excited about the fact that the first subject extensively was going to be foreign policy but there's no way they cannot talk about the economy.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "Well, exactly, except for Treasury Secretary Paulson and Fed Chairman Bernanke.",
        "You know, a lot of people don't like it, even conservative Republicans feel it's a costly bailout.",
        "Democrats said that they've been - this is the problem with Bush deregulation all these years , it's been Wall Street run amuck.",
        "So both the conservatives and the liberals seem to be one mind on this.",
        "However, I think there is a general feeling that something has to be done, I don't know if it has to be done by Friday as Secretary Paulson suggested.",
        "But there was a sense that it has to be done.",
        "Look, remember, Election Day is less than six weeks away.",
        "A lot of it is posturing hope but a lot of the outrage is real because they're hearing from constituents back home.",
        "Yeah, I've been wondering what they must be hearing from people because they're expressing such outrage.",
        "They must be getting - their phones must be ringing off the hook.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, because problem is for the longest time, Paulson and the administration had been saying that the markets are fine.",
        "That they're - whatever needs to be done, the markets will do because that's the way things are get done here.",
        "And so there were a lot of warning signs over the years, members of both parties did mention some warning signs.",
        "But again, everything was fine, you know, it was almost like it suddenly occurred to them that there were in this major crisis, with the easy ability to get loans, and the house foreclosures and all those thing that just seem to be adding up.",
        "So it really shouldn't have come as a shock, but it has and it's a major shock because this would be the biggest economic bailout in history.",
        "And you mentioned how quickly this needed to be done.",
        "That's one of the things Democrats are raising - this whole question of speed.",
        "They're being told it has to be done now, you've got to get it done now.",
        "And they're saying - this is reminding them of the time before the Iraq War, when the administration was also saying something has to be done.",
        "And issuing dire warnings so we can have a - a boy who cried wolf kind of situation.",
        "Cry wolf, right, exactly.",
        "And obviously, you know, had - this is same thing with the Patriot Act, with the Iraqi war that, you know, trust me.",
        "It needs to be done, and of course, some members went on against their own private wishes and private beliefs.",
        "But they felt that, you know, if the administration said that it was, must do, than they went along with it.",
        "And so they are obviously more leery, again, with constituents back home complaining about the size of it.",
        "Now we were saying that - earlier I was saying that, you know, there's this bipartisan agreement on the fact that they don't like this proposal.",
        "And they're also seems to be some Democratic or Republican agreement on some areas and how it should be changed.",
        "For instance, they're both saying that this whole idea of compensation packages for executives.",
        "The golden parachutes.",
        "Yeah, they're both opposed to that now.",
        "And the administration has been pushing that."

        "Right exactly.",
        "And also Barack Obama said this week and I think John McCain agrees too, that if this bailout is a success and there's some money coming back, then the taxpayers who are fronting the $700 billion should be compensated in some fashion.",
        "Yeah, so how is this going to play out for the Republicans, this has put the Republicans in a kind of tough position politically at this point.",
        "If the Bush administration is pushing something that's very unpopular with the people and that the Republicans now are joining Democrats in opposing.",
        "I'm not sure if everybody understands exactly what's at stake here and what the enormity of it is.",
        "But they do know that there is apprehension about the economy.",
        "And whenever you have apprehension about economy, the in-party in power, and that's the Republicans having control of the White House the past eight years, are the ones who pay for it.",
        "Now we can talk about polls in a bit, but there was a Washington Post poll that just a few weeks ago, had John McCain up by two points over Barack Obama.",
        "Now has Obama up in this morning's paper up by nine points.",
        "Obviously it's about the economy, stupid, I usually call Neal Conan stupid.",
        "I can call you stupid.",
        "But I've been - that was the old James Carvel maxim and it comes to true, and it comes to fruition here.",
        "The Iraq war, only nine percent of the people see that as a top issue, 50 percent say its the economy.",
        "And again, if usually when the economy is bad as we saw in 1992 when the first President Bush was defeated.",
        "In 1980 when President Carter was defeated, it was mostly the economy and was driven by the economy.",
        "And that could be the same thing this time, too.",
        "We're talking with Political Junkie Ken Rudin about the politics of the bailout proposal, and the new polls out on the presidential election, how the economy is affecting that.",
        "If you like to join us, the number is 989-8255 - 800-989-8255.",

        "How are you?",
        "Good.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "All right.",
        "That was in reference to Jimmy Carter who referenced the conversation he had at leave over breakfast with his daughter Amy.",
        "This was a bit easy, Steve is exactly right.",
        "This was an amazing thing at the 1980 debate, President Carter was asked about nuclear proliferation.",
        "And he said, well, I just had a conversation with my daughter Amy.",
        "I think she was maybe nine years old at that time.",
        "And we talked about the danger, and people - it was ridiculed for the longest time.",
        "So Troy Aikman, a few days later, said, you know, just talking about it because his daughter's is named Amy.",
        "Then the bomb he was talking about was, of course, the quarterback throwing the wrong ball.",
        "But so it mocked, but exactly right.",
        "It was a line by Jimmy Carter.",
        "Again, it's the kind of line that you hear in a debate, that you think it's just a throwaway but somehow comes back to bite you.",
        "All right, Steve you've won.",
        "What does he win, Ken.",

        "The - a lot of the excitement about her seems to have dissipated.",

        "Doesn't it?",
        "It does.",
        "And remember and we said this over and over again, this is not a national election, this is a 50 state plus the District of Columbia, 51 individual elections that had come out, and whoever gets 270 electoral votes wins - it's what Steve won in that trivia question because they're going to win a mess certainly with this problem.",
        "But again - so in states like Ohio which no Republicans ever been elected without it's - is basically tied.",

        "Virginia which hasn't voted for Democrats since 1964 is tied.",

        "Republicans are nervous about Colorado, Virginia, Ohio, even Florida has become close.",
        "So even though, you know, we see Barack Obama moving in to this sizable national lead, of course other national polls don't have it that widespread of a lead.",
        "In the states that matter in the 14 or 15 states that will determine the next president, it's very very close.",

        "Big mistake for Jimmy Carter, because obviously, if he suffered a defeat he'd had very little time to rebound.",

        "When it comes down to election day, will one issue take prominence over the other or not?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "But actually, the supposition of your question is not exactly right because as Barack Obama has taken the lead, at least in The Washington Post poll this morning, John McCain's advantage in national security and foreign policy also dissipated as well.",
        "Which is very interesting if - a lot of people felt that John McCain didn't know that much about the economy.",
        "But when he gets a boost coming out of the Republican convention with Sarah Palin, suddenly voters trusted him more with the economy.",
        "So it seems like as one candidate moves up, all the issues go with that candidate as well.",
        "So ultimately, I do think it would be about the economy but his early lead about foreign policy and national security which he hoped to show that he's a stronger candidate than Barack Obama, that has lessened as well.",
        "To get back to the bailout plan for just a second and the sort of the politics of that, one of the thing I want to ask you about that was the fact that the Democrats are saying - they're working on this but they're saying we're not going to pass any proposal here no matter how we change it unless we really have Republican support.",
        "House speaker Nancy Pelosi said it's their bill, it's their problem.",
        "So is this becoming a political football and is that good for the country?",
        "RUDIN: Well, I think Pelosi's comment was probably unfortunate but there is a truth to it that the Democrats know that if they feel that this a problem that the Bush administration ignored for eight years and this is a problem of Wall Street then there's no reason why the Democrats should put themselves and their political careers on the line by bailing out Wall Street, you know having this bailout for the economy while the Republicans sit home and vote against it.",
        "So, obviously the Democrats are going to say, for us to come on board this we're going to have sizable Republicans as well.",
        "And I suspect that, again, even though there are lot of objections, a lot of conservatives, there was one congressman from Texas said look, you know, God created the earth in seven days, we don't have to create this bailout in seven days as well."
