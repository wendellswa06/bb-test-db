        "Right.",
        "But ultimately, I think they're going to come on board.",
        "Now, we should mention of course that President Bush is planning to address the nation on this issue tonight.",
        "Yes.",
        "And of course he's going to use his powers of persuasion.",
        "But again, you know he has very low 20s, in the mid 20s or low 30s in popularity and approval ratings.",
        "He doesn't have the strength that he had, certainly coming out of 9/11 when he can address the country and everybody would unite behind what he has to say.",
        "I think there are a lot of people who are looking at the whole thing as politics and perhaps it's Bush's fault.",
        "So, it'll be very interesting if he changes the dynamic after tonight's speech but I suspect he will not.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take a call.",
        "We're going to take a call from Ed and he's calling from Toms River, New Jersey.",
        "Hi, Ed.",
        "Hi.",
        "I just like to - say thank you for taking my call.",
        "I'd like to say that I was undecided and I've changed to vote for Obama because I feel that McCain was out of touch when he said that the economy was fundamentally sound.",
        "It seemed like he was on board with the administration and really deceiving us about how the economy was.",
        "And also, I feel that his choice of Sarah Palin is irresponsible because I don't think that she's in touch with the economy, the national economy, especially since the economy in Alaska is so different than the rest of the nation.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that very first remark that John McCain made really had an effect on you, then?",
        "Yes.",
        "And it's not just that one remark, he's been saying all along that the Democrats have been pessimistic and he's optimistic about America and the economy and the way it's going.",
        "So I feel like it's been a lot of deception and I don't feel good about giving $700 billion to be managed by a guy who used to be the CEO of Goldman Sachs, it's seems like there's conflict of interest there.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for calling.",
        "Thank you."

        "There's someone who's - I guess, who's mind has been changed, no?",
        "Right.",
        "But I mean well, in fairness to John McCain, what he was saying when he said the economy is fundamentally sound.",
        "I think he was just saying that he is optimistic about the American spirit and things like that.",
        "It's almost like when we could talk about debate...",
        "But that comment has obviously had some effect on - it goes...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It goes to what the whole point of what's going on in this campaign is, you only need 10 seconds of the right or the wrong soundbites...",
        "Absolutely, Al Gore's sighed during the 2000 debate and that suddenly changed everything.",
        "So obviously, what he meant to say, what he, you know, Gerald Ford, when he talked about that the Eastern Europe is not under Soviet domination, he meant that the good people of Eastern Europe never feel that they're under that domination but it was seen as a gaff.",
        "And again, what you mean to say and what is interpreted, that's two different things.",
        "You're getting ahead of us because I think we're going to hear some of those...",
        "OK.",
        "I can wait.",
        "I was actually putting some tapes.. But before we get to that, I just want to read couple of emails we got and this is from Ben from Indiana.",
        "And he says, it seems that deregulation in the investment industry and mortgage industry, in particular, have been the chief factors creating this $700 billion dollar mess.",
        "Could your guest comment on the voting records of the presidential contenders with regard to whether they generally favored regulation or deregulation.",
        "Well, look John McCain has always proud - and proudly said that he is a deregulator at heart and he knows that a lot of people now with John - Barack Obama doesn't have the kind of lengthy record in the Senate, having been there only four years.",
        "But in fairness you know, I mean Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden voted for the war and supported the war for a long time until that became - until the situation there changed.",
        "Some people would say that John McCain is a flip flop or he's taking advantage of the situation but as a politician, one adapts to the situation.",
        "And to continue to say that you're a deregulator, obviously hurts your cause.",
        "So he said that, you know, he wants more, he's talking about greed on Wall Street, he - more federal controls of the Fannies and Freddies of the world but he's a record - his record - McCain's record is always been that of a deregulator."

        "They may not sit on the committee but they could be conferring with their colleagues and staffs and be ready when it comes time to vote.",
        "Well, the Republicans did criticize Barack Obama on Sunday night, again, why is this crisis going on.",
        "He had a multi-million dollar fundraiser in Beverly Hills.",
        "On Monday, he had one in Chicago that raised him several million dollars.",
        "And, of course, Barack Obama, unlike John McCain is taking federal money, Barack Obama needs to raise money.",
        "But the Republicans, they're trying to point out that if anybody is out of touch and elitist, it's Barack Obama and not John McCain who's raising money with Hollywood, you know, elitists while the country is suffering.",

        "Hi, Nathan.",
        "Well, as we said, the candidates are likely going to find a way to address the economy in Friday night's debate, even though the focus is on foreign policy.",
        "So we want to spend the rest of the hour talking about the upcoming debates.",
        "And joining us now is former CNN news anchor Bernard Shaw.",
        "So good to have you with us.",
        "Good to be here.",
        "And he moderated a memorable presidential debate between George Bush Senior and Michael Dukakis in 1988.",
        "And you've been listening to this discussion so far, Bernard and I just wanted to hear what you have to think about this whole issue of the economy and how you think it might affect the debate that's coming up.",
        "Like we said, it's supposed to be on foreign policy but I guess a moderator has to think pretty quickly as well as the candidates and switch once at a huge news story is going on.",
        "I think the economy is the entree in this campaign.",
        "And even though Jim Lehrer would be moderating at Ole Miss on Friday with the primary subject being foreign policy, it's inevitable that the economy will come into play.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So they're intertwined - so the issues are intertwined and apart from even just talking about the bailout plan, it would come up in any general discussion, you're saying.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "How does a moderator prepare for a debate?",
        "I mean, how you go about thinking about the questions you're going to ask the presidential candidates?",
        "Do you work with a team of people, did you work for the team of people at CNN to come up with the questions?",
        "Tell us a little about what goes on as you're getting ready for the debate?",
        "I should tell you, I believe being invited or being ask to be a moderator of a presidential debate is the highest honor that a journalist can receive.",
        "The commission on presidential debates has chosen four of the very best of the best when it comes to moderators, Jim Lehrer, Gwen Ifill, Bob Schieffer and Tom Brokaw.",
        "No, I didn't have a staff of people assisting me.",
        "You actually have been preparing for the debate going back to the snows of New Hampshire and Iowa, you've covered the primaries, you've covered the caucuses, you've covered the early part of the campaign, you've covered the conventions, you've interviewed these candidates several times, as have your colleagues and then you go into the general campaign and then you get to presidential debates.",
        "So, you pretty much know what the issues are.",
        "At the driving force, believe it or not behind each question virtually, is what's on the mind of the American voter.",
        "They direct the issues.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And if you are a journalist who has been covering the campaign right from the beginning.",
        "You've probably heard the candidates make their speeches several times, you've probably heard the same answers many times.",
        "Oh, until your eyes glaze over.",

        "Are you hoping that maybe you're going to get them to say something different in the debate?"

        "You're probing and you spend countless hours working on questions.",
        "I was up until two, three, four in the morning in a run-up to the debate.",
        "Under the rules negotiated by the Bush and Dukakis campaigns, their lawyers, the moderator in that debate could only ask one question.",
        "So I was under a lot of constraint and pressure to come up with a question that was relevant to issues in the campaign.",
        "Both of Vice President Bush, the question to him dealt with the qualifications of Jay Danforth Quayle, the Senator from Indiana.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And the question to Governor Dukakis dealt with capital punishment.",
        "Right.",

        "This is the second debate between George Bush Senior and Michael Dukakis in 1988, it was 20 years ago and you asked this question.",
        "Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?",
        "No, I don't, Bernard and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.",
        "I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.",
        "We've done so in my own state and it's one of the reasons why we have had the biggest drop in crime of any industrial state in America while we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in America.",
        "What were you going for then?",
        "Mr. SHAW: Oh, man.",
        "You're vibrating in your chair here.",
        "No, what's amazing about that thing is that I mean, I love pretty answer but of course, obviously you wanted passion, you wanted anger, you wanted Dukakis to say the thing that Jesse Jackson said about Obama about ripping out somebody's private parts.",
        "He just wanted him to show the emotion because the problem with Michael Dukakis was always, he was Zorba the clerk.",
        "I mean he was never that exciting kind of guy, and I think Bernard Shaw gave him an absolute opportunity to express that emotion.",
        "Well, I - in formulating that question, I spent two and a half days working on that question.",
        "I was concerned and I talk to myself a lot when I am working on questions for a debate and I said to myself, Bernie, if you ask Dukakis this question, if he hits it out of the park, you'll be accused of having subtly, if not overtly, helped the Democratic presidential candidate, and I should tell you and I'm neither Democrat nor Republican.",
        "If he does not hit it out of the park , then you'll be accused of helping the Republican candidate.",
        "And about 4 o'clock in the morning, the morning of the day of the debate, I just - very tired, said to myself, you are a reporter, you are a journalist, do your job, don't concern yourself whether people like or dislike your question.",
        "If this, in your judgment is an honest and a fair question, ask it.",
        "And that's how I resolved the conflict in my mind."
