        "Capital punishment, major sure in the campaign, all our polling showed that the people did not doubt his competency as an executive, but they didn't feel anything.",
        "Voters like to feel that the president is one of their guys and George Bush twice in that campaign called him the Ice Man, you might remember.",
        "And he had an opportunity but he flubbed it.",
        "I was criticized by Dukakis and his wife initially but later, subsequently, in years gone by, they say it was a fair question.",
        "In fact, when he walked off the stage of Pauley Pavilion after the debate, his campaign manager John Sasso was in the wings and he said to him, I can't use the word on the air but he said, John, I blanked up.",

        "Lynn, could we have the audience guess what the word was?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SHAW: Well, you know , I should tell you for junkies who think back to 1988, 14 days after that debate, the Dukakis people realized that their candidate blew it on that stage.",
        "In the green room, his campaign staff, they were just mortified at his response.",
        "We got a call at CNN headquarters.",
        "Dukakis wants to be interviewed by Bernard Shaw.",
        "I flew up to Youngstown, Ohio to the Airport Manager's Office.",
        "In this office sat Dukakis and John Sasso, his campaign manager.",
        "I asked him a question related to campaign issue that day, I think Vice President Bush was claiming to have smoked out Dukakis having smoked him out of a Liberal closet.",
        "And I said, Governor, the Vice President says he smoked you out of a Liberal closet,.",
        "Is that true?",
        "He said, first of all, Bernard I've been thinking about the question you asked me in that debate, and he launched into a rephrased answer that saying he would have that emotion but you can not deal in vengeance and Sasso, his manager, was kneeling off camera, cheering him on quietly with the answer.",
        "It was an effort to cast himself as having the emotions of the average voter.",
        "All right.",

        "And I just wanted to ask if knowing how the question has been scrutinized over the past 20 years if you would have asked it in quite the same fashion or if you might not have referenced the candidate's wife."
