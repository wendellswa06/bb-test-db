        "Right.",
        "He said, so you don't really feel this.",
        "I mean, it's exactly what you're saying.",
        "And of course, Ford said that in their heart of hearts, they don't believe it, but it was just an amazing moment that really could have held - probably one of reasons why Ford lost the election.",
        "And I think the questioner was Max Frankel of the New York Times.",
        "And Ford's staff, his key people, they tried to talked him into correcting that.",
        "And Ford resisted that initially.",
        "And a couple of days later, he came out and said, of course, I didn't mean that they're not dominated.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And again, that just illustrates you know, how one moment in a debate can really, can really turn the entire election.",
        "And it doesn't even have to be sort of a gaff like that when George Bush looked at his watch in 1992, when Al Gore sighed in 2000.",
        "Geraldine Ferraro had a very effective debate against George Bush in the vice presidential debate in '84.",
        "But the fact that she never looked up, she keep looking down on her lectern and writing notes.",
        "And people - and Richard Nixon's make up in 1960 was not as good as John Kennedy's.",
        "It's superficial, it's silly but with millions of people viewing it that way, it's amazing how elections can turn out.",
        "And strategically, that's one of the reason's why lawyers drown in minutiae.",
        "They ran up to a debate.",
        "One of the ironclad rules is that there will not be any cutaways of the opposing candidate while this candidate is talking, to try to allay the possibility of someone looking at their watch or rubbing their nose or something like that.",
        "Yes, my - the question I'd like to hear answered by the candidates.",
        "I'm in the National Guard and I've been deployed to Iraq twice.",

        "I don't think packing up and leaving is the right answer.",
        "But I don't think doing what we've doing is the right answer either.",
        "And there's a lot in Afghanistan that needs to be corrected as well.",
        "And I just think there's a lot of intertwining between the economy, the environment and what's going on in the war that I haven't heard anyone really give me good answers to what they plan to do to make those things work together.",
        "I think that's what Bernard was saying when he first - he was talking about the fact that so many of these issues are entwined.",

        "It's inevitable.",
        "We overthrew a government, ran down the dictating president of that country, Saddam Hussein.",
        "Initially, we destroyed the infrastructure, law and order by abandoning or disbanding the army, the police forces.",
        "We're mired down now.",
        "The government says we're making progress, and you've got three factions in that country that need assistance.",
        "We have to stay in for a long time.",
        "That's why people in Washington say, we're going to be in Iraq for a very, very long time to help the Iraqis get back on their feet.",
        "I think the question was, if Iraq were raped and murdered, what would the U.S.",

        "But you also, again, - as Bernard was saying before, the switch of the camera switching to Dan Quayle's face and the expression, it was just like the deer in the headlight.",
        "He was just so knocked over, but the point is for the longest time, Dan Quayle had been comparing his experience in Congress to that of JFK when Kennedy was elected in 1960.",
        "So Bentsen was ready with that.",
        "I mean, it was obviously a prepared thing and yet, it was just so overwhelming and yet, as bad as Dan Quayle looked and as good as Lloyd Bentsen looked, the Bush-Quayle ticket won 40 states that year.",
        "So ultimately, as we go back to the Palin versus Biden debate on October 2nd, ultimately, the - that - the VP debate may not be as important as the presidential candidate.",
