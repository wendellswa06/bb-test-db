        "He was recovering from an illness when White House counsel Alberto Gonzales showed up in his hospital room to try to get him to reauthorize a secret surveillance program.",
        "But Mueller and James Comey, who was acting attorney general at that moment, thought that one aspect of the program was illegal and should not be reauthorized.",
        "The two of them rushed to the hospital to confront Gonzales.",
        "Three years later, Mueller confirmed that he'd made common cause with Comey.",

        "Being asked to go to the hospital and be present at that time.",

        "Now 10 years later, James Comey reportedly had similar reasons for the notes that he took after private meetings with President Trump.",
        "Clearly, Comey and Mueller both share an instinct for memorialising meetings and for caution.",
        "There's no doubt that Bob Mueller and Jim Comey had a connection in their relationship together because for a number of years when Mueller was FBI Director, Jim Comey was the deputy attorney general.",
