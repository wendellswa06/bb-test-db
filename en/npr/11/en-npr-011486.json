        "And in the 11 business days after Schumer expressed his concern, there was a run on the bank.",
        "Depositors withdrew more than 1.3 billion dollars.",
        "And Reich said that Schumer gave the bank a heart attack.",
        "Schumer shot back yesterday.",
        "He wrote an email saying if OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today.",
        "He said, instead of pointing false fingers of blame, the OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs.",
        "Are there going to be future IndyMacs?",

        "IndyMac is the largest savings and loan ever to fail.",

        "So that will happen on occasion in cases.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And, for the most part, jurors will ultimately not be swayed by such events.",
        "They do look to the judge as the person kind of in control of the courtroom, and they do follow his lead very often.",
        "But it's in my experience that only at the point in time where a judge makes comments that give the impression that the prosecutors are playing unfair or doing things under the table - and, if it ever got to that point, then that's when you really start to lose a jury as a government prosecutor.",
        "So it doesn't, in my opinion, seem to have reached that level.",
        "The government did ask the judge to explain to the jurors that he got something wrong, and, to his credit, he did give that instruction.",
        "And, in fact, when that happens, a jury can start to empathize a bit with the prosecutors and give them the benefit of the doubt.",

        "Well, of course, the biggest question that arises is always is whether the defendant is going to take the stand and testify on his own behalf.",
        "I think that is fairly unlikely in this case.",
        "There's just such a hard-written record with documents that would be very difficult for the defendant to explain away.",
        "So I don't see that happening.",
        "And so I think the case may have a couple of their investigators who may have talked to a witness or two.",

        "Well, there's either one of two things happening.",
        "And they are, either the government's hit pay dirt with Mr. Miller - and when a witness refuses to go on the grand jury, that makes prosecutors think he has a whole lot of important stuff, if he's willing to take on a contempt charge.",
        "So, in normal circumstances, if I were the prosecutor, I'd be pretty excited that I might be on to something.",
        "But, in this particular case, Mr. Miller is also backed kind of by conservative think tanks, and that's who's funding his legal defense.",
        "So Mr. Miller may be just a pawn in a bigger play here by this conservative think tank to try to challenge the Mueller prosecution or investigation as a whole, and that's why they've said that Mr. Miller wanted to plead contempt - so it could be appealed to the D.C.",
        "Circuit, which is the appellate court, and then, in fact, if they were to lose there, go to the Supreme Court.",
        "Is there any merit to this?",
        "Well, they can file that legal challenge, no question, and they have the right to appeal it.",
        "So, in my opinion, this is a very, very large uphill battle for Mr. Miller's attorneys on this particular theory.",
        "And also, the Supreme Court doesn't take a lot of cases.",
        "If Mr. Trump were to refuse a grand jury subpoena from Mr. Mueller's office, I think that would end up in the Supreme Court no doubt.",
        "Whether the Supreme Court would take something like this on or just allow the D.C.",
        "Circuit ruling to stand is something we don't know.",
        "But this may not be a case that actually reaches the Supreme Court.",
        "That was former federal prosecutor Seth Waxman, a partner at Dickinson Wright."
