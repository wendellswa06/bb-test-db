        "And is the future for nuclear power in Vermont or in Georgia?",
        "I would say it's definitely in Georgia more than Vermont.",
        "I mean, as you pointed out at the top of the show, there was a very unusual vote that took place in Vermont - and it's unusual, actually, for a state to have much say at all in whether nuclear power goes forward.",
        "Curious elk gaze down from a hill above.",
        "That's true.",
        "And I couldn't locate him, but I did find his spokesperson, a captain who was a former TV anchor in the New Orleans area, very knowledgeable guy.",
        "He hadn't actually heard the news stories, but he said, `There's just no doubt that this story is not true.",
        "There were no 22 people found.",
        "But he suggested that the person I really needed to talk to was the St. Bernard Parish fire chief.",
        "And myself and the photographer ran him down that day and the first words out of his mouth was `It's a hurricane urban myth.'",
        "And, of course, I wanted to know how it got started and he spread a map out that showed the locations of the 123 people who were found in St. Bernard Parish.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This is an exclusive of the ones that were found at the St. Rita's Nursing Home, which were all found together.",
        "But except for those, all the others were found just spread out in--you know, maybe a couple of people together.",
        "And the fire chief said that he believes that the story got started because during the height of the rescue, just after the storm surge hit a particular spot near Violet called the Jumanville Subdivision(ph), just a very affluent subdivision, one person who was rescued, a man, said he saw people tied together on a rope.",
        "And this is at a time when people are surviving by being boated really or wading in through water to the Shelmet High School(ph).",
        "I mean, there were more than 2,000 people there with little food or water.",
        "It was just a calamity of rescue operations.",
        "And there really wasn't much of a way to run down anything.",
        "So that story, at least according to the fire chief, just kind of grew and grew and the number 22 became attached to it.",
        "And I believe he said it wasn't until three or four days later, right around the 5th when the story was reported, that he was able to, with a coroner, to get to that particular subdivision and they were thwarted by this really thick mud that's all over the place down there.",
        "And they got some bulldozers or end-loaders in there to scrap that out and they found no one there.",
        "There were no dead there.",
        "And there were just--he feels that the story just grew in the height of the chaos of rescuing people and finding bodies in the parish, which was hit by several walls of water from not only breach--levees that were breached but also from storm surge from the Gulf.",
        "And as you said, I mean, you know, obviously a lot of horrible things were going on there and elsewhere, but if you think about it for a minute, how long does a rope have to be to tie 22 people together?",
        "You're right."

        "It wouldn't take much in the confusion of things for a story to grow and become 22 people on a rope, and that's exactly what happened.",
