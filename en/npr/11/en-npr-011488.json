        "Thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "I think you were listening when we listened to George Pawlaczyk's story about how one rumor from Hurricane Katrina started and got spread.",
        "Does that sound typical to you in some ways?",
        "It sounds very interesting.",
        "It sounds typical.",
        "I would diagnose that rumor as being motivated by a desire to enhance a relationship with the people that you tell it with.",
        "It sounds like a rumor that got started--it sounded like something that could be plausible and then it was said for effect.",
        "Now the people that told it told it more or less as a good story and that's how it got exaggerated.",
        "It's the line that comes after, `It's been so bad that...'",
        "Exactly.",
        "There were a lot of these stories in Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Is that to be expected in such a dramatic event?",
        "Well, I think that in hurricanes or cataclysms or catastrophes or earthquakes like this, there's always a great deal of rumors in the aftermath.",
        "There's a great deal of anxiety; there's a great deal of uncertainty, communication.",
        "Networks have broken down, people have a need to know information, and it's not there.",
        "The formal sources of information, especially in the Katrina situation, as you well know, telephone lines are out, cell phone lines were out, people were isolated.",
        "And so these rumors sort of percolated about and became much more exaggerated than they normally would in, say, other situations, which tend to produce extremely accurate rumors.",
        "But natural disaster rumors tend to be extremely inaccurate.",
        "There was a set of rumors--I've seen studies that said there were different rumors in white and black communities in New Orleans."

        "That doesn't surprise me at all.",
        "Rumors migrate about and their details change to suit the characteristics of the group within which they're migrating.",
        "So in some--in white communities, for example, a rumor about a person doing a dastardly act, the perpetrator would be black and the victim would be white.",
        "And in a black community, it would be just the reverse.",
        "Yet, there's also suggestion that in the white community, they were filling racial stereotypes in some ways.",
        "The white community was saying there were people there acting like animals and different variations of that story.",
        "The black community saying they were out to get us, blowing up the levees, allowing those people in that warehouse to drown.",
        "Yeah, and just how people tend to see things that they didn't really see.",
        "And...",
        "A lot of the things that were written down were just completely to the left of truth.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And one force, especially active in rumors that cannot be checked, as in these situations, one force that acts is that they tend to agree with these stereotypes, these well-learned, negative--mostly negative stereotypes that are resident in the people within which they circulate.",
        "And does that suggest at least part of the reason why we believe the rumors, 'cause they match our--you know, to some degree our stereotypes?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The very first reason that people will believe a rumor is because it agrees with an attitude--a stereotype is one kind of attitude or one form of attitude--and it agrees with our currently held attitude that we have.",
        "Another is that it comes from a credible spokesperson.",
        "I believe we had that kind of situation here in the Katrina rumors.",
        "And thirdly, it's heard repeatedly and there may have been instances in which it was heard repeatedly.",
        "And fourthly, it's not rebutted.",
        "People don't hear a rebuttal of any kind.",
        "Is there a distinction between what we--we're talking about rumors and urban legend?",
        "I've made a distinction between rumor and urban legend, although there are some nebulous forms.",
        "Rumor is unverified information that people circulate in order to make sense of an unclear situation or to deal with a possible threat, whereas urban legends are more like tall tales.",
        "They're longer narratives with setting, plot, climax and a denouement.",
        "And they often teach a moral to the tale, a morality tale as it were.",
        "They're interesting stories to tell around a campfire or to your office mate."

        "And then one that's very common that comes up year after year is one that says that there's a Senate bill--it even has a number attached to it--that's being looked at that would prohibit the broadcasting of Christian programs over public airwaves.",
        "And when this comes out, when this rumor starts up about every six months, people will come to church with petitions that somebody handed them at work and they'll want everybody to sign it and send it in.",
        "And pastors find themselves almost overwhelmed sometimes just trying to get people to believe the truth and not believe the myths.",
        "Nick DiFonzo, that repetitive element, that cyclical element, almost, is that a feature of some rumors?",
        "Some rumors are what we call dying rumors.",

        "And he's absolutely correct.",

        "That other rumor that he talked about, about the Federal Communications Commission or the act--supposed act by an atheist to produce a bill in Congress that would ban religious broadcasting.",
        "Both of those rumors, by the way, are absolutely false.",
        "Apparently, reportedly, there's been 20 to 30 million phone calls over the past 20 years to the FCC related to that rumor.",
        "So you might want to investigate the phone company is the origin of the rumor, since they seem to be making some money out of it.",

        "And if that's the case, if you only see it in your e-mail, there's probably a reason for that.",
        "Because you on radio and people on TV have producers; newspapers have editors.",
        "They're gatekeepers and it's hard to get rumors past all the gatekeepers.",
        "So if you're only seeing it in your e-mail, there's a reason for that.",

        "And they don't tell you to photocopy this page and mail it to people.",
        "So, you know, rumors need help because they don't have facts behind them.",

        "It'll be an e-mail--and this NutraSweet aspartame scare rumor is typical of that.",
        "It'll come and say--the e-mail will come in your inbox and say something along the lines of `I got this from my cousin and she's a nurse so she really knows what she's talking about.",
        "And they attach the credibility to someone that they know.",
        "In fact, I've talked to people and asked people, `Why do you send this to me?",
        "And they say, `Well, you know, I got it from a friend of mine and it's a very trustworthy person.",
        "And sometimes I'll try to trace back to that person and say, you know, `You sent this along and people trust you.",
        "Why do you send it?",
        "And they said, `Oh, I just thought it was interesting.",
        "And these are how these things spread.",
        "People think there's no downside, but in fact, often and sometimes there is.",
        "And one example of a downside of these scares is at the American Council on Science and Health, people know to call us if they want to find the difference between a real health threat and health hype.",
        "And we got a phone call from an elderly woman in Florida who did not use e-mail herself but her friends who sat with her at the pool did get e-mail.",
        "You know, they're e-mailing with their grandchildren.",
        "And this woman drank a lot of diet soda.",
        "And they said to her, you know, `You drink a lot of diet soda.",
        "We heard that this aspartame stuff causes multiple sclerosis,' which is completely untrue, but she heard--it's a pretty scary thing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So she decided to stop drinking her Diet Coke and she switched to regular soda, which was a problem for her because she was a diabetic.",
        "So these scares actually can have negative impacts.",
        "In addition, they distract us from, as you said, the real things that--there are lots of things we can do to protect our health, but listening to these health rumors is not one of them.",
        "Here's an e-mail we got from Jackson in Basalt, Colorado.",
        "`Who started the rumor that fluoride in drinking water is bad for people?",
        "My local community has banned the use of fluoride in drinking water.",
        "I know of several dentists who are quite happy that they have more work to do compared to communities that do have fluoride in their water.",
        "How has this been such a persistent and pernicious rumor that's even gone on to change community decisions?",
