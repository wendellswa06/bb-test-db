        "Well, that's such an important question because one of the greatest public health advances we made in the last century is adding fluoride to water.",
        "Now when you tell people, if you were to take a poll right now and say, `Would you like the government to add a chemical to the public water supply supposedly to make you healthier?",
        "most people understandably might say no. But at the levels at which the fluoride is added, it's quite beneficial to our dental health.",
        "So people hear things that the government is doing to improve your health and I could understand why they get skeptical.",
        "You know, one of the other signs of the rumors is if the e-mail says, you know--this is the corollary to the fact that the only place you see it is in e-mail.",
        "The corollary is the reason you're only seeing it here is because they don't want you to know about it, whoever `they' might be.",
        "That's been such a successful way of spreading misinformation that it's been incorporated into the title of one of the most popular selling books this year about things that they don't want you to know.",

        "Yes.",
        "Are there experiments like that that are useful, Nick DiFonzo?",
        "Well, talk about things that you really can do to improve your health--is to quit smoking or never to start.",
        "But I don't know if I would put cigarettes in that category of it just being a rumor, because there is substantiated medical literature.",
        "Now early on, there was a period of time before the medical literature that it was just a rumor, and that's the challenge we have in science, which is...",

        "And at that point, there was only rumor behind it.",
        "Now certainly, that doesn't mean to say you shouldn't listen to people who tell you to stop smoking, but the bottom line here is we have to differentiate, based on the information that we have available to us today, and make rational decisions based on the best available information.",
        "We have to come to terms with the fact that we don't always have all of the information we'd like to have, but we have to go on making sensible decisions each and every day.",

        "There are memory limits, perceptual biases that occur when one is even observing an event and then writing it down.",
        "On the other hand, I would say that, say, in a court of law or in--someone conducting a fair-minded investigation, they would collect all of those different transcripts, all of those different end reports that people wrote down, compare them all together, and they would stand a much better likelihood, since they're able to check one against the other, of sifting out a much more accurate story.",

        "It's not simply that Bob Talbert is not part of the Mafia; you can't simply issue a denial.",
        "Right.",

        "And, in fact, even in Earthwick(ph) rumor situations, if you can establish a trusted third-party, independent source that will then issue a point-by-point rebuttal of the rumor, then some of the research has shown that that's very effective in countering these rumors."
