        "Now, the administration seems to be warming quite a bit, and I think it's because there's consensus that if the nation's going to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, we're going to have to increase the amount of power coming from the nuclear side.",

        "And so they were able to use spent fission material to contain the fusion reaction.",
