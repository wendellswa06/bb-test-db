        "That's right.",
        "There are a bunch of applications already in, and it takes such a long time for an entirely new site to be approved, to go through all the steps in the process, that it just makes much more sense for companies to say look, we have space for a new reactor on this site that was built for several originally, and we only got around to building one or two.",
        "Right, that site in Georgia that we're talking about was originally licensed for - I think as many as four.",
        "They only have two.",

        "Correct.",

        "That's correct.",

        "But they would include?",
        "So first of all, you have to have a big source of water because all of the reactors currently in the United States need water to cool them.",
        "Rebecca Smith was talking about a new design that may not need water, but that's not been licensed to operate yet.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly, and so there are examples of companies that have built, you know, artificial lakes in order to create that source but predominately, you have to have either the Great Lakes - or down in the South, they have other bodies of water.",
        "Or the Atlantic Ocean, or something like that.",
        "Another factor is any kind of form of electricity, well, transmission of power is hugely inefficient.",
        "So you want to be near a source of well, a big city.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You lose power when you go through lines.",
        "So you want to make sure you're close enough to your demand source that you're as efficient as possible, but also far away enough that you don't get in the way of a city's operations.",
        "And a city, of course, is also a source of labor for building a reactor.",
        "You need, you know, on average about 2,000 people to build one, and around 500 in order to maintain your average nuclear reactor on an ongoing basis."

        "No, certainly not.",

        "I mean, is it a big employer?",
        "I would say it's a medium-size employer.",
        "I mean, it is, you know, I just mentioned the figure of 500, which is what the - sort of experts around this have told me.",

        "They're, you know, engineers, technicians.",
        "You need education.",

        "And given the applications that we've seen thus far, is this pattern likely to continue, that places previously licensed are going to be far and away the most popular?",
        "I would say so.",
        "There's still quite a bit of capacity in the applications that are in with the regulatory commission.",
        "But you know, earlier on, like, early versions of bills have put in a call for as many as 100 new plants, which is obviously unrealistic, but there is a big it's a high goal.",
        "It's a demand, it's an interest among many.",
        "Rebecca Smith, it was interesting.",
        "Some of those smaller nuclear designs that you were talking about - again they're not licensed as yet, that Babcock & Wilcox, for example, were talking about - might be designed for very industrial-centric activities, places like oil refineries, that sort of thing.",
        "Yeah, it's fascinating, or even some of the high-temperature reactors, which would not be the Babcock & Wilcox design.",
        "But they're looking at using them for more purposes.",
        "Actually, they're it's worth taking a moment just to point out the differences between now and in the past.",
        "They're looking at building reactors factory-style, using modular design so that they could be built onsite more quickly.",
        "And also, there would be more or better quality control, and using modern manufacturing methods.",
        "Another reason why they're pushing this right now is that when you're talking jobs, this is a very high-value industry, and the U.S.",
        "is seeing an area in which it might rejuvenate the manufacturing base here, and also create a very high-value product that could be exported to other countries."
