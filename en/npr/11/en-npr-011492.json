        "I live in the area of the Duane Arnold plant around here, and I'm a recent transplant from northern Illinois, where we also got our power from where we also got nuclear power, and I've been told by some of the people that live out here in Cedar Rapids that when a major storm is passing through, that sometimes it tends to weaken the storm.",
        "I haven't witnessed that myself, but that's kind of like I don't know if it's just an old wives' tale that they're saying, but...",
        "Well, it can't be a very old wives' tale because, well, it's a relatively new phenomenon.",
        "But anyway...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, but I have noticed that even though the rest of the state tends to get some very strong storms, at least this past summer, I didn't really notice a whole lot.",

        "There is a considerable softening in the level of opposition, and so if you ask a general question of the national public of building nuclear power plants now, you get almost a statistical dead heat, with favorability slightly outpacing opposition.",
        "And I've read that, in fact, if you break that down carefully on the basis of education, those more educated are more opposed.",
        "There's in fact, one of the big findings from nearly 30 years of research is that typically, social background characteristics tell you very little about what shapes people's concerns about nuclear power.",
        "So if there is a study that does that, it's either an unusual one - or the facts, I'm sure, are not very strong.",
        "Oh, so I'm incorrect in that belief.",
        "I think that's yes.",
        "So these, in other words, in terms of demographics, income levels, education...",
        "The only consistent demographic difference that we find is that women tend to be much more more opposed than men over time.",
        "And I've read - and again, correct me if I'm wrong - those who live near power plants are more in favor than those who do not.",
        "Well, I haven't seen the recent data on that.",
        "I've been reluctant I've looked, and my data's quite old.",
        "So I'm not sure about that.",
        "There was a period of time when that indeed was true, and then after Three Mile Island in 1979, that changed dramatically.",
        "However, we've now had 30 years of safe - relatively safe operations, and we're in an economic slump, and the proposed 26 nuclear plants at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at the moment, 23 of them are at existing sites."

        "So I think - at least the industry believes that local people are quite acceptable of nuclear power.",
        "And do public opinion surveys, this dead heat, suggest that people are open to persuasion one way or the other?",
        "Well, that's a difficult matter.",
        "The other thing they need to I think another key point here is let me bring this out - is one of the way of one of the challenges of assessing public opinion in nuclear power, especially at the moment, is that the framing of the survey ideas that framing of the survey questions very much shapes how people start thinking about this technology, which is complex and has a risk.",
        "How important do you think nuclear power plants will be in meeting the nation's electricity needs in the years ahead?",
        "Eighty percent of the national - American public will say that's - they're for that, and they have said that since 1989, when that question was first asked.",
        "Overall, would you favor or oppose construction of a nuclear power plant in your area as one of the ways to provide electricity to the U.S., you get a two-to-one response the other way.",
        "Sixty percent of the people say they would not be favorable toward that, while 40 percent or less would say they would.",
        "That's the so-called NIMBY response, not-in-my-backyard.",
        "At one level, yes.",
        "At another level, it's a bit more interesting than that, at least for us as social scientists.",
        "And that's because if you go back to the original data I gave you, if you ask the question about the expansion of nuclear power among several environmental proposals, the results, as I pointed out was - are nearly a statistical dead heat.",
        "Fifty percent will say yes and 46 percent, no. So it's between the local and the general, the future one.",
        "And the reason for that is from cognitive psychology, we know such things that's called availability heuristics, that things that are concrete rather than abstract are much easier to recall and therefore, tend to dominate our perceptions as we make these judgments.",
        "Another factor is that if you think about it, as you ask a question about the future nuclear power versus the generating electricity versus building plants now versus a power plant in your community, you recognize that at the same time, you're introducing risk much more closer, much more real for people...",

        "And there's so many opportunities for bugs in the design.",
        "If we're going to bring on a generation of new power plants, and we're going to have 50 to 100 of these things - I'm just guessing - coming online, I'd love to see there be a couple standard designs that are very, thoroughly vetted and well-engineered.",
        "And I'd have to say, I'd feel a lot more comfortable if that was the plan.",
        "And would you live near one?",
        "I would probably bias my decision against it, but there's a lot of factors and that's I wouldn't veto it because of that."

        "Yeah.",
        "I think we've seen - in many cases, environmental groups that have been opposed to nuclear power are now less opposed.",
        "And one of the reasons is because they see a far greater threat through climate change.",
        "So they've decided, well, maybe ultimately we'll move to some kind of an economy that's not based on any of these things we have now, but for the short run, we're going to have to have more power from the nuclear side.",
        "Also, I think that...",
        "So I think that's an interesting development.",
        "And as they look at the limitations of well, if you're going to replace 20 percent of the nation's electrical power that's coming on right now, well, obviously solar power and wind power have well, they have benefits but they also have their drawbacks, and we're a long way from generating that kind of capacity.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you know, the last caller also said he would favor standardized designs and in fact, that is exactly what is happening, is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is looking at five designs.",
        "And the idea was they would approve these things.",
        "They would thoroughly vet them - some of these, in fact, have already been built in foreign countries like France, and some are under construction in China.",
        "But the idea was that there would be standardization.",
        "In the past, almost every plant was a one of a kind, and that caused tremendous problems.",
