        "The difference between then and now is that now exists an environment in which these horrific acts - that is, bombs were sent to people - yielded two and a half or so days of people asking whether or not these were fake or not, whether or not Donald Trump was or was not to blame for them.",
        "What it suggests is we've lost our capacity to be horrified by this sort of action.",
        "We've lost our ability to say, whether they were Democrats or Republicans, we disapprove of this action profoundly.",
        "And we're going to ask, is the climate that is conducive to it something that we are in any way contributing to?",
        "For example, when someone is driving around with the van with pictures that suggest dismemberment - the pictures that show people in the crosshairs of a gun - that that was normalized enough in a community that that person thought it was acceptable to drive around with that van and then attend a rally and park that van - go to a rally where some of those sentiments within the audience were expressed on T-shirts.",
        "How have we managed to normalize that so much that, in this moment, we couldn't come together and say, whoever did this, this is highly problematic.",
        "We disapprove of it, and we are going to look at the broader culture and ask how we minimize the likelihood that it will ever happen again."
