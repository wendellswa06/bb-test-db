        "Absolutely.",
        "It runs the gamut.",
        "And Barry Scheck, let me ask you that same question from the other side, from the criminal defense attorney's point of view.",
        "Give us an illustrative example of a plea bargain.",
        "Well, it's really the contrapositive or the converse of what Laurie was talking about.",
        "Very frequently, a defendant will take a look at the evidence.",
        "It's overwhelming in some instances, or you think it's going to be very strong.",
        "And you can get a better deal then you would if you're convicted after trial, for a whole host of reasons.",
        "So you take it.",
        "On the other hand, and this is what's really troubling, is that there are lots of defendants who are facing, let's say, the death penalty, who are facing really severe mandatory minimums or really severe sanctions under the federal sentencing guidelines that will plea guilty to crimes that they didn't commit.",
        "Or that they think they didn't commit.",
        "Well, both.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, because they're - in other words, if they're facing 18 counts of - that would put them in jail for a very, very long time, they might say I really don't want to take my chances in front of a jury.",
        "Even though I think I'm innocent, I will take the lesser charge and do five to 15, or whatever it is.",
        "Right.",
        "Or even in cases where they know they're innocent and they'll take a term of the imprisonment rather than face life in prison or even the death penalty."

        "Laurie Levenson?",
        "Well, that sometimes happens, admittedly, and there should be protections against that.",
        "I would say the number one protection is that you have to have a fair prosecutor who's evaluating the case, not just taking the police's word for it and making sure you don't have an innocent person pleading guilty.",
        "And beyond that, the judge has a role, as well.",
        "At the guilty plea, the judge is supposed to find out: Is there really a factual basis, or is this based upon coercion?",
        "But - you know, I'd be the first one to agree with Barry.",
        "Have there been cases where this happened?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There have been very famous cases.",
        "The big Rampart Scandal in Los Angeles involved police officers setting up gang members, knowing that they'd end up pleading guilty because they wouldn't have a chance as a gang member going to trial.",
        "Because the deck would be stacked against them.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "So, you know, nobody, I would say, that I worked with wanted that to happen.",
        "But there is not a full-proof method because we do have these very strong sentencing laws.",
        "And sometimes we have defendants whose lawyers will sort of say I don't see anything better in it for you.",
        "But if they had a lawyer like Barry Sheck who would work harder they'd find a way to fight it at trial.",
        "And that's another flaw with the system, isn't it, Barry Sheck?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "But one of the key unaddressed problems, I think, has to do with the issue of exculpatory evidence, because it doesn't matter how good your lawyer is, if there's exculpatory evidence that's in the possession of the police or the prosecutors that's not disclosed to the defense counsel, then the defense counsel can't make an intelligent assessment of the case.",

        "... that didn't commit the crime.",
        "But I think the problem is that under the law now, number one, prosecutors are not obligated to provide exculpatory evidence to grand juries who are considering whether or not to indict a defendant.",
        "And number two, there's no real requirement at all that prosecutors disclose exculpatory evidence to defendants prior to the time they decide to plead.",
        "Laurie Levenson, is that right?",
        "I know in trial, the prosecution's required to turn that over, but not before a plea bargain?",
        "Well, ethically, I think prosecutors should.",
        "But we do have some Supreme Court law out there that sort of says there's certain exculpatory evidence you must turn over and that impeachment evidence, maybe not.",

        "In the grand jury, there is no federal law that requires the turning over of exculpatory evidence, but there is in the state side.",
        "And once again, I think good prosecutors, prosecutors who are trying to do the right thing, will turn it over.",
        "They'll turn it over all the way through sentencing.",

        "And I'm calling, basically, because I have had experience with this.",
        "I do do federal defense work, and essentially, the cases that I have done are drug conspiracies, where a mandatory minimum is at stake.",
        "I recently had a case where my client was facing life without parole.",
        "He was charged with a drug conspiracy.",
        "And we weren't certain - based upon how they prove these drug conspiracy cases, where you're extrapolating the purity of a drug based upon whom the feds had purchased it from - that he was, in fact, certainly guilty of the specific drug crime that he was charged with.",
        "However, he was looking at life without parole because of his one prior instance of being convicted of distribution for two grams of methamphetamine.",
        "But the system is so leveraged against a defendant when they're given those mandatory minimums that we had to confront that, and it was a possibility.",
        "The only way he can get below that life without parole is two ways.",
        "One is called the safety valve, where his prior criminal record was such that he qualified and he had to provide substantial assistance, or he had to provide substantial assistance, meaning rolling over on everybody he knew.",
        "Right.",
        "So my experience is that not only is it leveraged against them, but they're in fact penalized for going to trial.",
        "And in the federal system, they give less of a sentence three levels off for acceptance of responsibility, pleading guilty.",
        "And Jeff, in that case, did your client plead guilty?",
        "He did, in fact.",
        "And, you know, I mean, we were - we thought that they could probably plead - prove their case in the sense that guilt by association.",
        "I mean, if you were guilty of some distribution, you were probably guilty of all the distribution in terms of the eyes of a jury.",
        "But we weren't, you know, I mean, when you start extrapolating the purity of drugs, which is how the -the federal sentencing guidelines are structured, it's hard to know what a jury is going to think."

        "You know, I think he's going to do about five years.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "And, Laurie Levenson, that illustrates another reason why prosecutors may be interested in guilty pleas and in plea bargains and that is to get one defendant to, as he said, roll over on another - provide evidence in more cases.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "It's the squeeze play.",
        "Basically, you come down like a hammer on one defendant and he says, I'm going to plead guilty.",

        "I'll go over to your side of the ledger.",

        "It's not a really popular tactic or technique and it has its downsides.",
        "But if a defendant is really guilty, it can provide a pretty good deal.",
        "And there is yet another circumstance that you hear sometimes and that is from the families of particularly murder victims or people who've been raped or have had terrible crimes committed against them, and the prosecution reaches a plea bargain with a person responsible and they end up doing a lot less time than the victim or the families of the victims think they ought to do.",
        "And then the victims are terribly upset.",
        "And one can understand why.",
        "You know, victims in our criminal justice system don't have a whole lot of control in the system, even when we have these victims' rights initiative.",
        "All it means, frankly, are that the prosecutors are supposed to consult with the victims.",
        "The victims and their families still don't make the decision what the deal will be."
