        "This really isn't criminal.",

        "And finally when the big trial occurred, one of the people who plead guilty and made a deal with the government testified, wound up giving evidence favorable to the defense, and the defense dismissed the case against the witness and (unintelligible) who had pled guilty and everybody else.",
        "And that's one of the problems when this - in the whole area of white-collar crime where there's all this ambiguity, but these really serious draconian penalties.",
        "Serious draconian penalties and certainly, Laurie Levenson, in federal court, they are - well, they're very serious.",
        "Oh, they're very serious and I know that case very well and I agree with Barry.",
        "Yeah, there were a lot of abuses in that case by the prosecution.",
        "But on the other hand, oftentimes, even in white collar deals, you'll have somebody who made a mistake, and the question is whether you have a fair prosecutor who can tailor the plea.",
        "Not a case like Broadcom, where they were putting on the squeeze play, where they thought they knew their case, but they didn't really know it from the witnesses.",
        "And so I think that what you have to take a look at is everything in the system, including the pleas, including who's bringing the charges.",
        "The grand jury system where the grand jurors are pretty much controlled by the prosecutors, and I say that as a former prosecutor.",
