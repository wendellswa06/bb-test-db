        "In my case, they just didn't work with me and I felt I had no alternative but to do what I did.",
        "And I don't think I would've showed any remorse or, you know, anything like that, like I would've gotten myself in trouble.",
        "So it's only best I just listened to my lawyer and did what I was told.",
        "Your lawyer probably stapled your lips shut.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Not quite, but close.",
        "Laurie Levenson, what would the judge have done - been forced to do in such a circumstance?",
        "Well, the judge should've said I can't take your plea, because the judges are not supposed to be taking pleas from people who are not guilty or professing to be not guilty.",
        "But that's where some of the rub is.",
        "I mean, judges want to move their dockets as well.",
        "So everybody plays the game.",
        "They will let through somebody who pleads but is hesitant about the plea.",
        "They certainly aren't requiring people to show remorse.",
        "They'd let the lawyers speak for the client.",
        "Because if they don't, then you're going to end up with this written record that says I'm pleading guilty because I feel like I have no choice.",
        "And that's not why you're supposed to be pleading guilty.",
        "You're supposed to plead guilty because you did it, and also because you think you're getting a better deal.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Thanks very much, Brad.",
        "And have you managed to get all this behind you now?",
        "Oh, no. It was all about 15 years ago.",
        "And I actually just - yeah, it's basically behind me.",
        "I'm over it."

        "Barry Scheck, interestingly - and again, we're at a terrible disadvantage since most of our legal knowledge is derived from, you know, watching television programs, but nevertheless, when that earlier caller said that he was up for a misdemeanor and if he accepted the agreement, that eventually, after he paid off his fines, this would all be expunged off his record.",

        "and its allies to do that.",
        "And the president, in the past, has said that without a deal he would be forced to withdraw all troops, a zero option.",
        "Well, in theory it could come back to haunt him because records in theory can be expunged, but then, you know, resurrected or discovered and especially in, you know, this Internet age.",
        "No, but frankly, what he describes happens every day, in great volume, in courtrooms all across the country.",
        "And if that remedy weren't available, the system might collapse of its own weight.",
        "But, you know, one of the things that really I think people have to think more about is that we need a better system for early evaluation of cases and we should just accept the fact that so many of them are really going to be disposed of by plea bargaining.",
        "And if we had earlier discovery available to both sides and a different form of talking about resolving these cases in a way where we have good information between all the parties and maybe charging, you know, in - certain kinds of infractions or crimes that perhaps shouldn't even be crimes.",
        "National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers just put out some very good publications about creating new kinds of courts where matters can be resolved without even resorting to the criminal sanction.",

        "That's actually a good lead in to my point.",
        "I wanted to draw the caller's attention to the fact that all this plea bargaining gives prosecutors an incentive and also resources to overcharge those minor crimes that perhaps shouldn't have been charged to begin with, or also multiple counts in a particular case, knowing that the case will be plea bargained.",
        "Is that your story, Dylan?",
        "No. I do have a story specifically attached to latter example.",
        "It is - I represented a criminal defendant who was charged with a - in a minor domestic incident with battering a live-in girlfriend.",
        "He was intoxicated at the time and he was released on bail.",
        "One of the conditions of bail was that he not consume any alcohol.",
        "He was a chronic alcoholic and he continued to drink and continued to get caught drinking.",
        "He didn't commit any additional crimes other than that, but he accumulated something like 18 bail-jumping charges.",
        "He maintained he was innocent in the original domestic incident, but because of the leverage that the 18 bail-jumping charges which were unassailable - there was no doubt he had been drinking - because of the leverage of those charges, he ended up pleading in this domestic incident.",
        "He may never have actually committed a crime other than to drink alcohol, but he ended up being put on probation for three years because he was forced to do so based on this leverage that the state was able to accumulate over him.",
        "I think that if the state - if we didn't have plea bargaining, the state wouldn't have really have the resources or the incentive to charge all these charges and we could have really looked at the merits of what he did more carefully.",
        "Laurie Levenson?",
        "Oh, didn't he give the state the leverage by doing all the bail jumping?",
        "I mean, that's part of the problem there.",
        "You know, it's true, prosecutors will charge to the max knowing that there's going to be a bargaining process, kind of like when you - and I'm sorry to make the analogy -buy a car.",
        "The used car salesman is going to cite a very high price.",
        "The person coming in is coming in with a lower price.",
        "And ultimately, somehow justice will be found.",

        "And he has done a fantastic job of developing this kind of community prosecution model, where he really has the trust of the defense bar because all the information is disclosed right away and people try to evaluate the situation and solve it as a problem, rather than, you know, make it a game where, you know, create the highest charge and we'll create some conditions which only make the problem worse.",

        "And I say, well, your trial is guaranteed within 30 days, which is really quick, that's the way they try to balance it out.",

        "I can really try to advise them of the consequences of having this on their record, and sometimes they are serious felonies that are going to stick with them when they become adults, but with juveniles, they just want to go home and they will take all sorts of really bad deals (unintelligible) no other way out of custody.",

        "In violent crimes and other types of crimes, I think you're going to have, and the defense will want the adversarial process.",
