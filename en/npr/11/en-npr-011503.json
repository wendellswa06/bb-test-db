        "But this is Trump - an instance of Trump going with his gut where I think it flies in the face of virtually all economic consensus.",
        "E.J.?",
        "I think what this decision shows is that Trump is genuinely nervous about the fact that he has not delivered much of anything to those working-class swing voters who swung key states to him, including Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",
        "And so this is Trump saying to them, I'm still that guy.",
        "And I think one of the things he had in his head is this race in Pennsylvania, this special election in western...",

        "Not just a Trump district.",
        "He won it by double digits.",
        "Correct.",

        "But trade wars are a lose-lose proposition.",
        "This is what economics - basic economics teaches us.",
        "And our partners around the world and our adversaries around the world are sophisticated people.",
        "And that's why we've seen threats for retaliation against businesses based in Kentucky and Wisconsin, which happen to be states represented by Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan.",
        "There's a pressure point.",
        "OK, in our last minute we have to discuss the story that in any other presidency would be dominating all of the newspapers all of the time.",
        "And that is Stormy Daniels, aka Stephanie Clifford, the porn star who says she had an affair with the president.",

        "We're learning more.",
        "The fact that I think a lot of people would say it's baked into the cake that Trump does this sort of thing - have sex outside of marriage with porn stars - wouldn't shock the American people.",
        "But the fact that he would be willing in some way to facilitate six-figure payments to avoid this coming out - I worry about blackmail and the susceptibility of the president to blackmail on an issue that most people think he might be shameless about, but clearly he's not.",
        "Well, the question of blackmail brings up Russia, which is a whole nother issue.",
        "But, E.J., I'll give you the last word.",
        "Well, A, this does play into the fears about the Russian story.",
        "But there's also another thing about those payments, which is they could well be in violation of the campaign finance law.",
