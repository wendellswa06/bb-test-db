        "Well, the whole thing about the all-American look, I'm not sure where that came from, but as a company, Six Flags has been in business for 45 years, and one of the things that we pride ourselves in is standards.",

        "We do have standards on hair length for male employees, and the standard is that hair cannot go beyond their collar, and that's been a standard in place.",
