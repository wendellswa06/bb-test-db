        "Oh, yes.",
        "The foundation that I've launched in 2000 under my name, Vusi Mahlasela Music Development Foundation.",
        "But it's more to encourage students and musicians to start picking up folk traditional instruments like we're using the costa(ph) in Africa because during the time of apartheid our ideas were controlled quite a lot by whites.",
        "They decided what goes in what.",
        "And music (unintelligible) quality defaulted in some of the instruments.",
        "Those (unintelligible) force us to play it because they call it play unlisted because it was not tuned to the western instrument.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it was more of an insult for us.",
        "But I think it's very much important now to bring this balance.",
        "That's what I'm doing also with the foundation.",
        "And I've borrowed one of the slogans from one of my favorite African writer, (unintelligible) that Africa, teach your children ancient songs so that they should glorify the spirit of collective good.",
        "And the spirit of collective good through music has been, ubuntu, humanity and morality (unintelligible), you know, to play.",
        "But not songs that glorify money or sex.",
        "You are very concerned, it sounds like, about the young people of Africa, that they understand their traditions and their history.",
        "Very much so.",
        "But it's quite a challenge because, I mean, you can say, OK, here is an indigenous world-time instrument.",
        "You must learn to play it on there.",
        "They're like, no, I want to play guitar or keyboard.",
        "Why will I have to play something with just one string on it?",
        "So you have to build an interest, you know, tell them the history about the instrument and everything and that will generate more interest for them to play.",

        "...and that's the conference at which she was speaking - by putting her on the platform two years in a row, in which she has said things that are just plain offensive, says things about conservatives that A) shouldn't be said, and B) are not in fact accurate.",
        "Hm-hmm.",
        "And presumably she's invited back to these conferences because she sells tickets.",
        "That's our assumption.",
        "We made a point last year of making a strong statement that we thought they shouldn't have her back - basically that they shouldn't.",

        "The fact that he thought it was appropriate I can only assume they thought it would help them reach out to conservatives, at which point it may mean that he doesn't understand conservatives very well because, you know, most of us don't approve of this sort of thing.",
        "And let me ask you from the other side of the political aisle, Susan Estrich - we just have a few seconds left, but if you were managing somebody - some opponent's campaign, what would you do?",
        "Well, if I were in the Republican primaries I might issue a statement just like Mitt Romney did.",
        "But I certainly wouldn't say no to her endorsement.",

        "If you're a guy like Romney who's trying to prove how conservative he is, someone like Ann Coulter still has a lot of appeal in the base."
