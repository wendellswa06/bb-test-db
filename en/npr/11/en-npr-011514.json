        "She found work at a private law firm in Washington, D.C., but was still troubled about the incident.",

        "It is not one that is preferred by supporters of legalized abortion.",
        "There are two cases scheduled for oral argument in November.",
        "What's the issue?",
        "Well, for about 30 years, the Court has said that women have a legal right to abortion, up to the time that - sort of the end of the six months of pregnancy, when the little fetus cannot live on its own - and that the government may not regulate abortion in a way that jeopardizes the life, or health of the mother.",
        "About six years ago, they had a case that made it a crime for doctors to perform the so-called partial birth abortions.",
        "These take place during the second trimester of a pregnancy.",
        "The surgery is a little more complicated then.",
        "The doctor, Leroy Carhart, he said - and some other doctors backed him up - is that he tries to remove the little fetus intact, that reduces the risk of bleeding, less chance of infection.",
        "So his view was this was the safer, better way to do some abortions.",
        "On that basis, the Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska law on a five to four vote.",
        "Sandra O'Connor was in the majority.",
        "Sandra O'Connor has now left, replaced by Sam Alito, President Bush's second nominee.",
        "And Congress has passed a federal ban - it's almost the same law.",
        "And now the question is, is the Court going to stick with the precedent in the Nebraska case, or change course and say the government can ban this type of abortions.",
        "There's been speculation… Well, first of all, there are two issues here.",
        "One is just the underlying issue itself, which is one that is so difficult for the society, and so polarizing, and emotional - it has to be said.",
        "But it's also a case where the absence of Sandra Day O'Connor could make a difference.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "One of the, I think, sort of odd things about this case is that it's really not a case about whether abortion should be done at this stage, but how they are done.",
        "You know, in other words, you hear a lot of opponents talk about saving babies and they're really talking about abortions at 16 or 18 weeks.",
        "These little babies cannot live on their own.",
        "So it's really not - I could see somebody saying you shouldn't be able to get an abortion that late.",
        "Eighteen weeks is too late.",

        "So it's a very unusual Supreme Court case, in the sense that you have a lot of medical experts testifying in trials in two cases up there.",
        "Basically, a two week trial, a back and forth testimony, and the judge concluding that yes, medical experts think that in some cases this is the better way to do these abortions - but Congress coming around and saying we find this whole thing abhorrent, and no, these abortions just simply should be not be done, and it's a crime to do them.",
        "So it's a very unusual thing of people have a great revulsion against abortion, particularly at this stage.",
        "On the other hand, it's sort of a debate between doctors about what's the better way to do them.",
        "And why then - well, so you've explained why the abortion opposition position, is that there is a sense that this is just abhorrent.",
        "So why from the abortion rights perspective is this an important case?",
        "Is there - since it really doesn't challenge the legality of abortions overall when they are most commonly performed.",
        "I think at a couple points.",
        "One is that they don't want the Court to backtrack on the notion that you can't - the government can't regulate abortion in a way that threatens the life, and or health of women.",
        "Suppose it was - suppose I had prostrate cancer and some doctor said to me, you know, you could have surgery, which is a 90 percent cure rate.",
        "Or you could have radiation, which is very good, has a 75 or 80 percent cure rate.",
        "By the way, for your listeners, I'm making up these percentages.",

        "Somebody else comes along and says no you don't really need the surgery.",
        "You could have the radiation.",
        "Well, to some degree, that's the debate here, is that these doctors are saying - and their women patients are saying -this is the better, safer way to do this particular type of abortion.",
        "The other side is saying, what's the big deal?",
        "There's another way to do these abortions.",
        "You don't really need this method.",

        "Okay, well, let's go to another case.",
        "This one, I have to say perplexed me when I first read about it.",
        "It's about the deportation of immigrants convicted of a felony.",
        "And I think the question is, are immigrants convicted of drug possession subject to deportation?",
        "The law says that immigrants who commit an aggravated felony are to be deported.",
        "And the government says that low-level drug crimes are a felony so, therefore, that illegal immigrants who commit these crimes can be deported.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, I can tell you from experience, a lot of hypotheticals change when they actually show up.",
        "But I take your point.",
        "Thank you for calling.",
        "So, what's the - it seems like a simple question of definition.",
        "If you commit a crime that's a felony, you can be deported.",
        "What's the constitutional issue that's come before the Court?",
        "Well, it is a legal dispute about what that word means.",
        "This is really the working out of a law that's 10 years old.",
        "Congress passed this illegal - it was called the Illegal Immigration Act back in ‘96, but this, I should say, this applies to all immigrants including permanent residents."

        "Because, you see, you could commit - you could be charged with possessing cocaine, like this fellow in South Dakota, and that law concludes up to five years in prison.",
        "So the federal government's point of view is that qualifies as an aggravated felony.",
        "You may think drug possession doesn't sound that serious, but it actually - you could get five years in prison under South Dakota law.",
        "And therefore, the immigration authorities say that person who committed the offense in South Dakota is now subject to automatic deportation.",
        "And this is a really strict - once it's triggered it's really strict - because you can't go to an immigration judge and say: Hey, I've lived in the country for ten years, I've got a family - doesn't matter - automatic deportation.",
