        "All right.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And I want to add that the data on this interactive is open so that anyone who wants to use this for any project that they want, can.",
        "Well the court's taking up two cases.",
        "One from Seattle, one from Louisville.",
        "Louisville's a little easier to explain.",
        "Louisville had a history of segregation.",
        "They had an integration plan - a bussing plan that ended in 2000.",
        "The school board basically said: we want to maintain integrated schools.",
        "And so they set sort of integration guidelines, that says basically, the elementary school should have at least 15 percent and no more than 50 percent black students.",
        "A white parent sued because her child was told she couldn't go to the school - he couldn't go to the school - nearest to home.",
        "And so the question is: is that unconstitutional because this child is being kept out of the school because of his race?",
        "Seattle's a little different.",
        "They have ten high schools, and you sort of pick which high school you want to go to, and sometimes they also have guidelines that try to limit the schools from being, you know - becoming nearly all black or nearly all white.",
        "And sometimes you're told you can't go to your first choice high school because it's too much this or too much that?",
        "Is race the only factor used for making those decisions where a school is oversubscribed or is it one factor?",
        "I think it's only one factor and there are a number - it's a little bit complicated, because you have a better chance of going there, for example, if your brother and sister went there.",
        "But sometimes, race can be the tiebreaker.",
        "And a group of parents sued and said you can't do this.",
        "And the Supreme Court, to some degree to our surprise, because these programs have been around for a while - magnet schools sometimes work that way; they try to integrate students at a magnet school - but soon after Sam Alito arrived, the court granted this appeal on the behalf of both parents.",
        "And so that suggests that some of them think this is wrong or unconstitutional, and of course we don't know how it's going to turn out.",
        "We're going to hear arguments from attorneys on both sides of this issue.",
        "We're going to begin first with Tom Goldstein.",
        "He's an attorney at the Washington D.C.",
        "law firm of Akin Gump.",
        "He heads up their Supreme Court practice.",
        "He's also counsel to the National School Board Association, which will be filing an amicus brief in support of the schools, and Tom Goldstein joins us from New Haven, Connecticut.",
        "Welcome.",

        "How are you?",
        "I'm very well.",

        "We try and explain how important these programs are to the educational mission of school boards.",
        "That the school boards here are trying to integrate, which is exactly what the Supreme Court told them was essential in Brown versus Board of Education - that they want their students educated in the environment in the context that they're going to grow up in their communities.",
        "And so, if we have schools that end up being all white and all black, we won't truly educate our children.",
        "Well, obviously… So, are you making the same argument that was made in the University of Michigan case; that diversity is an important educational quality, that that's important to the quality of education for students to receive, and that's why race needs to be defended?",
        "That's part of the argument.",
        "It's a very, very important part of it, and the Supreme Court agreed with that in the Michigan cases.",
        "We think that these programs are even easier to defend, because it's not as if there are a set of seats that are set aside for African American students.",
        "You may not get to go to a particular school because you're African American or because you're white, to the extent that's a factor in a particular placement decision.",
        "Because all that's at issue is diversity.",
        "It's not getting a minimum number of white seats or a minimum number of black seats.",
        "And some would argue that allowing schools to decide which students to admit, that using race as a factor at all, is discriminatory.",
        "And I think that's the administration's position, is that in a colorblind society the race should simply not be a factor in school admissions.",
        "And what is your response to that?",
        "Well that's a - certainly a good faith, well-held view by conservatives, that there's inherent discrimination and stigmatization that comes from using race in decision making.",
        "But these school boards, which really know their communities, really know how it is that their children have to be educated, have come to a conclusion that we can't have our students educated in isolation from each other, racially.",
        "Everyone has to meet people of other races; engage them day-in, day-out; learn with them; learn what their families are like.",
        "Because we can't ever hope to move into a truly integrated society if we start out as children, isolated.",
        "Let's bring a caller into the conversation.",
        "Let's go to Louisville, Kentucky and Mary.",
        "Hello.",
        "Well, I get pretty passionate about this issue.",
        "But I will say - well I can probably say a lot of things - but people have died and cried to go for us not to go back, and we are desegregated here in Louisville, and my children attend desegregated schools.",
        "I don't want to see us go back.",
        "I'm a very concerned person.",
        "Not only a concerned parent, not only am I deeply concerned, I'm going to be out here like I'm doing right now, talking to people - black, white, or other - and seeing how they feel about it.",
        "And most people in our town do not like what's getting ready to happen there with the Supreme Court.",
        "You think that the current policy's working well?",
        "The current policy is working real well.",
        "And we stand as a model here in our town for a system that has worked their best and done everything they can to keep our schools diverse.",
        "We live in a diverse world, we should have a diverse school system.",
        "This is preposterous.",
        "This don't make sense.",
        "After all the people have been through to make this whole country a more diverse country, that we would even address this issue, I'm insulted as a citizen.",

        "But I did want to ask you just briefly, why wouldn't that have been the same argument made by white parents in 1954 - which is that this is the way it is, we prefer that our schools remain segregated, and we are the local authority here, and stay out of our business.",
        "Well, it is in a real sense, the opposite argument.",
        "Because this is - we are fulfilling the most basic constitutional promise of integration and not discrimination, and that makes all the difference in the world.",

        "What's wrong with school districts trying to integrate their schools by using - considering race as a factor - in order to reflect the racial balance of the school districts on the whole?",
        "Well, I think it's important first, to make the point that there's no argument here that the school district has ever engaged in segregation.",
        "They've never actually looked at their students, categorized them by race, and then decided where they're going - segregating the blacks from the whites.",
        "So it's not a remedy for segregation.",
        "This is pure and unadulterated racial balance in order to achieve a certain amount of blacks and a certain amount of whites in each school.",
        "How did the law, previously held, that segregation does need to be intentional in order to be challenged or proactively addressed?",
        "Well, we would dispute that point.",
        "We think that all of the Supreme Court precedent, to date, has held that there is an obligation by the school districts to resolve, to remedy - segregation.",
        "Otherwise, segregation violates the equal protection clause quite clearly.",

        "And what is your answer to that question?",

        "The government should get out of the business of categorizing people by race and distributing government services to people on the basis of race.",
        "I mean it sends the most awful, I believe, message to students, to the children who are affected - that look, your race matters where you go to school."

        "But is the core of your argument that segregation must be intentional before the government can step in, can properly step in?",
        "If the government is affirmatively segregating its student body or segregating any population, then it must - it should be sued and it must remedy that segregation.",
        "If government is not at issue here, and it's mere voluntary housing patterns or choice of parents of where they want to send their kids, then the government should not step in and say, well, wait a second, we don't like these voluntary housing patterns, we don't like the choices you're making, we're going to send your kids somewhere else to satisfy a racial balance.",

        "Yes.",
        "I would like to just say that I think it's worth a little inconvenience on the parents' part, to send their kids to a different part of the school district, if it will allow kids of different races to interact with each other, and hopefully prevent passing on, you know, racist ideas from one generation to another.",
        "Because if kids are allowed to, or parents are allowed to make their kids be in different schools based on class or race, then these divisions are going to keep plaguing our society.",

        "I think Mr. Beard's point is that nobody's saying that's not nice to do.",
        "I think his argument is that it's not important enough for the government to step in to proactively ensure it if it means that you have to continue to use race as a factor.",
        "What would you say to that?",
        "Well, I think that race is still a huge factor.",
        "Because, you know, we are currently in a war, you know, no one is - lots of people think we're at war with Arabs.",
