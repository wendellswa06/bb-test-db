        "An anti-illegal immigration group called Ban Amnesty Now sent out a blast email last week asking supporters to, quote, \"\"stop illegals from stealing the election.\"\" Another group, Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, said Democrats were encouraging illegal immigrants to turn out in droves and that Tea Party and other activists had to be vigilant.",

        "And when pressed for specific cases to back up his claims, Gheen came up short.",
        "He noted reports that non-citizens' names have been found on registration rolls in a number of states.",

        "Well, we know that the Democratic Party machinery and these campaigns that go into minority neighborhoods looking for high-percentage Democratic voters have no way to determine between who is registered legally and illegally.",
