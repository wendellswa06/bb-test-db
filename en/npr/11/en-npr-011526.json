        "Parker.",
        "The Republicans had about 60 votes in the Senate, which they wish they had right now, and they had a dominant majority in the House.",
        "So it was, in that way, much more of a Republican nation in 1904 than it is now.",
        "I would agree with the characterization of the center-right.",
        "Well, talk about the difference between the party today in terms of geography and demography and what it stands for, and how that differs from the Republican Party--the turn-of-the-century party.",
