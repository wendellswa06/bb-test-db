        "And let's go back to a year ago.",
        "What was the Walter Reed scandal all about?",
        "Well, I think what angered Americans most - what we remember most of those about the stories is that injured soldiers were living, as you said, in these in a building that had all these mold and rotten - mice, cockroaches.",
        "But that was one building.",
        "It was called Building 18.",
        "I think that's worth pointing out because a lot of the other places that people live in at Walter Reed were actually fairly nice.",
        "Now, they were crowded because there were so many soldiers being treated, but, for example, the Malone House at Walter Reed is kind of like a Days Inn, like a small hotel and they got a bar in the lobby and the soldiers would in a small…",
        "Not necessarily the Ritz, but…",
        "Right, not the Ritz but, you know, not bad.",
        "And they have a room where you have two double beds and you might have your father or you mother would stay with you to help you out or maybe there'd be another soldier there.",
        "But - and these soldiers lived there with their laptop computers and their Xboxes and food and microwave ovens.",
        "And they're there for months and months.",
        "Sometimes they're there for a year.",
        "And that's the other - I think that's the other problem that The Washington Post story…"

        "Building 18 - you know, that's something you have to ask General Tucker.",
        "You know, I actually asked the Army yesterday, they weren't sure if it's closed or have been fixed up.",
        "I know they have fixed up a lot of the other buildings in military hospitals around the country.",
        "I'm not sure what happened to Building 18.",
        "Then, the other thing that you just pointed out.",
        "That interminable time, even bad conditions are tolerable there if you're only there for a little while.",
        "But nevertheless, these soldiers were there sometimes for months.",
        "Right.",
        "And that, I think, that's what the - was most valuable from The Washington Post series.",
        "It showed that there was a disability system that took way too long for these guys to get out.",
        "And before an injured soldier could leave Walter Reed or any other Army hospital, he or she needs a disability rating because that rating, depending on how high it is or how low it is, that's going to determine how much health care, how much disability pay they get when they leave.",
        "And that system is way too complex.",
        "That's what we found out.",
        "It was taking way too long to get the rating.",
        "There was concern that the rating system was seen in a low ball, the extent of the injuries.",
        "The system was seemed antagonistic as well.",
        "And amidst all of these, these very negative stories coming out of - in The Washington Post, certainly.",
        "There was a brand-new secretary of Defense just appointed.",
        "How did the Defense Department and the Army react to these reports?",

        "They changed things at Walter Reed.",
        "They brought in General Tucker.",
        "They changed things in the Army's surgeon general's office.",
        "And one thing they did - they're trying to make change.",
        "They're doing more research, for example, on the PTSD and traumatic brain injury.",
        "And the thing that maybe most visible is that they restructured the way things are set up for injured soldiers.",
        "There are 35 Army hospitals including Walter Reed, they now have things they call - a new brigades that they call Warrior Transition Units.",
        "And the idea is that these are for wounded soldiers who are getting care as outpatients.",
        "And the idea was to give them more attention and to hire extra staff to do anything that a wounded soldier or the family needed whether it was help getting through the bureaucracy or monitoring their medical care or just making sure they had the right transportation to get to a therapy appointment.",
        "But what about that other aspect, you know, again, living in those temporary, quote/unquote, \"\"facilities\"\" for months and months at a time, people got very good at playing videogames and memorizing \"\"SpongeBob SquarePants."

        "Very important.",
        "Tell us about it.",
        "Well, if you get a rating of 30 percent or more, you get access to Pentagon health care, your family is covered as well.",
        "If you get less than that, you get a severance pay and you go home.",

        "Right.",

        "Does - we're going to ask General Tucker but the does the Army have an explanation as to why you get such a different rating from the Veterans Administration than you do from the Army.",
        "Well, they look at slightly different things.",
        "The Army, the services are trying look up if somebody is fit to go back to duty.",
