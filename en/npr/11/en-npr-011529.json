        "They said that the leukemia was in remission.",

        "But Gen.",
        "Tucker, you've created - Joe Shapiro was just telling us these 35 warrior transition units - what do they replace, why are they better?",
        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",
        "TUCKER: They're replacing what was normally known as medical hold arenas which were active duty and reserve component soldiers, respectively.",
        "And so now there are Warrior Transition Units, and we took the term hold out of their title, hold means stagnant not moving.",
        "We want them in transition, moving on in life and getting better.",
        "And they're in transition because they were soldiers on the line who were deployable and now they're transitioning either back to the line - what we call return to duty - or they're going to transition to be a successful citizen of society, so they're warriors in transition in Warrior Transition Units.",
        "And about what percentage of them actually go back to active duty?",
        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",
        "TUCKER: Around 70 percent.",
        "So most of them that you see in these WTUs, as I'm sure they're called, are going back to active duty?"

        "In fact, 88 percent of that 70 percent are in their - are corporal to sergeant first class which is an important return on investment in terms of getting people back to the line that you'd have to go out and assess a staff sergeant.",
        "You can appreciate how long it takes to create or raise a staff sergeant or a sergeant first class - it takes years and years, decades.",
        "So now, we're able to return these soldiers back to the line about two brigades worth a year.",
        "And I neglected to ask you a question that came up earlier in my conversation with Joe Shapiro, and that's about the notorious or then notorious a year ago, Building 18 at Walter Reed Medical Center.",
        "Has that been fixed up, improved, closed, what's happened to it?",
        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",
        "TUCKER: Well, we've - building - we moved the soldiers out of Building 18 about - within actual days of 18th of February last year when the article came out in The Washington Post.",
        "And so what we did then was move on concentric circles across the Army to improve the facilities for all soldiers in the Army.",
        "So Building 18 is no longer being used?",
        "Okay, Joe.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",

        "As you look ahead though, a lot of the questions are about this disability rating system - I think you may have heard Joe talking about that just before you were able to join us - and the idea that you get one rating from the Army then another, sometimes much higher rating from the Veterans Administration, why the discrepancy?",
        "Brig.",
        "Gen.",
        "TUCKER: Well first of all, I'm in the business of healing soldiers not rating soldiers.",
        "That's the preponderancy of the Physical Disability Evaluation System.",
        "However, the Army by law is required to rate you for your retainability(ph) for further military service and we rate you for the single disability that is keeping you from staying in the Army, so to speak; where the VA is going to rate you for the whole person, the quality of life, so to speak.",
        "So they'll give you ratings for anything that's wrong with you, where the Army - or the services, so to speak, will only focus on that disability that is keeping you from further service.",
        "And that pilot program that Joe was talking about where the VA would do the rating by itself, how is that working out so far?",
        "Yeah, I think it's working out well.",
        "It's too early to really pass judgment on it and I know that the - Secretary Peake of the Veterans Administration's taking a very close look at the metrics they were using and is drawing a lot of attention from - for Secretary Gates as well because they want it to be a very good product when we're done."

        "We review that ratio every 90 days to ensure that it's the proper amount.",

        "We're growing at a - our numbers are growing at a rate faster than we can man the cadre, and so we're having to rely on what we call borrowed military manpower from the units out there at our camps and stations until we can get the TDAs to catch up with the population.",
