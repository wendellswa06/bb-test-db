        "We've got soldiers who were on multiple potent medications, methadone, morphine and powerful pain relievers.",

        "In addition to the risk assessment that General Tucker talked about, there's also new rules trying to prevent access to liquor by some of the soldiers who are on some of these drugs.",
        "But there have been some really pretty horrible deaths including one of a soldier at Fort Knox, Gerald Cassidy, last September.",
        "It took about three days before someone checked on him and it was like he was alive but unconscious for a few days before people at the Warrior Transition Unit - and this was in Fort Knox actually - found him.",
        "And as a result some people lost their jobs there.",
        "But so the number of suicides is up.",
        "There was a suicide attempt at Walter Reed that got some attention of a psychiatric outpatient named Elizabeth Whiteside(ph) who's an Army lieutenant that got some attention this year.",
        "And that's the problem.",
        "And there's concern about these increases of suicides or accidental suicides.",
