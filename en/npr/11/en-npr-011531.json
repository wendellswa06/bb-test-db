        "Since June - and you right, we've taken that to heart and issued some pretty draconian measures across our Warrior Transition Units so that we as military leaders should never find ourselves regretting not having taken an action that have prevented a soldier's death because any one suicide or any death is one too many.",
        "And in creating alcohol-free zones over these building facilities is one of those measures that you mentioned in addition to restricting for high-risk soldiers, narcotics risking, I mean, breaking it so that they don't get more than seven days at a time, dedicate chaplain support, requiring leadership to see them physically twice a day, assigning room mates, et cetera.",

        "And what it is, is number one, junior leaders need to be able to understand the conditions and the manifestation of these conditions as the symptomatology begins to surface itself; and then secondly, they need to understand what their responsibilities are in getting these soldiers referred to help.",
        "And that in itself has helped us an enormously with trying to get these soldiers to care because we can heal these wounds if we can get them the care.",
