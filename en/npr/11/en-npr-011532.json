        "Wow.",
        "At least several hundred fried things you could probably find at the fair.",
        "And some of them are just, you know, kind of crimes against cuisine, and some of them are really kind of, you know, fun and interesting.",
        "So I want to do the good, the bad and the ugly, so let's do the good.",
        "Like, what was awesome?",
        "Well, awesome - I mean it's kind of a binary question if you're a Minnesotan.",
        "Are you a corn dog person or are you a Pronto Pup person?",
        "These are, you know, kind of hot dogs that are speared on a stick and then dipped in either a - kind of a corn meal batter or a kind of a pancake batter, but it's kind of - one of the state fair's kind of iconic fried foods is the Pronto Pup of the corn dog.",
        "And those were good?",
        "Oh, I mean - that's how I was - I didn't have one this year, and I feel a little bit like - I feel like maybe I should go back this week just to have a corn dog.",
        "They're that good.",
        "And mini doughnuts are huge here.",
        "I mean, they kind of started at the fair in a lot of ways, and they sell about 4 million of them a year.",
        "In fact, you go to the fairgrounds, and you can kind of just smell of the grease in the air.",
        "I always feel like after I'm there for about an hour that I just - how long is it going to be before I can take a shower?",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "OK.",
        "So you mentioned that the ice cream was phenomenal.",
        "Really phenomenal.",
        "One of my favorites is a lingonberry ice cream that's made especially for the fair and sold by a small stand, which kind of speaks to the Scandinavian heritage that's kind of big here in Minnesota.",
        "The Methodists which kind of - they specialize in ham loaf which is a whole other story.",
        "They also have a partnership with a St. Paul ice cream maker named Izzy's Ice Cream.",
        "And every year, they come up with a different flavor, and it's always been a favorite of mine for maybe the past four or five years.",
        "So the bad."

        "I don't know if it's still on the fairgrounds, but I went back and looked at some past stories.",

        "Spam is very big here because, of course, Minnesota's the home of Spam.",

        "Oil prices have dropped dramatically in recent months but analyst Sandy Fielden told us that does not matter.",
        "Even at current low prices, Canadian producers will keep running the equipment they spent a lot of money to install.",
        "Once you've made the upfront investment, you're going to just keep on pulling the oil out.",
        "There's no incentive to stop unless the price gets really low - down to, you know, $30 a barrel or something like that.",
        "The only real change that's likely is that oil producers may not expand their operations in future years.",
        "A vital political question of course is what happens to oil production if the Keystone pipeline is finished?",
        "Fielden says, once again, the answer is not so much.",
        "Sending oil through the new pipeline would save producers money, but without it they will still move the oil through other pipelines or on trains.",
        "So far, they've delayed Keystone by three or four years from when it was originally supposed to be online.",
        "And yet, the industry has continued to find a way to get the oil to the market.",
        "So it's not just about the pipeline, in other words, I think it's already become clear that the fact that Keystone's been delayed does not seem to have had a significant impact on production.",
        "Because producers have developed pipeline alternatives.",
        "Many of those alternatives are building rail loading terminals to use rail to get their oil to market.",
        "Some of them involve moving crude by rail to barge locations on the Mississippi River to complete the journey by barge.",
        "And in addition to that, some of the existing pipelines have actually been expanded to accommodate increased flow.",

        "Tears are not uncommon.",
        "I do think that it can be very difficult for very strong students who have accomplished a great deal to perhaps for the first time in their life be told you're not good enough, and of course that's not the way the letter reads but that's the feeling that they get."

        "Charles's advisor, Mr. Nussbaum, says schools that have the luxury of turning down 80 to 90 percent of the people who apply are turning down more and more deserving academically qualified students.",
        "Which is why whenever a student looks at one of these what I sometimes call ridiculously selective schools, it really doesn't matter what their academic profile looks like; their chances of admission aren't that good.",
        "Getting into the best colleges is still very much about academic merit.",
        "But schools also want students with a wide range of backgrounds and non-academic experiences, which ultimately makes the admissions process a lot more subjective than it used to be.",

        "This year has been the most chaotic admission year on record."
