        "David Hawkins of the National Association for College Admissions Counseling points to a couple of factors.",
        "There are more students graduating from high school than ever before, and students are submitting more applications than ever before in a scattershot approach that Hawkins says simply doesn't work.",
        "And colleges who are standing on the other side of this divide are asking themselves, does this application look like it's coming from a student who really wants to go here or does it look like an application that came from a student who put together an assembly line of 20 or 25 applications?",
        "Hawkins's advice: narrow down your choices and tell each institution why you really want to go there.",
        "As many admission officers will tell you, that is far more important than anything like race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, geography.",
        "Any of the attributes that a student doesn't control.",
        "Getting students to take this advice, of course, is another matter.",
        "Too many kids and their parents, after all, are obsessed with elite colleges and the Ivy Leagues, says Hawkins.",
        "But with a frenzy in college admissions getting worse every year, it's going to be up to high school counselors like Mr. Nussbaum to force students to do a reality check.",
        "I'm much more focused in working with students on the right fit rather than the prestige of the school.",

        "Well, I have a foot in both camps, but I probably have seven toes in the writers camp because I see myself as a writer, and you know, whatever success I've had has come principally from my writing and, you know, was able to parlay my writing into producing.",
        "And, you know, the only - the main reason I'm a part owner of a show is because I co-created a show, and I co-create it because I was a writer.",
        "So, you know, my allegiances are definitely on the writers' side.",
        "A show like \"\"Law & Order\"\" and again, its spinoffs - but that's a show where a lot of writers have gone on to become a show runners, producer, executive producers.",

        "For a show that sticks around for a while, yes, of course.",
        "That's, you know, writers come up through the ranks.",
