        "She passed away on the show last year, and I've been a longtime supporter of an organization called Room to Read, which was founded by a former Microsoft executive, John Wood.",
        "And Room to Read has built something like 4,000 libraries in different countries, developing countries.",
        "And I thought it would be kind of a neat idea to galvanize this huge cyber community of \"\"Criminal Intent\"\" fans into donating money to build a library, which once it will be built, will have a plaque - a dedication plaque in honor of Frances Goren.",
        "And so - and, you know, by up to a limit, I've committed myself to, you know, making a dollar-for-dollar match of every donation.",
        "And so far, you know, starting one Web site and now its spread to five or six Web sites, even out to France.",
        "We've had contributions from Europe, from South Africa, Australia, Asia, South America.",
        "So - I thought it would be kind of a neat way of using the enthusiasm of the cyber fans…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…and sort of putting it all to good use.",
        "Of course, \"\"Law & Order\"\" and its various byproducts, including \"\"Criminal Intent,\"\" are seen in many of those countries.",
        "Indeed, they're produced in some of those countries.",
        "Well, in Russia and in France - one of the categories I mentioned earlier, format fees - that's when the studio sells the format of the show to Russian producers and they hire Russian actors and they shoot, you know, they basically take our scripts and shoot them in Moscow.",
        "You know, they adapt into the Russian context, and they've done the same thing in France, so…"

        "They get me-too contracts?",
        "Exactly.",

        "And so at this point, there's talk that the Directors Guild may strike a deal even, you know, six months in advance of the expiration of their contract.",
        "But, like I said, it's - a lot of ego.",
        "A lot of money is involved.",
        "You know, what's inevitable is that there is a deal that will be struck at some point and it's just the question of how much posturing will go on, you know, before…",
        "Between now and then and how much money might be lost by people on both sides if there is a strike?",
        "Well, you know, again last - this would be the third strike that I've been through.",
        "In '88, there were - there was a strike that lasted for five months.",
        "They figured there was (unintelligible) about was that the strike had cost the industry $500 million.",
        "Well, just to put that in today's context, the DVD sales for the series \"\"24\"\" amounted to $450 million.",
        "So, $500 million isn't what it used to be.",
