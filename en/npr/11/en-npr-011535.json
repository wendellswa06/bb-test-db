        "The reports are saying that as of next Monday they'll start the chief justice confirmation with John Roberts.",
        "Whether or not they can also start up a confirmation hearing for someone to fill O'Connor's slot remains to be seen.",
        "So how long would a confirmation hearing for a chief justice normally take?",
        "The president said, `I want this guy in his seat by the start of this term.",
        "Is that something that is likely to happen?",
        "It's interesting.",
        "I mean, certainly the estimates were that the confirmation hearing would have taken four, five, six days for Roberts for the associate slot, and theoretically it shouldn't take that much longer for the chief slot, but Democrats are already making noises that they're going to redouble their efforts to investigate Roberts' background, to get, for instance, those briefs from the Bush administration that they have not been able to get their hands on.",
        "In other words, they're saying, `We're going to really turn this into a fight now, where we were going to sort of let it skate before.",

        "Things are complicated, because Sandra Day O'Connor has affirmed that she'll stay on until her replacement is found.",
        "But there's this kind of confusion about her hearing arguments in cases that she then would never get to vote on.",
        "That's precisely right.",
        "The sort of sticky wicket on this is that she can hear oral argument, but her name cannot appear on an opinion unless she is sitting on the court when that opinion is handed down, and as you know, as we all know, the real biggies tend to come down in the spring, so presumably her replacement would have her seat by then.",
        "So she may be able to hear argument.",
        "It's not clear that she can vote, and certainly on the big cases that require a lot of debate and many revisions and drafts being circulated, it's quite clear that we have the possibility of a four-four split, in which case the court is probably going to have to ask that those cases be reargued.",
