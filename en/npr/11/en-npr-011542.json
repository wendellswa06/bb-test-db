        "There's that whole home theater market.",
        "Yeah, you walk around the show floor at CES, and it seems like everywhere you look is somebody touting the biggest screen in the history of mankind.",
        "And so Sharp this year showed 108-inch LCD screen, which is mind- bogglingly huge and leaves me to wonder how they even got it there without breaking it, because that's a big piece of glass to cart around.",
        "And that's cool.",
        "It's a cool demonstration of technology.",
        "Unfortunately, you know, none of us own a place - or certainly I don't own a place - where I can watch 108-inch screen if I could even afford it, and it's going to, you know, if they sell them, they're going to sell them for hundreds of thousands of dollars.",

        "You know, what's really driving the market is, you know, increased manufacturing makes the prices go down and it makes these screens more affordable for people.",
        "There's also some new technologies being rolled into them, so once again Sharp was showing a technology that doubles what's called the refresh rate of an LCD screen.",
        "So it - instead of operating at 60 hertz, it's operating at 120 hertz and it looks really great.",
        "I mean you can actually - it has sort of a clearer feel to it.",
        "It's not something you can sort of look at and be like, oh yeah, there's line here and line there, but it has this perceptual difference that I think is pretty noticeable.",

        "And how long will it last on a normal charge?",
        "That's a really good question.",
        "I only had an hour with it, so it never ran out during that time.",
        "But Apple says five hours of the hard stuff, like talking and surfing the Web and playing video, and 16 hours of just playing music with the screen off.",
        "Of course, nobody knows if that's real, and a lot can happen between now and June when the phone finally comes out.",
        "There's a lot of software to be done.",
        "One of the big knocks against this phone is that the battery is enclosed like an iPod, and you can't change it after, you know, a thousand charges or 500 charges when it's not holding as much charge anymore.",
        "You'll have to send it in to Apple just as you do an iPod.",
        ": Wow.",
        "And if that's all right, I'll ask Dr. Umetsu to answer that 'cause we don't really have a lot more time left.",
        "Go ahead, Dr. Umetsu.",
        "Next question, real quick, was the Apple TV product.",
        "In the business world, would that conceivably work connected to a projector and 10 or 20 people in the room could connect to it by WiFi and project an image off each individual computer onto the projector?",
        "Well, assuming that you had the graphics you want to display saved as photos, like jpeg files, yes, up to five people could be - their laptops could all be projected - although one at a time - onto this thing.",
        "I should mention that the Apple TV is high definition and tailored especially for wide screen, high definition.",
        "The graphics are stunning.",
        ": Thanks, David in Washington.",
        "Thank you.",
        ": I know you want one.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "What about, David Pogue, third- party applications for the iPhone?",
        "I mean you...",
        "Another very common question.",
        "Steve Jobs says no, that although this phone is actually running a stripped-down version of Mac OSX, it does not run Mac OSX programs and people cannot write new programs for it.",
        "This is bumming a lot of people out big time.",
        "However, I spoke to an Apple programmer at the show, an old friend of mine, who said that in fact there is discussion about whether or not you'll be able to add new widgets, you know, the little tiny, single-purpose programs like Stock Tracker or Weather Tracker and so on that Mac OSX has now, and they're leaning toward perhaps letting people add third- party widgets to this thing.",
        "And since a widget can do almost anything, that would mean that..."

        "Mark, there's been ongoing war - there's a format war between high-definition players - the Blu-ray, the others - has that been settling out now at the CES at all?",
        "You know, the war is still on.",
        "Both the Blu-ray folks and HD DVD, which is the competing format, both of those consortiums had booths where they were trumpeting their upcoming, imminent victory over the heinous forces on the other side.",
        "So there seems to be no peace settlement on the way.",
        "What we did see at CES were a couple of technological solutions.",
        "The first was LG showed a player that will play both Blu-ray and HD DVD discs, so that could be a way for consumers to sort of cut through the possibility of spending way too much money on a player that ends up playing an obsolete format and just buying one player that will handle them both.",

        "The other thing we saw is actually Warner coming on saying that they're going to make discs with both formats on it, so one side will have the movie in HD DVD and the other side will have the movie in Blu-ray.",
        "They're going to be some manufacturing challenges around that.",
        "That's going to be hard to do and probably costly.",
        "But, you know, it once again it does show sort of a creative solution from in this case a movie studio on ways to get consumers to take the dive into HD optical movie viewing and not feel like they're going to get locked into something that goes away five years down the road.",
        ": David, did you want to jump in there?",
        "Oh, I was just going to say, yeah, that's an interesting solution, but of course it's - the Warner solution - but of course that's only one movie company and, you know, there are other movie companies who have vowed allegiance only to one format.",
        "And, you know, I have this nagging feeling in the back of mind, too, that is the difference between HD DVD discs - I don't mean the brand - I mean high-definition DVDs and regular DVDs - still, is the difference enough for the masses to want to buy all new movies and replace their DVD player and get into this war.",
        "I still wonder.",
        "I mean that's the billions and billions of dollar question, you know.",
        "I mean the studios sure hope so because, you know, they're looking for a new revenue stream to keep everybody re-buying their content.",
        "You know, it's - I just remember all the things that I had on albums or cassettes that I re- bought on CD.",
        "You know, I personally am kind of a believer in the Blu-ray solution, just because I feel like Blu-ray is a little more future-proof.",
        "It has much more storage on it.",
        "And sort of looking forward, you know, as David says, is it enough now?",
        "Maybe not.",
        "But, you know, the next - as you look towards future generations of HD programming, you know, Blu-ray is going to be able to handle the giant file sizes maybe a little more effectively than HD DVD.",
        "You know, it seemed to me about this whole week, what it really boils down to isn't technology - this whole week boiled down to humans and our, you know, limited little brains, because look at how stupid the electronics companies are by waging this format war.",
        "It's just pride; it's just ego.",
        "It's policy; it's not technology.",
        "It's insanity, yeah.",
        "I definitely...",
        "And then look what Apple did.",
        "Apple knew that you can't design a new cell phone.",
        "You can't break through the ugliness and clutter of current cell phones without starting fresh.",
        "But it also knew that the cell phone carriers - Verizon, Sprint and so on - are the gatekeepers.",
        "I don't know if most consumers know this, but Verizon dictates the menu structure and the features and so on, and you'll have a great cell phone with some wonderful wireless Bluetooth feature and Verizon will say turn that off.",
        "We don't like that, so turn it off.",
        "Apple, by striking this exclusive deal with Cingular, basically said: Cingular, you're going to get our phone exclusively for several years, but in exchange you have no veto power.",
        "You have no say.",
        "You're not even going to really know what we're working on till way down the road.",
        "And Cingular wound up actually making network changes to accommodate Apple's design.",
        "For example, when you check your voicemail on the iPhone, you don't have to listen: You have 31 messages.",
        "You don't get that.",
        "You see a list like an e-mail inbox of the names of the people who left you messages and you can tap them in random order and listen to the important ones first.",
        ": Wow."
