        "Well, I mean Apple doesn't - I mean Apple proved in spades this week that they don't need to show up at CES.",

        "They can have their own show and everybody will come to them.",

        "And if Apple's really able to change the power dynamic between handset makers and carriers, then that actually might end up being the biggest radical thing that happens from the iPhone.",
        ": David, did you find it curious that they did not announce any new computer at Macworld, which is always some little announcement of an upgrade or something.",

        "He knew exactly where he wanted to shine the spotlight, and that's what he did.",
        "He not only ignored Macs completely in the announcement and barely mentioned iPod, but as I mentioned before, he left out one entire new feature just because he wanted to make sure that this phone is all anyone's talking about.",

        "You know, it's interesting about the stock - what happened, you know, Apple stock zoomed up and the BlackBerry company, RIM, its stock crashed that day.",
        "And I think that's sort of interesting because this phone is really astonishing, especially - by the way, no one talks about the camera.",
        "The camera uses that huge three and a half inch screen as its viewfinder.",
        "Most people have never used a digital camera with a screen that big.",

        "It's slow to type, although Steve had some practice.",
        "But the really cool thing is they're using software to compensate.",
        "So if you muddle through some word and hit the wrong keys by accident, the software analyzes the proximity of the other keys around the one you actually struck and figures out what word you must be going for.",
        "It's not T9.",
        "It's not predictive.",
        "It doesn't give you multiple choices.",
        "It gives you one choice of the word it's figured you meant.",

        "And these cells have not been studied much in the past because the technology to identify them and to isolate them has not been available until just recently.",
        "So, what we've shown is that asthma is caused not by T helper two cells as been previously thought, but by this novel class of cells called natural killer T-cells.",
