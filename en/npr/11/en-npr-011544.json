        "And oftentimes, the wheezing comes and goes depending on the other nonspecific stimuli, such as cold air, or exercise, and sometimes infection.",
        "When those stimuli are present, then the airways go into a spasm due to this inflammation that's present in the lungs.",
        "So the treatments for asthma try to reduce this inflammation and thereby reducing the symptoms that are associated with asthma.",

        "And that does reduce inflammation in the airways, but clearly there are patients who don't respond to corticosteroids.",
        "And that may possible be due to the fact that NKT cells appear to be resistant to the effects of corticosteroids.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And as I understand, there's two kinds of treatments for asthma.",
        "There's sort of this long-term prevention treatment.",
        "And then, there are these acute, you know, get me some air right now treatments.",
        "That's correct.",
        "So, there are what's called the controller medications, which are focused on reducing the inflammation in the airways, and there are also the quick-relief medications that rapidly cause broncho-dilatation, so that these open the airways if there is spasm.",
        "And so, those are the quick-relief medications.",
        "Okay.",
