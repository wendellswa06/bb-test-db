        "All right, well, let's see what our listeners make of all this, and why don't we take a call from Melanie in Phoenix, Arizona.",
        "Melanie, welcome to Science Friday.",
        "Hi, thank you.",
        "I love your program.",
        "Oh, great.",
        "The question I have is there's a lot of research from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the EPA, and others about particulate matter and mobile source air toxins, the relation between freeway pollutants and asthma, and the findings are that 70 percent, a child is 70 percent more likely to have asthma if they reside or attend school near freeways and play outdoors, et cetera.",
        "So, can you talk a little bit about immunology versus the environmental factors that would maybe exacerbate conditions?",
        "Or is this conflicting research, or does this address the same sort of...",
        "Sure.",
        "Excellent question, Melanie, thanks.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yes, well, most asthma, perhaps 70 to 80 percent of asthma is thought to be due to allergic disease.",
        "So, we know that if a child or an adult becomes allergic to, say, dust mite or pollen allergens, that they're, that is a significant risk factor for persistent wheezing.",
        "But, as you point out, there are definite studies showing that exposure to particulate matter is also a risk factor for asthma.",
        "And it's possible that a way to put this together is that the common pathway is through these natural killer T-cells.",
        "So, the way we look, we're starting to look at this is that allergens induce some amount of inflammation that releases glycolipid antigens, which then activate NKT-cell, these natural killer T-cells.",
        "It is also possible that particulate matter causes some kind of damage or injury to the lungs.",
        "And this also results in the release of these glycolipid antigens that activate NKT-cells.",
        "Okay, I let you get away with it once, but what is a glycolipid antigen?",
        "Right, right.",
        "So, glycolipids are essentially lipids, or fats.",
        "Mm hmm."

        "And the big difference between conventional T-cells that the TH-2 cells that individuals, scientists have been studying in the past, was that those conventional T-cells respond to protein antigens.",
        "Hmm.",
        "DR. LAURENCE GARDNER: The reality is there's no one to pay for their health care services.",
        "Whereas these natural killer T-cells respond to these lipids.",
        "And so, this opens up a whole new window where we must look at these lipids that are activating.",
        "Now this sounds like a very important shift in the way scientists will be looking at asthmas, if you're changing a whole class of the kinds of antigens, these molecules, that the immune system is going to respond to.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So, we think that this is almost a paradigm shift, where the cell type is different, and the antigens that they respond to are also quite different.",

        "On my husband's side, he's Germanic and Italian.",
        "And I don't know, I have sort of a theory, two different theories.",
        "One is that all the immunizations that our children have received over the years, and especially how they've been stepped up, you know, when my children were young, they got so much more than I ever did.",
        "And is anybody researching whether that predisposes children to, not just asthma, but also severe allergies?",
        "You sort of mentioned allergies are related.",
        "My kids also have severe peanut allergies.",
        "Okay, Sunita, wait a second.",
        "Now, let's get the answer to question one first.",
        "Okay.",
        "All right, Dr. Umetsu.",
        "Well, I think that we do know that the prevalence of allergies and asthma have increased quite substantially over the last two decades, essentially doubling over the last 20 years.",
        "And we don't know for sure why that is.",
        "And one hypothesis is that our Western society is cleaner.",
        "There's less germs.",
        "And we use more antibiotics.",
        "And part of that theory is that we immunize people so that they don't get infections.",
        "So, that's the theory that we're just a cleaner.",
        "It's called the Hygiene Hypothesis.",
        "But, the data that support that, unfortunately, is not that strong.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "There are some studies trying to look specifically at immunizations and their relationship to the development of allergy and asthma.",
        "Mm hmm."

        "Okay, could I...",
        "And, yeah, Sunita, go ahead and ask your second question, or your second theory.",
        "My second question was is there any way that because we have two, almost, well, not really different races, but two different backgrounds where, my family grew up eating a tremendous amount of legumes.",
        "And my husband's ate not very many.",
        "And my children are, and I ate legumes throughout my pregnancies, and both my kids have life-threatening allergies to peanuts, which is something that I always ate a lot of.",
        "My younger one also has very bad soy, and...",
        "Sunita, we have to be careful.",
        "We can't speak to specific cases here.",
        "But, I think we get the idea here, and that is, that there's, is there anything about someone's diet, in general, or particular food background that could interact with their genetic background that might make them more susceptible to asthma, Dr. Umetsu?",
        "Well, that's a very common question, and we don't have the final answer on this.",
        "But there actually have been many, many studies that have looked at the diets of pregnant women and the development of allergies in their children.",
        "And if you look at all of the studies together, there doesn't seem to be a pattern.",
        "And that, so that's the data that's present.",
        "Right.",
        "it's possible that eating peanuts during pregnancy has effects in some mothers, and then, that's a common scenario in my practice.",
        "I certainly see many kids who have peanut allergy, and mothers say, well, we, they ate lots of peanuts during pregnancy.",
        "But, unfortunately, we just don't have good studies to say eating peanuts results in peanut allergy at this time.",
