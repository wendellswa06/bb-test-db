        "If each of them added a couple of hours of sleep per night, how might that influence their performance?",
        "The goal is to aim for 10 hours of sleep at nighttime.",

        "We saw a drop in a tenth of a second, down to 4.89 seconds.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So just a tenth of a second, I guess - is that a big deal?",
        "A tenth of a second may sound small, but for many of these athletes, a tenth of a second is a huge difference.",

        "A tenth of a second in, you know, a 40-yard dash is a huge, huge difference from a performance standpoint.",
        "But what Church says is just as significant is that these players' levels of daytime fatigue decreased significantly with more sleep, and their scores on vigor tests improved."

        "Wind blows hardest at night when electricity demand is lowest; there currently aren't ways to store it for later use; and you can't count on it on hot, summer days when you need it most.",
        "You can put all that wind in, but I still have to have all this other generation that I need to have available — all my coal, nuclear, all the gas — for my peak load day.",
