        "Amir Silimani(ph), an English teacher, tried to get to his Tehran home once the fighting died down.",
        "Yesterday, I couldn't return home because Tehran's streets were militarized, so I had to stay in my uncle's house.",
        "At 10 p.m., people just move to their roof and start shouting something like this: (Foreign language spoken) which in Arabic means God is great.",
        "(Soundbite of chanting)",
        "And this has become the symbol of Iran's protests, meaning other than God, there is no one here to protect.",

        "This is now a dispute about the very legitimacy of the Islamic Republic and the whole idea of clerical rule, which is why we're seeing not just students and young people and even Mousavi supporters on the street, but now these strange new coalitions are forming between some of the establishment figures of the Islamic Republic: Rafsanjani, Khatami.",
        "Even Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament has thrown in his lot with the reformists in some way.",
        "So there's a real split at the very highest levels of the Iranian regime over the future of the country.",
        "So this is not primarily a struggle between those who want a more liberal Iran and those who support the conservative vision of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad?",
        "Well, I have to say that the old paradigms that we've been using to understand Iran over the last 30 years, the mullahs versus the kids, the secularists versus the theocrats.",
        "Those things have completely broken down in this uprising.",
        "At stake right now is what many in Iran feel is the militarization of Iranian politics.",
        "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as a member of the Revolutionary Guard, is really the puppet for the Revolutionary Guard; represents for many this strange, almost dangerous military coup that's taking place in Iran.",
        "And so in many ways, the clerical establishment itself, at least certain members of the clerical establishment, feel threatened by Ahmadinejad.",
        "They feel as though their very power is being taken away from them, that Iran is increasingly starting to look like a military dictatorship ala Egypt or even Pakistan; countries in which regardless of who's in charge, it's the military that calls the shots.",
        "Many of these young demonstrators want a different kind of Iran.",
        "They want liberal reforms.",
        "They want to be able to travel.",
        "They don't want so much religion in their lives, and yet they're in coalition with religious figures who feel that they don't have enough power.",
        "Right.",
        "It's the enemy of my enemy, right?",
        "You know, this is exactly the issue at stake here is that we don't know what kind of Iran is going to emerge from this crisis, but what we do know is that it will not be the same Iran as before.",
        "Whether that Iran will be more militaristic and more isolationist, that could very well be the case, but it could also be the cast that it'll be much more democratic and much more accommodationist.",
        "Mousavi has become really little more than just a figurehead for this uprising, the swelling of support for a different kind of Iran, an Iran that doesn't look the way that it did over the last four years.",
        "That's why, I think, you know, we have to constantly talk about this as an anti-Ahmadinejad uprising more than a pro-Mousavi or even a pro-reformist uprising."

        "With so many ridesharing companies out there already, why do you think the world needs another one created by Ford?",
        "Well, we think we might bring a lot of unique approaches to the business.",
        "First off, as an automaker, we're really focused on our core business, which is designing, developing and manufacturing and marketing terrific cars, utilities and trucks.",
        "At the same time, we're seeing a lot of the societal factors around congestion and what that means for mobility going forward, and that's why we're thinking also of ourselves as a mobility company, which means, how do we make people's lives better, and how do we provide mobility maybe beyond our traditional definition?",
        "Let's talk about Ford's investment in electric vehicles.",
        "Right now, gas prices are at near record lows.",
        "Sales of plug-in versions of cars like your Fusion and C-Max are very, very low relative to your sales of the F-series truck.",
        "How do you anticipate shifting consumer demand from your revenue source now - these sort of gas-guzzling trucks - to the electric vehicles of the future?",
        "Well, it's a big challenge right now, obviously, because where the cost of a gallon of gas is, it's not a very good financial decision by the consumer.",
        "But part of our job as a company and as an automotive manufacturer and now as a mobility company, is to think of what the world is going to look like five, 10 and even 15 years from now.",
        "And our view, very simply, is that over time, oil is a nonrenewable resource.",
        "And therefore, over time, higher levels of electrification will be necessary not only to meet consumer demand in that timeframe but also to meet the regulatory requirements.",
        "I just pulled up some recent numbers.",
        "Your plug-in Fusions sold fewer than 8,000 vehicles through October while the F-series trucks - it was about 630,000 in the same time period.",
        "Are we looking at an electric truck in the future?",
        "I mean, that's such a huge, huge, huge chasm."

        "Well, we do have plans to have a rear-wheel drive hybrid truck but the end of the decade.",
        "So yes, we're working on electrified F-series, and it's really around a conventional hybrid.",
        "But to your point, as you look at the industry today with over about 60 offerings in the industry today for electrified vehicles, it represents around 2-and-a-half percent of the total industry.",
        "If you look four years ago or so, there were only about maybe 10 or 15 electrified offerings, and the percent of total industry was about 2-and-a-half percent.",
        "So it hasn't moved much.",
        "And importantly, although it's relatively small percentage of our sales, we are the second-largest seller and brand seller of electrified vehicles in the United States, and we're the No. 1 seller of plug-in hybrids.",
        "So this is really allowing us to build on the leadership, understanding that the percentages today are small.",
        "But going forward, our view is that they'll grow, and we want to position ourselves for that growth.",
        "The climate deal that came out of Paris over the weekend aims for net zero carbon emissions by the second half of this century.",
        "How many years will it be until Ford's manufacturing plants reach net zero emissions?",
        "Well, overall, as a company, we have said, you know, global warming is an issue, and we want to be part of the solutions.",
        "And I can't give you and exact date right now, but we have been very much in the forefront in our manufacturing plants in terms of being very environmentally forward thinking.",
        "But my understanding is that globally, Ford's manufacturing emissions are not going down as you expand in China, though.",
        "The numbers are actually staying the same or perhaps even going up.",
        "Well, part of that is the growth of our brand and our products around the world.",
        "But we are very, very dedicated to making sure that as we grow the business, that we do it as environmentally sensitive as possible and make it as easy as the planet as possible.",
        "And you know, we're considered at the forefront, particularly in our industry, around those type of things.",
        "Although, if you talk about pivoting from being a 20th to a 21st century company, if your carbon emissions curve has not begun going down, is that really being a 21st century company?",
        "Well, I think overall, one of the main responsibilities of being a 21st century company is to make sure that we do our part, no matter where we are in the world, to contribute to economic development.",
        "So I suppose this is the tension between economic development and the need to limit carbon emissions as we move into this new era.",
        "Do you see those two as at odds?",
        "And it seems as though Ford, historically, has chosen the former, economic progress, over the latter, making cuts that could get in the way of growth.",
        "Well, I would disagree with that.",
        "I do think we have been, over the last decade or so, very, very sensitive to make sure that we balance economic growth.",
        "We're doing our part for environmental sustainability and also, at the same time, growing our business and, I think, doing it responsibly."
