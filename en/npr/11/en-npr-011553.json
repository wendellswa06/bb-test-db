        "Well, you know, that's something of an oversimplification and it stems from the fact that everyone doesn't have to have a car.",
        "So in Massachusetts you are required to have health insurance if there is an affordable plan available for you.",
        "Meaning that if you can afford it, you have to buy it.",

        "So if you're not eligible for a subsidy and your employer doesn't offer it, then there's a test to determine, okay, is there a plan available that's reasonable for you to purchase?",

        "They've started enrolling people in subsidized coverage and we've seen enrollments, I think, going well without huge problems.",
        "I think that the mountain gets progressively steeper as they go forward, because the first stage was basically for folks who were completely subsidized, no premiums.",
        "And then now we're in the stage where we're enrolling people who have sliding scale subsidies and soon we'll be talking about enrolling people who don't have any subsidies.",
        "So each of those is another hurdle to get over.",
        "How are you going to know if this thing is completely succeeding?",
        "Well, that's hard to say for sure, but certainly, obviously, we judge by the number of uninsured.",
        "We judge by whether there's a lot of bad debt - so that people who have insurance, are they really insured or are they underinsured?",
        "And we judge also by political acceptance; do people feel that they are being asked to do something that's reasonable, or do they feel that the mandate is unduly burdensome and unfair?",
        "Are you also going to have to judge by insurance rates, because if everybody is insured, shouldn't that mean that other people's insurance rates should go down?",
        "I mean, the people who already had insurance, their rates should go down a little bit, or at least not rise as much?",
        "Well I think that that's absolutely right.",
        "It would be nice to see rates go down, although I'm not sure anyone expects that, but certainly a slower rate of increase.",
        "And if you had one piece of advice to give to other states, like California now, considering this plan, what would it be?",
        "Well, just looking at what I've seen of California so far, as the debate goes forward there, I would say that they need to do some more thinking about affordability.",
        "I think in Massachusetts that conversation really is still ongoing.",
        "And what I've seen from Governor Schwarzenegger's plan, you know, that's an area that they might need to address more fully.",
        "Because if plans aren't affordable, and they're not reasonably comprehensive, I think that the mandate has a great likelihood of failing that last test - the political test.",
        "Okay, Mr. Miller.",
        "Thanks very much."
