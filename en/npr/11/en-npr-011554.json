        "If someone was watching your connection to the Internet, what would they see?",
        "That's the question NPR's Steve Henn and a team of security experts set out to answer this spring by tapping the Internet connection in Steve's home.",
        "They soon realized that in the years since Edward Snowden's first disclosures about the NSA became public, the fabric of the Internet has changed.",
        "Some of the biggest tech companies in the world have added new layers of security and encryption to some of their most widely used services, and while the team found that encryption is much more common online than it was just a year ago, it remains far from perfect.",
        "Here's Steve Henn.",
        "A couple of years ago, it really wasn't that uncommon to hear founders in Silicon Valley joke that they'd know their company had made it when their app or service finally got hacked.",
        "Encryption was kind of expensive and a pain.",
        "And for most people, security just wasn't a priority here.",
        "But if you were hacked, that meant your service, your app, was big enough to be a target, which was a sign you'd made it.",
        "Recently, though, that attitude has changed.",
        "That was the biggest surprise to me - how much has changed, how much is now encrypted that was not encrypted pre-Snowden, about a year ago.",
        "Dave Porcello is the founder of the security firm Pwny Express.",
        "From what I've seen, you know, most of these services were either not encrypted at all or only partially encrypting.",
        "Then came Edward Snowden's leaks, revealing the global scale of the NSA's Internet surveillance.",
        "In the wake of the Snowden revelations, the intelligence community has really lost the trust of American business.",
        "Nick Cardozo is an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
        "He says...",
        "Silicon Valley companies have finally recognized that there is a market for privacy.",
        "Today, as opposed to last year, billions of people care if their messages are kept safe.",
        "Now, encryption probably won't stop the NSA from reading your email if they're really going after you, but it makes mass surveillance much more expensive.",
        "Instead of just sucking up your messages and reading them, a security agency, like the NSA, actually has to make the effort to break the code that's protecting your data.",
        "That costs them money and takes time.",
        "Encryption also protects consumers from fraud, or hackers, or identity theft.",
        "And in the last year, companies have embraced it.",
        "Yahoo began encrypting email by default.",
        "Google added encryption between its data centers.",
        "Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook all took steps to make it harder for messages you send on their services to be intercepted, decoded and read.",
        "So when Dave Porcello at Pwny Express and Sean Gallagher, a reporter at the tech news site Ars Technica and I began tapping the Internet traffic into and out of my laptop and cell phone, we were kind of curious what we'd see."

        "Jim Crawford of New Morning Farm has been growing this vegetable in Pennsylvania for nearly four decades.",
        "And long ago, he even started buying it from his neighbors.",
        "He noticed this tart-tasting perennial was languishing in their gardens, unharvested.",
        "It sounds funny, but it was kind of common that people seemed to have that attitude about rhubarb.",
        "Dismissive.",
        "Yeah, dismissive, right.",
        "And then, of course, when they got a $1.60 a pound for it, they said, hey, you know, I think this stuff is worth something.",
        "In recent years, Crawford's seen a resurgence in demand for rhubarb, often filled by nostalgia, as with customer Ed Kayle(ph).",
