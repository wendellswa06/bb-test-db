        "And indeed, that there was no doubt in his mind that prisoners have been taken forcibly from Europe, taken to third countries, normally in the Arab world, where they were tortured, but just no evidence.",
        "That's what he means by outsourcing torture, he's talking about this practice that we call rendition?",
        "But what the U.S.",
        "denies and what Mr. Marty's asserting does happen, is that when those prisoners are rendered to places like Egypt, Jordan, Syria, or wherever, that at that point, they are tortured.",

        "says, well, we don't know that they are, and we certainly don't take them there for that purpose.",

        "When the Federal Reserve hatched the JPMorgan takeover at Bear Stearns, it was said that this was no bailout.",
        "Seeing your stock plummet to $2 a share was more like bankruptcy than a bailout.",
        "What about $10 a share?",
        "Well, I think this always was a bailout.",
        "It was a bailout of bondholders, and that was politically acceptable to keep the markets from freezing up and becoming paralyzed.",
        "Now, however, the shareholders have revolted, and for some redistribution of the subsidy, so they've quintupled the amount they will receive.",
        "It's probably the most they'll be able to get because Bear Stearns and JPMorgan have now agreed to stuff the ballot box by issuing approximately 39 percent of the shares to JPMorgan, meaning the transaction will now go through.",
        "But it was a case in which neither JPMorgan nor Bear Stearns were that concerned about the price.",
        "That's because JPMorgan was buying only the assets and giving most of the liabilities to the federal government.",
        "So there always was a degree to which this was a heavily subsidized deal with all of the bad assets being passed to the Federal Reserve.",
        "All that we've seen now is some in-fighting about who gets the benefit of this subsidy.",
        "Can you explain something?",
        "For a stock to go from $2 to $10 over the course of a week - of course, it's nothing compared to what it was trading for a year ago, but even so, it's going up five-fold, how can there be such disparate evaluations of what Bear Stearns is worth from one Monday to the next Monday?",
        "I don't think there really was an arm's-length evaluation of what Bear Stearns is worth.",
        "I think the federal government insisted that this transaction could not be allowed to appear as a bailout of the Bear shareholders, and therefore, the Federal Reserve insisted that the shareholders receive only a nominal $2-value price basically to protect itself from political criticism.",
        "And that was hard to insist on once the shareholders begin to revolt.",
        "And JPMorgan had no strong interest in fighting that battle for the Federal Reserve.",

        "He has these memos that Rumsfeld has dictated over the years - you see them.",
        "You see dictionaries definitions on screen.",
        "You see beautiful things that he has photographed, for instance, a huge close-up of a helicopter when Rumsfeld is talking about the exit from Vietnam, which he also was involved with.",
        "So there's real filmmaking involved here, which is something unexpected and which makes all this kind of dense stuff really easy to go down."

        "You don't hear the director asking the questions.",
        "And there are moments when he really goes, kind of, head-to-head with Rumsfeld in very engaging ways.",
        "Let's listen to one of those moments where Errol Morris has heard - a little bit off-mic - asking a question to Rumsfeld.",
        "And Rumsfeld, as he classically does, takes issue with the question.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, THE UNKNOWN KNOWN)",
        "You can hear there and you see even more on the screen, when you see the grin on Rumsfeld's face, why this guy was so compelling whether you loved him or hated him.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean it's a wonderful interchange.",
        "You really - 'cause you get to see Rumsfeld's personality.",
        "Even though Errol Morris interjects himself, the purpose is for us to see what Rumsfeld is really like, and that challenge is just classic - just classic."
