        "But Gorodilov wouldn't stand for it.",
        "He and others in town found a lawyer at a nonprofit and they got their message out on the Internet, insisting that the people of Sagra had been neglected by the police and were left to defend themselves against criminals.",
        "I sat down with Viktor Gorodilov and his family and I listened as they spoke about taking truth to power.",
