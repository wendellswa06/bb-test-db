        "I want to make sure I understand, you're also concerned about these so-called FEMA-villes, parks filled with temporary trailers that become permanent structures, permanent homes for families, for years and years and years.",
        "That's right, we were working with FEMA to provide some sites for emergency travel trailers.",
        "But we thought instead of erecting trailer parks, why not erect Katrina neighborhoods, with these small cottages and then allow people the option to either purchase the cottage and add on to it, or if they choose to move out, then the government could perhaps sell it to someone else, or someone who would lease it to another family.",
        "Well, FEMA put up a significant speed bump in front of your plan and the cited the Stafford Act, which is a law that was designed to prevent FEMA from picking up the tab for permanent housing.",
        "Do you understand the reasoning behind that?",
        "I can certainly see that reasoning, and it's a cost issue of course.",
        "And it's also the definitions and the cost benefits of temporary versus permanent housing.",
        "How much sense does it make to invest millions upon millions of dollars into FEMA travel trailers that are only going to end up on the trash heap in a couple of years?",
        "Whereas you could put that same amount of money into something that added value, and that's why we thought Katrina cottage makes more sense.",
        "But, you know, I understand that, but as a mayor you certainly understand the rule of law and what you're suggesting is basically sidestepping that law.",
        "Well what we're doing is talking to congressional leaders and seeing if they're willing to amend the act or if these cottages could actually be built within the existing parameters of the Stafford Act.",
        "I would be much happier, as mayor of this town, to have Katrina cottages rather than all of these thousands of FEMA trailers, because we're worried about the next storm season.",
