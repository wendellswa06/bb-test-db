        "Well, the initial few hours or 24 hours at least after the incident, our number was the only number published.",
        "So we were getting calls asking for help, asking questions about the incident, all the way to people requesting how they could pick up their car from the parking lot.",
        "The main calls coming in with regards to behavior health services - just a lot of people asking why, why El Paso, why us, a little bit of, you know, I was supposed to go to that Walmart that day - some survivor guilt.",
        "So we did a lot of just talking to people, letting them say what they needed to say.",
        "And if we felt like they needed more, we connected them with one of our clinicians.",
        "Were people able to connect with clinicians?",
        "Because one of the things that I read and one of the reasons we found you is that I read that mental health care in El Paso has not been easy to access for many residents.",
        "So there are two questions there.",
        "One is, have people who want that kind of help been able to get it?",
        "And why is it that people who say it hasn't been that easy to access - you yourself have been pushing for more services - why has it been difficult?",
        "Well, I'm not aware of the concern about it being too difficult.",
        "We had staff on the ground in the actual parking lot of the Walmart as it was happening.",
        "Since then, we actually set up what we called a co-op with two partners here in El Paso to be able to provide support groups twice a day at five different locations throughout the community for two full weeks.",
        "And then after that, we've stood up a clinic where people can just walk in and get the help or call and we can send someone to them if they have issues with transportation.",
        "In a way, I think it could be a pivot point, could it be?",
        "I think that there's often been a concern in communities of color, for example, that seeking these kinds of services is a bit stigmatized, a bit taboo.",
        "Perhaps people are less familiar with it.",
        "And so has this kind of opened the door for more people to seek these services who perhaps might not have known about them?",
        "Yes, I believe so.",

        "If someone has cancer, they don't steer clear of you, they embrace you.",
        "And I think that's something that we're able to use in this instance is, you know, from the neck up, your brain and your emotions are so important.",
        "And being able to talk to somebody about how you're feeling is critical to your health, your overall health.",
        "There's a report that - it's pretty old now.",
        "I mean, this is a 2001 surgeon general's report that specifically focused on the Latino community.",
        "It said that only 20% of Latinos with symptoms of a psychological disorder talked to a doctor about their concerns.",
        "But there's been a more recent report suggesting that only about a third of Latinos with a mental illness received treatment.",
        "This is according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
        "Have there also been sort of cultural factors that you found, particularly in this area, that have sort of added to the reluctance, perhaps, of people to seek this kind of care in the past?",
        "I think the broad brush answer I could give to that is a lot of times the Hispanic or Latino culture tend to turn to faith-based, maybe like a priest or maybe the Catholic Church or whatever church they're affiliated with.",
        "And they really, truly believe in that healing when it comes to mental illness.",
        "And I'm glad you said doctor because at times, mental illness is a true chemical imbalance.",
        "And they do need medication.",
        "And I think the heightened awareness that our nation has put on mental health and the stigma on mental illness has really opened up doors for individuals to seek treatment."
