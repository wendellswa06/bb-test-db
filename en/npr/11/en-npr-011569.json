        "I can tell you that Navy SEALs are the premier special operations force, the premier maritime special operations force in the world.",
        "As SEALs, we spend a lot of time training for what we call CQC or close quarters combat, and that simulates shipboard rescues and maritime rescues.",
        "In addition, many SEALs in a SEAL platoon have been to sniper school.",
        "And the incident you see now, they utilize U.S.",
        "Navy SEAL snipers to achieve tactical resolution.",
        "Why do you think it took five days before special ops could pull this off?",
        "Well, I think the purpose here was to try and resolve this situation without resorting to violence.",
        "And in a hostage scenario, any time there's a tactical engagement, the likelihood of having a casualty, including a hostage casualty, increases.",
        "They're trying to avoid that at all costs, but a scenario presented itself where it became necessary to use lethal force.",
        "From what you know about this situation, were there special circumstances to this rescue?",
        "I mean, what sort of things would they have had to consider before starting it?",
        "I think, tactically, what made this rescue so difficult was that the lifeboat was covered.",
        "So they didn't - they couldn't - they didn't actually have eyes on the targets.",
        "So that definitely caused the entire scenario to play out longer than it normally would in a hostage rescue scenario."

        "This does seem like a difficult operation.",
        "And, in fact, at any time that there are lives at stake, the situation is more intense and more dangerous.",
        "But SEALs are trained very well to be adaptive and flexible to any kind of tactical environment that they're put in.",
        "Kaj Larsen, paint a picture for us here of how this operation might look from the point of view of the rescuers.",
        "Some are on another ship.",

        "How does that all look?",
        "Well, it's a very good question.",
        "And obviously, I'm not speaking for the Navy, but from what I understand, the snipers or the SEAL team was in an elevated position on the Bainbridge, shooting into the lifeboat.",
        "And that is a very difficult tactical scenario not only because of the sea conditions, and their vision is partially obscured but that because in any scenario, when there's lead flying, there's the potential for something to go awry.",

        "The two Sharms co-exist but uneasily, as NPR's Peter Kenyon reports.",
        "It may be hard to imagine looking at a coastline crammed with hotels, resorts and villas, but just a few decades ago, this was rock, sand and sea, with a scattering of tents pitched by fishermen who would rise before dawn to fish the pristine, blue waters of the Red Sea.",
        "They weren't the only ones who saw the value of this point overlooking both the Gulf of Suez and the Straits of Tehran.",
        "Israel conquered the area twice, in 1956 and '67, and during the Second Occupation, they built the first hotel at Naama Bay, now the heart of tourist Sharm."

        "He first came here from Cairo 22 years ago and was so enchanted, he stayed.",
