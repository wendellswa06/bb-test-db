        "Mike McGee explains that NASA and his employer, Lockheed Martin, focused on finding ways to get the foam to stick better in critical areas.",
        "Unidentified Man #3: Yeah.",
        "But the most obvious task was simply to get rid of any place where there was a big chunk of insulation in the first place.",
        "That was true in an area of the tank called the bipod.",
        "A wedge of foam there the size of a suitcase was what ripped free from the tank during Columbia's liftoff.",
        "It went from a large block of foam that was on the bipod to now a very low-profile foam with a heater element that keeps the ice from forming on the bipod.",
        "Heaters to melt ice are being installed elsewhere on the tank, too.",
        "A falling icicle could easily do more damage than falling foam, and on this day workers are preparing to install heaters on a part of the tank called the bellow.",
        "They're not worried about the drip lift.",
        "They're worried about the flushes on the convoluted side.",
        "There are more than a dozen other major changes to the shuttle and the shuttle program.",
        "For example, in order to look for signs of falling debris during launch, NASA intends to take high-resolution videos of the liftoff from many different camera angles: from the ground, from the air and from the shuttle's under belly and, as McGee points out, even from the tank itself.",
        "And if you look to where the big feed-line pipe enters into the tank, and you see the small red cap...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...that's actually a cap to the camera.",
        "And so during launch, as the orbiter sits on top, we'll get a view from the camera down the external tank.",
        "You'll be able to see the bipods, how they're performing."

        "It burns up in the atmosphere.",
        "McGee says at that moment, the tank people know they've done their job.",
        "It's an overwhelming sense of achievement when you watch this vehicle launch and you know that you've played a significant part in producing it.",
        "Does it bother you even a little bit that it ultimately burns up in the atmosphere and that's it?",
        "Oh, no. That's what keeps us in business here.",
        "It's the only non-reuseable part, and we're more than happy to just go ahead and build the next one.",

        "So, if the students are not otherwise equally prepared, Ronald, then I don't understand what the significance of this would be.",
        "It would seem that the preparation would be the thing that will make the difference.",
        "No, I mean, there's a frame of mind, there's a state of mind, that we have when we go into a situation where we're going to be measured and tested, particularly if our performance is going to be visible to other people.",
        "And I think, to the degree that there is an Obama effect in this context - and I'm not sure there is such an effect, but if there is one - if the source of it would be the absence now of the feeling that people are assuming that you're going to do less well just because you're black - I mean, the stereotype-anxiety phenomenon has to do with not wanting to confirm a negative stereotype.",
        "And to the degree that the election has removed some of the negative stereotype associated with being black, black folks have less reason to be anxious, to feel anxiety, when they go into situations where they might otherwise be negatively stereotyped.",
        "And so, then they would perform better on a test, presumably, because of that.",
        "Yes.",

        "I think we can - the evidence is accumulating that the achievement gap is present by the first day of kindergarten and that it's due, in many ways, to the experiences the children have between the ages of one and five, and many of those experiences are experiences they have at home in the family.",
        "And so, to my way of thinking, there is great progress to be made in sharing with parents ideas about ways that they can interact with their children to prepare them to enter school more ready for school.",
        "At the same time, I'm not at all backing off of the idea that schools could also be much more effective.",
        "And so, I think we need to work on parenting, not only early-childhood parenting, but all the way through school; we need to work on the quality of instruction the students receive; we need to work on youth culture; we need to work on the availability of out-of-school time supports; and we need to try to cultivate leadership at the community level to try to keep the pressure on to get all of these changes made."
