        "Well, you know, Jane, language skills, a big part of a child's scholastic well-being.",
        "Let's talk briefly about that in how it relates to the gap between black and white and whether or not President Obama, who has been described, you know, many times and, rightfully so, as a very eloquent speaker and communicator, could his presence in that regard have an impact on the way black kids communicate?",
        "That's a good question, and I'm sure that is an aspect of the way in which he's going to be a role model.",
        "I think the other way, you know, very concretely that President Obama is going to help out is he's proposing in unprecedented expansion in funding for preschool programs.",
        "He's going to quadruple - he's proposing to quadruple the number of children who were served by the Early Head Start Program.",
        "This is the highest quality program we have for low-income children age zero to three.",
        "He's proposing to expand funding for Head Start and universal pre-kindergarten.",
        "Actually, the single biggest item in economic stimulus program is funding for education, including some funding for early education.",
        "Well, you know, the stimulus package, I was going to go to that next, actually, to talk about the president's policies with regard to education, and as we have been saying on this show every day so far, that the stimulus package has been running into opposition.",
        "Even the Child Health Insurance Program ran into opposition.",
        "Do you think, Ronald, that there is support for the kind of educational policies of the Obama administration that will help make a difference?",
        "I think that support can be generated.",
        "I think right now people don't really understand what they're being asked to buy into.",
        "I think that there are some things that need to be modified about the No Child Left Behind legislation, such as rewarding schools more effectively for progress.",
        "I think there is a lot that we can do to help school and district leaders to understand better how to help teachers to be more effective in the classroom.",
        "I think that Feds can be effective as a convener to help spread good ideas across states in this.",
        "And so, I think the vision of what we actually intend to do differently in education has yet to be really spelled out and publicly shared.",
        "And I think once that vision is shared and people develop a sense that it will make a difference, I would expect there to be quite of bit of support for funding it.",
        "Well, Jane, Ronald mentioned No Child Left Behind, which we were going to mention as well, a program, of course, implemented by the former president.",
        "Do you think that No Child Left Behind, as a policy under the Bush administration, has positioned the new president and putting him in a better or worse position to try to implement the kind of reform in education that will close this achievement gap?",
        "Well, you know, people disagree about this, but I actually feel like No Child Left Behind was a step in the right direction in that it shone a bright light on achievement gaps.",
        "It said to school districts, you can no longer report aggregate statistics; you have to report results separately for black children, white children, Latino children, for separate groups.",
        "It didn't fund improvements; it didn't impose standard - you know, consistent testing systems.",
        "There were lots of flaws in No Child Left Behind.",
        "But the one thing it did do was a shine a bright light on achievement gaps and, you know, heighten the focus on accountability, which was the direction that the states were going, you know, anyway.",
        "So, I think it was a useful step in the right direction, and - yes.",
        "You know, I would just add, I mean, I do a fair amount of work with school districts, and I've sat in the number of meetings in school districts where people were thinking hard about ways to help students do better in ways that they would not have been doing if not for No Child Left Behind.",
        "There was one meeting, one of the math department chairs said, well, my guys have been here a long time.",
        "I just don't think how we're going to do any of this stuff any differently.",
        "We just - you know, been there done that.",
        "And the assistant superintendent said, look, somebody from the state going to be sitting in my office a week from now asking me what we are doing, and I've got to have an answer.",
        "And so, if you're not going to do this, what are you going to do?",
        "And the department chair, oh, well, OK, and you just gave me another reason to - maybe we will.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So, that's one of the positive aspects of it, but in terms of the Obama administration, there is going to be a need for time, is there not, in order to make an effective change?",
        "There would be - you know, but they're not starting some scratch in terms of thinking it through.",
        "I mean, people have been thinking for the last several years about how they were going to advise the new administration to refine No Child Left Behind.",
        "Now, they're going to have to sort through all those ideas, but there are quite a few ideas already on the table about ways to fix the ways that we measure progress and so on."
