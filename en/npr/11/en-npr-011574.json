        "That's the sports show, and I've seen it, and boy, is it really, really, really hard, Paul Farhi.",
        "Yeah, that's a different take on it.",
        "ESPN did a sports quiz show back in the early '90s, I believe.",
        "It was just as hard, and it was amazing because you had these people on who knew everything about the Cleveland Indians and everything about the Lakers.",
        "And you know, that was more in the style of the 1950s, where you just sat back amazed by what people knew, and it wasn't about trying to relate to it.",
        "You know, if you got one right, you felt good about yourself.",
        "Yeah.",

        "That's true, but you know, this - that clip and your last caller points out something interesting, which is the idea of specialization.",
        "On a show like that or on \"\"Stump the Schwab,\"\" where very specialized knowledge is being tested, it's easier to see someone excel and sort of admire that freakish intensity of their interest in one particular subject.",
        "I think maybe where we've, you know, where we've declined as a society is just in this sort of general cultural literacy about everything.",
        "You know, it was much easier to be a Renaissance man in Thomas Jefferson's day when there was much less to know.",
        "And today with this, you know, boom of proliferation of knowledge about so many subjects that didn't even exist 50 years ago, I think it's hard to be one of these people that knows a little bit about everything and much easier to be the kid who studies up on the Plantagenets or the Schwab, you know...",

        "Paul?",
        "I was in England at the end of December, and I watched a fair amount of television over there.",
        "And I have to say, their quiz shows were really not much better than ours.",
        "The show that you just played the clip from, of course, is about very special kids who have expertise in a particular subject.",
        "But the average over there really isn't terribly different, and I've seen the same kind of commentary about dumbing down both in England and in Australia, where the same game shows are replicated."
