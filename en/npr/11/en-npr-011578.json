        "And what we have is a culture that wants to listen to and watch the kind of filth that he is often willing to produce.",
        "And so for him, it is an opportune moment, but that's only because we live in a country of people who are more than willing to slop themselves in the kinds of images and music, often, that's dehumanizing to black women, that degrades black culture and is an offense to the civil rights legacy that provided him the platform to do what he does in the first place.",

        "Do you think that, you know, it may be a split, that the red-meat Republican base is going to love her, but some of the independents are going to say, hey, you know what, wait a second, this isn't what I wanted, I didn't want a social conservative?"

        "Well, I think that's exactly what she was brought on to do, precisely that, is to energize the base and to enable John McCain to distance himself from the party and from Bush, paint himself as a maverick once again, someone bringing change to Washington, while keeping the base in his back pocket.",
        "But I would disagree.",
        "I think she will put a lot of these undecided and independent voters into play.",
        "I mean, you have recent stats that said that up to 25 percent of women were undecided.",
        "So even if Governor Palin doesn't pull the Hillary Clinton Democrats, Democratic women, which I don't, you know, necessarily think she will, there is a possibility that she does put a significant number of women in play for McCain.",

        "Before the Republican convention, the same poll showed Senator Obama with 50 percent of voters versus 42 percent for McCain.",
        "So Shaun, do you think this is a long-term lead or a short-term bounce?",
        "I think it's a short-term bounce, but I still think we have to take the Palin pick seriously.",
        "I mean, she has given the McCain camp tons of energy, she's just creating tons of momentum.",
        "He's had more people at his rallies over the past few days than he has in the past few months combined.",
        "And so - I mean, it would be easy to say, hey, it's just convention bump, but as the other bloggers have said, she's energized the base, but more than that, she has brought something fresh and new and change-oriented to the McCain campaign, and he was having a hard time saying that before.",
        "So whether we believe she's for change or not, it seems to me that people are believing that, and some of her record suggests that.",
        "So even social politics aside, she did do some really interesting things in Alaska.",
        "People are taking a look at those things and ...",
        "I'm not aware of what she did that was fresh and new in Alaska, nor am I convinced that she is much of a maverick either for the Republican party or a maverick politician, to use their own terms.",
        "I think much of her CV, as it were, on the executive side, is highly suspect.",
        "And all of that will be coming out, and it has been coming out since day one, in fact, that she is - she's the worst kind of politician, in that she lies.",
        "All right ...",
        "Wow.",
        "I want to - before you guys continue, I'm going to ask each of you to give me a concrete example of what you think she has done well or badly.",
        "Since you brought this up, Chris, a concrete example of a specific thing you that you think she lied about or did badly.",
        "Well, at least the thing I think she did badly, is she was snarky, which is what we're supposed to do as bloggers, which, you know, I'm very offended by.",
        "I mean, that's our job.",
        "But as a VP, she was a pit bull with lipstick, to use her own - so I thought the tone and really the substance of her speech, which was delivered excellently, was really something that in the long term may be off-putting to folks who she hoped, or the Republicans had expected to get."
