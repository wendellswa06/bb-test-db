        "But while she was mayor of Wasilla, a small town, she was for some pork barrel spending, but in the very short time that she was governor, and it was short indeed, she did do some things to really curb pork barrel spending in Alaska.",
        "It's a small record, but for the same reason that I got excited about Barack Obama when he announced his candidacy, her sheer presence in the race is so unique and different, there's never been anybody like her in national politics.",
        "And so a lot of her appeal is not her record.",
        "For the same reasons so many people are excited by Obama, her appeal is something very, very different.",

        "No, I can give you plenty.",
        "I mean, look exactly at her record.",
        "I mean, this is somebody who took on a corrupt GOP establishment, whether it was Governor Murkowski, whether it was Don Young, whether it was even the indicted Senator Ted Stevens, and she was a whistleblower while on the Alaska Oil and Gas Commission, to the point where she resigned in protest.",
        "I mean, this is somebody who has a record of going after corruption, no matter where she sees it, even in her own party, ruffling feathers, but doing what she feels is right for the people of Alaska.",
        "She did that by taking a surplus, and instead of investing it into different state areas, giving a check back to the, you know, citizens of Alaska and saying, this is the product of your tax money and you deserve to have it.",
        "So, I mean, I think her record is evident on a lot of those points, and I think the criticism that she had an inappropriate tone misses the mark.",
        "I mean, this is what a VP does.",
        "They play the attack dog.",
        "It's the same thing that Senator Biden is running around doing and has, you know, done in many other cases, even before he was a VP choice.",
        "So I think that to say, well, you know, I don't like her tone, it may rub people the wrong way, but in the end, I don't know how much of a substantive attack on her record or her qualifications that is."

        "So ...",
        "Well, yeah, certainly the - the community organizer line, even myself being on the floor of the convention, I cringed about that.",
        "Because I think especially minority Republicans had a problem with that line, because we felt, you know, when you're in a - if you come from a white or you come from a privileged background, you don't necessarily see the need for a community to be organized, because you don't necessarily have to organize to protect your security or rights.",

        "So she's using those zingers, the ones that she thought - that actually did do very well in the hall, and she's using that in small town America, throwing out that read meat not realizing, or perhaps not caring, that that is probably energizing - well it is energizing Obama supporters significantly.",
        "There are T-shirts, there are all kinds of things that are already created around her words that she thought were very effective, and what John McCain's people think are very effective, when in fact Obama raised 10 million dollars in less than 24 hours based on her speech.",
        "All right.",
        "Chris, I want you and of course Shaun and Claudio to indulge me.",

        "And right now, we're seeing that unemployment overall went to 6.1 percent.",
        "It's over 10 percent in black communities.",
        "Claudio, why will the Republicans in your view help that situation?",
        "Well, I mean, I think if John McCain can explain how his plan for creating jobs, which is - kind of dovetails with his tax policies and also with the energy, with drilling and increasing different pursuits of sources of domestic energy, oil and these kinds of things.",
        "If he can really get into how these jobs are going to be created by, say, drilling in ANWR or drilling off the Gulf Coast, he can do an effective job of explaining how they can hopefully turn the tide in terms of the direction that jobs are going.",
        "But we haven't seen much of that yet in terms of the actual rhetoric and the actual policies.",
        "But that's what exactly is going to have to be focused on to be able to get the message across to voters that jobs under, say, a John McCain administration would start to spike back up."
