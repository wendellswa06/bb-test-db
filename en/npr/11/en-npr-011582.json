        "If they want to go on to college or grad school, more tests - tough ones, too, like the SAT and the GRE.",
        "Many parents pay to have their kids prepped for the exams, but what if you don't have the cash?",

        "Right.",
        "The goal is to provide information and resources up and down the pipeline: from the student who needs specific test preparation - how do I take the SAT, what are the things I need to know to do well on the SAT or the GMAT or the GRE or the LSAT - to the parent who needs to be able to guide the student to doing things at the right time in the right fashion across the board: to the administrators and educators who have enough on their plate dealing on a day-to-day basis with their part of educational process.",
        "Now, to throw a standardized test into the mix to add another area that they may not have precise expertise, so we want to be able to take as much of that weight off the shoulders of other people as possible."
