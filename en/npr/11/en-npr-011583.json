        "So most of the feedback that I got was more less about me not serving in the military as opposed to serving as a black man, because at that time, African-Americans looked at the military as a source of opportunity and - which is the reason why I talked to the recruiter in the first place.",

        "Well, the integration order was in 1948.",
        "Now, the first service to integrate was the Air Force; that occurred in 1949.",
        "That immediately spurred about 4,000 African-Americans to join the Air Force bringing the total number to about 25,000.",
        "Then you had the Korean war, and what happened in the Korean war was quite interesting.",
        "Initially, Army unites were segregated, and one unit at the 24th Infantry Regiment performed horribly.",
        "And the - actually, the poor performance of that unit convinced the Army that it had to integrate for the sake of combat performance.",
        "The brass believed that by integrating, they could create a better army.",
        "So the ground services integrated shortly - during the Korean war and - but the Navy was behind."
