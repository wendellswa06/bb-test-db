        "During the Cold War, you had a draft and as a consequence, the Navy had the pick of the crop as far as recruiting was concerned.",
        "Any one who was bright, who wanted to avoid the draft, and not have to serve on the ground joined the Navy.",
        "So as a consequence for most of the Vietnam War, the Navy didn't have problems because there weren't that many African-Americans in the Navy.",
        "In fact, in '71, only 5.3 percent of the Navy was African-American, and only about 0.7 percent of the officers were African-American.",

        "Right now, there is wide satisfaction.",
        "The Navy is one of the best places to work in the world as far as equal opportunity.",
        "It's a place where whites regularly work for blacks and do so happily in every warfare community; at every level of the chain of command.",
        "And that's thanks to Admiral Zumwalt and people like Commander Black - pioneers who made this possible.",
        "Commander, one last question, you are a pro-military, but some African-Americans are hesitant to join now, and there's been a drop in enlistment and reenlistment.",
        "If you were a young man out of college today, would you sign up?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "I would definitely consider the military.",
        "Of course, my first choice - and I always tell the young people - the first choice should be to go to college and continue your education.",
        "But if you can't go to college or don't have the resources or the grades, the military is a great opportunity because you can continue to grow and also, you can continue to - continue your education through the military.",
        "And I think the military is a great place, once again, if you don't have the resources for college.",
        "So that's what I would tell the young person today, but just be smart about what you go into.",
        "There is a lot of opportunity in the military in all branches, so just be smart and understand what you're getting yourself into.",
        "Well, John Sherwood, Commander Black, thank you both for joining us.",

        "It cost $11 million.",
        "The interviews were conducted a few years ago.",
        "At first NASA says the results would not be released because they might upset people who fly, and also the airlines.",
        "Tell us what you can about what's in these pages, and is there information that indicates there are serious safety problems with our air traffic system?",
        "Well, that is a matter of debate.",
        "It's 24,000 interviews.",
        "They went back to some pilots over and over.",
        "And they did it with a social science background - people who are experts in polling did a few questions up front, saw how those questions played, refined the questions, and then turned it loose on a very large body of pilots for several years.",
        "And they thought if they went back and analyzed these, they could find common areas of concern that might indicate what they call precursors - little factors that by themselves are not dangerous but might come together to form an accident.",
        "But they never got to the analysis stage.",
        "They also never got to the stage of asking other people important to safety like mechanics, flight attendants, et cetera.",
        "NASA said that this was taking too long and that the methodology wasn't tested, wasn't good, and gave up on it.",
        "I think some of this is a conflict between NASA, the engineers, and the social scientists they hired.",
        "But in any case, what they have now is a large mass of raw data that NASA says isn't terrifically useful.",
        "And the people who designed it say sure it is, go in and analyze it."
