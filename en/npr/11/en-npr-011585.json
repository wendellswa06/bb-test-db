        "And the way it shaped out as it made its way through the courts was that an intermediate appellate court had found that the police had violated guidelines that were enacted by the attorney general 10 years ago to more carefully regulate the way police conduct eyewitness identification procedures.",
        "Our feeling was that the police were properly responding to efforts by the suspects to intimidate the witnesses into silence and to prevent them from cooperating from the police and that all that the police did was urge the witnesses to man-up and to make an identification and that the police would take steps to protect them.",
        "So what happened was - is investigators who were involved with the case had spoken to the witness after he showed a little reluctance to identify a suspect, and then the witness went back in with a detective who was unaware of who the suspect was in the photo lineup that was presented, and then the witness was able to make an identification.",
        "The case then went up to the Supreme Court on our petition because the conviction was reversed based on the appellate division's finding that we violated those guidelines, and then after oral arguments were conducted, in which not only the parties appeared but also the Innocence Project, in which they were contesting the very - the soundness of the legal structure itself for evaluating eyewitness identifications.",
        "Once the court heard all of those broader systemic challenges, it issued an order saying that we don't have enough of a record in front of us to evaluate the soundness of our current legal system.",
        "So we're going to send this, all of this material to a special master, specially designated by the court, to review all of the social science in this area and make recommendations to the court as to whether we should retain our current framework or to make modifications to it.",

        "No, I think that our office is satisfied with the Supreme Court's decision.",
        "There was - the other side was advocating much more sweeping overhauls and reforms to the system, and we thought that the current system could be modified in a more limited way, and we're very satisfied because we think that the court essentially threaded the needle quite nicely by on the one hand rejecting the notion that our court system needs to suppress a lot more identifications that get to a jury or to dramatically overhaul the system.",
        "And on the other hand, the court saw that the right way to do this is to frankly better educate the participants in the system - whether they be judges, defense lawyers, prosecutors - as to what the police should be doing and what they are doing and in the course of the process better educating the jury, as well.",
        "Will the ruling change the way you and police officers in New Jersey do their job?",
        "It will change it in certain minor respects.",
        "We have to back up about 10 years, like I said, to these guidelines because a lot of the guidelines that were put in place back in 2001 by my office, and which surveys, which were - which we conducted in the midst of this hearing to see the level of compliance with police - they're already doing most of the things that the court says in its opinion should be done.",
        "There are a few minor things, and yes there will be needed - there will have to be supplemental training, but by and large, the way the police go about their business will be the same.",
        "As far as how this issue is litigated in court, the court essentially made the initial burden the same and ultimate burden of proof by the defense to justify suppression the same, but the way the actual issue is litigated is going to be modified a little bit, but we're comfortable with our ability to deal with that.",
