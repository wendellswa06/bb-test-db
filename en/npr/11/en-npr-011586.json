        "But in part because the Supreme Court hasn't looked at these issues for a long time, since before social scientists did a lot of their work, since before DNA has brought these misidentifications to light, where eyewitnesses made mistakes and sent innocent people to jail, a lot has changed over the last few decades.",
        "And finally now, we have a model for how to deal with the problem.",
        "What's the model?",
        "Well, in the New Jersey model, the court is actually focusing on factors that bear some relationship to the reliability of an eyewitness.",
        "Now, one of the things that I saw when I looked back at the criminal trials of these innocent people was that you had these eyewitnesses come into court saying I'm 100 percent certain that this is the person I saw who did it.",
        "It's either him or his twin brother.",
        "And we now know they were wrong.",
        "DNA proved that person innocent.",
        "It turns out they actually hadn't been so confident when they first were confronted with a lineup.",
        "The lineups themselves generated false confidence.",
        "And that's exactly what social scientists have seen in their studies.",
        "But what the Supreme Court said in its last decision on the subject, the Manson v.",
        "Braithwaite decision, was the eyewitness confidence is one of the markers that a court is supposed to look at when deciding whether to let in eyewitness testimony or not.",
        "And so that factor of confidence or certainty has no relationship to how accurate the eyewitness is.",
        "In fact, an eyewitness who has been mislead by a suggestion and told, you know, good job, you picked the right guy, will be more confident.",
        "And so that's just one example of courts focusing on the wrong factors.",
        "The other thing that the New Jersey court does it it's not an on-on switch anymore, on-off switch, I'm sorry.",
        "So typically the question is: Is a court going to let the eyewitness take the stand or not?",
        "And if the answer is no, then the entire prosecution may be derailed.",
        "And so what New Jersey has done is create an intermediate option, where assuming this eyewitness is going to take the stand, you at least educate the jury about how to assess that testimony, how to properly weigh it.",
        "And Paul Heinzel, in terms of giving instructions to a jury, which is, you know, a moving target and can be a tricky balance in terms of what information you give and what information you leave out, what sort of methods going forward do you think are going to be best practices?",
        "Well, what the content of those instructions is remains to be seen.",
        "The Supreme Court ordered a couple committees it has in place to tailor jury instructions to take up that project.",
        "Obviously, every member of those committees will have to read this opinion very carefully because this opinion is really a teaching opinion."

        "It's meant to educate, as I said, all the members of the relevant legal community on how to go about evaluating things that can influence a jury - I'm sorry, a witness' identification and how juries are to be more careful in assessing each of those factors that might go into an evaluation of how credible the witness' identification is; things like, you know, not only what the police did in whether they properly put together a lineup, whether they did anything to either purposely or inadvertently suggest who they believe the suspect is but also variables that are outside of their control; that is, you know, whether it was dark out, the witness' ability to see and so on and so forth.",
        "And those jury instructions are going to have to capture all of those factors, also mindful of the fact that the social science in this area is what they call probabilistic, it can't tell you if a given factor that may risk creating a more suggestive environment, that suggests the right answer, actually had any adverse effect on a witness or not, or whether the witness was right nonetheless.",
        "So the instructions are going to have to sort of walk a fine line here.",
        "And Brandon Garret, do you have an ideal jury instruction in mind, or is it - varies case to case?",
        "Well, I think what the court did was exactly the right thing, which is to identify the relevant factors, and in some cases, some of those factors may not be on point.",
        "You know, the court suggested a couple of other things, which I think were really interesting.",
        "For example, trials can be long, and it can be hard for jurors to remember everything that happened.",
        "One of the things that they suggest was maybe sometimes it would be appropriate to educate the juror and give them instructions at the time that they hear from the eyewitness and not wait until the very end.",

        "And I think, you know, we all know that it's hard to remember the faces of strangers that we encounter in our everyday lives, and police know it, too, and that's why they use a lineup as a test.",
        "But what the social science research has shown is that the test can actually shape the memory so that what's in our minds isn't a photograph of something that we saw or a video that we roll back when we're asked to remember the crime that we saw, but rather every time we remember it, it can shape the memory itself.",
        "And so if police say - and we were cut off, we didn't hear what Robert was told - but if the police told him good job, you got the guy; or look more closely at number four and tell us what you think; or good job, in fact that guy has a long record, a record as long as my arm.",
        "Any comments like that by the police will make someone who's not sure really sure.",
        "And so the test itself can distort someone's memory and even make them remember things that they didn't remember before and even cause them to identify an innocent person.",
        "Well, even short of a blanket statement like the examples you gave, if - you know, if a policeman's body language shows some cues that a witness who is eager to please picks up on, that can change their identification.",
        "Yeah, so the studies have also shown that even totally unintentional cues or unconscious cues can really affect an eyewitness, and part of is that you have to imagine the position this person is in: It's not a happy or stress-free thing to have to go to a police station and be confronted with photos of someone who might have been the person, say, who attacked you.",
        "And so a lot of eyewitnesses are crime victims are in a position of looking to the police for reassurance.",
        "And so they may perceive cues even that never took place, which can distort who they pick out and how they feel about it, how they testify about it if a case goes to court.",

        "How did they rig it, Howard?",

        "So all the other pictures had a suspect - was a person with a moustache like mine and aviator glasses, but the cheekbones were different, the hairline was different, and the - and two of the suspects were Hispanic, clearly Hispanic, and I'm very white, so.",
        "It was a rigged photo lineup, and then to top it off, there were two victims.",
        "The one who had the better view of the person they totally ignored.",
        "So I and my attorney found one of the other suspects who the police claimed they could never find, and we had them in the courtroom, and the victim identified them in the courtroom as the perpetrator.",
        "And then I was acquitted, but the police refused to arrest that person.",
        "Howard, thank you for your call.",
        "You know, the question of how the photo array or the lineup is conducted is also part of this research, you know, whether - whether even just the witness knows that one of the choices is correct or whether there's a possibility that none of them are, in fact, the perpetrator.",
        "Yes, so when I was looking at these trials of these people who we now know are innocent, I was surprised how often the victims, even when they were talking about the lineup, admitted that, you know, actually, now that I think about it, only one person in the lineup really looked anything like the suspect.",
        "You know, there was only one color photo, and that was of the defendant here.",
        "There was only one person in the lineup, or in the photo array more typically, who had a moustache that was anything like the attacker's.",
        "The defendant stood out.",
        "And I was surprised how often they remembered it, but then again, maybe it makes sense.",
