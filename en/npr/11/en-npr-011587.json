        "Thank you.",
        "What is going on in the mind of an eyewitness during a lineup or while looking at a photo array?",
        "Can you re-create that for us?",
        "Well, the tendency in general of an eyewitness is to assume that the perpetrator is among the people being shown.",
        "And partly as a result of that, the eyewitnesses tend to look at the lineup and try to identify the person who looks most - more like the perpetrator than the other members of the lineup.",
        "Now - and so we call that a relative judgment process, that is who looks more like the perpetrator relative to the others.",
        "But there's nothing particularly wrong with that, if you could assume that the perpetrator is in there.",
        "But if the perpetrator's not in there, there's still someone who looks more like the perpetrator than the other members of the lineup, and that person is at considerable risk.",
        "And what about the role of the officer there?",
        "How can they influence an eyewitness' memory?",
        "Well, it's a big role.",
        "And so I introduced the idea of double-blind lineups back in the 1980s.",
        "That's something that I think is perhaps the most important reform to lineups that could be made.",
        "And the idea of a double-blind lineup is the person who administers that lineup, whether it's with photos or a live lineup, should not know which person in this lineup is the suspected person and which ones are fillers because it's in the nature of people who are testing somebody else - this is well-established in scientific psychology, to influence the person they're testing; not intentionally, necessarily at all.",
        "Unintentionally, often without any awareness on the part of the person doing the testing.",
        "This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.",
        "I'm David Greene.",
        "And it is time for the puzzle.",
        "So for instance, I mean, maybe a witness looks at a lineup.",
        "The person administering it is usually the case detective, and the detective knows that his suspected person is number three and that one, two, four, five, six, those are just fillers, and the witness starts talking about number two.",
        "Well, number two, and then the investigator might say now, take your time, be sure you look at everyone, which tends to get the witness off of that person.",
        "But if they mention number three, it's tell me about number three.",
        "So it's a very interactive process, and the idea of a double-blind lineup just takes that completely out of the equation.",
        "We have an email from Paul in Jacksonville, who says: I've been robbed at gunpoint twice.",
        "Both times, all I could focus on was the gun, not the person holding it.",
        "I told the police I couldn't identify the gunman.",
        "So not only are we dealing with sort of the fallibility of memory in general but the fallibility of memory at a stressful time."

        "Well, that's right.",
        "And what he's referring to is something that we've established in social science for some time.",
        "It's called weapon focus.",
        "It's the tendency to - for the weapon to draw a lot of the attention or even most of the attention, which means you had little or no time to process the face.",
        "There are a lot of problems like that that occur at the time of witnessing a crime.",
        "Stress harms the ability to form good memories as well.",
        "Cross-racial identifications are less reliable than within-race identifications.",
        "You have these things often happening very quickly.",
        "You have them happening under conditions that maybe at a distance, there may be poor lighting.",
        "There are a lot of things that can lead to the witness having a very weak memory to begin with.",
        "And so when they get to the lineup, you know, they sort of feel like a failure if they can't identify someone.",
        "So among other things, not only are they using potentially relative judgments - who looks most like him - as opposed to true recognition, which is actually very fast, they're also looking for cues, various kinds of cues, looking to the lineup administrator, who may or may not be giving cues.",
        "I mean, I think Brandon makes a very good point that the cues may not be there, but they're being read by the witness anyway.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let's take a call from Chris(ph) in Evansville, Illinois.",
        "Chris, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Oh, hi there.",
        "I was in an incident and the eyewitnesses, they were just so vastly different in the way they describe the situation.",
        "They just try to - one person described my car as being brown, and it was white.",
        "They described the other person's truck - or car as a truck, you know?",
        "And it was - they were no more than 40 yards away, you know.",
        "And they tried to - the police, they tried to get eyewitness accounts from people at a bowling alley that was more than 150 yards away, you know?",
        "And I just don't - I just think they reach - a lot of times, they're reaching whenever they're trying to find witnesses and identify people, you know?",
        "And I just really think the witness, the eyewitness account, I agree, it is very flawed, you know?",
        "Chris, thanks for your call.",
        "And let me just say that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Brandon Garrett, that issue of more than eyewitness having a different version of events, was that something that came up a lot in your research?",
        "Yes, and I think people have this idea that, well, what if multiple eyewitnesses identify someone, then that must mean it's especially reliable.",
        "On the other hand, what if eyewitnesses are inconsistent?",
        "Does that mean that they saw different things?",
        "In these cases involving wrongful convictions, you often had eyewitnesses who said very different things initially.",
        "But as they attended police lineups and their memory was tested and the like, their memories somehow converged, so that by the time of trial, they were both sure that it was the defendant, and they described someone who look like the defendant even though their initial descriptions were really different.",
        "And so you could really see in those cases the effect that all of these different lineup procedures and the like and the conversations with the police were having on them, again, in these unusual cases, where we know with the benefit of DNA that they got it wrong.",
        "Now, most cases obviously can't be - can't benefit from DNA testing, so you really wonder, you know, how often do these procedures play a role in affecting the memory of people where DNA can't save us.",
        "We'll never know whether this person is innocent and guilty based on fancy science.",
        "Instead, there's this sort of unease that you feel knowing that some of these wrongful convictions occur because of eyewitness mistakes and because of the procedures that police used.",
        "Brenda(ph) from Aiken, South Carolina, is on the line.",
        "Brenda, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I wrongly identified someone one time.",
        "I was held up at gunpoint.",
        "And I worked as an independent contractor.",
        "And when I went into a factory to do an inspection several weeks later, I was certain I saw the young man.",
        "And, I mean, it just set me back.",
        "I was so sure.",
        "So I called the police and I said I found the guy.",
        "And the detectives who had caught the case the day I reported the robbery did an investigation, and they were convinced it could not have been him.",
        "And so they sat down with me and went over it and I said, if it's - if you're sure, then that's good enough for me.",
        "Oh, and in the meantime, they had, of course, arrested the guy and charged him and then they did their investigation.",
        "And in the meantime, I had gone down and picked him out of a lineup."

        "And to the day I die, I will be grateful that those two law enforcement - those two officers did their job and did it thoroughly because that young man had a little bit of a police record, petty crimes, and armed robbery would have gone very harshly for him had he been convicted.",
