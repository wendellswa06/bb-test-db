        "And I can tell you from first hand experience, it's very difficult to raise money from state and federal sources, and it's very difficult to receive money from financial institutions and other corporate donors who want to participate.",
        "And if a tobacco manufacturer in the Commonwealth of Virginia wants to contribute to a slavery museum - a very important message and a very important aspect of our American history here in America and in Virginia - I say let's take that money.",
        "But at the same time, I think that group needs to take its fight in other means and other manners.",
        "And trying to cut off resources in a very difficult fundraising climate, I think, is the wrong way to do it.",
        "I'm going to go back to you, Walter, because, obviously, you have a very moving and very important personal story.",
        "What can be done if you think that this money should not flow to this organization?",
        "What can be done to find other contributors that you think would be more aligned with the mission?",
        "Well, I think that's a marketing challenge on the part of the museum.",
        "And I think if we look at the tobacco industry - you know, if they really want to make a contribution, make it towards a health care fund, to individuals who've been damaged by tobacco.",
        "You know, there are some meaningful ways that this industry could provide a valuable service to society.",
        "And I think what they do by making these type of contributions, I think tongue-in-cheek they say we're with you, but we also want to make sure that we cover our you-know-what, because we understand the damage we've done to the very community that we now claim that we support.",
        "So, I think, for the museum and other black museums across the country, I understand the difficulty of fund raising, but at some point in time you have to ask yourself are you sort of defeating your own purposes here when you begin to accept money from sources that clearly have been aligned against the very community you purport to represent?",
        "And I think it handicaps it in a way of telling the whole story.",
        "Let's tell the whole story.",
        "You know, perhaps maybe the contributions should come with the caveat that you have to tell the whole story about tobacco and how slave labor was used picking tobacco for free as part of the museum's exhibit.",
        "I'd like to see how that story is told before they take this contribution.",
        "All right.",
        "I would agree with that last point that Walter made.",
        "But I don't - you know, the responsibility that exists in our community is to educate our young people and our adults about healthy living.",
        "If you go on these people's Web sites - and they may be as horrible as they want to be, and I would - have admitted them are and have outright lied.",
        "But what they do now by law and by interest is talk about the danger of smoking on their own Web site.",
        "So the question is where are we?",
        "You know, we can't cough our way, certainly, to freedom.",
        "But we've got to raise some of the questions about these lifestyles, and many of the people who are leaders look at their own lifestyles and the examples that they're putting out there.",
