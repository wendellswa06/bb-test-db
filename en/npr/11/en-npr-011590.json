        "But the fact is Iraq - coming hard on the heels of an incomplete mission in Afghanistan, that is to say it was done, it was done successfully, but it still lingers - and with all the other responsibilities we assigned to our military, is taxing our forces - especially our Army, and to a lesser extent our Marine Corps - in ways that are, on the long run, unhealthy, unwholesome, and not good for our national security.",

        "The law requires voters to present photo ID prior to voting and some of the folks who contest it say that that requires, you know, lengthy drives to get very expensive photo identification.",
        "In effect, it precludes them from voting and the claim had been - the civil rights groups have certainly claimed and Democrats have claimed that it's really just a thinly veiled way of disenfranchising foreign minority voters.",
        "Underneath it all is a very, very large sort of partisan ideological conflict that has grown up in this country in the last couple of years, essentially since Bush v Gore were, on the one hand, you have the GOP claiming that there's a rampant vote fraud problem and that people are illegally stuffing the ballot boxes and the things like these voter ID laws need to be enacted in order to do away with that.",
        "On the other hand, you have Democrats saying, no, there's no vote - such thing as vote fraud.",
        "In fact, there's this enormous effort at vote suppression as suppressing, intimidating minority and poor voters in order to sort of stuffed the ballot box as in a different way.",
        "And so underneath this specific Indiana case, there's a whole circuit split, different courts of appeals have gone different ways on similar voter ID measures.",
        "So it, hopefully, will be a way for the court to sort of weigh in on a question that has really, really divided this country and certainly, the jurists in this country on increasingly partisan lines."

        "We have - over the past several years, several administrations - considered ourselves roughly a million person army.",
        "And that roughly has broken down to half in the active duty Army, the other half in the reserves, that is the Guard and reserves.",
        "Now, those aren't precisely the numbers.",
        "It's roughly 500,000 or thereabouts for the active Army, and then the - maybe 340,000 or so in the guard, and another 190,000 or so in the reserves, something like that.",
        "Of those, 140,000 of the active forces are in Iraq.",

        "Say 39 brigade combat teams in the army, building towards 42.",
        "Sixteen of them are in Iraq.",
        "How many people are in a brigade?",
        "Well, somewhere between 5 and 6,000 is in a brigade combat team, something like that.",
        "So, and then maybe another two and half in Afghanistan, 16 brigades roughly in the United States being reset, retrained.",
        "Some taking leave - there's not much leave in the armed services these days, however.",
        "And then, of course, we've got some scattered around.",
        "We've got that force there at the DMZ in North Korea, in what we've always considered the most sensitive border in the world.",
        "So, roughly, half of our combat force is committed to Iraq right now, and you've - you know, we recently heard from General Casey that he may need more.",
        "Unpack that situation a little bit for us.",
        "General Casey said that he might consider increasing troop strength in Iraq, but then we're also hearing that in 12 to 18 months, we may try to turn Iraq over to Iraqi forces.",
        "Is this a short-term increase and then followed by decrease?",
        "Or how do you parse out what that actually means?",
        "Well, let's try to look at it in the fairest for our commanders, but also in the clearest way for us sitting here in the United States to analyze it.",
        "If I were an unfriendly critic of our Armed Forces and of our general officers, I'd say that's an estimate born of desperation.",
        "But I'm not, and I think what I will say it's an estimate born of reality, and that reality is this: the present force simply is not proving to be able, using lots of different tactics to stem the continued increase of violence - specifically in Baghdad, and at large in Iraq."
