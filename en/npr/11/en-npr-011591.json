        "And so he's likely to need forces just to hold on.",
        "As a long term solution, I think just about everybody now has come around to the conclusion that we need to be looking for an endgame and an endgame that is not far away.",
        "And if you wanted to know in my view the best indicator of what are our active military generals are thinking, keep an eye on what Representative John Murtha says.",
        "Of the members of Congress, he is the one most in constant touch with them and most attuned to their thinking.",
        "Well, Murtha has also been a controversial figure in some ways, really going against what the administration said its capabilities were.",
        "But you're saying that he's the most - he's the most knowledgeable.",
        "Well, he is the most knowledgeable.",
        "And remember, John Murtha - and bless his soul - he confesses that every time he stands up was one of the staunch voices and votes in favor of the administration's course in going into Iraq.",
        "But he has also said, and I think we all remember that he came out and said it's not working and we need to plan on bringing ourselves out of there in an orderly fashion.",
        "Over the years of his career - he is now the ranking member of appropriations, but for a long time he's a ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee of House Appropriations.",
        "And he has always supported our Army, our Marines, whenever they needed a voice to say this is what they need to train.",
        "This is what they need to get the equipment they need.",
        "This is what their size needs to be.",
        "And for that reason, he often talks with senior officers and often hears from them.",
        "Now, you have people like Senator John Warner saying this isn't working.",
        "But at this point, being a secretary of the Army in the past and having served, you know, both in the Army and in Veterans Affairs, what would you do at this point?",
        "Let me say something from my experience, such as it is as a civilian who has been part of and watched, and as a citizen.",
        "Our involvement over time in a number of the theaters - say from my time as a captain during our time in Vietnam, I was assigned to the Pentagon during that period.",
        "We're very good at planning - for the most part - how we will go in, how we will advance, how we will consolidate.",
        "But I don't think there is any society on earth or any military force that's really all that good at planning how to withdraw under advanced circumstances.",
        "And exit plan is always easier to talk about than execute.",
        "Let me give you an example.",
        "We couldn't just up and announce one day that we're leaving, and everybody is out the next day.",
        "That's physically impossible, humanly impossible, and also very unwise - one day there, and the next day the floodgates open.",
        "By the same token, phased withdrawals - which is what military leaders and planners favor, they're about the only ones we can execute - are very difficult.",
        "Because as you draw down your force, the force that remains is even more and more vulnerable to attacks from the enemy if the enemy hasn't agreed to stand back.",
        "And so pretty soon you're left with a scene not unlike that scene that many people remember as we pulled out of Vietnam with the helicopters taking off from Saigon, people rushing to cling - and the North Vietnamese overrunning the streets and at the gates.",
        "It's a difficult scenario, the one - and everyone's talking about a variation on the same one.",
        "A phased one in which we turn over increasingly more responsibility to Iraqi security forces is the best way, but it is also the hardest to figure out how we are going to precisely do it.",
        "So what's the best case scenario for the United States' military at this point?"

        "Best case scenario is, frankly, not far from where we are in terms of getting to a resolution.",

        "New Century Financial had to absorb billions of dollars in unpaid loans from barrowers who defaulted on their subprime loans.",

        "And here is where that really sticky point comes.",
        "We have to communicate to the Iraqi government a timetable - some days, some dates, a point by which - several points by which - and, of course, the answer, the other side of that is once you do and the dissident elements learn of it, they either ratchet up their activity so that they can begin to position themselves to really attack whatever is left behind as a government once we go on the date certain.",
        "Or they lay low until that date certain and then erupt again.",

        "The more striking thing from his opening statement was just how angry he was at being accused, saying his life and his reputation have been ruined.",
