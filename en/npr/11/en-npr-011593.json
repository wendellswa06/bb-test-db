        "So you're locked in now to about 10 percent interest?",
        "No. We since - we refinanced three or four times.",
        "Oh.",
        "So what is your interest rate now?",
        "We have 6.5 percent.",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "So now, are you in a regular loan?",
        "I think we've climbed into the Alt-A category.",
        "So I think 6.5 is not a paper, but it's a five-year adjustable.",
        "So you basically were able to use the subprime loan to your advantage.",
        "In other words, you got into a house that you wouldn't have been able to get into and the value of your house increased, and so you were able to refinance and now you're in a regular loan.",
        "Well, I would say that not only we're able to get into a house that we wouldn't able to get to otherwise, we wouldn't able to get to any house without subprime mortgages being available.",
        "So, you know, all the news about subprimes is pretty terrible, and subprimes are getting a really bad rap, and, in fact, companies that issue them are - some of them are on the verge of bankruptcy.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "Well, you know, don't throw the baby out with the bath water.",
        "I think you have to separate fraudsters and the individuals engaged in predatory practices, fraudulent practices from the subprime products themselves.",
        "Subprime products do have a place in the financial market, but you have to be able, though, to enforce the laws against folks who misled people into - and failed to disclose what people were getting into.",
        "That has nothing really to do with the subprime product, but rather the greed of the individuals involved who do the deal and make the money."

        "And as you recall, the vote came out 87 to 13, and the thirteen were Democrats.",
        "So there's even a minority of Democrats that think a date ought to be set.",
        "I think in regard to the editorial that you have to remember that Bush would like to get out today as well.",
        "We don't relish the opportunity of being there, but on the other hand we feel that we have made a commitment as long as we're a guest of the government of Iraq.",
        "If they told us to go tomorrow, we'd have to get out tomorrow.",
