        "Garcia serves as a master of ceremony at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle.",
        "In a letter to Cardinal Wuerl that was posted on an advocate's blog, Deacon Garcia wrote of the anguish that victims of clerical sex abuse experience and said, quote, \"\"the time for cowardice and inaction is long past.\"\" And he added that, quote, \"\"no amount of apology will suffice unless and until bishops and other complicit clergy resign,\"\" unquote.",
        "In that letter.",
        "Deacon Garcia informed Cardinal Wuerl that he can no longer, in good conscience, assist him during Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral.",
        "Deacon Garcia was kind enough to come into our studios in Washington, D.C., to tell us more about his letter.",

        "A recent grand jury report in Pennsylvania described hundreds of allegations of child abuse believed to have been committed by some 300 priests, some of whom were supervised by then-Bishop Wuerl.",
        "Was it the grand jury report that prompted this letter, or was it something else?",
        "It was the Pennsylvania grand jury report that inspired me to write as I did and take the action that I did.",
        "I take it it was a hard decision, and I can - if you don't mind my saying, I feel that, even now, it feels difficult for you.",
        "Well, if any lawmakers were hoping to hash some of this out over a drink, we've got bad news.",
        "One of Capitol Hill's favorite watering holes is closing.",
        "For 44 years, the Hawk 'n' Dove was the preferred dive bar of politicos of every stripe.",
        "It was a difficult decision, but I think it was one that's necessary under the circumstances.",
        "I think it's incumbent upon, especially those of us who minister to the faithful, to always keep foremost in our minds the tremendous pain and suffering that the victims of sexual abuse at the hands of clergy and other church personnel have gone through and to foster as best we can genuine healing, not only for the victims themselves first and foremost but also for all of the faithful for whom the events of the last few weeks, to be sure but also events going back now generations, the pain that we all feel that's associated with the crisis.",
        "You said that the cardinal is compromised now, unlike his predecessor, Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who had to resign in disgrace after his own personal behavior was deemed to have been inappropriate in a number of circumstances.",
        "There are credible allegations that he had sexually harassed minors and priests and seminarians.",
        "That's not the case with Cardinal Wuerl.",
        "It's more that he had not taken appropriate action to remove these priests about whom there were allegations.",
        "Is that what compromise is - I guess the question would be - what is it that has compromised Cardinal Wuerl in your view?"
