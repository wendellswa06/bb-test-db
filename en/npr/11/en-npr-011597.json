        "Materially better off, a lot of them, although there are some that have been losers as the old state system has collapsed.",
        "They also have more freedoms now than they had under communism, but they do not have more freedoms than they had during the Yeltsin period.",
        "President Putin has imposed stability, which a lot of Russians very much want, and a firm hand at the top, which a lot of Russians very much want, but at the expense of free press, a really vital pluralistic democracy, and the KGB - that is to say the old KGB, the security organs, are now back.",

        "And we just have to hope - and I think a lot of Russians hope - that this will be a passing phase.",
        "How much of the situation in Russia, credit or blame, can be laid at the feet of Mr. Putin?",
        "Or on the other hand, maybe you would say that Russia is shaped by circumstance very much.",
        "No, I think Mr. Putin deserves, as it were, both credit for some things that are going pretty well and blame for some things that are moving in an ominous direction.",
        "One of his favorite phrases is the vertical of power.",
        "That doesn't sound like terribly good English, but that is the Russian phrase."
