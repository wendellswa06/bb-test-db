        "And that's - first, that health policies really take presidential leadership if anything is going to happen.",
        "But more important for us, that this is one area where the president's humanity really shines out.",
        "Presidents don't - you know, they don't feel hunger or homelessness.",
        "They don't go on welfare as a general rule.",
        "They don't go to jail.",
        "So all those kinds of policy areas are a kind of distant and maybe cerebral to the lives of the presidents.",
        "But they all get sick and they all have families that get sick.",
        "So what we really wanted to find out was the illness that runs in the families and through the White House.",

        "Eleven of them died prematurely, significantly before the rest of their generation.",

        "Well, let me remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow talking with James Morone, who is co-author with David Blumenthal of \"\"The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office.",
        "You know, and what's interesting is that we really never realize the influence of Republican presidents on health care.",
        "We always think about, you know, health care as being a Democratic issue.",
        "But you write in your book about the presidents who really were most involved, the Republicans.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's frustrating for Democrats writing books.",
        "My co-author is here in the Obama administration.",

        "So, yes, the great health reform victory is Lyndon Johnson.",
        "And maybe we'll get a chance to talk about that in the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, he was extraordinary.",
        "But you put Lyndon Johnson aside, and what you have are a series of pretty remarkable events around Republicans.",
        "You mentioned Richard Nixon.",
        "His childhood was fraught by, as you said, tuberculosis.",
        "His younger brother died and then his older brother.",
        "The family favorite came down with TB.",

        "She went to Arizona, started caring for other boys with TB so she could afford the rent.",
        "So Richard is left with his abusive father, no mother.",
        "And the mother doesn't come home until the second brother has died as well.",
        "Richard Nixon's career - very strange political career - he flashes on the scene as a great red baiter, a meat-eating conservative.",
        "But even in those early days as a congressman, he was very liberal on health care.",
        "And from the White House tapes, the infamous White House tapes, we now have really quite sad stories of him talking to people.",
        "And again and again, he'd - when it came to health care, he'd say, oh, I know about this.",
        "And then he'd go on a long rambling story that really touched his soul.",
        "And the result is we came very close to national health insurance.",
        "Kennedy, the great - Ted Kennedy; the great congressman from Arkansas, Wilbur Mills, the great health reformer; and Nixon, almost pulled off the national health insurance that is still the model for national health insurance today.",
        "Again, Ronald Reagan of all people - Ronald Reagan - government is the problem, Ronald Reagan - he really believed in catastrophic health insurance for Medicare.",
        "Now, entire cabinet was against it.",
        "All his advisers were against it, but Reagan pushed it through.",
        "It really touched something in him.",
        "And one final example of Republicans who were successful in pushing health reform, and that's George Bush.",
        "Bush - you know, we've talked to a lot of people in the Bush White House.",
        "And the picture that emerges of Bush is not the usual picture we get on most other policy areas.",
        "He was very focused on getting the Prescription Drug Reform.",
        "All right.",
        "Hang on to that thought.",

        "We've lost our leader for it.",
        "The minority of advisers and, reportedly, the economists were: let's get out of this health care thing while we can, get out alive, and Obama overruled them with, apparently the minority of the people in the room saying so.",
