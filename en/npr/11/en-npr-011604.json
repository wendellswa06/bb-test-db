        "Now, you and your brother used to work at another test prep company.",
        "Did you ever think that what you were doing then - or even what you're doing now; - it's just not fair?",
        "Students should live and die by their own abilities and not be coached.",
        "Well, that's sort of a sticky question in that - Michael Jordan was coached, so does that mean had he not been coached, he would have been as good a player?",
        "Right?",
        "So everyone needs coaching along the way, which is sort of the foundation of education.",
        "Someone else has information that you need, and to draw out your best skills and your best ability, you look for someone with more information than you have.",
        "I think the industry - the test prep industry - gets flak and - and rightfully so when you look at the cost of some of these things.",
        "All right?",
        "So it shouldn't be held for ransom someone's success.",
        "Do you think that, essentially, test prep companies arose because the schools were not doing what they should have done?",
        "Again, like all of these educational issues are somewhat sticky.",
        "It's a question of somewhat of the chicken and the egg: What led to what?",
        "The need for measuring student ability and differentiating students is a primary motivator of the creation of these tests - to measure the success of your school, to measure the success of a program, so all of these things are the primary motivator for standardized test existence.",
        "The mechanism of standardized tests is under fire because they are so coachable.",
        "All right?",
        "Because if I can pay $1,500 and get 300 points more, what does that mean to me?",
        "So I don't know that it's so much that the schools are failing or, you know, not necessarily that the schools are failing; it's a reflection of the problems in the educational system in the country.",
        "Very briefly, if I were a sophomore and went in to you to get some coaching for the SAT, give me an example of one thing that you would do with me.",
        "I would make sure that you understood how the test was scored, that on the SAT, unless you can eliminate an answer or two, it's actually a disadvantage to guess blindly.",
        "So that might amount to 40, 50 points for some students.",
        "And how long do you work with a student?",
        "Our typical program is 40 hours spread over anywhere from 10 to 12 weeks depending on what kind of partnership we set up.",
        "But that's also hard to define because we look to set up partnerships with schools and organizations to provide more broad information rather than simply work with an individual student, which we also do, but the focus is really on increasing the information generally, so that everyone can be on board with helping someone.",
        "Well, Akil, thank you so much."

        "Well, it probably started with the tuck rule, when they beat the Raiders with the benefit of a obscure rule that actually existed in the NFL but, to anybody's knowledge, had never been applied.",
        "From there, you got to Spygate, where the Patriots were accused of spying on the other team.",
        "Then you got to Deflategate, where Tom Brady was accused of having footballs deflated during their win over the Indianapolis Colts, which is a violation of NFL rules.",
        "Then you had, basically, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady being associated with Donald Trump, which is its own set of red flags.",

        "I mean, even last year, when they lost to the Eagles in the Super Bowl, everybody was excited about the Eagles winning for the first time ever.",
        "But eventually, that all sort of churned back into, OK, what's the AFC going to do about New England this year?",
        "Because the dynasty must die.",
