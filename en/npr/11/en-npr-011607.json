        "In the hope of getting American pressure for a cessation of hostilities, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is journeying to Washington later this month to see President Bush, for in the coming months, the future of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship may be influenced more by power struggles in the two camps than developments between the two camps.",

        "Netanyahu narrowly failed to win a vote in the Likud Central Committee to hold a new election for party leader next April, but Netanyahu continues to be a thorn in Sharon's side.",
        "If Netanyahu eventually succeeds in deposing Sharon from the leadership of the right-wing party, the incumbent prime minister would probably try to stay in office, assembling a new coalition of supportive Likudniks along with Labor and perhaps one or more of the fringe parties, but Sharon will probably be weakened in negotiations with the Palestinians.",

        "In recent municipal elections, Fatah, Abbas' party, and Hamas emerged as the major players.",

        "On both sides, Israeli and Palestinian, there appears to be a struggle for legitimacy.",
        "On each side, there are hard-liners seeking to wrest control of policy and return to confrontational oppositions.",
        "That this drama is being played out, at least for now, by ballot rather than bullet may itself be a hopeful sign.",

        "He has a huge lead in New York state polls, and a big victory would put him a lot closer to clinching the nomination.",
        "But even with their hopes dimmed today, Trump's rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, do see a long path ahead and plenty of chances for an open convention.",
