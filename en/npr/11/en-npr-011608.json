        "So, there were obviously things that they did do.",
        "The other thing they did, of course, is they did get pregnant, and they did have children.",

        "It starts as something called the French Boils, in the town of Naples in the end of the 15th Century.",

        "They've always been asleep, or they've been looking at themselves in a mirror, or coyly looking away.",
        "So, the kind of shock value of a woman without clothes on starring back at you, almost as if in invitation, has never happened before.",
        "This woman is looking directly at you.",
        "And she's in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and when I was writing The Birth of Venus, I used to pass by her after I'd been to the Botticelli's, which was what I was working on, and think, who are you?",
        "And when I started researching her, of course, the fact is, when Titian paints her in Venice, she couldn't be a known woman.",
        "She would've been actually disgraced, because clearly, she's recognizable.",
        "And if you now read Titian's letters, it's pretty certain she was a courtesan.",

        "And if you like, that's the balancing act that I'm trying to do.",
        "I'm trying to create a good story that makes you want to read the book, and along with following the story, because you need to get to the end, kind of almost painlessly, you'll learn something about what it was like to live in that extraordinary time in the Renaissance in Florence.",
        "But never because I went, sit down, listen to this and then repeat it after me.",
