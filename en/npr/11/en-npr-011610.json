        "And she then collected the papers and read them, and she found it was impossible to tell who the people were who really had gone to camp and who were the people who were making it up.",
        "Because the camp experience is so pervasive in our culture - in movies, in books, in TV stories, in stories you hear from your friends - that people, even people who didn't go to camp, feel like they went to camp, and they've been through this process of psychological sorting, figuring out whether they liked the camp that they didn't go to or didn't like the camp that they didn't go to.",
