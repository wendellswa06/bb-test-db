        "So Amanda, is the good old-fashioned go-to-your-room grounding thing just a thing of the past?",
        "Well, it's a little bit more complicated today than it used to be, certainly, because sending somebody to their room doesn't have the same effect if there's a laptop in there that connects you to your social network.",
        "So certainly to be more effective in your grounding today, you might want to be employing some restrictions on the digital tools that your kids have in their -at their disposal.",
        "And how can you do that?",
        "Well, I think it depends on the teen, obviously.",
        "If you have a 12-year-old boy who's really into video games, you're probably going to be more interested in taking away his or her Xbox - or his Xbox, than you are going to be in taking away his Facebook page, which he may or may not have.",
        "But if you have a really social kid who is using Facebook, who is using instant messaging and who has a cell phone, and that's probably about 75 percent of teens today, you have to decide what - where are you going to employ these restrictions.",
        "If you really want your grounding to be this total sort of return to the home and a sort of a pulling back from your friends and your social relationships, then you will need to cut off those other avenues.",
        "And let's just remind ourselves of the pain that can inflict.",
        "You recently found that the average teen sends about 50 texts a day and a third send double that?",
        "Yeah, more than - in fact, about a third - yes, a hundred, and about 15 percent send 200, which is about 6,000 texts a month.",
        "And for many teens, it is really the primary way they are talking with their friends.",
        "Well, actually, it would kind of scare me to take my daughter's cell phone away, because I like to have that communication with her.",
        "And also, because I don't think they start to ground her boyfriend as well.",
        "But I take her car keys away and make her catch a ride with her sister, that seems to be the most inconvenient and humiliating thing I can do to her."

        "What do you think these words say about American culture?",
        "Well, I do think the one that speaks most loudly really is `integrity' because I think that is kind of the lost quality in our lives.",

        "When I look and I see words like `pandemic,' I obviously see people who are concerned about what could become a major issue in the year ahead.",
        "When you see `levee' and `tsunami,' I think you see the fact that natural disasters really do touch our hearts.",
        "When you see `contempt' and `filibuster,' I think you see a people that are concerned about current events.",

        "Well, the word that is off to the strongest start, I have to say, is `pandemic.",
