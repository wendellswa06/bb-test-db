        "So I think that's, you know, that's really - and what parents should be doing.",

        "Because there certainly are kids who are tech savvy enough and who have enough time and incentive to get around whatever kind of technological barriers we're putting up in front of them to keep them offline, in a way, from their sort of online social spaces.",
        "Not every kid is that savvy, and there's a lot of, you know, very - you know, if you reset passwords and if you have parental controls set, there's a lot of things that parents can do and plenty of kids either won't try or don't have the knowledge to get around it.",
        "But there certainly are a subset who do, and who would be delighted to spend their time now in solitary, in their room, hacking away at the computer controls that you've put on to their machine.",
        "Flo, thanks so much for your call.",
        "Well, because I remember, Amanda, your study did find the kids have certainly a knack for getting around restrictions in school when they're not supposed to use text messages."
