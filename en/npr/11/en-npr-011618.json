        "Amid the chaos of Katrina and postponed Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Congress returned to session today.",
        "Helping the victims of Hurricane Katrina is obviously at the top of the agenda, as are angry questions about the muddled federal response.",
        "Earlier today, President Bush announced he will head an investigation into what happened.",
        "The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will also hold its own hearings according to a joint announcement today by Senators Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Susan Collins of Maine.",
        "Senator Collins asked why the lessons learned after the September 11th attacks appear to have done little to mitigate this new tragedy.",
        "How is it possible that almost four years to the day after the attacks on our country, with billions of dollars spent to improve our preparedness, that a major area of this nation was so ill-prepared to respond to a catastrophe?",
        "There have also been a number of proposals to aid the recovery effort in various ways.",
        "We're joined now from Capitol Hill by Representative Mark Foley, Republican of southern Florida.",
        "He's no stranger to hurricane devastation; four touched down in his district last year.",
        "Thanks so much for being with us today, Congressman.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "Now you've introduced legislation to remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "How much support are you getting for that, and why introduce that legislation?",
        "Well, we'll see how much support I get.",
        "I've been asking for this effort for quite some time, even before the first hurricane struck Florida, because of my concerns was when we rapidly tried to create an agency to provide comfort and safety for America, I was worried that, in fact, we would have created the ultimate albatross, which is a colossal bureaucracy that has to report too many chains of command to get a simple decision made.",
        "So I think in light of all the commentary on FEMA, on the response--and some blame needs to be shared by local and state governments, but at least at the moment, I believe separating FEMA, creating it and putting it back in the place it was to respond to these natural disasters would be a great step forward in trying to create, if you will, the agency that I think we all depend on and, frankly, we desperately need in these times of crisis.",
        "Well, from your own experience with hurricanes in your state, what else do you think the federal government can do to be quicker in response to this kind of disaster, more effective on the ground and get there as soon as they're needed?",
        "Well, I think it's preplanning.",
        "And what I find regretful is that the local governments didn't do more to evacuate prior to the storm.",
        "There's no question we've all known, particularly in Florida, that with the hurricane season upon us--Max Mayfield from NOAA, a national weather organization, have all predicted that this would be an extraordinarily active storm.",
        "Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, did what was right and ordered evacuations far in advance of the storm so that there was an orderly departure from homes.",
        "That should be the norm, not the exception.",
        "People were waiting too late to leave New Orleans despite the fact that it's long been known as a potential disaster area based on its location below sea level."

        "So I think there has to be a lot more preplanning.",
        "Clearly, there has to be more resources in place and ready.",
        "There has to be a greater coordination with the United States military, as evidenced by their rapid response once they were asked to join the effort.",
        "They then were able to get the convoys in necessary to help remediate some of the crisis that was unfolding before our very eyes.",
        "But the federal government does need to do more than just do modeling and planning.",
        "FEMA says over the last several months, they've been studying the tsunami and its effect on the community and has an action plan ready for a comparable disaster.",
        "Well, they may have done the test drill, but they failed miserably in the real-life exercise.",
        "Now something else you've proposed is that you want to bring home National Guard troops from the affected areas, you want to bring them home from Iraq, is that correct?",

        "And when Iglesias said no, Domenici said I'm sorry to hear that and hung up on him.",
        "Iglesias described his feelings as just being sick afterwards at having felt very pressured to do something that was for completely political reasons.",
        "And, of course, Domenici denying that on news programs over the weekend.",

        "Well, he was the funniest ouster in the sense that he's the only one who the Justice Department expressly said he did nothing wrong.",
        "We just got him out of the way so that a guy called Tim Griffin could take his job.",
        "Griffin's chief qualification to be the big prosecutor in Arkansas would have been his work as an opposition researcher for Karl Rove and the GOP.",
        "So Cummins is in a particularly fraught situation.",
        "He did nothing wrong.",
        "But he did testify today that he got a phone call from a senior Justice Department official who essentially said - and this is on February 20th, so after this had started to erupt as a scandal - that if Cummins or the other U.S.",
        "attorneys who'd been ousted participated with the congressional investigation or gave quotes to the press, the gloves would be off.",
        "And, you know, the Justice Department would have no choice but to embarrass them and disclose the real gory details of why they were dismissed.",
        "And Cummins and the other U.S.",
        "attorneys today testified that that just really made them mad.",
        "They felt terribly betrayed."

        "I had to strong-arm the pharmaceutical companies to give me plenty of samples, because I was writing samples and medications for those who had insurance, but those who didn't, particularly the elderly, they would leave here with grocery sacks full of medications."

        "Then read ahead: we're here, and then a week into this clinic, I became seriously ill and had several surgeries, and went through my own personal storm.",
        "And at times, it was very difficult, because that at time, after Rita, the volunteerism kind of stopped.",
        "And then we were not the hot topic, you know, but there was still a need, and there is still a need, a great need.",
        "Although it was declared a state of emergency, we had a difficult time getting doctors credentialed to work in these clinics that I was in, because it wasn't a site deemed by FEMA as a disaster site.",

        "It was now declared a site, but it was always a hassle getting these doctors to come in.",

        "They had a huge center that the, the Department of Health and Hospital at the Jimmy Swaggart Building.",

        "It was absolutely crazy.",
        "They just didn't have it together, and they were not looking for the help to get it together.",
        "Then, while I was recuperating, I was told about a FEMA clinic.",
        "But I come to find out that--I thought was going to be taking care of people who were evacuees and so forth and so on, but it turns out that I was taking care of FEMA workers who were working at the morgue, and the Red Cross was there providing back rubs for the FEMA workers.",
        "Now, that's good, but you know, I'm a little bit miffed because I was just told, maybe three or four weeks ago, that children are needing this and children are needing that--and now, I don't mind taking care of FEMA employees, they need help too when they get sick--but you would not believe the waste.",
        "You would not believe what I saw.",

        "When a hurricane causes severe damage to a city, it often raises the question of whether people should've be living in the worst affected areas in the first place, and should they then be allowed to return?",
        "For some in New York City, nearly two years after Hurricane Sandy, the answer to those questions is no. In Staten Island, the state is tearing hundreds of houses down.",
        "Here's Matthew Schuerman of member station WNYC.",
        "Without question.",

        "For your listeners' benefit, they do have FOX and CNN telecast in Iraq, and our troops are watching things back home.",
        "Those men and women who are deployed from the National Guard in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are under a tremendous, tremendous emotional strain knowing that their children, their loved ones may be homeless; they may not even know the status of those family members.",
        "And they could be a valuable resource to us back home helping clean, strengthen our community, protecting property, helping stop looters.",
        "But I believe psychologically, they'll be be very little use to us in the theater in Iraq at this time, and out of compassion, we should bring them home and let them help both secure their homes, their families and, more importantly, help their communities rebuild.",
        "One other question.",

        "What's the fate of those tax cuts now, would you say?",
        "Well, some need to continue.",
        "Capital gains tax reduction at 15 percent probably needs to continue to keep the economy vibrant.",
        "This is going to take a horrific toll on our economy.",
        "But I think any new taxes probably have to be postponed.",

        "It doesn't mean full elimination, but it could mean a number that would mostly satisfy 90 percent of Americans.",
        "We have a huge bill that is going to come due for these natural disasters.",
        "We're talking housing, rebuilding of levees.",
        "We're talking about a massive infrastructure restoration project that's not going to come cheap, and so we have to be very, very prudent and very careful as we're allocating dollars that we not go too quickly on tax relief right now.",
        "We may be able to revisit that as we watch the economy carefully for signs of stress.",
        "But for the moment, I think our priorities have to be, rather than wrestling with the other side of the aisle over tax relief, more importantly, finding ways to solve the human suffering that's occurring in these states."
