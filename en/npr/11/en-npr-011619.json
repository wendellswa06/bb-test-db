        "Of course, the president knows that Congress will also want to have its own investigation and that, in fact, Senators Susan Collins and Joe Lieberman--that's the Republican from Maine, Susan Collins, and the Democrat from Connecticut in Lieberman--have already begun the mechanics for having their own investigation.",
        "They are the chairman and ranking member respectively of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, and they have the jurisdiction to investigate this.",
        "They are also two people who were largely responsible for setting up the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "And since FEMA is now part of the Department of Homeland Security, this is their baby, in a way, and they are quite interested in how poorly all this has gone and they obviously want to dismantle it and get inside it and find out what happened.",
        "Ron, remind us of some of the issues that have fallen by the wayside now.",
        "And do you expect them to eventually creep back on to the agenda but in a different form or will the fight be the same?",
        "And I just want you to understand that this is not over.",

        "And trust me, these past several months, I actually thought, well, you know, the hell with it, but I just can't let it go.",
        "(Soundbite of train whistle)",
        "In the long run, of course, such issues as the estate tax or Social Security changes the president wants or immigration changes that the Republican Party would like to push--all of these things have been interrupted and postponed, but they'll come back eventually.",
        "We just don't know exactly when.",
        "In some form, I suspect, Congress will talk about extending the elimination of the estate tax.",
        "Maybe it will not be totally eliminated, as Congressman Foley suggested, but something is going to be done on that front before we reach the expiration point for the elimination that was passed back in 2001.",
        "Some form of estate tax is probably going to survive.",
        "Also, the Social Security changes--in some sense, those are going to emerge from committee in the House, from the Ways and Means Committee.",
        "It'll be called something like retirement security.",
        "It will not be called Social Security reform so much; it'll be called retirement security.",
        "We'll see that before the end of the year.",
        "All these issues will come back, but what I don't expect is the big push towards enactment that the the administration and the Republican leaders in Congress had hoped for in September and October because of this enormous--I won't call it a distraction; I'll call it a shift in focus for the entire government.",
        "And this is going to very, very costly.",
        "There's a wire report here that President Bush intends to seek $40 billion as the next installment for hurricane relief.",
        "That's got to change the way people are looking at these other economic issues on the Hill.",
        "And that's on to of the 10 billion that emergency approval was gained for by Congress last Friday.",
        "I've seen the figure 100 billion, I've seen the figure 150 billion.",
        "That, for example, would represent a 50-percent increase in the national deficit unless some other revenue were going to be produced to make up the cost.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for being with us today, Ron.",
        "My pleasure, Lynn."
