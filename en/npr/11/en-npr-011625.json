        "Here in the U.S., we learned today that the economy created more than a quarter of a million new jobs in December, capping off the strongest year of job growth in 15 years.",
        "The unemployment rate also fell, but as NPR's John Ydstie reports, the data for December also included some disappointments on wages and workforce participation.",
        "First, the good news - according to the government's data, U.S.",
        "employers added 252,000 jobs last month.",
        "That exceeded the forecast of many economists, including Carl Tannenbaum of Northern Trust in Chicago.",
        "This morning's readings on payroll creation were undoubtedly very strong, both with the reading for December, which was very good, and the upward revisions to the prior two months.",
        "The upward revisions put the average job growth in the past three months close to 300,000.",
        "The strong employment growth helped push the unemployment rate down two-tenths to 5.6 percent.",
        "Unfortunately, the forces behind that fall weren't all positive.",
        "Part of the reason for that, unfortunately, was a decline in labor force participation, which is a trend that we have been hoping will stabilize as those discouraged by poor labor market conditions eventually return to the labor market.",
        "But instead, more workers quit looking for a job and left the labor force.",
        "Part of that is due to older baby boom workers retiring, says Tannenbaum, but it also suggests the economy isn't creating enough opportunities to draw many people back into the labor force.",
        "And they are clearly people who are outside the labor force looking in who would like to rejoin it."

        "Another disappointment in the December data was a fall in wages.",
        "November's report showed an uptick that created some confidence that sluggish wage growth was picking up.",
        "Instead, wages fell two-tenths of a percent.",
        "Tannenbaum suggests that could ease concerns about inflation at the Federal Reserve and keep the focus on jobs.",
        "With wages falling off a little bit, it certainly doesn't seem imminent that the Federal Reserve would be increasing interest rates.",
        "Overall, says Tannenbaum, the positives jobs picture is one of several factors lifting the U.S.",
        "economy as the new year begins.",
        "The jobs created and the incomes that come with them will be good for consumer spending.",
        "We're likely to have less of a fiscal drag from government austerity.",
        "Sectors like housing and investment, which have been a little slower than usual, should also kick in.",

        "The Klallam language was one of many Native American languages the U.S.",

        "The chairman of Hazel Sampson's tribe says her death marks the end of an era.",
        "There are an estimated 3,000 members of the Klallam tribe in the United States - most live in Washington State.",

        "After her son was born, Pardit decided not to return to her job as a legal administrative assistant.",
        "She knew she couldn't afford the $400 COBRA payments to keep her health insurance, but she assumed she'd be able to find another job with benefits when she was ready to go back to work.",
        "I knew that I wasn't going to be working for a while because I did decide to stay home with my son and I thought, kind of, OK, fingers crossed, that nothing will happen during that time.",
        "But I was looking to go back to work around the time he would be eight months old to a year old.",
        "So that's when I started looking for a job, because I thought that's the best way to get insurance was through an employer.",
        "What she found instead was an economy still sputtering toward recovery and employers willing to hire workers on a contract basis with no benefits.",

        "President Obama, E J, was able to find enough senators - Democratic senators - to guarantee that he can sustain a veto if it comes to that.",
        "How significant is all this?",
        "Well, I think it's usually significant.",
        "In the end, I am not surprised by this because despite all of the heavy lobbying and despite a lot of Democrats feeling very cross-pressured on the issue, the argument that there is really is no alternative to this deal that is plausible, I think was bound to carry the day with Democrats.",
        "I think there's some real fallout here.",
        "First there's still the question of whether Democrats will get 41 votes to prevent a vote on this all together.",
        "And then we're going to have a lot of issues to deal with.",
        "Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to either have to establish a new relationship again with the Obama administration or he's going to continue to fight on, I suppose, hoping for a Republican president.",

        "It's divided American Jews.",
        "Democratic and Jewish Senators Chuck Schumer, of New York, and today, Ben Cardin, of Maryland, came out against it.",
        "Does the political landscape change at all as a result of all this?",
        "Well, you know, the striking thing about this process has not been that ultimately the president secured the votes that he needed but how difficult it has been for him to get the votes he needed to make sure that Republicans can't override a veto on this resolution of disapproval.",
        "Remember, he only needs 34 votes, and he has 44 Democratic senators.",
        "And so the fact that he's had to work this hard is, I think, in one sense, a reflection of the challenge of selling the deal itself, which is problematic.",
        "And which, you know, in a sense, it's strange to say but Donald Trump made a pretty good case against it.",
        "We've just heard a piece of it.",
        "And every Republican has made essentially the same case.",
        "It ends up being a pretty powerful case, it's not the easiest thing for the Democrats to ignore.",
        "But it also, I think, does show the some of the weakness of the administration's relationship with Congress in general, including with Democrats in Congress, which this president has had trouble rallying again and again.",
        "He's made sure, of course, that there's not an alternative.",
        "So to say that there's no better alternative - there's only one president, and only the president could really provide Congress with an alternative here.",
        "This is what he wants, and he presents it as a yes or no question.",
        "Ultimately, he'll get his way, but the difficulty that he's had is really telling.",

        "I think it is troubling for the long run that an issue this important could become so deeply partisan.",

        "Yeah, there's no question that this is one of the ways in which foreign policy has become deeply partisan in the last few years.",
