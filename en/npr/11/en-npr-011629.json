        "And Frease told me that yes, that term - hairy arms - is an important piece of trade lingo in the commercial art world.",
        "We've been asking listeners to send us unusual words and phrases that people outside their line of work might not know.",
        "Jessica Frease learned this lingo while at Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida.",
        "It was her illustration professor who told her the story, and it was tied to a celebrated animation company with a strong presence in that state - Disney.",
        "So the story goes that probably a long while ago - probably in the '30s or '40s - they had a lead animators, but they also had creative directors.",
        "And when the lead animators would make concept designs, meaning, like, character development, they'd be so proud of these characters.",
        "And they would go to their art directors, and their art directors would change something constantly even though they thought it was their best work."

        "So what they realized after working with these art directors - that what they hated the most was anything added to the character, especially hair on the arms 'cause this is, you know, '30s and '40s.",
        "Things had to look very slick.",
        "So what they did was to distract the art directors from making other changes, they would automatically put hair on the arms of each character.",

        "Right.",
        "They would add extra - well, they would add hair.",

        "And they would kind of be distracted from all the other things they had added to the character.",
        "So that's where the term comes from.",
        "It's basically something you add to a design that you know you may not even want there, but it's a distraction from your client or creative director.",
        "It's to divert their attention so that they'll focus on that and let you get away with everything else?",

        "Later in the hike, he told me the only reason he ever got over his fear of the woods was because of the Boy Scouts.",
