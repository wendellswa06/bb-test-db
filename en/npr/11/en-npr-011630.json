        "And Nate, you listed a different challenge as well, overcrowding.",
        "I know that the Park Service broke their visitation record last year with more than 300 million visitors.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it's a good problem to have, right?",
        "The parks want people to visit these sites.",
        "But at a certain point, it can be too much.",
        "We've seen some of that in parks like Yellowstone this year, where you have more people visiting the park than the staff can manage.",
        "And that's not to speak ill of the park staff.",
        "They're just stretched too thin.",
        "Now, a lot of that has to do with funding.",
        "One of the other big challenges we identified, the National Park Service has not been able to pay its bills for a long, long time.",
        "It has more than $12 billion in deferred maintenance.",
        "Those are roads that need to be fixed and buildings that need repairs, even - in some cases, it's entire sewer systems that need repaired, but the money just isn't there.",
        "And it doesn't seem like Congress is going to give them any more anytime soon.",
        "So you looked at funding, overcrowding, climate change, relevancy.",
        "Was there anything that surprised you?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It definitely changed the way I view national parks.",
        "I mean, I'm the kind of person that likes to go out to the parks to get away, to hike, fish, just disconnect.",
        "But I met a lot of people that wanted to visit parks to connect, either by traveling in big, loud groups or meeting other people there or even just by posting stuff on social media, you know, taking a photo of that bear and getting a bunch of likes.",
        "And I've realized how valuable that is to the parks, too.",
        "My version of how the park should be might not be your version or somebody else's, but that's OK.",
        "And I think the Park Service is realizing that, too, and doing a better job of accommodating and meeting people where they are.",
        "Well, good stuff, Nate.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "That's NPR's Nathan Rott, who's been reporting on the National Park Service's centennial, a birthday being celebrated across the country today.",

        "The Washington Post says the lane could run in front of a church, and the United House of Prayer says that would infringe on their freedom of worship.",
        "A bike lane would make it hard for parishioners to park their cars on the street.",
        "Now, the Constitution does assure free exercise of religion.",
        "It is not clear, though, what the founding fathers thought about just, you know, riding a bike to church.",

        "I",
        "mean, there are other times in our history when if you poll-tested certain issues they would be the majority before them, like slavery, pro-slavery or before there were women's rights or before there were segregation.",

        "I think - I understand you draw the analogy - and Wade Henderson, by the way, is the outgoing chair of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a fellow civil rights leader.",
        "I think where the analogy perhaps differs is that people didn't survey the slaves about how they felt about slavery.",
        "I think the better analogy might be surveying women at the time of suffrage about how they felt about the vote.",
        "So in this instance, the affected people are the ones being surveyed.",
        "And I just have to ask, you know, how you feel about that.",
        "Yeah, well, I know that not everyone's going to agree, but I do think that this poll itself is a cooked poll.",
        "I think they didn't survey - for example, you know, I'm an Indian leader.",
        "I meet and met with thousands of Indian people throughout the country.",
        "The - every major organization in the United States representing Native Americans has called for the name to change.",
        "Is your objection that the poll was done at all or is it the way the poll was conducted?",
        "Well, I don't know enough about the poll to be able to speak in specific terms.",
        "But I do understand they never asked the people if the name should change.",
        "And if it's such a civil issue, why not do that?",
        "Many teams have done that.",
        "Anybody who believes in doing what is right knows that you shouldn't use a slur against someone.",
        "You shouldn't say a name to somebody else if they are offended by it, even if it's not defined as a slur, and this is defined as a slur.",
        "And you can't change that.",
        "No poll in the world is going to change the fact this is a dictionary-defined slur that our people are subjected to on a daily basis."

        "What we saw, in these documents, is that these reports of suspected claims of abuse went pretty much directly from the local church down the street, to the top levels of the archdiocese.",
        "And it appears Cardinal Mahoney wrote to these priests; met with them; told them they were in his prayers.",
        "What we saw, in reading these memos, was that there was a clear understanding among these church leaders there was criminal wrongdoing, and prosecutions could result from these priests' actions, and a desire - and willingness - to keep authorities in the dark.",

        "They never got their day in court.",
