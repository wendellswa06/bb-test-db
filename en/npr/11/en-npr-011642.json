        "The warring sides in Georgia have agreed to stop.",
        "Russia and Georgia agreed to what's described as a provisional cease-fire.",
        "It comes after fighting that killed hundreds, displaced tens of thousands, and forced the world's attention to a volatile region.",
        "The many people talking about this include Republican presidential candidate John McCain.",
        "We will interview McCain after we get an update from Georgia's capital.",
        "NPR's Ivan Watson is there.",
        "And Ivan, what does this cease-fire agreement say?",
        "Well, it's calling for a temporary secession of hostilities, but I just spoke with Georgian officials who are really questioning whether it is truly a ceasefire because I've just returned from a press conference with the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili.",
        "He said there was no Russian bombardment overnight last night but he has made fresh, disturbing allegations of Russian activities against ethnic Georgians in the breakaway region of South Ossetia.",
        "Let's listen to what he just said at this press conference.",
        "Camps were set; women and men were separated from each other; internment camps were set up, set, and we are getting reports of large-scale violations of human rights.",
        "The Georgians are claiming, Steve, that Russian irregular militia forces are moving through Georgian villages, looting and executing people in and around South Ossetia.",
        "The Georgian government also claims that Russian troops destroyed yesterday Georgian military boats in the Black Sea port of Poti.",
        "And finally, Georgian officials have just claimed that dozens of Russian tanks just rolled through the town of Gori, which is just 50 miles west of here, the Georgian capital, Steve.",
        "So Ivan Watson, you have these claims both that this fighting is even grimmer than it seems and perhaps that it's not over.",
        "What kinds of reports are you hearing from elsewhere in Georgia?",
        "Steve, I just got off the phone with a resident in the town of Gori.",
        "She said she was standing two yards away from a Russian tank in the center of the town, that there were 10 to 15 of these Russian tanks rolling through that town as we speak.",
        "I also spoke to a resident in the Black Sea port of Poti.",
        "She says that Russian armored vehicles were operating in that town Monday and Tuesday but have since withdrawn.",
        "And the Russians have also occupied, according to eyewitness reports, at least two other Georgian towns in the west - west of the country.",
        "So the situation is pretty grim for this country, Steve.",
        "The Georgian army has been smashed as of Monday - it's nowhere to be seen - and the government is not in control of many of its bigger towns west of the capital.",
        "And we also have tens of thousands of people displaced, both from South Ossetia and from Georgian territory, and they are terrified of both the advancing Russian troops and even more so of rumors of these irregular Russian-backed forces operating in the area, militia-type people who are said to be looting and marauding.",
        "I unfortunately cannot confirm those reports right now."

        "Ivan, very briefly, is Georgia getting any international support in this situation?",
        "The presidents of five ex-Soviet bloc countries appeared on stage with the Georgian president yesterday, Steve.",
        "They are showing solidarity with Georgia against Russia.",
        "They are clearly worried that if the Russians move on Georgia that they could be next, and they are saying as much in statements with the Georgian president.",
        "So Georgia is getting support but I think these new reports are destroying some of the euphoria that was being felt at a concert yesterday in Tbilisi in the town square with these five presidents standing alongside the Georgian president, showing defiance against Moscow.",

        "The big constant is how many more scandals seem to crop up in a two-term president's second term.",
        "Well, James Fallows, you sure hit the nail on the head with that one.",

        "Thank you.",
        "I'll take you up on that actually.",

        "Jim, you're out of town for a little bit, but we are knee-deep in scandals.",
        "The IRS giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups, the Benghazi investigation, the Justice Department seizing Associated Press phone records.",

        "I think there are two things that are familiar about what we're seeing right now.",
        "One is, as I mentioned fortunately a few months earlier, often after a successful re-election battle, a lot of things sort of either come loose or go wrong in the administration.",
        "We've seen this for a long time.",
        "The other is the familiar Washington press and political framework of the scandal.",
        "And we see the kind of press coverage that kicks in, the kind of investigations that kick in, the kind of stories about how the White House is or is not bearing up under this kind of pressure.",
        "And so that is where we are on these three otherwise unrelated phenomena.",
        "Hum.",
        "Now, how likely do you think these are to persist and overwhelm President Obama's second-term agenda?",
        "Certainly in terms of persistence, I think what has evolved in the generation-plus since the Watergate hearings in the mid-1970s is sort of an industry of scandal investigation.",
        "The press has its ways of looking forwards to advance a story day-by-day.",
        "And certainly when the opposing party has its hands on the investigative machinery in Congress, as the Republicans in the House do, you can have hearings to say who knew what when.",
        "And with these three different potential fronts of the Obama administration, we're likely to see a lot of that.",
        "And we don't know yet whether or not crimes have been committed.",
        "You were thinking of Watergate.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think that it's worth establishing that three things which are collectively the Obama scandals right now, these are entirely different things in their potential gravity and who is involved.",
        "And so far, no apparent connection to the president himself, which has been an important element in some previous genuine scandals.",
        "You know, it's interesting, Jim, a lot of people glued to the TV these days - has the television era really heightened the potency of the presidential scandal?",
        "Is it sort of made for TV?",
        "It certainly has changed the dynamic.",
        "And through the whole course of American history, there always have been scandals.",
        "There have been political intrigues.",
        "But I think the modern history really dates to the Watergate hearings where, for a period of months, people around the country and the world were riveted to their screens to see how the news was advanced every single day.",
        "And ever since then, that's been sort of the mental template - and actually operational template too - for members of the press, for prosecutors and for members of the opposition party to whoever is in office at the time, to find ways to have the real-time reality show drama of high-stakes hearings where you have witnesses under pressure, senators and representatives grandstanding in various ways.",
        "So I think that the Obama administration is hoping these will be minimized, and his critics are hoping to make the most of them.",
        "There has been a lot made this week of how the White House has responded.",
        "What's your take?"

        "I would imagine that right now, the Obama White House is studying very carefully the playbook of the Clinton administration in President Clinton's second term when the Monica Lewinsky genuine scandal was threatening to overwhelm him and even led to an impeachment trial.",
        "And what Bill Clinton tried to do then was day by day by day saying, there's all this political friction, but I care about the business of the country.",
        "So I'm doing this on the economy and this in foreign policy and this in technology.",
        "And I'm sure that is what President Obama will try to do and convey.",
        "And there was an interesting story in The New York Times today saying that instructions have gone out within the White House staff for people to spend no more than 10 percent of their time on scandals, put generally.",
        "So I say good luck on that goal, but I'm sure that's the message the president wants to convey.",

        "There was some disparate treatment.",
