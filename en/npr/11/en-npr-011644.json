        "I'm up here in the (unintelligible) section with the cocoons full of balloons ready to be dropped on the delegates at the right moment.",
        "But the abbreviated schedule means that they had to scrunge the big speeches into three nights instead of four and they don't think that they're losing anything big by doing that.",
        "On the other hand, they're paying very close attention to that storm, which is barreling its way towards the coast, towards New Orleans, ready to make changes if necessary.",
        "So, what are the contingency plan should the storm intensify and really hit Louisiana or the Gulf Coast?",
        "Well, the convention organizers say they're in close contact with NOAA.",
        "They're paying very close attention, but they want to avoid the optics of a kind of split screen image of devastation in New Orleans and people in funny hats partying in Tampa.",
        "So they're very sensitive to the optics and they'll make changes if necessary.",
        "But they're watching this day to day and you never know what the storm is going to do in the next 24 hours.",
        "Now, you mentioned split screen.",

        "Four years ago, John McCain had to shorten his convention to three days because of Hurricane Gustav.",
        "And most people I talked to say these conventions are very expensive.",
        "There's no suspense anymore, nothing really happens at them.",
        "They're a four or three-day infomercial and that three days would be just fine.",
        "And that's probably what you're going to see in the future.",
        "Let's talk about the unofficial agenda for the week.",
        "What does Governor Romney need to accomplish in these next three days?",
        "Well, he has to try to do something about the deficit that he comes into this convention with, although he is tied with the president in the polls, he does have poor likability ratings.",
        "No challenger since 1984 has come into their convention with higher negative personal ratings than Romney.",
        "So he wants to soften his image."
