        "Uh-huh.",
        "You have white people moving in, you have black people moving out.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "The perception is that you've got rising real estate values and black renters - poor black renters in many cases are having to move elsewhere.",
        "And yet at the same time it seems to me that there were African Americans who owned houses in the District of Columbia, sold those houses into a rising real estate market, made a bunch of money, and moved to the suburbs.",
        "Is that a good thing?",
        "I don't have any problem with this demographic change.",
