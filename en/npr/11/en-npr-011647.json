        "Still, there are very few game-changing opportunities left in this campaign.",
        "The debates are crucial, but conventions can be game changers and Mitt Romney hopes that this one can be a game changer for him and he can come out of this convention with a positive image, convincing people that he has a plan to not only fix the economy, but as one of his campaign officials say today, increase the take home pay of ordinary middle class Americans.",

        "Well, they don't test ditching airplanes, so there's really no experience for most aircraft types on exactly what the airplane will do when it touches the water, and therefore, it's impossible to program a flight simulator for it.",
        "I think if we had data to program the simulators for, we might do well to practice ditching and practice multiple engine failures more often.",
