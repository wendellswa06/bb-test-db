        "Well, I think that was an important step, but it was only a step.",
        "And what that money will do actually is only bring the levee system up to what it was supposed to be before Katrina.",
        "They don't fully address the long-term issues, protecting the eroding coastlines.",
        "New Orleans is not naturally as vulnerable or shouldn't--wasn't naturally as vulnerable as it has become.",
        "And the chief reason for that is the erosion of hundreds and hundreds of square miles of land that used to stand between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "And that land can be restored.",
        "Does the federal commitment of billions of dollars for levee restoration do anything so far for restoring wetlands outside of New Orleans?",
        "Well, there's a tiny bit, but it has yet to address the major problem.",
        "Now you have not permanently relocated to New Orleans again.",

        "They both--yeah.",
        "Well, actually part of the Ninth Ward and none of Lake View is above sea level.",
        "The argument is Lake View people have the resources to rebuild.",
        "The Ninth Ward people don't have the money so they're not going to rebuild anyway.",

        "You can't very well rebuild if you don't have power.",
        "The--most of the city today still does not have electricity.",
        "Today there are still areas that were never flooded that have electricity but still don't have telephone service.",
        "So just basic utility services.",
        "Just over Christmas, much of the French Quarter and the hotels and the restaurants, they had problems with smells coming out of the sewer system, and that's just in the last few days."
