        "The thing is that the Russians, who were the dominant nationality, just never really thought about their own identity.",
        "They were the empire.",
        "So in some way, you could say that the last 25 years have been a search for identity.",
        "And Putin has tried to provide certain markers, for example, support for the Russian Orthodox Church or instilling pride from the Russian or Soviet victory in World War II.",
        "But it's really a balancing act.",
        "Russia is still a multiethnic country and has a very complex tapestry of ethnicities and religions.",

        "So they feel like if they can get Bani Walid, they're hoping that Serte would then just have a domino effect and Serte would fall too.",

        "Yes, there's very much a concern of that.",

        "Are there individual tribes here that might be willing to fight a lot longer than would seem sensible to outsiders?",

        "So he wondered how the total number of birds in the sky might be changing.",
        "Are there fewer birds than there were in 1970, or are we seeing a shift and losing some of the rare specialized species and shifting towards more generalist, more common birds, species that are more adapted to humans?",
        "To find out, he and some colleagues gathered all the data they could on over 500 bird species; a lot of it came from bird surveys done each year by volunteers.",
        "They also used data from weather radar installations that can detect flocks of migrating birds.",
        "They crunched all the numbers and were stunned by the results.",
        "By our estimates, it's a 30% loss in the total number of breeding birds since 1970 - less than 50 years - and that's 3 billion birds."
