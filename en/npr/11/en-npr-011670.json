        "But in this legislation, those cars are actually tied to disaster aid because House Republicans decided to lop off a big chunk of money from a loan guaranty program for developing electric cars - a program, by the way, that started during the last Bush administration - and to use those savings to help pay for the $3.65 billion for the disaster relief assistance in this bill for FEMA.",
        "But if the offsets are that important, why did the Republican leaders in the House come up with only $1.6 billion worth of them when the FEMA funds are beyond three billion as you say?",
        "Well, traditionally Congress has never taken money out of other programs to pay for disaster relief.",
        "Lawmakers essentially put it on that big credit card as we know as the national debt.",
        "But this time some Republicans demanded that every penny of the disaster money be offset by cuts elsewhere.",
        "But they could risk having an even bigger fight with Democrats if they cut even more, and they don't want to be the ones taking the blame if that money gets held up.",
        "So, they just chose a program a lot of Republicans are quite skeptical about and they took some money from it, though not all of it.",

        "In your explanation, doesn't seem likely that FEMA's going to run out of money.",

        "And I think because everybody wants the government funding to continue into the new fiscal year, and for there to be disaster relief money in it for FEMA, I think one way or another, they will find a way to do this just because they were so badly burned by the last showdown over federal funding.",
