        "As you can imagine, there's controversy in Canada too.",
        "It's time for Canadians to move pass talking points and have thoughtful dialogue on better addressing oil policy issues.",

        "Well, I think there's people in your country that will have a far better grasp of the political nuance than maybe I would.",
        "But I think there's a lot of people in Canada that anticipate that it will come back in 2013 once things cool down.",
        "It's largely seen here from those that can take a breath and get past their own politics to be a strategic political move in relation to your vote coming this fall.",
        "Everyone fully anticipates that the pipeline will go ahead because it makes sense on a lot of levels from a Canadian perspective and probably from an American one as well.",
        "However, there are any number of controversies related to this and inconsistencies in policy in both countries, not the least of which Canadians, for all our reputation of being nice and reasonable, we sometimes like to have our cake and eat it too."

        "And much like your country, you really can't talk about a Canadian perspective and have anything that's terribly uniform, sir.",
        "In our country, the problem being is that, you know, we are as divided, as I'm sure Americans are, on a lot of issues, up to including this one.",
        "And we're also regionally divided because eastern Canada isn't as dependent on oil production as a revenue source.",
        "In Canada it's a little bit different perhaps than in the United States because the provinces, equivalent to the state government, obviously has control over the resources - its natural resources.",
        "So for provinces like Saskatchewan, where I live, or next door in Alberta, it's a really big deal to produce oil and a really big deal to export it, particularly to the United States, which would be our preferential export.",
        "The difficulty being is that, particularly in Alberta, they're running headlong into the environmentalist lobby.",
        "It's not just an American environmentalist lobby, but I think our federal Canadian government and perhaps a couple of our provincial Canadian governments want to categorize it that way, as too much influenced by the American left.",
        "In reality, though, what is of concern, though, is just being able to get our oil to market.",
        "As I say, the preferential market would obviously be the United States, but there's a second pipeline through northern B.C.",
        "called the Northern Gateway pipeline that Canadians are proposing - Canadian oil industry is proposing as perhaps an alternative to feed Asian markets - China and such - if this pipeline doesn't go through in terms of the Keystone development.",

        "And so I have talked about how you put this into pieces to prove to the American people that we can do our job, that we can get this right.",
        "Use that to build on to an overall immigration solution that addresses everything that we need, whether that's entry-exit systems, whether that's people who are here without documentation.",
        "I think this situation today gives us a way to start to prove to ourselves we can do this and to address a very important policy issue, and that's what to do with children who were brought here to this country through no fault of their own.",
