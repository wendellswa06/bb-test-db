        "Yesterday we talked to the No. 2 Democrat in the House, Steny Hoyer, and he was also at that meeting.",
        "He seemed positive.",
        "You know, he says broad bipartisan agreement is coming and that even the president sounds more and more like it's not about a wall - right?",
        "- a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border.",
        "He said Democrats and Republicans are starting to agree about something else - about securing the border with something - you know, a so-called virtual wall using technology and surveillance.",
        "Do you see broad agreement there?",
        "I think the language the president used yesterday was a wall protection system - I think was the actual phraseology that they used.",
        "And the way they described that was, you know, a wall, technology, personnel.",
        "And that's something that I think I've seen and heard from this administration over several months of conversations on this.",
        "It's not just a sea-to-shining-sea wall, as some have described but a system in place, a border protection system that involves technology, personnel because the president himself said it yesterday.",
        "There are places where it doesn't make sense to put something like a wall in because you've got a river or a mountain area that just doesn't make sense.",
        "So I do think that that is an area that can gain support, and I don't think that's actually going to be the most difficult part of this discussion.",
        "I think that border security will probably be one of the easier of a very difficult conversation.",
        "Of the elements that are on the table right now, what is the toughest thing?",
        "Well, the toughest thing is going to be how to address this issue of families, how to address the issues of nuclear family.",
        "And that's what the president described as chain migration.",
        "That is going to be the most difficult part of this discussion in my opinion as people try to describe, all right, how do you have a solution that addresses people who were brought here against the law through no fault of their own?",
        "And so that's going to be tough to address, you know, parents, brothers, sisters - how to make that work and how to do so in a way that the United States can be proud of.",
        "You know, many say that a more cost-effective way to slow illegal immigration might be to go to the source, to crack down more aggressively on employers who are hiring illegal immigrants.",
        "Do you imagine that that will be part of the conversation around border security?",
        "That I think has been a part of the conversation around border security.",
        "I haven't heard that as much a part of this discussion because I don't know that there will be a prescriptive, so to speak, border security approach.",
        "I think there will be conversations about appropriations, you know, for the border protection systems.",
        "I don't know that this will yet encompass some kind of a mandatory, you know, e-verify (ph) different than it is today.",
        "I do think that that will be part of the discussion - ongoing discussion.",
        "Now, whether that's the solution, I don't know.",
        "Nobody has said that it has to be at this point, at least to my knowledge, so - but it will be part of the discussion.",
        "Chances that a deal can be reached - like, percentage chance, in your mind...",
        "My problem is I'm an eternal optimistic person, and so I'm eternally optimistic.",
        "And I believe that we will find a solution.",
        "The president has committed it.",
        "The president has said we would.",
        "So I'm committed to that, and I don't think failure is an option."

        "Hi there.",
        "Well, this is a very large study.",
        "It's large in two ways.",
        "One is we interviewed very large number of Americans.",
        "Also, we asked them a very large number of religion questions.",
        "And the idea was to be able to look at the diversity of American religion, to look at small groups like Buddhists and Muslims and also the different kinds of groups within the large Christian communities, such as Protestants and Catholics.",
        "So the idea of the study is to be able to look at this at great detail and with considerable precision.",
        "And what surprised you most about your findings?",
        "Well, a couple of things.",
        "One was just a sheer diversity of American religious life.",
        "We always anticipated diversity.",
        "That's why we did this big study, but even we were stunned by the variety of religious affiliations, beliefs and practices.",
        "But another thing seemed to surprise us a great deal, and that is the non-dogmatic character of most people's attitudes towards their faith.",
        "For instance, among Americans who had a religious affiliation, seven out of 10 told us that they believed that many faiths could lead to eternal life as opposed to just their religion being the one true faith.",
        "And did you ask them any question about how their religion affects their perception of public life in terms of politics and policy - those kinds of questions?",
        "Oh, yes we did, and in fact one of the parts of the report is to try to relate this religious diversity to views on social and political values and there we found an amazing amount of diversity as well.",
        "Some of the findings are kind of straight forward, for instance, people with very traditional religious beliefs and practices tend to have more conservative views on politics, particularly on issues like abortion and homosexuality.",
        "We found that a lot of Americans, however, were very comfortable being people of faith living in a modern, diverse society.",
        "And we also found something like a consensus on issues like aiding the poor and protecting the environment, that large percentages of all the major traditions tended to favor those kinds of policies.",
        "And is America still mainly a Christian country?"

        "Well, overall, most Americans are Christians of one kind or another.",

        "But the real growth among Evangelicals is in nondenominational churches, and many of them, the large mega churches that we hear about in the suburban parts of the United States.",
        "The impact of Evangelicals is not just the sheer number of people in Evangelical congregations.",
        "It's also the impact of their ideas and their style of religiosity, a very informal style that puts a great emphasis on individual beliefs and individual commitments, and that Evangelical style has influenced many of the religious communities in the United States.",
        "And when you say it affects people's ideas and people's attitudes, are you talking politically or in terms of religion?",
        "Well, really, both ways.",
        "I think there is an impact on people's religion in terms of style, in terms of beliefs, but there has also been some impact on politics as well.",
        "Something that has come with that has been an emphasis on the social issues, on cultural questions such as abortion.",
        "But the evangelical community itself is becoming more diverse.",
        "One of the results of its growth is that it has more different kinds of people within its boundaries now, and we see some changes on issues like the environment, on questions of the economy and foreign policy, that would not have been common a generation ago.",
