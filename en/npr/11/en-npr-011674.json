        "But without that part, those preexisting condition provisions - requiring that people with preexisting conditions be able to get coverage, requiring that they pay the same - those two would be invalidated by the elimination of the penalty for not having coverage.",

        "The Justice Department isn't asking for anything immediately.",
        "Obviously, this is a lawsuit, and it could take months or even years to work its way through the courts.",
        "But it does certainly raise the prospect of a court decision that would say there could be no more protections for people with preexisting conditions.",
        "That's one of the most popular parts of the health law."
