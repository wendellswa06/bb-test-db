        "We've been getting reports from all over the country about how health care premiums are going up.",
        "Why is that happening?",
        "Do you expect it to keep happening?",
        "Well, one of the reasons it's happening - say the insurers, who are filing their rates now for next year - is because they took away this penalty for people who don't have insurance.",
        "The insurers say that healthy people will probably opt out of having insurance.",
        "That will leave sicker people buying insurance.",
        "So they have to raise premiums.",
        "The Trump administration is also trying to make it easier for healthier people to get less comprehensive health insurance, which would also take more healthy people out of the pool where most people buy their individual insurance.",
        "And for those reasons, premiums are going up more next year than they would have otherwise.",
        "And you expect this to continue?",
        "Yes.",
        "We've only seen, you know, a handful of states so far.",
        "But in every state, insurers have said that's the reason they're raising their premiums.",

        "Decades before your PC, your Mac or your Commodore, Alan Turing was designing a machine which could calculate almost anything: a universal computer.",

        "Yes.",
        "He was found dead in his room with clues like a mystery novel.",

        "Well, today, you've got the Big Five--basically the permanent members of the Security Council--and Germany who are meeting in London at senior official level.",
        "So it's not the foreign ministers, but it's the experts who are really going to get down to the nitty-gritty.",
        "I think what they're trying to decide is whether there's enough consensus among the Big Five to refer this to the emergency session of the UN nuclear watchdog, and that is the body which will actually refer this whole mess to the Security Council, assuming that there is at least a minimum agreement to do that.",
        "And we're not talking about sanctions.",
        "Anne, we're talking about getting Russia and China to go along.",
        "How difficult would it be to do that?",
        "The most difficult, at this point, is actually going to be China.",
        "China has huge--well, at the moment, it's kind of draining most of the world's resources, as I understand it, to feed its own economic appetite, and it's importing masses of oil from Iran to do this.",
        "So China has very important economic relations with Iran.",
        "China is also never keen on sanctions at all.",
        "So they're going to have an uphill struggle winning the Chinese over today or in the next few weeks even to refer Iran to the Security Council, I reckon.",
        "And how is this playing out in Iran?",
        "What is Iran saying?",
        "Well, Iran, as usual, is saying all sorts of contradictory things, but is consistently hard line at least.",
        "It insists on its right to enrich uranium, saying that it is entirely a peaceful program.",
        "That's the problem for the West, that we have not got the cast-iron proof that Iran does have a peaceful program and doesn't want to build a bomb.",
        "Well, Iran has vast oil reserves.",
        "So how convincing is its argument that it is using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes?",
        "Yeah, not very convincing, frankly.",
        "And Iran actually works on a nuclear program for 18 years without anybody finding out, and it was supposed to be working in cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.",
        "Given the war in Iraq and everything that was said in the lead-up to that war--vis-a-vis weapons of mass destruction and the possibility that Iraq may have nuclear weapons--will that work against the five permanent members of the Security Council in trying to make their case to the UN?",
        "Obviously, there's all sorts of things going on here which kind of sound familiar--Don't they?--from the last time around, what with referring this case to the Security Council.",
        "The Bush administration, they've obviously got their hands full in Iraq.",
        "So it suits George Bush now to say, `We want a diplomatic solution here.",
        "But basically at this point, there are no other options.",
        "They don't know what the stick is; they don't know what the carrot is.",
