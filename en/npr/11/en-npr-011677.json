        "So, Ron, if this bill clears the Senate, how effective really will it be?",
        "Well, I have to tell you, as a free market fiscal conservative, I'm always nervous when the government tries to step in and take the assumption of the rest or to take the responsibility of the risk of obtaining a mortgage.",
        "I do believe that the Congress will act and I do believe a bill will be sent to the president for signature this year.",
        "The question will be, how much responsibilities that Congress wish to assume for people who should have taken more precaution and people who should have, unfortunately, paid more attention before they took these loans out that are skyrocketing and forcing them out of their homes?",
        "But, Ron, there are always limits that are imposed by various governments for various reasons.",
        "Some people have said that these businesses essentially pushed these loans to consumers in ways where consumers didn't understand.",
        "Maybe it was a question of language.",
        "What do you think of that?",
        "I agree with that.",
        "And I am very concerned when you look at red lining that is skyrocketing insurance premiums based on a particular demographic in a particular area.",
        "And I think that there is a strong oversight responsibility that Congress must exercise to ensure that predatory lending did not take place.",
        "And if it did take place, then I think the punitive actions will come into place.",
        "But again, as a free market fiscal conservative, I'm just very, very cautious and very nervous about the federal government making people's assumption of the risk.",
        "So, Mary, this bill passed by the House allows for greater relief in the limits proposed by the Bush administration.",
        "So why might the Bush administration be more conservative with this issue?",
        "Well, they would be more conservative for the same reason that Ron objects to the bill on free market conservative grounds.",
        "Although, when it's to their benefit, politically, to have the government take action, they go ahead and take action.",
        "Also, in a week, when the Federal Reserve board has just cut interest rates when it previously opened its loan window to banks at lower rates and urged them to come to take loans, when it is essentially bailing out the banking industry and the hedge funders and all the people who financed mergers and acquisitions and all the big guys up the top."

        "It seems to me to be wrong to say that somebody shouldn't help the little guy down at the bottom who has made these loans.",
        "And in fact, the people who didn't understand and who were pushed into it and who took the greatest risk and who now are in the worst trouble need help more than anybody.",
        "So that - what the Congress has done - and you will know that lots of Republicans voted for the House bill, it simply wasn't Democrats.",
        "I mean, Republicans voted overwhelmingly.",
        "There are enough votes there to overwrite a veto.",
        "It just seems that, in fairness, we ought to do something for the little people and keep the economy going.",
        "When the economy is bad and you're headed toward what looks like a recession, you can either take the Andrew Mellon at the time of the depression position and say: Liquidate, liquidate, let's ring out all the excess.",
        "Let everybody suffer or you can try to help everybody.",
        "This is to help the little guy.",
        "And I think that even if Bush vetoes it, Congress will pass over his veto.",
        "Well, Mary, the one thing I'd say though, I agree, obviously, with what the administration has done because I think that there is room to modernize the FHA program.",
        "I think there is a strong momentum that all of us would agree that you should be able to expand the amount of money that people who can qualify for these loans and to have certain forgiveness.",
        "But I just worry about the federal government making an assumption that we should come in and bail people out on these particular loans because I don't want the United States government involved in a regulation or at least ownership of the mortgage industry anymore as it turns to health care, which I know Farai will talk about in a minute - that the federal government should be providing universal one-size-fits-all health care.",
        "So I am all for those who are at the lower end of the strata who are most adversely impacted by this.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And what people forget is that in an hour and five minutes, David Chase was sort of charged with wrapping up seven years of very difficult storylines, but he was never going to wrap all of them up.",

        "It was just - that's part of the given take, the cat and mouse that Chase plays in this series.",
        "And, you know, part of me, I think, this was kind of harsh to say to people who are fans of this series they might be upset.",

        "Right.",
