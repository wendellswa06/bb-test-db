        "Tony's dead to her.",

        "You know, he's got what he wanted.",
        "This is a - definitely a talker; it's a pop cultural phenomenon.",
        "And he's left it in a way that I think satisfies the diehards and it keeps people to - will be talking about whether he's alive or dead or did the series go on.",
        "For a long time, there's a lot of possible endings.",
        "I think part of it was you can make - I think he's got his own ending I really believed that.",
        "But I think he left it so that you can infer on your own what happened.",
        "It's so funny, because I sat there and at the end of it, you know, I was thinking, oh my God that was great.",
        "I mean it didn't end.",
        "We don't know what.",
        "I was thinking - it was just funny, though, I woke up in the middle of the night, that's how much I'm a fan of the show, and I'm laying there my eyes popped open I'm thinking, no, Tony's dead.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "(Unintelligible).",
        "Anyway, it was a great show.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But a cynic, Tim Goodman, might suggests that while he's left us all on a cliffhanger, much as a regular season finale might be, is this the perfect set-up for, in two years time, \"\"Sopranos\"\" the movie.",
        "Well, that's definitely cynical.",
        "And I share a sense of jadedness about that.",
        "But, the key - and I would not rule out that in, you know, in some amount of years if they backed up a truck, he might get it done.",
        "But I really believe, honestly believe, that David Chase is done with \"\"The Sopranos\"\" and he's always wanted to make movies.",
        "I think - and he's actually writing a movie now that has nothing to do with \"\"The Sopranos\"\" or is engaged in a script that's nothing to \"\"The Sopranos.\"\" And I think he wants to move on and left this sit on the shelves of these DVD box sets on its own.",
        "But that said, if a movie or two of his does fail in the end, you're right.",
        "And Tony could still be alive and it can be brought back."

        "It is as if a good friend that disappeared from the face of the earth, no explanation, just a realization of their absence.",
        "And, well, getting back to the show, this show has broken barriers from the very start in how it was structured, in how it was presented, and the effect that it's had on television.",
        "Tim Goodman, it's hard to argue that any show in the past 10 years has had more influence.",
        "I think that's true.",
        "I mean, I think that certainly from the - if you go back, \"\"The Sopranos\"\" completely made HBO.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "It legitimized all of cable as a place where you can go and even pay money to see television, which was kind of unheard of for some people.",
        "But it's also raised the bar, you know, that's kind of a cliche that I hate, but it has raise the bar throughout television.",
        "People have to - if you're in the business of making dramas even it's for NBC or ABC, they have to be better because if people watch \"\"The Sopranos\"\" or \"\"The Wire,\"\" a lot of things that were on television, the expectations are so much greater as to the quality."
