        "These healthcare workers argue that their convictions preclude participation in procedures that violate their conscience.",
        "It's largely but not entirely a reflection of religious beliefs, and while the issue is not new, it's growing, along with pharmaceutical innovations like the morning-after pill, technologies that can keep patients alive on machinery, and political shifts like Oregon's approval of physician-assisted suicide.",
        "Some doctors refuse to prescribe Viagra to unmarried men, anesthesiologists in California refused to participate in an execution, and, of course, there's abortion.",
        "The fight over the right of conscience and a patient's right to care has sparked debate in hospitals, courts, state legislatures and in Congress.",

        "And Clinton is being smart about it this time.",
        "She's taken a page out of Mitt Romney's playbook up in Massachusetts and come up with a plan according to the same professor at MIT who advised Romney, which is almost the same with a few bells and whistles that are different on it.",
        "And she's emphasized as she much choice.",
        "She learned the last time, as Bill Clinton learned, in his first administration, that if you make it look like it's too much - too complicated, if you try to interfere with choice or leave yourself open to the idea that you are in those Harry and Louise commercials that were on television, you're dead in the water.",
        "So she's learned from that and from her experience.",
        "And so she's now saying, if you like the health care you got, keep it.",
        "If you don't like it, then do something else.",
        "So I think it's smart, and I think it's workable, and I think it is a lot like the Massachusetts' plan, and it's smart politics too.",

        "You can pick the plan that federal employees now have, and they have a platter of choices that they can take.",

        "She's also proposing that if business - small business gives health insurance to their employees, they can get a tax credit for the health insurance, which they like.",
        "They were prepared to pounce on this.",
        "But they immediately said, gee, this is great.",
        "Also that low income people who don't have the funds can either get subsidized to buy insurance, or if they have enough income, they can get a tax credit to buy insurance.",

        "And then, the money to pay for the subsidy would come from kicking back the tax credit - tax cut that people over $250,000 got in the Bush tax cuts, which is one way to pay for this.",
        "So it's a broad comprehensive plan and she said, I don't have all the details, I work with the Congress to do it, which is smart politics too.",
        "Ron, again, Mary keeps her effort in saying Mitt Romney.",
        "And some blog, some economic critics have said, well, gee, he's now disavowing a plan that he himself used.",
        "How do you fall on that one?",
        "Well, I think that the key distinction here is that you're talking about the common wealth of Massachusetts, which is a particular state.",
        "A very small state.",
        "A state in which most of the people and the common wealth of Massachusetts did have health care.",
        "There's one difference there between people who live and reside in the common wealth, deciding that they want to impose these specific mandates in the specific reform upon themselves versus someone in Washington believing that they understand how to best deliver health care - the health care delivery system to people all across the United States.",
        "The estimates of 47 million people being uninsured in the United States are often tossed around, and I think that is absolutely a erroneous figure at best and a lie at best.",
        "I think there are a lot of people who elects not to have health care coverage.",
        "I think that there are well over 10 million illegal immigrants in the country who do not have health coverage who are figured into this.",
        "And most importantly, that Senator Clinton's plan goes back to the old mandate that we've talked about before.",
        "She mandates that if you have a job, that you have to have health care insurance.",
        "I do not believe it is the role of the federal government to be telling people, to mandate to people that they have to take particular action because some bureaucrat or some individual in Washington thinks that they know best.",
        "The repealing of the Bush tax cuts has done much to stimulate the economy.",
        "I think rolling back these particular tax cuts before they expire in 2010 is a mistake.",
        "And I believe that the Congress has an obligation to work together in a bipartisan fashion, but imposing a one-size government, Washington knows best solution is more of what we saw back in 1993 and a mistake.",
        "Mary - quick…",
        "Farai, let me just say that if something is enacted for health care, it will be done by the people who represent the people.",
        "It won't be done by some pointy-headed bureaucrat in Washington.",
        "Congress will vote for it and it won't be done by the president alone.",
        "So we don't have to worry about it being representative.",
        "The second thing is Alan Greenspan even says the tax cuts, the Bush tax cuts were wrong at the time, and that he just mumbled too much and didn't tell us.",
        "So I don't know about that.",
        "And it won't just be - even if it is Massachusetts as one state, what's puzzling to me is why Romney doesn't want to take credit for his own ideas and his own plans."

        "Okay.",
        "The dog that the African-American community has is that we are disproportionately poor and disproportionately without health insurance because of that, and disproportionately likely to be ill for all kinds of reasons that - to have been well documented.",
        "And so you got all these people who are suffering because of the lack of it.",

        "All of these, the dog that African-Americans have in the fight is we - they should be for a strong health care reform to make sure that everybody get insured so that people can get medical care, and stop dying, and suffering from things, and dying too young.",

        "I know you were going to move on.",
        "I have to say this very briefly.",
        "The federal government in working in conjunctions with the states through the Medicaid program insures that those who are at the most need of having medical care, medical assistance who provided that, the Democrats in Congress have used the SCHIP program, the student child health care insurance program is a backdoor plan to try to bring everybody on the health care role as opposed to these poor, needy children that deserve that health care treatment the best.",
        "So I think this is an interesting debate that we'll have here in Washington.",
        "But African-Americans and those who are traditionally at risk, or those who are at the lower economic strata already have a safety net.",
        "We need to strengthen that safety net.",
