        "Alex joins us now from Cape Town, South Africa.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Hi.",
        "So today is the sixth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and most of our national focus has been on terrorists from Afghanistan and Arab nations.",
        "So what does East Africa have to do with terrorism?",
        "Well, it's primarily about geography.",
        "East Africa is basically just south of the Middle East.",
        "And there's a potential overspill of the turmoil in the Middle East.",
        "Influences have always traveled that way.",
        "Christianity basically found its legs in the Ethiopia.",
        "Islam also did, when the Islamists were thrown out of Saudi Arabia or when they were thrown out of Mecca.",
        "They found refuge in Ethiopia.",
        "And now, the fear is that this sort of turmoil that you see to the north will also come south and to some extent, that's already come true.",
        "Somalia is home to the oldest and best-established jihadi camps in Africa.",
        "Al-Qaida has a presence there.",
        "You know, lot of the Islamism is homegrown and locally focused.",
        "But there are - both al-Qaida and U.S.",
        "military, regards Somalia essentially as the third front on the war on terror.",
        "Is there any evidence that East Africans actually have been involved in international attacks?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Plenty.",
        "I mean, there's the - in 1988, that we tend to think of September 11th is the start date for the war on terror.",
        "But 1988, essentially, where when the first shots were fired when two American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were blown up with simultaneous car bombs and attacks had killed, I think, 224 people.",
        "That was carried out by a group of people who subsequently and probably, previously, had found refuge in the camps in Somalia.",
        "Now you recently reported from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.",
        "And in your article, you called it, quote, \"\"a town of spooks.\"\" What did you mean by that?",
        "You just can't avoid bumping into suspicious people with lots of information.",
        "It is.",
        "I mean, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa.",
        "And in some ways, it's a spiritual spencer(ph).",
        "It's the only country in Africa that was never colonized.",
        "It's also where, you know, early man was first born for the 5.8 million years ago.",
        "So it has this sense of being a heartland, and as one diplomat puts, it's the center of gravity for the region, perhaps not all of Africa but certainly for East Africa.",
        "And to that extent, it attracts the spooks because when everybody is looking at the Horn as a potential risk area, something that could blow up, everybody has their spies on the ground in Ethiopia.",
        "It is slightly unnerving, you know.",
        "Addis Ababa is a town of cafes.",
        "Ethiopia produces great coffee.",
        "And in cafe culture, it's very much part of the culture.",
        "But just sitting in a cafe, you hear - you overhear the most amazing conversations going on on next-door tables."

        "So when you're talking about these spooks or spies and operatives, you really are talking about many different nations.",
        "How many different nations do you think have an active role or an active stake in Ethiopia's future?",
        "His machine made breaking the Nazi enigma code possible, saving millions of lives as it helped the Allies win World War II.",
        "But Turing wondered if a machine could calculate anything, could it calculate thought, and this idea gave birth to the field of artificial intelligence.",
        "But Alan Turing was gay, a taboo that led him to his arrest and chemical castration by the British government.",
        "He was found dead at the age of 41, ruled a suicide by the coroner.",
        "Turing feared that his work would be forgotten and dismissed because, as he put it, Turing believes machines think, Turing lies with men, therefore machines do not think.",
        "Here with me to remember both a war hero and a scientist reviled in his time is David Leavitt, professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville, author of the book \"\"The Man Who Knew Too Much: Alan Turing and the Origins of the Computer.\"\" Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let's talk about his achievements.",
        "Tell us what made him most famous and his biggest achievements were.",
        "Well, it really depends on, I think, your own perspective.",
        "Turing really had four major achievements in my view.",
        "One was that he resolved a major problem in mathematical logic, the so-called decision problem.",
        "In order to do that, he invented a kind of hypothetical universal machine that was the avatar of the modern computer.",
        "He was responsible for the building and the design of the machine that broke the enigma code during World War II.",
        "And with some of his later papers, he really established the field of artificial intelligence.",
        "So in some ways, the question what was his major achievement, it sort of depends on who you ask.",
        "I think for anyone to have done any of those things in a lifetime would have been extraordinary.",
        "To have done all four is mindboggling.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What is a Turing machine?",
        "A Turing machine is a very simple hypothetical machine that is - initially, the idea of the Turing machine was that it would - was programmed to solve a particular algorithm.",
        "Turing then went on to prove that there could be what he called the universal machine that is to say a machine into which instructions could be fed by which that machine could resolve or solve or approach or try to solve any algorithm, an infinite number of algorithms.",
        "And he actually proved that such a machine could hypothetically exist.",
        "And so the Turing machine is that machine.",
        "It's that machine that can be turned into any other machine, and that was his huge breakthrough."

        "And there was also a test that he devised, was there not?",
        "About whether you could tell if somebody in a different room was a machine or a person.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This was one of Turing's most, I think, radical and interesting ideas.",
        "He posited that the way to determine whether a machine could think was whether that machine could convince a human being that it was thinking.",
        "And so he proposed this game, which he called the imitation game, which is actually now played annually at a sort of competition, where there'd be two human beings and a computer, and one of the human beings would be asking questions of the other human being and the computer.",
        "And based on the answers, he or she would have to decide which was the computer and which was the human being.",
        "If the computer could fool the interlocutor into thinking that it was human, then according to Turing, the machine could think.",
        "Did he actually build the device that would fool people that way?",
        "He was kind of moving that way when he was in Manchester, when he was actually working on computers.",
        "Turing had a very, I think, restless imagination, and I think he was much more interested in the theoretical foundations of things.",
        "It seemed like whenever he was onto something, he would want to move to something else.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "So he was going on into biology toward the end of his life, into an entirely different area of inquiry.",

        "That was a - that's a pretty coy title, obviously.",
        "I was referring to the Hitchcock film, \"\"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\"\" But I meant it in two ways.",
        "On the one hand, he knew too much for his own good.",
        "I mean, to possess that quantity of knowledge, I think, could be a sort of overwhelming experience for anyone.",
        "He also knew too much in the sense that he was perceived by the British government in the years after World War II as a security risk because of the quantity of classified information that he had in his possession.",
        "And, therefore, he was really hounded by the British police who were concerned that because he was gay, he would - he could be easily blackmailed or seduced into going over to the East.",
        "Remember, this was the sort of epoch of Guy Burgess.",
        "So his knowledge, as that little syllogism that you quoted implies, he really felt that his knowledge was going to somehow be his undoing and that his homosexuality was going to interfere with getting the word out about the - what he believed what and he discovered."

        "He never kept his homosexuality.",

        "His attitude was that it was perfectly normal and not a big deal.",
        "And so he behaved as if everyone else felt the same way, which was obviously a big mistake at that time.",
        "Tell us - talk a little bit about that, that it was a crime to be a homosexual at that point - that period and to act out in your homosexuality.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There was a law on the books that was colloquially known as the blackmailer's charter because it criminalized, quote/unquote, \"\"acts of gross, indecency between adult men in public or private.\"\" And it was under this law that Oscar Wilde was arrested and sent to prison.",
        "The law was obviously a terrible law and it could be - it was applied very selectively.",
        "Turing had been having an affair with a young man in Manchester whom he suspected of having robbed him.",
        "So he reported the robbery to the police, who turned around and arrested him under the auspices or under the terms of the blackmailer's charter.",
        "He was then given a choice between serving prison time or undergoing a, quote/unquote, \"\"cure\"\" for his homosexuality, which consisted of massive doses of estrogen and amounted to what we would now call chemical castration.",
        "Even after this period when the so-called treatments had ended, the police followed him everywhere and made it very, very difficult for him to have anything like a normal life.",
        "Yes.",

        "One is that he committed suicide.",
        "One is that his death was accidental.",
        "And the third is that it was set up, that he was actually killed and that it was contrived to look like a suicide.",
        "That third, I think, has pretty much now been dismissed.",
        "The suicide idea I think grabbed people's imagination because Turing loved the film \"\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"\" And when he was at Cambridge, he would often quote from the evil queen's incantation, dip the apple in the brew.",
        "And so the idea that he'd committed suicide by eating an apple dipped in cyanide, you know, was incredibly terrifying, but also kind of, you know, created a - to led the whole mythology, including the myth that the apple and Apple computers was a reference to Turing.",
        "It's really unclear.",
        "I don't think that an absolute answer can be given.",
        "However, my own feeling is that the argument that he died accidentally because he accidentally got cyanide on the apple that he went ahead and ate kind of reminds me of the old thing about Rose Mary Woods' argument when she was Nixon's secretary about how she erased the tapes.",
        "Yeah, but - yeah.",
