        "Yes, go ahead.",
        "Actually, I am just now leaving work and I couldn't believe you guys we're talking about Turing.",
        "I'm actually wearing a shirt right now that says, I failed the Turing test.",
        "We're (unintelligible) humor.",
        "But anyways, I'm calling because I actually didn't encounter Turing as a computer science major.",
        "I encountered him as a philosophy major, reading an argument called \"\"The Chinese Room Argument,\"\" which hypothesizes a room in which you could put someone who only speaks English and then give them a book that has an infinite amount of responses to anything that could possibly be asked of the room, any instruction that could be given.",
        "And the idea is you could give this guy Chinese - you could give this guy information in Chinese, and he could follow the instructions in the book and correct responses but have absolutely no idea what it was that he was actually doing.",
        "And in such a way, you could create a machine that could pass the Turing test without actually having to think, with no idea what it was doing.",
        "Right.",
        "Let me just remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "What do you think of that?",
        "You know, it's an interesting argument, that's John Searle's quite famous paper.",
        "And I think it is certainly one that's very worthy of consideration.",
        "Turing anticipated that argument and his position was that, essentially, well, yes, you can say to this computer, if you don't know that you're thinking, then you're not thinking.",
        "If you're not aware that you're not thinking, then you're not thinking.",
        "But Turing said, you could also say that to me.",
        "I could say that to you.",
        "I could say, I don't have proof that when you give me answers to questions, you're actually going through a thought process and not just copying Chinese characters.",
        "Give me that proof.",
        "And Turing's point was that that's impossible.",
        "From his point of view as a mathematician, someone trained in mathematical proofs on a sort of reductio ad absurdum basis, if something functions in a way that suggests it's true, then it is true.",
        "This was also a very anti-Christian argument and that kind of negated the idea of the soul so - but he did anticipate that argument.",
        "And in his paper, he does, in a sense, refute it in advance.",
        "But why do people like our last caller, why do they have to stumble on Alan Turing?",
        "And they - he's not a well-known computer guru.",
        "He - I think his reputation was if not suppressed, then sort of conveniently forgotten for many years because of the scandalous nature of his - what happened to him in the last years of his life.",
        "It was considered unseemly, and people didn't really want to talk about it.",
        "Turing was also the opposite of a self-promoter.",
        "He was very shy.",
        "He was very awkward.",
        "He didn't have any skills of putting himself across.",
        "And so, therefore, he didn't do much to ensure that he would - that his reputation would survive.",
        "I think the third element was the fact that so much of the work he did was classified, and, therefore, people actually couldn't get access to the information.",
        "And it wasn't until Andrew Hodges' wrote his biography and Martin Davis, a professor at Berkeley, began doing a lot of research on the history of computers that Turing's - the incredible importance of Turing's role really came to light."

        "Subsequently, there was a motion in the House of Lords to issue a posthumous pardon, which was refused within the House of Lords.",
        "It was voted down on the grounds that even if what Turing - the crime he was convicted of would not be considered a crime now, it was considered a crime then.",

        "But it's clear from the conversations that I've had with healthcare workers around the country over the last few months that this is something that is causing a lot of passionate feelings and concern among both healthcare workers and among patients.",
        "On the one hand, you have healthcare workers who feel like they're being asked to do things that conflict with their deeply held personal moral or religious beliefs.",
        "And on the other hand, you have patients who feel like they're being denied access to legal medical care that they're entitled to.",
        "And have some of those patients taken their - these people to court?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What's happened is that when these two interests come into conflict, what will sometimes happen is you'll have patients who will sue their providers or file complaints against them when they feel like they've denied access to something.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And on the other hand, you'll have healthcare workers who've been disciplined or fired or suffered some sort of penalty who will be suing their employers, charging religious discrimination.",

        "And most of the time, they've - the healthcare workers in the clinics and the facilities, they find a way to settle it informally.",
        "Someone will say I don't feel comfortable doing this, and another - a coworker will step in and take over for them, and it happens quietly behind the scenes, and, as you said, often times, patients may not even be aware of it.",
        "But what happens is every once in awhile, through the specific circumstances, there'll be a conflict that occurs and that's when you have these flare-ups.",
        "In some circumstances, is this not a reflection of, well, you know, insufficient information made available to the patient.",
        "For example, Catholic hospitals don't do abortions.",
        "Everybody knows that.",
        "That's right, and sometimes what happens is that patients will either be taken to a hospital not realizing that it's run by a religious institution, and when they get there, they - like a typical example is a woman who'll give - have child - give birth to a baby, and then oftentimes afterwards, she'll decide she wants to undergo a voluntary sterilization.",
        "Then she'll find out, no, we don't do that here.",
        "You have to go elsewhere.",
        "And sometimes patients will just show up at a doctor's office not realizing that the particular provider that they're seeing has these beliefs, and then they'll discover - and they'll say, no, I don't feel like I can do this, not comfortable, and it'll come as a shock to them because they weren't expecting it.",

        "And it really in this country, as you said, it's when Roe versus Wade was passed is when it became a prominent issue.",
        "And in the wake of that, most every state passed what they called a conscience law which specifically permitted doctors and nurses who did not want to participate in abortion from stepping away and not being forced to do so.",

        "That makes a profession different from a job, that there's special training, there's special credentialing, there's special privileges, but at the bottom-line there's a duty.",
        "And in medicine the duty is always to the care of the patient whether it's the cure of the patient, the treatment of the patient, the prevention of harm.",
        "But a professional in medicine whether a doctor, a nurse, a technician, a pharmacist, always works in a system that is organized around the health and wellbeing of the patient.",
        "So, yes, that duty to care is always about placing the patient's needs above one's own needs.",
        "And, in your view, does professional responsibility always trump personal conviction?",
        "Well, that's a very interesting thing because we - especially the field that I'm in, in bioethics, we talk a lot about the patient as a whole person, but we also talk about physicians as whole people.",
        "And I don't know anyone who would say, well, I don't really care about my doctor's values.",
        "You know, maybe some people would say that...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You know, in response to the physician's comment just now, if we use reasonable action to make our decisions with, the health of the patient comes first, but how do we weigh the health of one patient who is 85 at end of their life versus the possibility of saving 10,000 lives with better food and immunizations.",
        "...but if you're in a relationship with someone, you generally want them to bring their values.",

        "If we try to control for every sort of belief I think we're going to run into some problems because if we try to make laws that say, none of your beliefs can have anything to do with the performance on your duty, we're touching on areas like clinical judgment, candor, empathy; it's hard to control for those things.",

        "But we all play our part in this system; my insurer plays a part because I hand over that card, too.",
