        "Hi, I'm a going to be a starting med student.",
        "But one of the ironies going in with this conversation is, you know, when you're applying to med school they actually ask you what you'll do in these situations and I kind of think that's nice that they do it.",
        "But, you know, going to making another comment about the professional duty, I think that's its very important that a doctor does do there professional duty but at the same time, you know, it's kind of hard to just say you can't completely ignore your personal ethics either.",
        "I mean, me being a Roman Catholic, if I perform an abortion I will be excommunicated from my faith.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "But, I mean, it's - you know, to me it is just something that is just something that's a lot more complex than just one personal belief.",
        "What's the difference between your doing it or just referring a patient who wants an abortion to somebody else who will do it?",
        "You know, I've often dealt with this issue and often discussed it, and it's one of those things that yeah, in a way I am being complicit by referring it to someone else to do it.",
        "But in a way, you know, I got to do what's best for the patient.",
        "But I, you know, I just can't really live with myself if I'm, in fact, doing the abortion.",
        "Yes, Rob Stein, there were some healthcare givers in your article who said they would decline to refer somebody else.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean that's the solution a lot of people but forth to get around this.",
        "Is that, okay, if you don't feel comfortable doing it, then at least you can refer the patient elsewhere.",
        "But there are a lot of healthcare workers - I spoke to a lot of pharmacists, there are doctors who did not feel comfortable doing that.",
        "They felt that that would make them equally complicit with the act.",
        "We were talking about Oregon University and I spoke to a doctor there right after that policy came out and he was livid because that policy required him to refer patients elsewhere for physician assisted suicide, and he was morally opposed to that, felt he could have no participation in it whatsoever.",
        "Dr. Scheidt is this an issue in your association?",
        "Yes, it certainly is.",
        "I think if the situation is acute and the life of the patient is in the balance it takes precedence.",
        "However, in any elective situation, I should think the doctor would have the right not even to refer.",
        "There would be time then for the patient to find a doctor to accommodate his wishes."

        "And being able to pars it saying that there are ways, and medicine allows you to do this, to say you could have a situation where you in some situations could decide not to do something but to refer the patient onward.",
        "Because there is another very important duty in medicine and that is non abandonment of a patient.",
        "And this is taken very, very seriously in medicine.",

        "I mean, imagine a situation where this is a primary care provider or an emergency situation.",
        "Again, that goes to power imbalance between the patient and the physician.",
        "And so we have to be very mindful that these rights do not exist in isolation from one another.",
        "And I do think that the referral process, which is in most codes of ethics and most policy statements on this, seems to be - if it is possible to make it work in practice - seems to be a way of managing these conflicts.",

        "I'm 71 and I graduated from medical school in 1960.",
        "Consensus at that time was abortion was wrong and there were very few ethical dilemmas.",

        "It's already there when you get to medical school, and perhaps that's part of the dilemma for students who are now coming on board.",
        "But I practice in a community who shares my values.",
