        "You don't believe he was honest in his criticism of the government?",
        "Well, no, I think he was honest in his criticism of the government, but I think that he underplayed some of the complexities that he was part of.",

        "So he was, if you want, an apparatchik in the system.",
        "But I think he underplayed the challenges that the crown prince had to overcome.",
        "Are we learning here why he would have so irritated someone in Saudi Arabia because he would be seen as an insider, someone who had been part of the system then criticizing the system?",
        "He didn't really irritate people that much.",
        "He was not a threat.",
        "I think as this thing is being investigated, what happens sometimes is elements in the security service or people who are responsible for internal security tend to magnify issues.",
        "And there was an overreaction to it, and obviously, it was a criminal overreaction 'cause ultimately...",
        "If you'll forgive me - there are overreactions, and there overreactions.",
        "Well, it's a criminal overreaction.",
        "This case, according to a Turkish newspaper, 15 Saudi officials, 15 Saudi government functionaries, gathered to assassinate a man and cut him apart with a bone saw.",
        "I mean, this is not, like - it's hard to believe that he wasn't considered a severe problem by someone.",
        "No.",
        "He was considered a severe problem by someone.",
        "And I said it was a criminal overreaction.",
        "And I think what's happening in Saudi Arabia now is there is a serious investigation going on, and the Turks have not been helpful because the Saudi prosecutor has been asking, for example, for the recordings.",
        "The Turks have been releasing leaks right, left and center.",
        "They've given the Saudi prosecutors the transcripts, but they have not given them the recordings.",
        "And the Saudi government is trying to make an effort to pursue a proper legal process.",
        "People don't seem to take that with a lot of credibility, if they're trying.",

        "The CIA has briefed the United States Senate.",

        "Because first of all, the CIA gave a medium-to-high assessment that they thought the crown prince was involved.",
        "And as I've said before, with all due respect to the CIA, maybe their understanding of what happens in the inner, inner sanctums of the royal palace is isn't perfect.",
        "Yes, I think they were authorized to go and interrogate him and maybe to bring him back or to try and bring him back.",
        "But it was an operation that was carried, in a way, off the grid.",
        "In other words, it was not carried out by the professional elements within Saudi intelligence.",
        "It was a team put together from different parts of the security services...",

        "People who have been pictured physically close to the crown prince because they're part of the security services.",

        "What can individual investors learn from the stories of Warren Buffett and Kenneth Lay?",
        "Well, I think the first interesting thing about Kenneth Lay is that up until Enron started to fall apart he was celebrated as a charismatic and dynamic and innovative leader of a company that had grown to be worth tens of billions of dollars, so it can be difficult.",
        "Certainly pre-internet - I think the Internet is changing things, but it has been difficult to get information on who the people are running the companies and what sort of culture they're creating.",
        "So I love the idea of trying to evaluate the very best and the very worst public company leadership, as an investor myself, and try and see, well, what traits travel with greatness among leaders and what traits travel with impending failure.",
        "And I guess I'd cite, in distinguishing Mr. Buffett versus Mr. Lay, first - and I have a couple different thoughts on it - but the first is just if you look at the cultures of the company, and you could get some sense of that, Enron really had a very arrogant and hard-driving culture, very focused on the next three months of business; and Warren Buffett is very well known throughout his professional career for having demonstrated humility.",
        "I mean, I think he has spoken to business-school audiences and said just, you know, I think 99 percent of this is luck.",
        "I happened to be born in a great place in a great time that valued highly someone who knows how to allocate capital, so I think humility and arrogance is something that anyone should look at, whether it's an organization you're working at or a company that you're thinking about investing in.",
        "A lot of us, if we're thinking about investing, tend to look at charts and graphs and statistics.",
        "You say the CEO.",
        "Look at him, too, or her.",
        "Yes.",
        "I love to see how much stock the CEO owns and how long the CEO's been with the company.",
        "I also like to try and get some sense of whether or not I think the business is using conservative or speculative accounting.",
        "And I think those travel with humility and arrogance as well.",
        "You will find the more humbler leader will often be more conservative in their approach to reporting to their shareholders how they're doing.",
        "The more arrogant leader will feel entitled to push the accounting rules as far as he or she possibly can in order to overstate the success of that organization.",
        "So, I'm always trying to evaluate, in my investments and in my recommendations at the Motley Fool, whether or not I think the leadership group is treating outside shareholders - the smallest shareholder, somebody with $2,000 invested - as a partner that they have to report to simultaneously all the information that they know, or as somebody they that, maybe they even feel entitled to take advantage of.",
        "I mean, there was a lot of insider selling at Enron when the news was bad, but it hadn't been released.",
        "And that is just such a loss of perspective by people who already had millions and millions of dollars.",
        "To be selling stock in advance of bad news getting out there shows that you've lost perspective of what money is and isn't in life.",
        "Well, in an odd way, you and Warren Buffett, you're a lot alike.",
        "I mean, he does many of the same things you do."

        "One thing - one interesting thing I'll say about Warren Buffett that most people may not think about, in his personal accounts when he invests, he invests in much smaller companies than Berkshire Hathaway can.",
        "So I think a lot of - if you're a bit of an enterprising investor trying to get returns like Warren Buffett did throughout his career, you wouldn't be necessarily buying Berkshire Hathaway stock.",
        "It's already a company valued in excess of $100 billion.",
        "Buffett would be - if he didn't have so much money to allocate, he would be looking for smaller companies.",
        "He said that if he said than, I believe, $10 million to invest, he thinks he could get about 50 percent investment returns per year, and I believe him.",
        "But you're really going to get that out of finding small, unknown, obscure but well-run companies that the rest of the investing community doesn't yet know about.",
        "Let me turn your attention, briefly, to another story today.",
        "Coke's secret recipe was reportedly stolen, and three thieves allegedly tried to sell it to Pepsi.",
        "This is pretty interesting example of industrial espionage.",
        "Well there's a - you know, if you're thinking about going to law school, I think intellectual property law is the area you want to get involved in.",
        "We're moving into a world, a global marketplace, where we're seeing all over the place knock-offs, the theft of intellectual property, whether it's music videos - that will be a big issue online is how movies and other video creations are passed around without rewards to the original creator.",
        "That's a wonderful situation for your situation for your ten-year-old to find themselves in.",
        "I mean, many adults don't have that when you factor in how much credit card debt they're carrying.",
        "So she's well ahead of the game.",
        "So this is just another smaller, slightly - I mean it's - on some level its huge, but on another level, Neal, I'd say, I know I'll probably offend some of your listeners by saying this, but I think the distinction between what a Coke is and what a Pepsi is is small enough, and I think Pepsi, as an honest organization, knows they wouldn't have benefited from that information anyway.",
        "But these are drinks - the real issue for Coke and Pepsi is not about the information that might get passed between those two companies, but about their products being under pressure.",
        "Their brands are being under pressure now by natural sodas, the things that you might buy at Whole Foods, that don't have 39 grams of high fructose corn syrup.",
        "So the same issues that faced companies like offering Wonder Bread and Krispy Kreme Donuts that were hit for dietary concerns by the medical community, I think these artificial sugar soft drinks are really under pressure in the years ahead because of the new nutritional instructions we're going to get from our doctors."
