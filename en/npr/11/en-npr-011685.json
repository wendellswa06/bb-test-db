        "Absolutely.",
        "It's an intangible asset and I think that, so the real risk there is just that the idea that a secret formula is gone, that there's no more secret recipe for the company that's held onto that as a patented and private piece of information for many, many decades.",

        "For example, I work for Norfolk Southern, and while we're reporting record profits and paying the CEO's multimillion-dollar salaries, they're cutting employee benefits back, which seems questionable morally.",
        "Is there any way to invest in companies that are a little bit better?",
        "Not necessarily better investments, but...",
        "Well, Tom Gardner, I know that there are so-called green portfolios.",
        "Sure.",
        "And the Calvert Family of Funds has socially responsible index funds, socially responsible funds, and I think, you know, I think that's it's a personal decision.",
        "That's how I view it as I look at my investments.",
        "I think there are some situations, for example - and I don't know the story of Norfolk Southern, it's not a company that I follow - but there are certain situations where an executive team would actually be rewarded for bringing greater efficiency to a company that may have been managing itself sloppily for many, many years.",

        "I mean, the real danger with executive leadership in the U.S.",
        "that I see is that the average tenure of a CEO is about four or five years, which means that they don't have necessarily top of mind of putting that organization in a position to succeed for the next 20 to 25 years, which is what investing owners should be thinking about when they invest.",
        "So, in terms of looking at companies and evaluating whether or not you believe in who they are and what they do and how they act and whether they abide their mission and core values, after all, I think the second core value in Enron's annual report was integrity.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So, I think what it requires you to do is look at your own life, where you spend your money and your time, what you believe in as a consumer, and then I do think using the Internet to go to the Web site of the company, you can Google and search the backgrounds of the CEO and CFO and the board members; there are SEC filings that are available for free online, where you can look at the 14-A filing and see who these - who are these board members, what are their backgrounds?",
        "How much stock does the leadership group own?",
        "In general, you're going to find that executives that own a lot of stock in their company treat their company like a house that they own or a car that they own, rather than a car that they're renting.",

        "It doesn't really happen.",
        "So, people take care of what they own, and I like to find that in the executive groups that I invest in.",

        "Where, if their child agrees to put aside a dollar for five years or more, the parents will match it with another dollar.",

        "Along the theme of IPOs, and you see more of them, and they seem to be coming back these days.",
        "And, you know, it's really tough, I think, for an individual investor to make that kind of call.",
        "But, like, Shutterfly, I think was going to launch last week.",
        "And how would an individual investor make an investment in something like Shutterfly?",
        "Well, the initial public markets really, and it's a wonderful question, because there's such an interesting part of the marketplace.",
        "Individuals can be swept up in the enthusiasm of IPOs, and when they are, that usually means the market is moving toward a top and should get you concerned.",
        "Because, in fact, the stock market is essentially an auction market; and, in general, we don't want to be bidding on merchandise that everyone else is bidding on.",
        "We'd rather find something great on a corner table with an auctioneer that no one's listening to, that we get to buy at a deep discount.",
        "So what happens on the day of an IPO is that company is getting more exposure in the financial community than it has - than it certainly will be getting, on average, six months later.",
        "So you'll see that the average IPO is trading below its initial price six months after the IPO.",
        "And what that says to me is don't be concerned about getting in on day one.",
        "Wall Street and the investment banks may want to create some bubbling enthusiasm in the marketplace to help them sell their positions, but in general, you're better off letting the company come public, have it go through a quarter of its earnings as a public company at least, and then start to evaluate the business at - usually what you'll find is a lower price than what existed on the first day.",
        "So I would just discourage you from feeling that the train leaves the station on IPO day and you can never board it again.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's good advice.",
        "And do you feel the volume is coming back up, though, from an IPO standpoint?",
        "Certainly, there are more IPOs than there were in 2002.",
        "And it's not - we're not seeing the feverish pitch of, wow, another one doubled the day that it came public!",
        "Right.",
        "So when you start feeling that, even use your intuition and gut a little bit, and as you go through a couple cycles you'll learn.",
        "You can also track IPO numbers so you can be more quantitative about it.",
        "But you'll begin to sense that, wow, the market's getting a little bit pricier than it was when nobody wanted to buy stock and no company could find a marketplace of investors ready to buy its IPO."
