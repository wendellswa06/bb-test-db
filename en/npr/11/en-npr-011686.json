        "Good afternoon, Neal.",
        "Okay.",
        "In one sense, and let me begin with you, Michael Sallah, this is the story of two buddies, Sam Ybarra and Ken Green, who grew up together in Globe, Arizona.",
        "They enlisted in the 101st Airborne Division together.",
        "They later served together in that elite platoon known as Tiger Force, and tell us a little bit about how they became killers.",
        "Well, I think that the war, certainly with Tiger Force, initially, was one of reconnaissance.",
        "It was about topnotch soldiers being able to go into the terrain, find the enemy, and call in air strikes.",
        "It was a very brave unit.",
        "Unfortunately, the unit that it started out to be was eventually brought on to do relocation in the Central Highlands, basically, a civilian affairs unit.",
        "In some ways, though, they were obviously still fighting the war, and it began to spin out of control.",
        "Things began to go wrong around May of 1967.",
        "It escalated to where they became very frustrated in trying to move the Buddhist farmers into relocation camps.",
        "Eventually, they began systematically killing them.",
        "They would throw grenades into underground bunkers where men and women were hiding, creating mass underground graves.",
        "They would go into, they would go onto, well, rice paddies and just systematically kill, execute these farmers who were unarmed, most of them were elderly, some of them as they pleaded for their lives.",
        "These two friends quickly evolved into killers, and when one of them died, when Boots Green was killed in the Quang Nam province in September, Sam went over the edge, Sam Ybarra went over the edge and began mutilating bodies, began cutting off ears, wearing them as human necklaces, and so were other members of the Force, not just those two.",
        "But they became very much emblematic of the Tiger Force soldier and how they denigrated into killers, essentially.",
        "And, Mitch Weiss, in another sense, this is the story of an army cop, a warrant officer in the Criminal Investigations Command by the name of Gustav Apsey, a man who showed incredible determination to unravel this story years after it happened.",
        "Correct.",
        "Gustav, ironically enough, was the son of a Nazi officer, and he basically, I remember, you know, Gustav telling us stories about how he would see his father come home sometimes from interrogating prisoners, and he was caked with blood, and his father was killed by the Yugoslav resistance in 1944.",
        "And this was a man who basically, after the war was over, his mother married an American GI, was educated by the Jesuits - basically was a guy who grew up during the Nuremburg trials, and he always felt that America was a wonderful, great country and should be held to a higher standard, and it was just, you know, just so ironic that this son of this Nazi officer would lead the longest war crimes case of the Vietnam War.",
        "And in another sense, this is a story about a lost campaign in a lost war, about why Tiger Force was sent into Vietnam Central Highlands in the first place, and about why more senior officers did nothing to try to stop them, and, Michael Sallah, this was reported to battalion officers at the time.",
        "It went up the chain of command at various points, and everybody seemed to say, look, just don't stir things up."

        "Well, I wondered about that.",
        "It's tempting to dismiss Mr. Gomez's contest as a gimmick, but gimmicks can be as useful in politics as political action committees.",
        "A politician could court contributors while the body-double sits behind the politician's nameplate, through the drone of committee meetings so dreary they wouldn't even be on C-SPAN.",
        "If the Lakeside Council of Neighbors meets one night at the same time as the Lakeview Citizens Committee, a politician and his double can make both meetings, and both sincerely declare I wouldn't miss this.",

        "And he can appear before an anti-gun control group while he sends a body-double to speak before a pro-gun control group, and then both earnestly and fervently can deny whatever the other said.",
        "A politician can use his body-double the way a child blames an imaginary friend for breaking the living room lamp.",
        "But a body-double might also be more relaxed, interesting, slightly irreverent and lots more entertaining than the politician that he or she is doubling.",

        "I mean, these are folks like Etan Thomas of the Washington Wizards who's an anti-war poet and an anti-death penalty activist - Adam Morrison of the Charlotte Bobcats, who's fighting for national health care - Adonal Foyle, who believes in campaign finance reform -even an NFL player named Scott Fujita, who is trying to speak about civil liberties in the United States and relaying his own experiences being the grandson of a Japanese-American who was interned during World War II.",
        "See, I think what we're seeing is because - you know, we have the war in Iraq, which has now lasted longer than World War II - because of hurricane Katrina, it's becoming harder and harder for professional athletes to live in figurative and literal gated communities.",
