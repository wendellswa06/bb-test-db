        "Well, it has - freedom of speech has actually been contracting for the last two years because during this process, which is very contentious, and particularly when you are taking on a reactionary conservative class and religious establishment, a lot of the things that the crown prince has done - not just allowing women to drive, but integrating women into the labor force - so much has happened to quote-unquote \"\"liberalize\"\" society that has been fought extremely aggressively by the religious class.",
        "And we have seen what happened to other people who have tried to address the conservative class in the Middle East and have been overthrown.",
        "You're trying to explain to me why political activists have been arrested even in this period of supposed reform?",

        "Yes, there have.",
        "There have.",

        "His brothers - one of his brothers, who's a plastic surgeon - said that, you know, when he was a kid growing up, he always looked out for the underdog.",
