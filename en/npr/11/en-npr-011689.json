        "I think that it is.",
        "I think that, you know, the U.S.",
        "Military, we kind of hold ourselves to - we do try to hold ourselves to uphold the laws of armed conflict, and we need to do that.",
        "You know, any force that's going to be comprised of a cross-section of society, and when individuals do stray from that, we need to hold them to account.",
        "What's frustrating, though, to be in the service, is to see an appropriate amount of scrutiny placed on U.S.",
        "forces, but none placed on our adversaries.",
        "It almost feels like, you know, the U.S.",
        "media, for the most part, parrots Al-Jazeera.",
        "If you can see a dead person in Iraq or Afghanistan, and they're wearing civilian clothes, Al-Jazeera and much of the U.S.",
        "media assumes, well, it's a civilian.",
        "Well, maybe he's an unlawful combatant, because maybe he was shooting at U.S.",
        "forces and he, therefore, is guilty of a war crime and violating laws of armed conflict.",
        "He ought to be in uniform and clearly mark himself as a combatant so that we can use, you know, discriminate means with proportionality and all the other terms that come from knowledge of the rules of engagement and laws of armed conflict.",
        "But when the other side violates it, when they fire from a mosque, the responsibility ought to be on them to say, they have taken what was formerly a protected place and they have turned it into a lawful target for us to respond to when they're firing from it.",
        "I see no coverage from our media about war crimes of the adversary, and it's frustrating.",
        "Jeff, thanks very much, appreciate it.",
        "I wanted to ask you guys to comment on that, because those kinds of allegations were certainly made about this sort of thing in Vietnam, 40 years ago.",
        "Well...",
        "Well, I think that that's, I'm sorry, Mitch, go ahead.",

        "When somebody goes and tells their leadership that that's going on, that, you know, the leadership - it's incumbent upon the leadership to do something to stop that kind of behavior.",
        "And just as the soldiers on the ground committing the atrocities are guilty of war crimes, their leadership, all the way up the chain of command, that knew about it or even had a hint about it really are very guilty of the same things because their job - you know, when a soldier's on the ground in the situation, it doesn't take that much to push a soldier to that point.",
        "I've had to stop myself from really doing things that I shouldn't be doing, and I've really had to make a conscious decision not to do it, because you just get so frustrated, particularly in situations where - like the previous caller was talking about, where you have civilians attacking or people dressed as civilians attacking you.",
        "You know, it gets to the point where you just want to shoot everyone around you.",
        "You don't, you stop yourself, and you keep your soldiers, you know, under control, as well.",
        "And I have to really give a lot of credit to the soldiers that I worked with, because there was a lot of times when I could see that they were getting pushed to that point and they stopped themselves and they really exercised self-control.",
        "But I really hope that even though it's 40 years past, that someone goes back and looks at the leadership that knew what was going on and did nothing to stop it, and sets that example for the world that it doesn't how many years have passed, we will still do something to correct the problem."
