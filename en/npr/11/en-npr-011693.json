        "What did you use before?",
        "Well, like most cities out here, we don't routinely plow residential streets because luckily we don't have to.",
        "Our snowfalls typically are smaller, and they don't give people a problem getting from Point A to Point B.",
        "Our resources basically allow us to plow arterial streets and collector streets, and that keep us pretty busy.",
        "We have a problem, though, when we have the really big snowfalls that hit us occasionally, and in that case, like everyone else, we would hire contractors at great expense, and they would show up - typically, they'd do their private work, their parking lots and churches and so on, and then they'd show up a day or two later to work for us, but that's too late.",
        "A day or two late.",
        "The snow gets packed down and rutted and bonded to the pavement, and it's impossible to cut off at that point.",
        "And I assume the plows for the garbage trucks ran a pretty penny.",
        "Well, it depends.",
        "They're a one-time expense.",
        "They cost $20,000 a piece.",
        "And we bought 11 of them, so $220,000, which is a lot of money, but they'll last a long, long time, whereas contractors cost $100 an hour.",
        "And a few years ago, we had to hire 40 contractors, and we worked them day and night for a long time, and we ran up a tab of $750,000 and did a so-so job on our residential streets.",
        "So you can pay Peter, or you can pay Paul.",
        "Well, the idea, of course, for us is to get on the snow when it's soft and to do it quickly.",
        "You know, when it's fresh snow, and it can be plowed, that's the time to plow it, and we can't be dependent on contractors to show up a day or two later.",
        "So we decided to utilize our existing resources.",
        "We had a yard full of trash trucks, recycling trucks, and we had professional drivers for those trucks, and they know the residential street network better than anybody, literally, because they drive up and down them every week to pick up trash and recycling."

        "So we decided to put plows on the trucks, and, when we have these bigger events, to have these same drivers drive their routes, only this time they're plowing the center third of the street, up one side of the street and then eventually back down the other side, just as though they're picking up trash or recycling, only they're not.",
        "They're either plowing - they're just plowing in this instance.",
        "Well, you'd think garbage trucks and recycling trucks would be heavy enough to be good snowplows.",
        "Are there any problems with them?",
        "They are heavy.",
        "They're tandem-axle trucks, big, heavy trucks.",
        "They do need some weight in the back.",
        "So in this last event, where we sent them out and tried it, we actually left some trash and left some recycling on the trucks to give them weight.",
        "For those times when the trucks are empty, we have made some counterweights to fit inside the back of the trash truck to give it the weight it needs.",
        "Oh, to counter the weight of the plow.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Otherwise it gets a little squirrelly, and it'll want to turn sideways.",
        "You still need some weight over those rear tires to give you the traction to push the snow.",
        "And so we filled up some big tractor tires, farm tractor tires, with cement, and they have a lifting device on it.",
        "And we lift it on the back of the truck and close the gate, and away they go.",
        "You said you learned some dos and don'ts.",
        "Can you give us an example of one of each?",
        "Well, we have a lot of cul-de-sacs in our town, and these big trash trucks don't make that corner very well, especially when they're trying to push snow.",
        "So some of those cul-de-sacs we won't plow with the garbage trucks and the recycling trucks.",
        "We'll use pick-up trucks with plows on the front to zip in and out of those cul-de-sacs.",
        "The garbage trucks will do a great job plowing the straighter street.",
        "Well, good luck to you."

        "Combating snow is a really difficult thing, and it's very costly.",
