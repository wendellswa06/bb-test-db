        "On this island, there is no fresh water and(ph) streams and they rely 100 percent on rainwater, it's only source of drinking water.",

        "And when they're bad for hurricanes in the tropics, they're good for hurricanes near the coast.",
        "Writing in the journal Nature, Kossin warns that when the conditions flip, when the Atlantic cools and gets windier, it still breeds hurricanes.",
        "And that's when conditions along the coastline tend to intensify hurricanes as they get closer.",
        "Kossin says this phenomenon has protected the U.S.",
        "in the past, but there's no guarantee it will last.",
        "This has been a very lucky thing for us.",

        "So that--meaning that from then on I could cook in her kitchen, but it meant under her supervision.",
        "So I was very fortunate that I was able to get in my mother's kitchen and learn from her hand to cook her candied yams, her green beans, you know, with the little fatback that had been cooked for two or three hours so that the green beans would have that distinct flavor and taste, and pour a little bacon grease on top just to finish.",
        "Candied yams, as I mentioned, and my mother made them distinctly.",
        "She baked her sweet potatoes all first, then cooled them, peeled them, sliced them, sauted them and buttered, sprinkled sugar, then covered them with maple syrup--no orange juice, no lemon, no marshmallows, none of that stuff to camouflage the taste of the sweet potatoes.",
        "So I probably would bring a big bowl of sweet potatoes to make a contribution so that people would remember the sweetness."
