        "Well, let me go to Joe.",
        "Chef Joe, what about this whole sense of connection, that the African diaspora shares elements of foods?",
        "You run a cooking school in Savannah, which has a rich culinary history.",
        "What do you teach your students about where the foods that they're cooking come from?",
        "Well, the early Africans that came to this country played a very important part in the development of the food of the South.",
        "I also take issue with this word `soul food' because we know--those of us who've studied food and history know that soul food came along with \"\"Soul Train\"\" and soul music in the '60s...",
        "Exactly.",
        "...and Africans and African-Americans have been cooking for 200 or 300 years.",
        "Surely soul food is a part of the African-American experience, but it's not the totality.",
        "So let's forget about the word soul food.",
        "I hear a...",
        "Thank you.",
        "...three-person down-vote on the language, but what about this African-American food or African diaspora food?",
        "What kind of traditions from Savannah, Chef Joe, do you try to transmit to your students, for example?",
        "Well, Savannah here is in the bottom of the low country, so we do things like Savannah red rice.",
        "We do shrimp smothered with okra and tomatoes that we serve over rice.",
        "We prepare dishes that reflect that African-American table; surely candied yams, collard greens, mustard greens.",
        "So there's many similarities.",
        "There's a group here who went from South Carolina at St. Helen's Island to Senegal.",
        "And when they got there, they found that the food they ate was food that they had been familiar with all their lives.",
        "So it's not that much different.",
        "It's just a larger portion of meat that we have grown to eat today because of our ability to purchase and our buying power.",
        "It's something that always wasn't there.",
        "It was dishes with small bits of meat, lots of rice, and then gravies and a variety of different things in it.",
        "We ate what we hunted, we ate what we caught when we went fishing, and we ate, you know, whatever we grew in our garden or on our little farm and what we raised, be it hogs, be it chickens or cattle.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Well, I want to ask all of you about something a little bit besides the food part, more the nutrition aspect.",
        "African-American cooking traditions--Chef Joe, you mentioned that traditionally there was not a ton of meat in the African-American cooking tradition.",
        "Now, of course, we have access to just about everything, including as much fat and sugar as we can cram down our gullets.",
        "But how can you follow the African-American tradition and keep it on the healthy side?",
        "I'm going to start with you, Chef Joe."

        "I think all food is healthy.",

        "My mother lived to be 92 years and put half and half in everything.",
        "So I think sometimes it's not what we eat, but how much we eat that causes us to have a problem.",
        "And there are--some people tend to want to fix the problem by changing what we eat, but it's--fat is flavor, and you just have to be careful how you use it.",
        "Some scientific studies have shown that fat will produce a feeling of fullness for much longer than other, you know, protein or carbohydrates, and so if you take out the fat, people actually eat more.",
        "But let me--I heard you chime in, Patty.",
        "What do you think about the moderation, the health, all that stuff?",
        "There's a very sensual side of soul food, especially for desserts.",
        "The way we like it, the way we cook it.",
        "It just calls for a couple more pats of butter, an extra tablespoon of sugar.",
        "I think moderation, like the chef said, that's the key.",

        "I agree, I agree.",
        "Consider collard greens.",
        "Now I remember I was on a TV show once and I was in a real dilemma because it was at the time the height of `don't use pork' and `don't use this--use the smoked turkey.",
        "And so I decided not to put any meat in the collard greens, and I just used some garlic and herbs and seasoned it up.",
        "And they were very, very good, but I had a lot of flak from my mother because her--all her church people were looking.",
        "And then she said, `You know, you wasn't raised like that.",
        "I mean, there you are making them naked greens'...",
        "That's funny.",
        "...you know?",
        "Why, I have to say, my mom's recipe--which I follow for collards--is with tomato and onion and no meat, and it's delicious, you know?",
        "The tomato gives it a little sweetness to the base.",
        "And when I was growing up in Baltimore, the traditions that we would follow included the German traditions because there were so many Germans in Baltimore and somehow my family picked it up.",
        "So we would always have sauerkraut...",
        "Mmm.",
        "...and then we also have some of the Indian traditions, corn pudding as well as everything else.",
        "So I think that, you know, for many of our African-American families, you just pick things up from where you are, you know, and it's not just a black tradition.",
        "In that vein, let me ask about some of your favorite foods that you cook that are from other traditions.",
