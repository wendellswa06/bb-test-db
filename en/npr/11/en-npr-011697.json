        "As Congress is trying to figure out what, if anything, to do about gun violence, they are looking to President Trump for some guidance.",
        "And he hasn't exactly settled on a clear agenda here.",
        "He is throwing out ideas, as he did yesterday at a meeting with a few dozen state governors.",
        "First, the president talked about banning bump stocks, and then the president brought up the police response to the Parkland shooting.",
        "Some sheriff's deputies, as you may know, did not go into the school to confront the shooter as 17 people were killed.",
        "And the president speculated that he would've done more.",
        "So we've heard a lot of talk from the president about things he would like to see happen after the Parkland shooting.",
        "Before we get to the aspirations, has anything concrete happened at this point?",
        "The one step that the White House has taken so far is to address bump stocks.",
        "That's an accessory that makes a semi-automatic weapon perform more like a machine gun.",
        "It was not used in the Parkland, Fla., shooting, but it was used in the shooting in Las Vegas last October.",
        "And the White House has directed the department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to crack down on that.",
        "But he can't do this by himself, right?",
        "And this - changing gun laws is anathema to a whole lot of Republicans.",
        "So does President Trump have the kind of clout, frankly, that he needs with enough Republicans to make a change like this?",
        "There's some changes that do seem to have some consensus behind them.",
        "The president has talked about improving background checks, by which he means making sure the information that should disqualify a would-be gun buyer makes it into the federal database against which background checks are run.",
        "He's not talking about, for example, closing the gun show loophole.",
        "But there does seem to be some momentum in Congress for that on background checks.",
        "The other idea that he's talked a lot about that you mentioned is to arm teachers.",
        "And yesterday, we heard the governor of Texas, where that's already in place, defend it as a well-thought-out program.",
        "It's an idea that the state of Florida is now considering.",
        "But the president also heard some strong pushback from Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, who says he's talked to teachers who don't want to be packing heat in a classroom full of first graders."

        "What about the issue of raising the minimum age for purchasing certain weapons, assault-style rifles in particular?",

        "But the NRA said they didn't much like that idea.",
        "So where is this right now?",
        "The president seemed to be supportive of this idea after he met with students and parents from Parkland last week.",
        "But he made no mention of raising the minimum age when he spoke at CPAC last Friday or yesterday when he was meeting with the governors.",
        "As you mention, it's an idea the NRA opposes, and the president met with NRA leaders on Sunday.",
        "His spokeswoman says the president still likes this idea in concept, but he's not talking a lot about it.",
        "So there is one thing that is not really being put on the table here.",
        "We've got all these different proposals dealing with bump stocks, working around the edges.",
        "What is not going to change, regardless of this debate, are a couple of figures that we heard on NPR's All Things Considered last night - 350 million guns in civilian hands in the United States, 25 or 30 million more guns being sold each year.",
        "Right.",
        "And so how do you go about trying to get those guns back, if at all?",

        "It includes a three-day waiting period for all firearms purchases.",
        "They want to raise the age limit for rifles to 21.",
        "That would be the same as it is for handguns.",
        "The package would allow law enforcement to temporarily confiscate weapons from someone they deem a threat to themselves or others.",
        "And it would create this so-called school marshal program - that's what they're calling it - that would pave the way for teachers to carry guns in schools after they've undergone a lot of voluntary training.",
        "As you guys were discussing, that's an idea that has gotten some support from President Trump.",
        "But it's going too far for the Florida governor, Rick Scott, who's also a Republican, who says he does not like - he does not think it's a good idea to arm teachers - and neither, do that matter, for a lot of Democrats in the state or the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, who've have been lobbying their lawmakers since the shooting.",
        "So then how likely is that to pass, this - the idea of arming certain teachers?",
        "You know, that's - it's not really clear.",
        "I mean, I think the state lawmakers are in a slightly different place than the governor.",
        "So it will be - you know, I think we should see that shake out before the legislative session ends next week.",
        "Right.",
        "There is some urgency here because they don't have that many days before the session ends.",
        "So Democrats, Joel, yesterday tried to push through a ban on high-powered semi-automatic rifles.",
        "That failed.",
        "So did they really have a shot at that?",
        "Not in Florida.",
        "I mean, this is one thing where the Republicans in the state really are on the same page.",
        "They think that that kind of ban would be unconstitutional.",
        "The students at Stoneman Douglas, for example, have been pushing for it.",
        "Democrats in the state are definitely sympathetic, but they simply don't have a lot of power in Tallahassee.",
        "Republicans have control of the state government here - both the governor's office and the Legislature.",
        "And the NRA holds a lot of sway.",
        "The state has been very friendly to gun rights over the years.",
        "So what's pretty remarkable in Florida is that these new gun laws are under discussion at all, despite opposition from the NRA.",
        "I have to ask you about the police response.",
        "There's been a lot of criticism of the sheriff in Broward County, Scott Israel, because on his watch, it was some of these sheriff deputies who did not go into the building when they heard the shooting.",
        "He's under a lot of pressure - many calling on the governor to replace him.",
        "What's that looking like?",

        "A new law says that 80 percent of a property has to remain forested.",

        "But, as you say, he's going to continue to face a lot of questions about what happened before the shooting, when his office had dozens of interactions with the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz, and his family, and also on the day of the shooting itself, when some of the deputies, you know, reportedly did not go in.",

        "And that tracks onto what's happening around the globe.",
        "So if Hollywood positioned itself to take advantage of those demographic realities, box office numbers are going to increase, and the industry as a whole is going to flourish."
