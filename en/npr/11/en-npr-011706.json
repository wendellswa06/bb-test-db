        "So, if consumer spending is poor, and we all know housing is in a terrible slump, why the better than expected growth?",
        "Well, one reason, Alex, is the weak dollar.",
        "That makes U.S.-made goods much cheaper on the global market.",
        "Exports rose five and a half percent since January.",
        "Government's spending also provided a slight boost to GDP, but the real star of quarter growth was rising inventories.",
        "Now that is all the extra stuff businesses keep on hand, with the intention of selling it.",
        "Stocks of those unsold goods rose significantly higher than they did in the last quarter and with a nearly one percent contribution to GDP it may have single handedly kept the economy out of the red.",
        "So, what does that mean for the future?",
        "Well, for all the things, Alex, that could have given the economy a boost, rising inventories are not ideal, especially at a time when consumers are reining in their spending.",
        "It sets up the next quarter for a major inventory correction, as businesses try to unload all of that stuff in an economy where people are hanging on to the little cash they have.",
        "And what people do spend isn't going as far as energy and food prices are soaring.",
        "You can't subpoena people to talk to you.",
        "You - if you write to them and try to call them on the phone and they don't answer or so forth, then take them unawares.",
        "And while they're doing this talk, my mind started racing like, OK, how much is this going to cost to do 100,000 people.",
        "And, you know, how long is it going to take and how many of these systems would we need?",
        "The National Institutes of Health provided $25 million, which allowed Affymetrix and the Kaiser team to process the saliva samples in just 15 months.",
        "[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: The processing was done by Kaiser and UCSF, not Affymetrix.]",
        "Then came another daunting task: matching each participant's genetic information with health information in Kaiser's electronic records.",
        "Cathy Schaefer says those records, which go back to 1995, include a lot of detail.",
        "Diagnoses of disease, any procedures, all the medications they've been prescribed, imaging, x-rays, MRIs, CT scans, pathology results...",
        "Kaiser also had information on smoking and drinking habits, body mass measurements, and even geographic information that could be used to estimate exposure to certain chemicals in the air or water.",
        "It will take years to fully explore the data.",
        "But researchers presented some early results this month at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting in San Francisco.",

        "I think we discovered something like 45 different genetic variations that influence that measure, some of which were known before but a number of which were not previously known.",
        "Another early result involves cholesterol drugs known as statins.",
        "Risch says Kaiser has genetic information on nearly 28,000 members who started taking statins in the past few years.",
        "So we've already started looking at the difference between their cholesterol measures before and after they went on the statins.",
        "So we have a direct assay of drug response and we've already shown that there are genetic factors that are predictive of drug response.",
        "In other words, which people are going to benefit most from statins?",
        "The research team is also looking at genes that can interact with factors like weight to cause diabetes and high blood pressure.",
        "One person who is very excited about the project is Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn at U.C.",
        "San Francisco.",
        "It's just this playground of incredibly rich data that we're just scratching the surface.",
        "Blackburn won her Nobel for work on telomeres.",
        "A telomere is a sort of cap on the end of a chromosome and it tends to get shorter with age.",
        "Activities like smoking shorten telomeres even more.",
        "Blackburn got Kaiser to include telomere measurements along with the other genetic information extracted from the 100,000 saliva samples.",
        "And she's been using those measurements to help understand differences in how men and women age.",
        "For many years, people have known that women and men have different average length telomeres.",
        "On average, women have longer telomeres and, on average, they live longer than men.",
        "The Kaiser project, though, found that as young adults, men and women have telomeres that are about the same length.",
        "But then we found there's a big split above age 50 and it gets bigger and bigger with age until about, you know, 75 or so.",
        "So a marvelous new finding nobody had ever seen before.",
        "The data also show that people with very short telomeres are more likely to die.",
        "Blackburn says someday, doctors will probably look at telomeres and lots of other genetic information when assessing a person's overall health."
