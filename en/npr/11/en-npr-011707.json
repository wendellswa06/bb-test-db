        "Twitter was covered with the NBC fail hashtag, but tons of people still watched NBC's coverage.",

        "Instead, NBC's replaying all the live streams at 3:00 p.m. That's a nice change, but probably won't satisfy people who want to see events immediately on their own timetable.",
        "But what if you're a super savvy fan and you just can't wait.",
        "Then, you might want to consider another media source.",
        "The BBC will cover Sochi's opening ceremonies live so if you have access to their programming by satellite or online, you're in luck.",

        "The advances the rebels have made by taking the town of Zawiya on the coast, just 40 kilometers from Tripoli itself, and also inland, taking the town of Gharyan, has thereby cut Tripoli off, both from its hinterland to the south and from the rest of the world to the west.",
        "Now that's really very serious.",
        "At the moment, there's fighting going on inside Zawiya, inside the refinery, and that's even more serious because the refinery is the sole source of fuel oil to generate power for Tripoli itself.",
        "If they get control of it - and I think they probably will - then, in effect, Tripoli doesn't have any energy.",
        "It doesn't have access either, and in a very short period of time, life inside Tripoli will become intolerable.",
        "Now this is important because Zawiya is to the west of Tripoli.",
        "If they control that, they control not just the fuel, but the coastal highway that is the main source of other supplies."

        "That's right, and the coastal highway is really very important.",
        "There are other roads that go to Tunisia, but they're very small and they're already controlled by the rebels in the Jebel Nafusa, the western Mountains, just behind Tripoli.",
        "And therefore, in a sense, control of Zawiya means control of Tripolitania, and that's a very serious situation to the Gadhafi forces.",
        "They have been very badly bruised by NATO's bombing campaign.",
        "They have now very little fuel available to them, and soon they're simply going to grind to a halt.",
        "And when that happens, of course, they become virtually no longer credible as a defense force for the regime.",
        "These forces making the gains in the south and the west part of the country, these are separate from the group that's been operating from Benghazi to the east?",
        "Well, yes and no. That's to say, those who've been operating in the south, south of Tripoli, coming from the Jebel Nafusa, the mountains behind Tripoli, they are definitely independent.",
        "They are basically the Berber populations of the mountains who've long disliked the regime and who moved against it ever since the beginning of the crisis inside Libya.",
        "Those now attacking Zawiya basically come from Misrata, to the east, on the coast.",
        "And Misrata has been a town that was besieged by Gadhafi's forces, where the local population fought back and very successfully forced Gadhafi's forces out.",
        "Now they've been supported from Benghazi.",
        "They get regular supplies by sea, and there are now flights going into the airport and Misrata as well.",
        "So, in a sense, they're more closely linked to the insurgency in the east.",
        "But, of course, all these insurgences claim to be operating and working together.",
        "But I suspect when final victory comes, that situation may not last.",
        "And, indeed, the political situation back in Benghazi has been - I think chaotic is probably a pretty good word.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "Ever since the beginning of this month, in fact, when the commander of the forces of the insurgency was assassinated.",
        "He was assassinated by some extremists in an elite militia, and he had been accused of supporting secretly the Gadhafi regime.",
        "Now there's no real evidence whether he did or not, but he was the regime's previous interior minister, and he'd been a close colleague of Colonel Gadhafi's for some 40 years.",
        "And therefore the problems that arise from that represent both the incompetence and the lack of cohesion inside the National Transitional Council, and that's very serious.",
        "It's already produced several effects.",
        "First of all, the council had to get rid of its government.",
        "It's not been able to form a new one since.",
        "And also beyond that, it's had to reconsider the way in which it runs its armed forces because they, in part, were independent militias as well as regular armed forces coming from the old Libyan army.",
        "Now, the situation is that those militias are supposed to be integrated into the army itself, but many of them are refusing to do so.",
        "And they are raising a finger towards the National Transitional Council, saying that it was responsible for what happened to General Younis, the commander who was killed.",
        "And that means that there's now a considerable degree of chaos there with nobody really knowing how the administration is going to work.",
        "And that's serious because international opinion has begun to support the council.",
        "And now they're going to find that they haven't got really a valuable interlocutor with whom to work.",
        "This chaos erupted just shortly after, in fact, the United States, among others, recognized the Transitional National Council as the legitimate government of Libya."
