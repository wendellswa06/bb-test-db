        "The others all died.",

        "Can we go 24 hours or 48 hours or 72 hours before we start treatment?",
        "Can we increase the window and still achieve 100 percent protection?",
        "If these experiments pan out, the new drug could be a lifesaver for people in Ebola outbreaks in Africa and for lab workers who get infected accidentally.",
        "And it could be important if terrorists somehow get hold of Ebola and use it as a weapon.",
        "Feldmann says the new drug opens up possibilities that go beyond Ebola.",
