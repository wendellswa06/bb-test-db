        "He did indeed.",
        "And he's probably still has got them but he can't very well bring them out without NATO seeing that and then of course he'll be attacked.",
        "And the missile he did fire was aimed apparently as Marsa Brega, or that's what's believed to have been the case, and it missed it by 50 miles.",
        "So I don't think they represent a major strategic advantage that the regime holds.",
        "The much more dangerous missile that they used is the Grad missile, which is a short surface-to-surface missile.",
        "And that indeed does a lot of damage.",
        "But even that is no longer proven effective because NATO's been spotting the trucks that carry it and eliminating them before thy can fire.",
        "NATO has to be encouraged, at least, that the military situation seems to be brightening.",
        "But is there - is this going to bolster the determination to see this through to the end?",
        "Well, NATO has a problem too.",
        "And NATO's problem is that its authorization for action will soon come to an end.",
        "And that means there's a question of how it's going to be renewed, for how long and with what objectives.",
        "And NATO has a real problem beyond that.",
        "And it is simply that it can aid the winning of the war, but what it can't do is to guarantee the security of the population because no foreign occupation is allowed under United Nations resolutions.",
        "No one's yet come up with a way of providing some kind of force that can guarantee security once the main fighting is over.",
        "And that's going to be absolutely essential, because without security and an impartial security force, the danger of further chaos and an outbreak of tribal fighting between tribal militias becomes ever greater.",
        "And in previous years, it would have been possible at least to turn to Tunisia or Egypt, the neighbors, and say, might you be able to help out here.",
        "Obviously, they're having problems of their own right now.",
        "Well, there are indeed, of course, because Tunisia is where the current wave of revolutions began, and they're trying to solve some very difficult constitutional issues.",
        "And they almost certainly wouldn't want to intervene.",
        "Their army is too small, only 40,000 strong.",
        "And the Egyptians have got their own problems, and the Egyptians, really, wouldn't be acceptable either.",
        "Libyans haven't forgotten the war that was fought between Egypt and Libya in 1977.",
        "And the idea of the Egyptians moving in, I think, would fill many Libyans with a feeling of horror of what might then be an occupation that would be difficult to end.",
        "The problem is to find alternatives has proved very difficult.",
        "One obvious one would be Turkey, but then again, there are historical reasons why that might not be acceptable.",
        "Another that's being mentioned is Indonesia, a Muslim nation that apparently is prepared to do that, but no one has yet showed any interest in actually asking Indonesia to intervene.",
        "And the African Union has demonstrated that it really couldn't hold the ring if it were asked to do so instead.",
        "George Joffe, thanks very much for your time.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "You're welcome."
