        "Yaron Brook, welcome.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let me begin with you, Dan McCarthy, here in the studio.",
        "What is your definition of a conservative?",
        "Well, conservatism has been in a rather difficult position over the last 20 years or so because it's become a kind of anti-liberalism as opposed to something that has roots in a philosophy derived from Edmund Burke or David Hume or someone like Michael Oakeshott.",
        "Conservatism is a defense of ordinary life against the sort of vast forces that would attempt to transform it, whether those are ideological or whether they are economic or political in the case of big government.",
        "Matthew Franck, looking at the current crop of Republican candidates running for president, who do you think best defines what it means to be a conservative?",
        "Oh, that's a good question.",
        "You know, like many interested observers of the election, I'm disinclined to single out a particular candidate.",
        "But I think that as things are developing in the race, we're seeing very strong set of alternatives in Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum.",
        "And Santorum in particular is coming on strong, I think, as everyone knows, because of the evangelical vote in Iowa.",
        "He is a Catholic, of course, but Catholics and evangelicals are very much in sync on many of the issues that face us in our public square today.",
        "Yaron Brook, when you look at this crop of candidates, Republican candidates, who do you think best embodies the principles of Ayn Rand and libertarianism?",
        "I don't think any of them do.",
        "I mean, I think there's a certain sense in which Ron Paul represents a certain aspect of objectivism of Ayn Rand's ideas, certain aspects of the economic policies, his defense of free markets, his strong advocacy for reducing the size of government."

        "But then I think, you know, he kind of goes off the wall in his foreign policy.",
        "And I don't consider his foreign policy a legitimate one or one that is consistent with Ayn Rand's, I suppose.",
        "And he still, you know, holds on strongly to his religiosity.",
        "It's a part of his political agenda, which I think, you know, again, Rand would reject completely if you would advocate strongly the separation between religion, between church and state.",
        "So while there seems to be a semblance between his ideas and (unintelligible), I think it's more superficial than deep.",
        "Dan McCarthy, from The American Conservative magazine, which candidate do you think best represents conservative views?",
        "Well, it's very interesting.",
        "We saw in the Iowa exit polls that voters who said they were most interested in a true conservative actually supported Ron Paul.",
        "And now, it's kind of surprising, because as this discussion has mentioned, religiosity seems to be one of the defining qualities of conservatism today.",
        "And Ron Paul certainly is religious, but he doesn't make it as much a part of his program politically as someone like Rick Santorum does.",
        "But I think what you see here is a shifting of terms.",
        "That, in fact, Ron Paul harkens back with older kind of conservatism that was once sort of identified with people like Robert A.",
        "Taft in the 1950s.",
        "So, in fact, there's a very good case to be made.",
        "Kind of isolationism.",
        "Well, isolationism isn't the right word, because, you know, Ron Paul believes in trade as indeed, you know, people like - what Thomas Jefferson did.",
        "But they didn't believe in sort of actively, you know, engaging with military forces, you know, trying to transform the world by force.",
        "Having a large U.S.",
        "presence overseas, for example.",
        "The heady buzz of romance may have given way to the less-urgent throb of commitment, but Celine and Jesse have never stopped trying to puzzle out their relationship.",
        "Actors Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke have again workshopped the dialogue to make their scripted conversation sound loose and improvised.",
        "And this time, director Richard Linklater has them wandering through an eye-popping family vacation in Greece, babbling away in long, uninterrupted takes for the camera.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"\"BEFORE MIDNIGHT\"\")",
        "It's not surprising that their sparring would have a less wistful edge after years together, but even they don't expect the sharpness that creeps in when they check into a hotel for some away-from-the-kids, shake-out-the-cobwebs sex.",
        "The sun sinks below the horizon and somehow takes civility with it.",
        "And as the director exchanges Greek vistas for the tiny confines of a hotel suite, in the artificial light, you can see the creases that time has etched into the actors' faces, see how earned the pain seems in their eyes."
