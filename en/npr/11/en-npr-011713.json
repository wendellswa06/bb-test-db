        "Safeway's program is a hit with lawmakers who would like employers to use it as a model.",
        "They had a language to the health overhaul bill in the Senate Finance Committee.",
        "Some lawmakers call it the Safeway Amendment.",
        "The amendment means healthy people could save a lot of money.",
        "As NPR's Julie Rovner reports, the problem comes with people who might pay more.",
        "There was a princess who became a general.",
        "Well, from the very beginning, the NFL has always had very close ties with the Pentagon.",
        "I mean, these Blue Angels that fly over NFL games before the game start, it's not like the NFL rents those out by the hour.",
        "There's always been a tight connection between professional sports and the business of war.",
        "And when Pat Tillman put - kept $3 million on the table and signed up for the Army Rangers, this was something that just had people salivating in the Pentagon and in the NFL corridors.",
        "The problem was, at that time, was that Pat Tillman - and I write about this - was not willing to play their game.",
        "He refused to be in recruitment posters.",
        "He refused to be on commercials signaling Pat Tillman, an Army of One.",
        "He literally dropped out of sight.",
        "And then when he died, though, he became something in death he never would've wanted to be in life, and that was a tool for public relations.",
        "And as I write in the book, if you actually look at Pat Tillman's thoughts, you know, in terms of speaking with his parents and speaking with his friends, you see that he - like a lot of Americans - was somebody who was very gung ho about the war on terror early on.",
        "He joined as a visceral reaction to the tragedies of September 11th.",
        "But as the years went on, he began to see the Iraq war, as he put it to a friend, quote unquote, \"\"illegal,\"\" and he began to have serious doubts about the conflict itself, which makes how he was used immediately after his death all the more monstrous.",
        "Well, you know, perhaps, Dave, there is no other sporting event more closely tied to the vicissitudes of politics than the international Olympic Games, from where they are - on the issues of from where they are held to which countries agree to compete.",
        "And with China hosting next year, the politicking is already underway over...",
        "Oh yes.",
        "...issues like China's role in Sudan, for example.",

        "Wow.",
        "I see - with what's going to be happening in China in 2008 - a continuation of what is a continual history in the Olympic Games.",
        "And there's -I have a whole chapter in the book about the Olympics.",
        "And that said, everywhere the Olympic goes - whether it's a country that we might identify as more autocratic or dictatorial like China, or Western nations like Atlanta in 1996 or Los Angeles in 1984, certainly Athens, this past year in 2004 - you see a stepping up of two things.",
        "You see the stepping up of gouging of communities on the taxpayer dime, people kicked out of low-income housing, etc., to make the way for things that are oh so useful like, you know, like a luge facility - that's for the winter games -or - we all need luge in our lives.",
        "And - but you also see the stepping up of state repression.",
        "And I think certainly, in China, of course, in a normal week, it's very difficult to stand up and state your beliefs in China.",
        "I have tremendous fears about what's going to happen in the lead up to the Olympics.",
        "And from early reports, a lot of that has already begun - the rounding up of dissidents, the crushing of incipient movements to keep people from getting kicked off their lands to make their way for facilities.",
        "I mean, this happened in Greece, and this will happen in China.",
        "But the fear is that in China, it'll be of a particularly brutal nature.",
        "Before I move on to the subject of racism in sports, I just want to - as an aside - say you talked about how cities are sort of victimized by hosting the Olympics.",
        "But in Los Angeles in '84, the city actually turned out pretty well financially, didn't it?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, the city in Los Angeles in 1984 was the first city to turn a profit on the Olympic games since Los Angeles in 1932.",
        "And - but the thing about 1984 in Los Angeles was that yes, it did well financially, but that was also the site of Darryl Gates - who was then the head of the Los Angeles Police Department - the notorious gang sweeps, where they revitalized - and I talked about this in the book - they revitalized old anti-union laws from the turn of the century for the purpose of arresting young, black males on street corners for the crime of doing the wrong handshakes or wearing the wrong clothes.",
        "And this was the birth of, really, the infamous gang sweeps in Los Angeles, which planted the seeds of the LA Rebellion in 1992.",
        "So even though LA was able to do good business in 1984, it came at a tremendous cost to the people in South Central and Eastern Los Angeles.",
        "Our time is short.",
        "Let's bring it to a close with this topic: race and sports.",
        "Don Imus aside, for the moment.",
        "It's getting more and more difficult to know what is racist in sports and what's not.",
        "Right.",
        "Take Barry Bonds, for example.",
        "Some say racism is there because of baseball's reluctance to embrace him, but it seems more complicated than that.",
        "What does it say about race relations to you, in about a minute or so?",
        "Well, one of the things that says that on sports radio, you get some of the most honest discussions in this country about race and racism - as frightening as that sounds.",
        "Because people call in, they defend Barry Bonds.",
        "People call in and say they hate Barry Bonds.",
        "One side says it's racist.",
        "The other side says it's not racist.",
        "And in the middle of that, you get a view, a sneak - a little view, about how divided, I think, in many respects, we still are in this country on the issue of race or racism.",
        "And in a weird, ironic twist, it's presented in the form of Barry Bonds."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And that's the promise of the title, and my hope is in coaches in small communities who are trying to use sports to teach values of cooperation and healthy competition.",

        "And it certainly is limited in the number of days.",
        "Right.",

        "But I do think the calculation that Republicans are making - at least the ones I've talked to - is that the FBI is not going to turn up any new corroborating evidence for Dr. Ford's claims.",
        "I think they're also counting on - and you just heard the president talk about this - that if they can make the process look a little fairer, it will help them get the Republican votes they need, and it will make any political backlash after Kavanaugh is confirmed a little bit less.",
        "Has this become a major issue for candidates campaigning for House and Senate seats this fall?",
        "I don't know about a major issue, but I think it is going to affect the elections in some way.",
        "It's unclear.",
        "We have to see what the FBI comes up with and whether he is confirmed or not.",
        "But if he's confirmed, the question is - can it energize college-educated female voters any more than they already are?",
        "I think the trend lines for the midterms are pretty much set.",
        "Then there's the question if he withdraws or is defeated - will that enrage Republicans - increase turnout - or demoralize them?",
