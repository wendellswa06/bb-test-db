        "They're looking for intellectual inspiration.",
        "They're looking for something new that can really defend their position.",
        "With regards to limited government, I think the reliance on tradition, the reliance on religious arguments, the reliance on kind of traditional mall arguments has been a failure.",
        "And I think many of them know it.",
        "Dan McCarthy, why does Romney have such a difficult time convincing conservatives that he is a true conservative?",
        "Well, I think during the primary season, you'll always see that people have - their first priorities, which are, you know, especially among the more philosophically committed elements of the party, are not typically going to be the most electable candidates.",
        "But eventually, you do tend to find the party coalescing behind someone who is pretty far from being perfect by any kind of conservative philosophical measure, whether it's as a religious conservative or a libertarian conservative or what the case might be.",
        "George W.",
        "Bush, for example, was not really, even in 2000, someone who was another Ronald Reagan, for example.",
        "Certainly, he was not another Barry Goldwater.",
        "Similarly in 2008 with John McCain.",
        "This was someone that a great number of conservatives had problems with, but they eventually were willing to support him because they thought Barack Obama would be a disaster.",
        "And again, I think this illustrates that conservatism has sort of reduced itself to being a mere anti-liberalism.",
        "And so as long as there's a demon figure or an enemy out there against whom you can organize, even these characters who are not at all Goldwaterite or Reaganite or Taftian conservatives, are able to get the party behind them simply because of what they're opposing.",
        "But it sounds like - I'm going to throw this question out to all of you - that when you look at the current crop of Republican presidential candidates, there is not a single one, maybe for the moment, who can sort of unite all of these wings of the party, or is there?",
        "There are some people who bowed out who might have been very interesting contenders.",
        "Tim Pawlenty is probably kicking himself for having gotten out so early and not stuck around to see if he got a second look.",
        "Chris Christie didn't get in.",
        "Mitch Daniels didn't get in.",
        "Paul Ryan begged off, Bobby Jindal, Haley Barbour, Jeb Bush, not all of these would have been fabulous candidates for one reason or another.",
        "But they certainly would have presented us with a richer array of choices.",
        "Well, that only looks to be the case, though, in retrospect.",
        "If someone like Jon Huntsman, for example, had not got in the race and you'd look at his resume, you would have said, this guy would be a real contender.",
        "This guy would be one of the top tier.",
        "Sure."

        "And the problems, whatever they may be, it's not the fact that we don't have enough candidates or don't have candidates who represent a broad enough spectrum of philosophies.",
        "There's something more fundamental that's going wrong here, and maybe Barack Obama just is fortunate that not just this particular slate of candidates, but the Republican Party as a whole doesn't have any kind of focused mission or any clear idea what its identity is.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think the real issue is a much more fundamental issue, and that is that the Republican Party and the conservative movement don't know what they really stand for.",
        "And you could see this in the Tea Party.",
        "The Tea Party was a movement that was clear about what it was against that had no real idea about what it was for other than some slogans about limited government.",
        "They had no idea how to get there, why they should get there, what it looked like when they got there.",
        "And I think, generally, it goes back to this notion that I think you mentioned earlier about conservatism being primarily anti-liberal rather than having a clear positive agenda.",
        "And as long as it's just anti, I think it's going to struggle to have a real candidate and have a real agenda for the future.",
