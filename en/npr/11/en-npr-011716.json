        "I had family, extended family, for the first time in my life.",

        "Let's see if we can trace the genealogy, and, of course, Al Sharpton had to agree to this and provide information.",

        "It's not something to be ashamed of, but I do think that too many of us still do see slavery as sort of an excuse.",
        "And we look at the sort of victimization of it, and, you know, we came here 200 years ago and dah, dah, dah, dah.",

        "My grandfather was a sharecropper.",
        "And for those of you who know, sharecropper is what they call slavery after slavery was abolished.",
        "But when I hear the stories of what he had to overcome as a man who had 11 kids, whose wife died and he ended up - none of the kids ended up in jail, on drugs, etc. It instills within me an ancestral sense of pride and strength because I realize that all of the people who died in the middle passage and all of the people who suffered through the horrors of slavery, the people who were able to survive were able to be - able to get descendants that ended up with me.",
        "So I came from the strongest of the strong, so to speak.",
        "So to me, that is a sense of pride in terms of what our people have been able to take on in this country."
