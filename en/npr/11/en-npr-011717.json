        "Well, I say one more time that this is a situation which actually is just empty posturing on the part of the Virginia legislature",
        "So that's a no?",

        "All right, Jeff Obafemi Carr, two points.",
        "First, her remarks about Obama, and secondly, did you hear some code in there about the issue of race?",

        "So I thought that that was very interesting why some writers have said she was gushing about Barack Obama.",
        "I think that Barack has obviously affected Condoleezza in some sort of positive way.",
        "But going to that political issue, the Gallup poll that said that 94 percent of the people in America would vote for an African-American reminds me of my campus political days when the young sister who was running for campus queen who nobody liked was handing out hotdogs and everybody was eating saying yeah, yeah, I'll vote for you.",

        "So in that case, I don't think race is an issue.",
