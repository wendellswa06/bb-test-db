        "I had the title before I had the book.",
        "I thought \"\"Kill My Mother\"\" was a great title.",

        "And slowly, I, you know, I came to a mother and daughter who are - teenage girls are always wanting to kill their mothers.",
        "They're always in rebellion.",
        "You know, and I said what if the mother is working for a private eye because her father - her husband was a cop.",
        "And he's killed, and she needs a job.",
        "And she's trying to solve the murder.",
        "And then I was launched.",
        "One of the things you did that is not especially common in the world of Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler, you're leading characters are women.",
        "Yes.",
        "I love that idea.",
        "You know, there's something in me, as you may know from my earlier work, that goes against the grain.",
        "And the thing about noir is it's all about the guys.",
        "And the women are walkons or they're sex objects.",
        "And I wanted to do just the opposite of that.",
        "And so as it turned out, the men are the minor characters in this book or subsidiary characters.",
        "And it was taken over by the women.",
        "And again, while I thought about that, it's just something that happened, in a sense out of my control, and I went along with it.",
        "Now you do write some great dialogue for men in a few places in the book, even though they are playing mostly supporting roles.",
        "And that dialogue really does echo, you know, another time.",
        "I wonder if maybe you could read to us.",
        "This is the private eye, Neil Hammond, who is almost always drunk.",
        "This is sort of a drunken rant from him.",
        "Yes.",
        "He has been on the trail of a woman that a client was looking for who was 6-foot 3'.",
        "He finally finds her.",

        "She makes fools of the others, but not to me.",
        "She's big, but I'm plenty enough man for her.",
        "Looking down on me.",
        "Who does she think she is?",
        "Where does she get the nerve?",
        "Here's how goes down.",
        "OK?",
        "I don't show up for that drink at the Flora.",

        "She was never going to show.",
        "So he goes full circle, which is...",
        "(Laughter).",
        "What took you so long to get to a graphic novel?",
        "I went in the wrong direction for 50 years or so and got into politics.",
        "And I (laughter) - but after a time when I said everything I had to say, I decided that there was - well, the Village Voice decided by firing me that it was time for me to find some other kind of work.",
        "And eventually, I stumbled on what I'd loved from the time I was 5 or 6, but I didn't know how to draw in that style at 5 or 6 or 10 or 15 or 20.",

        "Dick Woodruff of the Cancer Society says the groups are all for encouraging healthy behavior at the work place.",
        "The problem is when you begin to tie the incentives to the insurance system in premiums, and when you take a selected number of your employees and give them a deep discount, that cost gets transferred over to the least healthy employees.",
        "Karen Pollitz, an insurance expert at Georgetown University, has been studying some of the wellness plans already on the market.",
        "She says that while they say they encourage healthier behavior, some are more of a backdoor way of separating people who are healthy from those who are sick.",
        "One plan, she says, starts everyone out with an annual deductible of $2,500, then offers $500 discounts from that total to those who pass tests related to smoking, weight, cholesterol and blood pressure."

        "And the result of that is two-fold, she says.",

        "Both of which save the employer and the insurer money, but don't necessarily improve anyone's health.",

        "This year, the average cost of an employer-sponsored family policy topped $13,000.",
        "So an individual's penalty for not voluntarily signing up to participate in this program might be four, five, $6,000 a year.",
        "That's pretty coercive.",

        "Do workers really want their employers to have so much of their personal information?",

        "With your employer, you don't.",
        "Woodruff says the groups do support a lot of ways to encourage wellness on the job.",
        "They way to do this if for companies, if they want to have healthy employees, they should offer gym memberships or healthy meals in the cafeteria or opportunities to exercise, or whatever.",
        "But backers of the proposal to tie wellness programs to premiums, like Democratic Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, say the language is fair in context with other pieces of the overall health bill."
