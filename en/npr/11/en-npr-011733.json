        "NPRs Robert Smith joins us from Manhattan.",
        "Governor Paterson held a news conference there this afternoon.",
        "And, Robert, the governor has been facing weeks of damaging rumors and news stories.",
        "This one finally knocked him out of the race.",
        "This was a really bad one, and there have been some bad accusations against the governor over the past year.",
        "But this was the news that a former girlfriend of his top aide, a really trusted aide, accused this aide of violent abuse.",
        "Now we knew that earlier in the week, but even more damaging was that the state police allegedly pressured this woman to drop her case against the aide, and the governor himself talked to the woman on the phone before her court date.",
        "She ended up dropping the case, not showing up for that court date.",
        "Now the governor didnt get into specifics today but he did - he did raise his right hand, and he said...",
        "I have never abused my office -not now, not ever.",
        "And I believe that when the facts are reviewed the truth will prevail.",
        "Still, the governor said he needed to be realistic about politics, and there's no way he could run the state, New York, and deal with all these accusations.",
        "Run the state, and the state, of course, New York is facing a fiscal crisis.",
        "Can he realistically do his job with this scandal still hanging over him?",
        "Well, thats the real question.",
        "I mean, you know, the state has an almost $8 billion deficit it has to close.",
        "And the governor now is a lame duck, and I have to say he has barely a friend in Albany anymore.",
        "But there is this chance that now that hes sort of freed from politics he can make very brutal, brutal budget cuts and, you know, frankly, Paterson has very little to lose."

        "It does, but he has to be very careful about how he does this because he is officially investigating this whole mess: the alleged witness tampering, the use of the state police.",
        "So he has to figure out how to announce in a way thats not unseemly.",

        "Soldiers were kind of allowed to do this freely.",
        "It was kind of flying under the radar.",
        "Well, we talked to one of those early military bloggers, Colby Buzzell, who started blogging about eight months into his deployment.",
        "When I started blogging, I don't think the military really knew what a blog was.",
        "The Internet cafes were all somewhat brand new on the bases there.",
        "And we're allowed to pretty much go in any Web site we wanted to while I was over there.",
        "And they actually found out about my blog when I wrote about a firefight on August 4th 2004 that got hardly any press coverage."

        "When did all that start to change from that openness we were just describing?",
        "Well, part of it changed when Colby Buzzell blogged about that firefight in August 2004.",
        "You know, he pretty quickly wound up on a front page of newspapers and then magazines.",
        "Well, let's hear what happened to Colby Buzzell in his own words.",
        "My chain of command found out about it, and I had to go see my battalion commander.",
        "He had a printout of all of my blog postings.",
        "And he went over to some of the concerns that he had, like how we run low on ammunition, how we almost run out of water on a particular mission.",
