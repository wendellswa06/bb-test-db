        "When we saw Mr. Toplikar's van go by and obviously not turn into where the banner was, I immediately thought that we had placed a whole bunch of signs down in some other areas and thought he is going to go down there and clean us out.",
        "So it's what I did, I left my position and ran about a block and a half down to a gas station, hopping over bushes, trailers.",
        "I ran across the gas station parking lot, and there was a little row of three little tiny bushes.",
        "And I took cover there and instantly started videoing him.",

        "This gentleman tore up two signs; picked them up, watered them up and threw them on the ground.",
        "They at that time saw John Toplikar, but had no video, no pictures, or anything.",
        "We reported that to the police.",
        "And they said, you know, basically, it's kind of their word against Mr. Toplikar if they were to ask him about it.",
        "So Kelly and I decided if it takes getting video to get this stopped, then that's what we were going to do.",
        "And Kelly is Calvin Hayden's wife?",
        "Correct.",
        "I'm just curious as to how this might change the dynamic of the campaign.",
        "Do you think you have a better shot at winning now?",
        "I believe we had a great shot in the beginning regardless of whether we found out that he was doing this.",
        "But I think this just enhances Calvin's chances."
