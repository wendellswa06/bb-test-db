        "The president had wanted clarification of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions that outlaws detainee torture and abuse.",

        "First, it says that the president has the authority for the United States to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions.",

        "law, to narrow the range of offenses.",
        "But most importantly - in addition to giving the president the power to interpret the bill - has provisions that prohibit detainees from filing lawsuits.",
        "So that it says that - and really, the provisions that I think will cause the most concern by those who thought we need to bring this under the - sort of under the rule of law, is that - is it the act provides that no person held by the United States as a detainee can bring any lawsuit if they're held over - in an overseas location.",
        "And it wipes out both all the pending lawsuits and any future lawsuits, and indeed says that no person may invoke the Geneva Conventions in any action to which the United States is a party.",
        "So that it pretty much says it's up to the president to decide the meaning of this and tries in two different ways to prevent the courts from taking a second look at it.",
        "It also includes terms that prevents detainees in U.S.",
        "custody from challenging the legality of their detention.",
        "Does this mean that they could be locked up forever with no recourse?",

        "It amends the speedy - but it takes away some of the rights that people would have in military trials generally.",
        "But it provides fair procedures.",
        "It even provides for some appellate review to the courts.",
        "But for all the detainees who are not tried - and the bill gets rid of the speedy trial provisions - for all the detainees who are simply held in custody, they're forbidden from challenging either the fact of or the circumstances of their detention in court.",
        "So while the bill says at the end that the U.S.",
        "shall not engage in cruel, inhumane treatment, it goes as far as it can, I believe, to prevent anyone from actually being able to bring such a claim in court."
