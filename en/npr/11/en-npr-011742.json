        "So, yes, they left, in 1957, and were promptly dubbed the `traitorous eight' by William Shockley.",
        "This was really one of the first times that you saw this startup or spinoff, phenomenon that we now consider such a part of Silicon Valley, happening, and one of the things that was so exciting for me to find was the notes that one of these eight young men who left took where his boss's boss called the group of them into a room and essentially read them the Riot Act, saying, `Your names are mud.",
