        "I know the Taliban often acknowledges its responsibility behind its suicide attacks.",
        "Has it acknowledged it behind this attack?",
        "No.",
        "In this case they've actually denied it, but they often do deny it when we're talking about a number of civilian casualties like we're seeing here.",
        "In this case also, because they went after this particular gentleman, Abdul Hakim John, there's also fear of tribal retaliation.",
        "And so at this point they are saying they had nothing to do with it.",
        "But if this had been somebody else, let's say a rival tribe that was going after a tribal leader, they wouldn't have gone after Abdul Hakim John in such a public venue.",

        "They basically took their shot.",
        "At the same time, by doing this, by causing so many civilian casualties, they're able to shake local Kandaharis up and make them feel as if this government can't protect civilians.",
        "And so, Soraya, where does that leave this city of Kandahar?",
        "Well, the Kandaharis are really worried that without Hakim John that his strategic district north of the city will soon be overrun by Taliban fighters.",
        "And so not having this man there anymore and basically have no barrier to them creates a scenario where the Taliban fighters could move in.",
        "And this in turn would give them easier access to key targets in Kandahar, like the airport where Canadian troops are based or even the governor's palace."
