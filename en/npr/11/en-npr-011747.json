        "Well, truthfully, I don't know how it happened in the first year because I was in the Navy when the first reunion occurred, but somebody did it.",

        "Han and her son's bodies were so decomposed, authorities say, they couldn't determine the cause of death.",
        "But there was no food in the apartment and no money in Han's bank account so many people assume they starved to death.",

        "These two men invented, independently, and, actually, without any knowledge of what the other one was doing, but their work was completely complementary.",
        "What Jack Kilby came up with was a way to build a circuit, all of the different parts, out of a single piece of semiconductor material, and what Noyce came up with was the way to connect all of those parts at the same time they were printed.",
        "And this is really what led to much more reliable electronics systems than anyone had ever had before.",

        "If this what it took to start Silicon Valley?",
        "Is this the kind of people that were out there that were go-getters, independent-minded, moving to California in that gold rush out West?",
        "That's definitely a big part of what it took.",
        "I mean, the sense of adventure that Noyce brought to his life extended to things--like every idea he encountered, he wanted to take it to the next level.",
        "He was just sort of an idea-generation factory and was always looking to start the next new thing.",
        "That was a key part of getting these companies and ideas getting their roots into Silicon Valley, and then he had people around him, people like Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove, who were able to pick up the pieces of his ideas and actually figure out how to make them work.",
        "You needed all of those parts together.",
        "Noyce was the essential inspiration.",

        "You say that actually Noyce might have won two Nobel Prizes if he had of lived.",
        "Well, this was another one of those very exciting things to discover, which was Noyce's work on something that today is called a tunnel diode, that really no one had known about.",
        "This tunnel diode was one of the first devices to ever demonstrate that some of the principles of quantum mechanics actually could be observed in semiconductors, and the person who published first on the tunnel diode was a man named Leo Esaki, who won the Nobel Prize--shared the Nobel Prize for physics in 1973.",
        "Noyce had come up with his ideas almost simultaneously, but he had never published them.",
        "Because his boss at the time, William Shockley, told him that they aren't very interesting, go off and do something different, and Noyce was very young, he was newly hired, and he went off and did something different.",
        "And what was very interesting to me about that story was the way that Noyce spun it.",
        "He was a very modest man.",
        "In his entire life, I only saw one reference to this tunnel diode, and that context was that Noyce used this experience of his as a lesson on how not to manage innovators.",
        "He really believed that you had to give your innovators their head and let them run with their ideas, even if you didn't immediately see the practical applications.",
        "And about 15 years after William Shockley told him to go--forget this idea, Noyce put the lesson he learned in practice at Intel, when he really encouraged a young researcher named Ted Hoff to follow up on his ideas for something that we today call a microprocessor.",

        "You've hit the nail on the head.",
        "That's exactly what it is.",
        "Stanford has been collecting in the area of Silicon Valley history for a long time.",
        "And when I would go to people's houses as part of my interviews, I would always ask if they had any papers, and the things that people pulled up from their basements and out of their attics in dusty boxes and, in one case, a waterlogged box, which just broke my heart, were the founding sorts of documents of Silicon Valley.",
        "And even when they weren't that exciting, there was just people's notes and their thoughts.",
        "Silicon Valley is a place that always looks forward, and we're in danger of losing our past if we don't collect these materials.",
        "And I would really encourage any of your listeners who have materials to visit the Web site for the book, www.themanbehindthemicrochip.com, and they can reach me through that, and we can talk about preserving things, whether at Stanford or somewhere else.",
        "We just can't let them be lost."
