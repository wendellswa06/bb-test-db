        "He--it wasn't so much his physical presence as his incredible brain power, and also his real ability to inspire in the people around him a real confidence in themselves.",
        "Noyce liked to say, `Don't be encumbered by history.",
        "Go off and do something wonderful.",
        "And when you think about what that would mean to somebody, a young employee, or an entrepreneur, because Noyce supported a lot of next-generation entrepreneurs, to hear someone say that to you was extremely meaningful.",
        "I interviewed about 140 people for this book and several of them actually broke into tears talking to me about how much Noyce had meant to them.",
        "And then, of course, on the `How did he get people to give him money?",
        "side, he was extremely smart, had an excellent partner, was in a growth industry and had a proven track record.",
        "So it was pretty much a slam dunk, for example, when he and Gordon Moore wanted to start Intel.",
        "Yes.",
        "Their backer, Arthur Rock, found funding for them in less than 48 hours, and said that he could have found it even faster if people hadn't had to return phone calls back then.",
        "Wow.",
        "That's great.",
        "Wouldn't you have liked to have met these guys, Colleen?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I read Tom Wolfe's long essay on the development of the Silicon Valley, and I will read this book, as well, because I think that they are the Thomas Edisons and--What do you call it--Who's the other guy that invented the radio?--I mean, of my generation?",
        "The Marconis.",
        "I don't--yeah, Marconi.",

        "I think that Colleen is really building on another point that was such an interesting part of writing this book was Noyce's personality was giant, but he was surrounded by other people who were so interesting.",
        "So it was people like Andy Grove or Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett, who he served on a college board with--these were the people he dealt with and they were just so interesting to talk to and so interesting to learn about and that's--that sort of sense of excitement I really tried to bring to the readers.",
        "Because just the facts aren't gonna tell the story of what happened.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, Steve Jobs said to me `Bob Noyce took me under his wing.",
        "He tried to give me a perspective that I could only partially understand,' and as much as my historian heart would have loved to have found some sort of a memo, you know, `To Steve, from Bob, subject line: How to Run a High-Tech Company,' this sort of thing didn't happen.",
        "The two spent a lot of time together and really--it was almost a process of osmosis where Jobs absorbed things about adventure and excitement in a way that you do from standing next to your grandmother as she cooks.",
        "And my favorite Jobs-Noyce story takes place in probably the early 1980s and Bob had a plane called a Seabee that could land on water or land on land and he wanted to show it off to Steve Jobs.",
        "They started to fly up to Lake Tahoe and Noyce stopped at an intermediate lake, showed, `Oh, look, it lands on water,' and they took back off, and were--without either of them knowing it--Noyce inadvertently locked the wheels into water-landing position, and when they went to land on the ground, the plane almost flipped.",
        "There is this bouncing.",
        "You know, Steve Jobs described sitting there, just white-knuckled, with sparks shooting past the windows, and picturing this headline Bob Noyce and Steve Jobs Killed In Fiery Plane Crash.",
        "And I think that Noyce gave Jobs living proof that this sort of sense of limitless and adventure and creativity and vision and energy, that both these guys had in such abundance, you didn't have to give that up when you started running a company, that these could be the core of the high-tech company's approach to doing business and inspiring people.",
        "And it was a very exciting relationship to learn about, and just one of many, many mentoring relationships that Noyce had.",
        "I'm sure there's no record of it, but one of them must have said, `Hey, let's do that again.",

        "I knew Bob pretty well.",
        "But he gave a lot of credit to Grant Gale who was a physics professor at Grinnell.",
        "And Grant Gale--talk about Bob inspiring other people, Grant Gale is probably one of the inspirations that Bob Noyce had.",
        "And he was a--Bob was a great guy.",
        "He was a diver on the swimming team, a very compact man, and--physically, and a tremendous skilled acrobatic diver.",

        "Leslie?",
        "Yeah, yeah, I...",
        "Did she get it?",
        "...you have--you've nailed that perfectly.",
        "And everything you said is right.",
        "And Noyce never ever forgot how important Grant Gale's influence was for him.",
        "As a matter of fact, when he was awarded the National Medal of Technology, which is one of the highest awards our government can give to technologists, he invited Grant Gale to join him in the audience, and he always felt that science and engineering education was what was going to keep our country strong, and when people ask me `What would Noyce think about what's going on today?,' I--there are a lot of things that would make him very happy--the innovation we have today and the prominence that Intel has achieved.",
        "But I think one thing that would concern him a great deal is our country's current ranking at number 17 in the percentage of college graduates who go into science and engineering.",
        "That would really give him some concern.",
        "I think you're right that--I liked Bob.",
        "I didn't know him that well, to be honest, but I did know him, and he lived in the dormitory right next door to mine.",
        "And one time I was invited to a celebration of his getting his `G' for Grinnell, when he got one--when he got his `G' for diving.",
        "I'll let it--I'll let you go; thank you very much for listening to me.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "Bye.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255 is our number.",
        "Let's--so I was actually going to ask you about that, what he might have thought about the failure of our educational system today.",
        "As you say, he really thought that's where our security lie in, and, as you point out, other statistics show that in the last 20 years the number of graduates, PhDs, scientists and engineers, has remained steady, even though the population has gone way up in this country.",
        "So I guess--is there anybody around today that you could point to that'd say, `Oh, he's just like Bob was'?",
        "Or are we lacking that kind of leadership?"

        "I think one of the things that made Bob Noyce so important and so interesting was the number of different hats he wore.",
        "He was an inventor and an entrepreneur, but then he went on and donned a completely different hat when he was worried that the American semiconductor industry was under threat from Japanese competition.",
        "And took on a job that he never particularly liked, which was spending about half his time in Washington, DC, lobbying for measures to try to help the American semiconductor industry, and I think at this point that sort of variety of interests in someone so prominent is something that we could all really use, not just Silicon Valley.",

        "Each of those three were quite different from one another.",
        "Certainly, Andy and Gordon, Andy Grove and Gordon Moore, very, very different personalities.",
        "And to the degree that I did know Bob, he, again, seemed different, yet.",
