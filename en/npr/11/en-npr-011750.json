        "How much should our incentive be, Giunchigliani wondered?",
        "How about 50 percent?",
        "I didn't think a hundred percent - I was trying to find a middle ground and it was a new place to start.",
        "I thought that would be reasonable.",
        "So a bill went to the 2005 legislature and passed unanimously with almost no discussion of that 50 percent.",
        "Legislators say the thinking was who's going to build green in energy loving, devil-may-care Las Vegas?",
        "Unfortunately, in that, they were very, very wrong.",

        "Those flowers rising up in the desert are seven skyscrapers that will make up MGM Mirage's gaming mega resort called CityCenter.",
        "CityCenter is as green as the 7.4 billion dollar bills it will take to rise it up from the desert.",
        "If we can find ways to lower our costs, we're going to do that.",
        "Gordon Absher is with MGM Mirage's public affairs.",
        "And yes, there's an admirable goal and we can say we're saving the planet, but at the same time, we're saving ourselves money.",
        "Before the bill, there were 14 registered green projects in Nevada.",
        "Now there are 92.",
        "But it wasn't until this year's legislative session that some poor state auditor's jaw dropped.",
        "Las Vegas' Clark County projected the incentive could cost the county up to 50 million a year in lost revenue.",
        "That's almost 10 percent of what it averages in property taxes every year, the stuff that pays for schools, roads and police.",
        "Instead, much of that money would go to green casinos.",
        "Chris Giunchigliani was flabbergasted."

        "It'll be opened to the media and broadcasted live on CNN, but Warren will be the only one asking questions.",

        "Is it a dangerous situation for this government to have an economic slowdown now?",

        "They've come from pollution.",

        "And so to the degree that they lose the story that be quiet and life will get better, they may have to rely more heavily on the nationalist crutch.",
