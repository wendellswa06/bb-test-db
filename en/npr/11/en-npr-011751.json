        "One is that there will be many, many fewer immigrants and they are likely to be from parts of the world like Latin America and that people in the United States, Americans, the people who want to reunite with, say, their spouses or bring their spouses in with a visa, will be less likely to get services that they need out of fear that that will affect their ability to bring in a loved one like a spouse.",
        "So it's a terrible outcome.",

        "And they're using this tool to do it.",

        "Yes.",
        "We know that there has been a chilling effect just as a result of the conversation about this rule.",
        "We know that people in the United States are using fewer benefits.",

        "And we expect that harm to get worse as this rule becomes final.",

        "Can you explain that?",
        "By doing this, the Trump administration has us all talking about, well, but what about people who are poor, what about people who are in need?",

        "And I think it's worth noting that in your version of this legislation, you would actually have banks hold on to more loss-absorbing capital than even is required right now.",
        "And if they did that, they'd be able to get out of some Dodd-Frank regulations, right?",
        "Well, indeed it's kind of a Dodd-Frank off-ramp that's financed with private capital.",
        "And that is, if you will raise large amounts that are commensurate with a safe and secure banking system, then you can get out of the micromanagement of the federal government.",
        "That management, remember, helped bring us into the crisis in the first place.",
        "Fannie and Freddie, our federal regulators, said that you didn't have to reserve hardly any capital against mortgage-backed securities or sovereign debt.",
        "Think Fannie, Freddie and Greek bonds.",
        "So the regulators got it wrong.",
        "We would be better served by higher levels of capital than the supposed wisdom of the financial regulators who got it wrong last time.",
