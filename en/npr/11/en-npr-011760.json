        "Mr. Mondale got a big hand at the convention.",
        "He got walloped come November.",
        "He did, but not because he told the truth.",
        "That is, Reagan did raise taxes, and Mondale would have, but because the Republican ads successfully argued - successfully by which I mean people believed that what Mondale was going to do was not use the money that he would raise to pay down the deficit, but instead he would use it for more spending.",
        "And voters are inclined to believe things that are consistent with what they think is true about the party.",
        "Voters think Democrats are likely to spend on social programs.",
        "So that was the deception the audience was willing to believe, and that was more influential and hurting Mondale than anything they said that was honest.",
        "So his honesty was turned against him, and then you have the situation these days where it's not just the rival candidate who might turn your words against you, but, well, a lot of his allies - the superPACs.",
        "And that's a phenomenon this year that we should worry about.",
        "We looked at the top spending third-party groups through June 1, and what we found was these are the - first, the (c)(4) groups, the groups that don't have to disclose.",
        "And we found a very high level of deception.",
        "More than 80 percent of the dollars spent by those ads, those advertisers were spent on ads that contained at least one deceptive statement, deception defined by the fact-checking organizations.",
        "And when we looked at the top spending superPACs plus Apps Me(ph) during the primaries through Wisconsin, what we found was over 50 percent of the dollars spent contained - were spent for ads containing at least one deception.",
        "Third-party ads more deceptive than candidate ads historically, but television stations have a right to reject those ads.",
        "They don't have to air them at all.",
        "And if they air them, they can insist on accuracy.",
        "If they were to do that, we could dampen down that deception.",
        "It's going to be the greatest source of deception this year, and those station managers have control.",
        "You want to email your stations to tell them to please do that, station managers, go to FlackCheck.org.",
        "It just takes a minute.",
        "There is - are there any examples in the modern era of broadcast advertising, radio and television, of campaigns that did not resort to distortions?",
        "The 1960 and 1980 campaigns - the '60 campaign elects John Kennedy.",
        "The '80 campaign elects Ronald Reagan are free of serious deceptions about the opposing the candidate or about the plans of the ultimate winner.",
        "So within memory, although not recent, recent memory, we've had campaigns that were conducted in a fair and forthright fashion."

        "And so, you can't really fault him for campaigning if the evidence that he had available suggested that it was an accurate claim.",
