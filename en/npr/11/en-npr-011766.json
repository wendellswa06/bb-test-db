        "I mean, there have been four lockouts in sports in just the last year.",
        "And all of that is linked to the fact that the leagues themselves felt like that they were going to not get the kind of public subsidies that they'd been used to in years past, tax dollars.",
        "So you're saying that made the players more politically active in their own right.",
        "Because they were locked out and because they were then forced to actually speak to the public about why they should side with them and not see these labor battles as just, as so many people say, billionaires versus millionaires.",
        "Right.",
        "So what are the risks for athletes...",
        "Ooh.",
        "See, that's the flipside of it.",
        "...doing that - doing this now?",
        "There are significant risks, not the least of which is that a typical athletic playing career is very short.",
        "In the NFL, it's three and a half years.",
        "And in baseball and in the NBA, it's really not much longer.",
        "It's five years, seven years.",
        "So you're talking about a very limited window where athletes can earn the majority of money that they're going to make over the course of their entire lives.",
        "So you've got players that are trying to walk this fine line between making a name for themselves, getting out there in front of the public and supporting a belief that they feel passionate about...",
