        "I'm talking to sportswriter Dave Zirin.",
        "His new book is called \"\"Game Over: How Politics Has Turned The Sports World Upside Down.\"\" Dave, you really went to town on the NCAA in this book...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and the notion of student athletes.",
        "In fact, you keep putting student athletes in quotation marks.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The main reason I did that was after speaking to a former All-American NCAA basketball player from the University of Maryland by the name of Laron Profit.",
        "And Laron said to me, the word student athlete is so ridiculous because we're really athlete students, because the second we walk on to campus, it's made very clear to us where our priorities should lie.",
        "And after - as soon as he said that to me, I said, you know, I'm never using the phrase student athlete again.",
        "And then after researching it, that's not a word that came out of, say, the pen of Grantland Rice 100 years ago - the great sportswriter - as a poetical phrase for somebody on campus.",
        "It was actually a legal designation put forward by the NCAA so they wouldn't have to pay workers compensation to a crippled football player.",
        "Because a college football player actually sued the NCAA, saying, I deserve some sort of compensation.",
        "My body has been destroyed by playing football.",
        "And their response was: Well, no, you don't get workers' compensation because you're not a worker.",
        "You're a student athlete.",
        "So they actually concocted this designation.",
        "And they generate, really, billions of dollars.",
        "I mean, the NCAA tournament is an $11 billion deal all by itself.",
        "Coaches make millions, and the players don't see a thing.",
        "And it's only - this is one of those things where I really do believe that the center will not hold because coaches keep getting paid more and more.",
        "Players, more and more, are seeing the NCAA as really this amoral tool of enforcement, like something that has no real moral weight.",
        "Do you think that this is one of these political beliefs that we're going to see some of the players start standing up for?",
        "Definitely.",
        "And you have seen this in the past at different times.",
        "I mean, you saw 20 years ago the great University of Michigan Fab Five team.",
        "They all came out on the court wearing black T-shirts instead of their jerseys to protest that the jerseys were the top-selling jersey in the country - with their names on it - but they weren't seeing any money for it.",
        "A few years ago, as Taylor Branch reported in The Atlantic, there was a move by players to actually strike before the final four, unless they got some money for that.",
        "It's very difficult for college athletes to do this, though, because this is one of those things that people don't know when they say: Wait a minute, these guys get a free full four-year ride to college.",
        "And it costs a fortune.",
        "They should be happy to get that."
