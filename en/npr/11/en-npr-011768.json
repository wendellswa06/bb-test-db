        "He condemned what he called Russia's act of aggression.",
        "Russia, if it wanted to help deescalate this situation could return its troops to the barracks and deescalate rather than expand their invasion.",
        "And as John Kerry spoke in Kiev, back in Washington, President Obama simultaneously addressed the issue.",
        "He said there's still a chance for Russia to work with the international community to stabilize the situation.",
        "We've sent a clear message that we are prepared to work with anybody if their genuine interest is making sure that Ukraine is able to govern itself.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is considering sanctions if Moscow does not pull troops out of Crimea.",
        "NPR's Michele Kelemen is traveling with Secretary Kerry and joins us now.",
        "And Michele, first of all, Kerry offered economic support to Ukraine.",
        "What does that include?",
        "That's right.",
        "He came here with an offer of a billion dollars in loan guarantees.",
        "It's meant to offset any losses for Ukraine when it cuts back on energy subsidies.",
        "That's one of the many reforms that Ukraine's going to need to do to get its fiscal house in order and to receive a bailout package from the International Monetary Fund.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is also offering technical assistance to help Ukraine deal with what could become a trade war with Russia.",
        "And the U.S.",
        "has a program to help Ukrainians recover stolen assets, train election monitors ahead of a planned vote in May.",
        "So various programs really to help this new team in Kiev financially, but also politically.",
        "And who was Secretary Kerry meeting with there?",
        "What was he doing?",
        "He spent a while at the Ukrainian parliament building meeting all the major figures from the protest movement so we met with the interim president, the prime minister and many others, but, you know, the most interesting part of the day, Audie, was his visit to this makeshift memorial to dozens of people that were killed by snipers on a day in late February, February 20."

        "James Streitz spent his life believing no good comes from higher taxes.",

        "Trouble that may throw the economy into recession and the job market into reverse.",
        "Faced with that grim alternative, Streitz says tax increases should be a part of a budget compromise.",
        "The only reason I think that the tax increases are necessary to start with would be to satisfy both sides of the aisle.",
        "The way he sees it, he's willing to compromise, why aren't politicians?",
        "It's giving them the opportunity to, you know, kind of both of them to step across the aisle and say, I may not completely agree with this but in the spirit of compromise, let's move forward and make a decision.",
        "So I like the fact that it's kind of forcing their hand.",
        "To be sure, some business groups still vehemently oppose any tax increases.",
        "But Streitz's view is held by a growing number of businesses.",
        "Yesterday, the Business Roundtable, a prominent group representing CEOs, endorsed a compromise that includes increased tax rates and eliminating deductions.",
        "And in a quarterly survey by Duke University and CFO Magazine, 63 percent of U.S.",
        "businesses said they would support the Simpson-Bowles fiscal plan, which favors $1 of tax increases for every $2 of spending cuts.",
        "John Graham is director of that survey.",
        "So the reason this is such a surprise is CFOs usually are all about lowering tax rates to spur economic growth - reducing corporate tax rates, reducing individual's tax rates - so there's more money available to spend in the economy and, you know, just have stronger economic growth."

        "And so, you know, interesting that businesses are sort of right in the middle kind of clamoring for compromise.",
        "It would be nice if the politicians heard their voice.",
        "One of those voices is Tom Fitzsimmons, chief financial officer of TMP Worldwide, an advertising and communications company.",
