        "There was a state employee who told the governor yesterday that he basically pays his mortgage payment with this check.",
        "And he asked the governor: I don't see you having this problem, can you please address this situation soon.",
        "What did the governor say?",
        "Well, the governor always says that he's concerned about this.",
        "He wants to get the shutdown done as quickly as possible.",
        "But he says the impact of the budget that the Republicans who control the legislature put forward is much more extreme.",
        "And that there's going to have to be short-term pain now to make sure that the budget is balanced and fixed over the long-term.",
        "Well, where do negotiations stand right now?",
        "Are there any talks scheduled between Governor Dayton and the Minnesota Republicans?",
        "They haven't had face-to-face negotiations since last Thursday.",
        "And, for that matter, the governor has been putting forward some offers, saying, you know, if you don't like my income tax proposal, maybe we should tax cigarettes; maybe we should expand the sales tax to things like auto repair and haircuts.",
        "And the Republicans just say, no, we don't want any taxes - we want to hold the line on spending."

        "In the years since - it's only in the years since that the U.S.",
        "has developed a new relationship with China, which is - they hold a massive share of our debt.",
        "Does that provide a backdrop for every issue, do you think, nowadays, or is all of that swept aside when it's a question of one dissident activist?",
        "I don't think that really has that much impact.",
        "Now, our sort of network of commerce between the two countries and our worldwide interest in various and sundry matters, I think, does co-mingle with the human rights issue.",
        "For example, on occasion, we may not press the human rights issue as vigorously if we're trying to get cooperation from China on the question of Iran, or on the question of North Korea."
