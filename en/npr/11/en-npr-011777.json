        "Yes.",
        "The man in charge now is senior White House advisor Peter Rouse, one of the few gray-haired sages there, and a guy with long Capitol Hill experience, including as chief of staff to then-Senator Barack Obama.",

        "And what do you mean by that?",
        "Look, Guantanamo is a symbol of a lot of things, from the terror threat to compliance with international treaties and due process of law.",

        "Okay, Nina.",
        "Let's start with the not.",
        "Well, the not is, for example, that the Obamaites thought that they would come into office and that there would be a file on each detainee, and that they could review those files with fresh eyes.",
        "Instead, in many cases, there were no files.",
        "They have been - the information wasn't centralized.",
        "It was all over the place so it took months to get the stuff in place just to review.",
        "I think you can lay the blame for that on the Bush administration, which - Lord knows - had plenty of time.",
        "What is seen as the Obama administration's fault is that the White House let Congress get ahead of it on this; didn't brief Democrats, didn't have a plan in place before the White House announced the closing.",
        "The bottom line was that, not just Republicans, but Democrats were yelling bloody murder that U.S.",
        "citizens would be in danger and passing legislation, barring the transfer of detainees to the United States.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so there's a lot of talk now that the Obama administration should never have set that deadline for closing Gitmo in the first place.",
        "Well, I talked today to lots of folks in the administration and they think this is just a cheap shot.",
        "Obama ran promising to close Gitmo.",

        "And that really changes the political dynamic in countries where you're trying to create some peace and stability.",
        "You've mentioned Afghanistan and 9/11.",
        "Is there another example that springs to mind of what you fear might be lost if the State Department and USAID are not adequately funded or if their funds are cut?",
        "Well, one of the concerns that I think military commanders would echo is that we will have crises.",
        "We can almost guarantee there will be another crisis somewhere in the near horizon.",
        "And we hope in most of those cases, that can be dealt with through diplomacy and foreign aid.",

        "We can see how critical that ability to rapidly move aid and assistance into a country might be.",
        "It's also important that we have security in and around that area.",
        "But if we don't have the diplomatic tool to use, then the only option left is the military, and that's not necessarily the way we train and equip our leaders in the military.",
        "And we have some examples with the provisional reconstruction teams that we had in Afghanistan.",
        "They were manned by the military until the State Department, some years later, could begin to fill those positions."
