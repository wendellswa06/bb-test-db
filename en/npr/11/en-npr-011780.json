        "Oh, man.",
        "Allison Aubrey joins us now in the studio to talk about this.",
        "And you're hearing despondency in my voice, Allison, because after your piece, I realize that I'm basically walking around in a state of total dehydration at all times.",
        "OK.",
        "Are you drinking four water bottles' worth of water each day?",
        "That's what I have in front of me.",
        "Definitely not.",
        "You have brought props.",
        "There are all these water bottles.",
        "I mean, we hear this all the time, that we're supposed to be drinking water, but what your piece illustrates that it really doesn't take that much to dehydrate us.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so the question people ask is, well, how much am I really supposed to be drinking so I don't end up dehydrated?",
        "Right.",
        "What's the answer?",
        "So there's no exact daily requirement.",
        "I know this is going to be more complicated than anybody likes, but several years ago, the National Academies looked at this issue.",
        "And they came up with basically ballpark recommendations.",
        "They said women in general need about 91 ounces of fluid a day.",
        "So that's what I've got in front of me, these four water bottles, 91 ounces here.",
        "OK.",
        "But, here's the thing.",
        "We get a lot of our fluid from our diets.",
        "Fruits and vegetables have a lot of water weight.",
        "On average, we get about 20 percent of fluids from food.",
        "And then there are all these other factors that can make my water needs different from your water needs - your size, your muscle mass.",
        "Also, weather conditions, your activity level.",
        "So if you're out there in the heat and you're sweating and exercising, this will obviously increase your water loss.",

        "The Queen had a heavy foot and always stepped on her own hems, so every evening, Frederik's mother reached for her basket of threads, all wrapped tightly on wooden spools.",
