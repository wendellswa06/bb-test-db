        "So I think what happens with the jurors now is, and with the public is, listen guys, I know people who have been hurt by this and there's no way you guys are going to get away with it.",
        "And on that point, Nat, it might be worth pointing out that these guys were not just big wigs in the corporate sector, but Ken Lay was a big donor to President Bush.",
        "He donated some $300,000 to his two gubernatorial campaigns, to the then gubernatorial campaigns, and $100,000 to his 2000 presidential race.",
        "He's somebody that Bush once called Kenny Boy.",
        "Not only are they politically active in town, in particular Lay, but they're also very active in civic affairs.",
        "Lay gave millions of dollars to many civic causes.",
        "And a la Richard Scrushy in HealthSouth, I think that he thought that that was going to say, hey I'm this big guy in town.",

        "And it's good note to save any delays, September will be the reckoning day as relates to sentencing, but that may, in fact, be pushed back.",
        "All right, Donald Rumsfeld took to the airwaves last night on Larry King as he did an extensive interview with Larry King.",
        "He talked about that a timetable to exit Iraq would not do any good.",
        "He also talked about the strength of the U.S.",
        "military; but that he was in fact surprised at the strength of the insurgents in Iraq and that there were no weapons of mass destruction.",
        "Blaming that on imperfect intelligence.",
        "This juxtaposed to a report released by the Congressional and Defense Department officials that suggest an official military investigation into allegations that American Marines killed innocent Iraqis last November has uncovered evidence that a number of dead civilians is much higher than the 15 originally reported.",
        "Larry King also talked about Guantanamo, where Donald Rumsfeld suggested that everything was fine and dandy there.",
        "There are going to be those, Laura Washington, who suggest that this interview is part and parcel of the problem.",
        "It's the emperor has no clothes once again.",
        "Well, it's no accident that this interview was done with Larry King.",
        "With all due respect, he's not the most insightful interviewer in the world and he tends to treat all of his guests like celebrities.",
        "And, of course, Rumsfeld got the celebrity treatment and allowed him to give us still another snow job.",
        "It's clear that this is a tactical strategy on their part.",
        "I don't think it's working.",
        "It's what I called - what they created around the White House is a culture of implausible deniability.",
        "I mean they want to deny, they want to say that everything is okay, but they just are not believable.",
        "It's completely implausible to say that whether the intelligence was perfect or not, that you didn't have - you should've been in possession of enough information to make some intelligent decisions."

        "Hey, Joe, we don't want to give short shrift to the investigation in the sense of the name William Calley comes to mind.",

        "Calley, and, of course, that's what he's associated with in the Vietnam War, which was a critical turning point, I think, for many Americans in that view of that war.",
        "If this becomes that, well, then the perception of the war can only fall further, and it's already - we're already talking about a Bush administration that has ratings in the 30 percent range, in terms of approval ratings.",
        "And I think the strategy to try to generate support for the war is at an interesting crossroads for the Bush administration.",
        "Last night in his televised press conference with Prime Minister Blair, it was interesting the way they acknowledged some missteps, some mistakes, if you will, after having this kind of bravado front for so long.",
        "It was clearly a different approach.",
        "I'm not sure at all that it's going to help win back support for the war that has dropped drastically over the past couple of years.",

        "I watched that press conference last night and I thought as we do, as Americans everywhere, began to reflect on this Memorial weekend.",
        "That America itself and its view of this war has already reached a turning point.",
        "And I think that the recent revelations about the number of Iraqis killed in this - possibly by the Marines, that this is, as President Bush acknowledged -he said that one of his three or four mistakes that he was ready to acknowledge - he said so far what happened in the Abu Gharib prison was one that he thought that we were paying a terrible price for.",
        "And I think, should it turn out that in fact these Marines have killed innocent civilians, Iraqi civilians, it will also be something that will stain our presence in Iraq.",

        "The fact that we may be approaching something like 3,000 dead Americans is not the problem.",
        "But I think it's more of the fact that we have now - the future of our involvement in Iraq is left to the prime minister, the newly elected prime minister of Iraq.",
        "How did we get ourselves in this position?",
        "Laura, Rumsfeld suggested a timetable won't do any good, but there's a looming date that may make all of this moot, in the sense of pressure put on the White House and that, of course, is the '06 midterm election.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "November.",
        "And I think it's going to be one of two ways.",
        "Either the administration is going to get with it and decide that they got to send a clear message, timetable, something, that has an end date or has some hope for us getting out in the near future.",
        "They have to make that announcement before November, or it's going to get made for them in terms of the - given what we were just talking about - about their low ratings in the polls.",
        "A lot of folks are going to go down in Congress, Republicans, because of this and then it'll get made by whoever's left standing.",

        "Well, I think what you see happening already is you see Republican candidates, in some cases, not wanting the president to campaign for them openly.",
        "They might allow him to come in and raise money in a closed-door session, but they start putting distance between themselves - their candidacies and the Bush administration.",
        "So it becomes Bush's albatross?",
        "Exactly.",

        "And not only for the war, but for spending measures.",
        "A lot of Republicans think, for example, that - they're curious as to why he has not vetoed any spending measure as of yet.",
        "And so you find a lot of Republicans looking at his poll ratings, as I said earlier are in the 30s, and they're realizing that this might not be the guy I want standing next to me at my next rally."

        "We had good intentions, but now we're part of the problem.",

        "And that may be the face-saving measure that the president needs.",
