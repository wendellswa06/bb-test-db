        "And as NPR's Joe Palca explains, it's taken them more than a decade to figure out why it happens.",
        "First, they looked at what happened when liquids with spherical particles evaporated.",
        "These formed rings like coffee does.",
        "But when we evaporated the drop with the elongated particles, instead of forming a ring, they were spread out across the entire area covered by the drop.",
        "And this was the Aha Moment: Maybe it was the shape of the particles that were responsible for the coffee ring effect.",
        "Coffee has particles in it, but Yunker didn't know whether they were spherical or not.",
        "So he did what any good scientist would do.",
        "We went down to the building coffee machine, put, you know, 35 cents in, got a cup of coffee.",
        "Went back upstairs to the microscope, put it on a slide, took a look.",
        "And, at least on the micron scale, the particles that we saw were in fact spherical in shape.",
        "That might be enough proof for most people.",
        "But Yunker wanted to look at the effect in conditions he could control precisely - the size of the particles and their exact shape.",
        "Our particles were made from polystyrene, so they're just plastic particles.",
        "Sure enough, when he let a drop of liquid with spherical particles in it evaporate, they formed a ring.",
        "When he tried it with ellipsoid particles, no ring.",
        "So why did the shape make a difference?",
        "When an elongated particle reaches the surface of the drop, then it deforms the surface.",
        "Deforming the surface of the drop seems to be the key."

        "When spheres reach the surface of the drop, their shape does not induce the same deformation.",
        "Without the deformation, the particles travel to the edge of the drop and form a ring.",
        "With the deformation like the one the ellipsoid particles cause, there's no ring.",
        "So there you have it.",
        "These results appear in the prestigious international science journal Nature.",
