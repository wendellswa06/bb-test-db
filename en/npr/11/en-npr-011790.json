        "Young writes about the time his youth baseball team won in the finals against a better-equipped white team, how they muted their celebration in the face of glares from the white kids and their parents, about the lessons imparted by a demanding history teacher and about hours-long neighborhood basketball games.",

        "No, it seems difficult for us to grasp now, but in fact it's not intuitive that wind exists, because unless you know air exists, and early on in early history they had no idea that there was something, they always thought of air as a nothing, and so if there is nothing there, how can it exert force?"
