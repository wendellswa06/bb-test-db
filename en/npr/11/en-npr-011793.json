        "But Gaitskell says theory predicts, at some point, one of these particles will interact with something.",
        "The question is...",
        "Well, you can't blame a guy for trying.",
        "Well, and one of the most extraordinary things, in some ways, of the past decade has been that we've really been engaging in two wars without significant, major, overwhelming and consistent protests of the kind that you saw at that time.",
        "And that may be a topic for another day.",
        "Obviously, there's no draft driving young people to face the same kind of tough choices in the same numbers, but all of which is to say a lot of that's been channeled into, perhaps, our political back-and-forth.",
        "And a lot of that gets fought out in the media and particularly in the opinion media, where claims and counterclaims are often mixed with fact, but not necessarily firmly grounded upon it.",
        "And the new factor there seems to be Glenn Beck, who moved over from CNN to Fox.",
        "Beck has been a shooting star in the last couple years on television, and by moving over to Fox - an exceptionally canny move on his part - he is playing to his own political base.",
        "One of the extraordinary things to look at, in some ways, is his ratings.",
        "Glenn Beck is on at 5 o'clock in the afternoon here in the East, and that means that he's on the air before people are home from work.",
        "Nonetheless, he's getting nearly 3 million viewers a night, which is just about - he's getting more viewers than Sean Hannity is at 9e and Greta Van Susteren is at 10, so that - people are already at home in the evening part of the broadcast.",
        "He's on before that, and he's still getting better numbers than they are.",
        "That speaks to the degree to which he has energized and electrified a certain small-but-telling niche of the viewing public that says, I want to see this guy.",
        "And so to some degree, this is a cable news phenomenon.",
        "And is it good business for Fox, and it is good business for what many people say is the other side, on MSNBC?",
        "Well, MSNBC has found a winning formula for the first time in pretty much its existence, since its founding in 1996.",
        "MSNBC has essentially said, we can do on the left what Fox does on the right.",
        "Now, they don't do it entirely.",
        "They're not quite as focused at what they do and successful at what they do.",
        "Beck is a perfect embodiment of what Fox does in its - what it calls its programming hours; that is, its non-straight-news hours.",
        "And you know, many people make the case, somewhat convincingly, that at Fox, the line is more blurred than at most places.",
        "But what Beck does is he's able to serve as sort of a daytime fixture, riling people up, getting them talking, making Fox a water-cooler destination for a - you know, remember, these are all niche audiences."

        "It helps drive certain kinds of news coverage, and Beck has served to create sort of the third leg of the triptych.",
        "You know, you've got Hannity, O'Reilly and now Beck, which are these three very strong, right-of-center - in Beck's case, often right-of-right-of-center - positions.",

        "I just wanted to call up and make a point about a conversation that happens a lot of times in my house.",
        "My husband listens to left radio on Sirius satellite, and a lot of times he ends up walking in the door a little more angry, I feel, than he would have.",
        "He says he listens to it because he likes to hear similar points of view of, you know, his take on things, and I feel like we have to do the responsible thing and possibly step away from it because I believe that, same as the folks who are on the right listening to Fox, I think we're walking away with a negative point of view where, if we focused on the positive, things might look a little better.",
        "So he is angry with them rather than at them.",
        "Correct.",
        "And I think that that's - it plays into that whole Glenn Beck/Rush Limbaugh scenario, and you guys just played a clip of Ed from the \"\"Ed Schultz Show,\"\" and he - we first heard him on left radio, and I stopped listening because, you know, I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere.",
        "It was just making me angry.",
        "All right.",
        "So I'm loyal to NPR and feel like it leaves me with the information I need to hear, and without being angry.",
        "Katie, thanks very much for the endorsement, and thanks very much for the call."

        "Right.",

        "You know, people - when Fox came out and was very brash and was upsetting the applecart in the news business and particularly taking aim at other news organizations in its coverage - which is, you know, one of its signature moves - people would say, well, isn't this a terrible thing?",
        "And you know, my feeling is it's very hard to argue against the ability of more people to have more speech.",
        "The question is, what kind of influence it has both with voters and citizens, and also what kinds of influence it has inside the media itself.",
        "MSNBC, as you alluded to earlier, has hit on a significant measure of success -although not equal to Fox - by presenting itself on the left.",
        "And meanwhile, you know, the media landscape is fracturing.",
        "The Web has brought all kinds of new voices into the mix, but it also means that we don't tend to listen to or read the same sources as one another.",
        "And a lot of those sources are not as fixed in the pursuit of fact as one might want in order to then start the debate and say, all right, well, what are we arguing about with - you know, what is the death panel?",

        "And he talked about them as concentration camps and you know, was President Obama and his administration planning this?",
        "And he even occasionally acknowledged on the air, you know, I don't have facts to prove this but, I don't know this to be the case but - but the rhetoric was extremely alarmist."
