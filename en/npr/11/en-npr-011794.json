        "Hey, great to be here.",
        "And I wonder: As you listen to this rhetoric - and there's plenty of it from both sides - what's the message beneath the anger, or is the message simply anger?",
        "Well, first of all, I think that this - just to be clear - I think the story is overdone, and I think there is something strange about how when conservative or right-wing or Republican - whatever adjective people want to use - protest gets angry or loud, it's seen as America getting - having this sort of dangerous movement afoot.",
        "But there was a lot, a lot of anger at Bush over the last eight years, and those people represented America, too.",
        "And it shouldn't take, you know, a right-wing crank like me to point it out.",
        "And you know, there is this desire to somehow have this standard that when sort of middle-American, conservative people rise up and scream bloody murder, it is a dangerous sign of the unraveling of the country.",
        "But when left-wing, coastal people get up and scream bloody murder, it's democracy in action or, you know, patriotic dissent, and dissent is the highest form of patriotism.",
        "And when conservatives protest, particularly because Barack Obama happens to be black, all of a sudden we go from patriotism - we go from dissent being the highest form of patriotism to dissent being the lowest form of racism.",
        "And I think there's a real double standard at work in all that.",
        "I am.",
        "And he says things that I don't agree with and I can't defend, and then some of them I've criticized, and some of them I haven't.",
        "But it's worth remembering that a lot of this isn't new.",
        "I mean, people talk about the partisan rancor in this country.",
        "Forget - you know, people were killing themselves in duels in the era of the founding fathers.",
        "And in the 19th century, you know, congressmen were getting beaten up on the floor of the House with, you know, with walking sticks.",
        "Yet, well, we pointed out, yes, there were battles on the floor of the Senate but nevertheless, the upshot to that was a Civil War.",
        "Hopefully, we're not headed there.",
        "Sure, no. That's fair.",
        "And I think that, you know, that - but I also think that things could get a heck of a lot worse than they are now.",
        "I mean, people who talk about how allegedly hate-filled Beck and Limbaugh and these guys are, seem to forget how hate-filled Joe Pine was in the 1970s or how hate-filled Father Coughlin was in the 1930s.",
        "And that's a good case in point.",
        "Father Coughlin only becomes a sort of poster boy of hate-filled, dangerous rhetoric when he breaks with FDR.",
        "But when he was saying all of these nasty things in support of FDR, he was a good guy.",
        "So that double standard is very old.",
        "The populous who are with me are good fellas, and the ones who are against me are not.",
        "That's right.",
        "And look, I don't want to dismiss all of it.",
        "I think that things that are indefensible should not be defended, and anyone who threatens violence should be deeply and seriously criticized by reasonable people in all parties, and all of the rest.",
        "But I think at the same time that there is a lot of hype to this story line that came all of a sudden when the protest came from the right side of the aisle.",
        "Well, that happened with the change of administration, and I think that was probably pretty predictable.",
        "But is there a line that should not be crossed?",
        "Obviously, advocating violence, we'll go beyond that."

        "Yeah, I think there's a - you know, obviously, you know, advocating violence is the easy one.",
        "And some of these are sort of like the famous line about pornography: You know it when you see it.",
        "Right.",
        "But there's the larger problem of what to do about it.",
        "If someone goes off and says something truly awful - and I can find examples of people across the aisle who have said truly awful things over the last 10 years -therefore what?",
        "I mean, are we all supposed to break out into a grand chorus of tsk, tsk, tsk, you know, how dare this happen?",
        "I mean, there's only so much hand-wringing will do, and I don't think there are any public policy options to it.",
        "So I think talking - you know, the answer to most free speech problems is more speech.",
        "Criticize people who go too far on both sides, and that's part of the debate.",
        "And as you look at this debate, I mean, it seems like this is good business on both sides of the aisle, that it helps drum up business.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "I mean, part of the issue here is, you know, it's sort of a media story more than it is a woe-betide-the, you know, American-democracy story in that with the Balkanization of the media, everybody is breaking up into niches.",
        "And some niches are very, very large in terms of their, you know, the amount of money you can make off of them, but you look at MSNBC.",
        "It is decidedly sort of liberal now in the same way that Fox is decidedly conservative.",
        "And you look around, there are all sorts of people who are breaking the mold in every which way, blurring the lines between, you know, staid political commentary and opinion and more bombastic stuff.",
        "And I don't think there's anything that we can do about it in this day and age.",
        "I don't think everyone should go that way.",
        "I think there's still a roll for sort of call-it-like-you-see-it, mainstream reporting and journalism.",
        "But you know, in a democracy, you're going to have a lot of different voices.",
        "And I think there's a very strange standard that's being applied to some of these people.",
        "I mean, Beck is a - sort of an entertainment guy.",
        "He does stand-up comedy.",
        "He can be bombastic and over-the-top and all of the rest, and if you want to criticize that, that's perfectly legitimate.",
        "But you know, we've gone through almost eight years now of the mainstream, elite media worshiping and lionizing people like Jon Stewart, who blur the lines between serious news and commentary and comedy far more so than people like Beck.",
        "The in-house Media Watchdog Program on NPR on the media, the host of the show told the Associated Press that their role model is Jon Stewart.",
        "I think in terms of style, not necessarily politics.",
        "That's fine.",
        "But in terms of style.",
        "But the style is a big part of it.",
        "There are a lot of people, when they hear people they agree with cross the line, they say go get them.",
        "But when they hear someone they disagree with cross the line, they say how dare he?",
        "That's not his place to talk like that.",
        "And I think that the problem is that, that's the way it's going to be going forward, and there's really nothing anyone can do about it."

        "He does the dance that certainly others do on the left as well, which is to critics, he'll say hey, look.",
