        "So what's it more similar to?",

        "We don't know a lot yet, Ed.",
        "We have--the record hasn't been fully reviewed in terms of his civil rights record, but what is clear is that if you look at, for example, Harriet Miers, just at the end there, the moment when she was being pulled, right before then, some speeches came out in which she spoke positively about affirmative action.",
        "And many on the right said that was a killing blow for her.",

        "So they know that one.",
        "But the question where he stands on civil rights, I think, is still pending, and if you look at the entirety of his record, though, it's without a doubt 100 percent conservative, which is why you hear Ron Walters talking about the filibuster threat again.",
        "We're really right back where we were in terms of a mess approaching with this nomination and--but the thing is, it may be pleasing to the White House.",

        "Let me ask this, Ron, and, Juan, please pick up on the back end of it, this can either be, as Juan suggested, exactly what the White House needs or, conversely, one of those missteps that this president may not be able to recover from, juxtaposed to and/or with all of the other faux pas that, frankly, the White House has made over the course of the last month or so.",
        "Ron, is that overstating the case, or can it be that dangerous for this White House?",
        "Well, you know, I think a lot depends upon the Democratic Party's response.",
        "I looked at the split in the Democrats in the Senate who--22 of them voted for now Chief Justice Roberts; 22 of them voted against.",
        "Of the 22 who voted for him, fully half of those--half of those--were in states that George Bush won handily in 2004.",
        "There is an element here, then, of this where he does exercise some coattail effect over Democrats, and so it'll be interesting to see if the Democrats in the Senate can pull their party together and really fight, 'cause a lot of what you're saying really depends upon them.",
        "Juan?",
        "Well, I think that it's unlikely, with Samuel Alito as the nominee, that you're going to get--I don't think you're going to get 22 Democrats to vote for him because while he does have an extensive record--he's been on the court a long time--what you get here is someone who is almost a doctrinaire conservative.",
        "So if this is the person to replace Sandra Day O'Connor as the swing vote on the court, a lot of key cases are going to now turn to the right, and I would anticipate that would include not only abortion but civil rights.",

        "So what you're looking at is then a protracted nomination--excuse me, confirmation process that could extend into January and leave Sandra Day O'Connor on the bench for much of that time.",
        "I think that this is--from the president's, from the White House's perspective, it may look appetizing now to get the fight in place, to say, `We got, you know, a good conservative.",
