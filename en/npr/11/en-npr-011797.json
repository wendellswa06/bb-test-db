        "Is that right?",
        "So that's some behavior modification, you might try.",
        "No, and I think that it may be protract--now the president wants this done by the end of the year, and so I think that the instructions going out to the Judiciary Committee is to get this thing moving and let's see if we can get it done.",
        "But I agree with Juan.",
        "I don't know quite how somebody with 15 years on the federal bench in terms of his paper trail, you can squeeze that into a month or six weeks, especially with the president--actually with his attention elsewhere.",

        "I think it's going to be protracted.",
        "I think as long as it's protracted, that gives the Democrats some traction and I think that that's going to feed into this whole drama about Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, the war.",

        "Oh, without a doubt, and I think that's why I say at the moment, the president is low.",

        "Now we've seen the Alito nomination as one step.",
        "Then there's legislation that he could put in place, and lots of people are talking about things like immigration legislation, going back in terms of tax cuts, that kind of thing.",
        "But I don't--I see the Democrats now also revived.",
        "I mean, the president may revive the right wing; he has revived the Democrats because they're going to have to stand together.",
        "The president has 55 votes in the Senate if he gets every Republican, but there are, you know, 44 Democrats, and he needs some of those Democrats to get more than 60 votes needed to block a filibuster.",

        "But his main point is that whatever can help vets with PTSD or chronic pain is worth a try, especially if it's not an addictive, opiate painkiller like the VA often prescribes.",
        "The VA is subject to federal law so it can't give out CBD or marijuana, and Danyluk says that adds to the distrust some veterans have for the VA.",
        "What a veteran told me recently was with all the medications that he's on and his buddies were on, he said, you know, the VA's doing a far better job of trying to kill us than the Taliban ever did.",
        "The stories are anecdotal, but that's all there is because federal law makes marijuana research really difficult.",
        "It's in the same class as heroin and other Schedule I drugs.",
