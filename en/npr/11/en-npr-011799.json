        "There have been dozens of arrests so far.",
        "Does it feel like there is still a lot of tension on the streets, or has that abated somewhat?",
        "The protests in St. Louis are complicated because there are organized protests led by community members here that tend to be peaceful and nonviolent.",
        "And then there's always some other people who come in there that are not going to be peaceful.",
        "That's been a pattern in Ferguson, where during the daytime in Ferguson, the protests would generally be peaceful.",
        "And then at night, under the cover of darkness, some other people would infiltrate in and commit various acts of vandalism.",
        "Ferguson is so close by.",
        "And I'm wondering, how similar does it feel - what you're seeing now - to what happened back then?",
        "So there are some similar people that are leading the current protests that led the protests back in - during Ferguson.",
        "St. Louis now has a large and activated protest community that can be readily mobilized for protests when the community feels that there's an issue worth protesting about, so...",
        "But the same amount of tension - does that feel quite similar?"
