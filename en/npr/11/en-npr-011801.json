        "Yes.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "What are you thinking about - as someone who's in the industry, when you put something in your mouth to eat it, what's going on in your head?",

        "I mean, I have my moments, but by and large, I'm usually taking a product in my mouth and actually thinking about, what are the sensory properties, what is the smell, what's the taste, what are the aromatics, what are the textural characteristics.",
        "And so, my recommendation to people who want to lose weight is to - if you stop thinking about the pleasure you're getting and start thinking about what are some of the characteristics that are in the product, half of them you won't even eat because they're not very good-tasting.",
        "Farai Chideya, NPR News.",
        "My belief is if you think about it hard and long about what are you actually perceiving, you'll be less inclined to just go with the joy ride of the kick of the food and actually start thinking about what it is.",
        "Half of the things that are out there are out of date or not very tasty.",
        "And if you're just doing it for the fat, salt and sugar kick, which is absolutely what a lot of people are doing, I think if you pay attention to what you're actually tasting and perceiving, you might actually eat less.",

        "We're not chewing anymore, are we?",
        "Well, and that's another big factor that I happen to point out to David is that in the many years that I have been in the food business, we used to have foods that we chewed for 15 times and 20 times and 30 times before we swallowed.",
        "And now there's rarely a food out there, outside of a sweet chewy candy, that you have to chew more than 12 times and it's gone, and therefore you're in for the next hit, you know, to get more pleasure.",

        "Well, you know, and I - the Snickers bar is a very old product, and I'm wondering if they actually designed it or hit upon it.",
        "But the interesting thing about the Snickers bar is that it has the chocolate, it has peanuts, it has caramel and nougat.",
        "You put it in your mouth and all those things work together so that the pieces of peanuts, which can be very annoying - if you think about trail mix and such, sometimes you can all those particles stuck in your mouth.",
        "And in fact, what happens with the Snickers bar is the particles of the peanuts break up and are carried away into the melting and dissolving caramel and nougat.",
        "And then you have all the lubricity from the chocolate as well.",
        "And so, everything in your mouth comes together and disappears at the same time.",
        "And it's really well-designed, as opposed to some of its competitors, where you have particles of peanut or you have no peanut and you have just caramel stuck on your teeth.",

        "But I do think that with whole wheat, if you toast it, if you have the grain and you toasted it and don't have so much of the bran flavor and the raw grain flavor, it actually is much tastier and actually tastes like roasted nuts.",
        "David Kessler, who is to blame for all of these kinds of foods?",
        "Are we, because we'll consume them or are we being bombarded with so - with the advertising and - gee, I just can't help myself, you know, because I'm seeing this stuff being thrown at me all the time, like we used to be with cigarettes.",

        "Once we understand that our behavior is becoming conditioned and driven and we're laying down this neural circuitry and we're laying down this neural circuitry for a lifetime, the business plans of the modern American food company has been to take fat, sugar and salt, put it on every corner, make it available 24/7, make it accessible all the time - gas stations, in your cars -make it socially acceptable to eat, to make it into entertainment.",
        "Once we understand that we're conditioning and driving the behavior and laying down the neural circuitry of our children - does the food industry have to change?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "But in the end, just because my brain is being hijacked doesn't mean that I shouldn't take steps to protect myself.",
        "But up until now, we've not explained to people why it's so hard.",

        "You were lazy.",
        "You didn't have self-discipline.",
        "We didn't tell people that their brains were constantly being bombarded.",
        "When they walk down the street, their activation - the cues are constantly bombarding their brains.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "This is a collusion among every - you know, the consumers are telling the food companies what they want and the food companies are giving them what they want, and then they want more of it.",
        "And so, in fact, I'm totally in agreement with David that this has to be like it was with cigarettes, that we have to educate people so that they understand what the cues are so they can avoid the cues, or they can be aware of those cues and at least I say, well, here it comes.",
        "I think David has a part in the book where he says, you know, the chocolate chip cookies were in the room, the hotel room, and he took them and he threw into trash because he knew he couldn't eat just one - to go back to the original opening remarks.",
        "I think we need to figure out how each individual is going to know what's going on and respond to what's going on, and the individual has to take responsibility.",
        "The food companies have to take responsibility.",
        "And the government will probably have to do some heavy duty lifting with labeling to make sure that people can be aware of what they're eating."
