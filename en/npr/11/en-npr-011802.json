        "One of the things that - and your other caller - one of things that pleases me is to see restaurants that offer small portions.",
        "And that's what happens in other countries as well.",
        "No one expects that you're going to have to have three - a ginormous appetizer, a huge main course and then a dessert.",
        "They're perfectly happy if you have, you know, two small portions and finish.",

        "The kids, however, are not so excited, usually.",
        "And I think, like David says, we have to learn, we have to teach people.",
        "And I think that's one place to start, is to encourage restaurants that offer smaller portions.",
        "And certainly if you go travel in Europe and you travel in Japan - I mean, Japan's well noted for the fact that you can have a five-course meal before you ever get to dessert.",
        "But each portion is small.",
        "And so, in the end you have a little - you have all these seven diverse little tastes.",
        "But they're just tastes and you're not overindulging on any one thing, which I also think is part of the problem.",
        "I think it's this overindulgence of the fat, sugar, salt delivery, such as the fries, instead of having diversity in your menu.",
        "So if you can start with one thing - and let's try to keep it simple.",
        "I only have about a minute left.",
        "And you want to start to eat better and not -and get rid of the fats, the sugars and the salts, if you could just hold off on the fries, begin slowly, that would be a good first step, David, and then move on to other things."
