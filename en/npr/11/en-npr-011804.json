        "And the assumption of the war game was that India would attack Pakistan by conventional means.",
        "It quickly became clear in the course of this war game that Indian air superiority would be established almost immediately and that within three to five days, they would be able to take over control of a major Pakistani city.",
        "And the clear message that was intended here was, A, that India would be able to impose its will by conventional means very quickly and very easily, and, B, although the war game only had three steps and never went to that very dangerous fourth step, I think the participants were invited to infer from what they saw how easily and how quickly this could lead to nuclear war.",
        "And I must say, I was particularly impressed by the fact that this appears to be one of the ways in which U.S.",
        "intelligence can be used for diplomatic means, to convey the message that Secretary of State Rice, I'm sure, was conveying when she visited South Asia just a few days ago.",
        "And that is, whatever else happens, we have to avoid war between India and Pakistan.",
        "Since the atrocities in Mumbai at the end of last month, the Indians have been rumbling about the possibility of attacking terrorist-training camps inside Pakistan camps they say were used to train the people who assaulted those hotels and other targets in Mumbai, in India.",

        "Tell us what the reception was like.",
        "It was really fascinating because usually when you cover campaigns like this, you never see both candidates under the same roof, in front of the same bunch of people so you don't get that sort of apples-to-apples moment.",
        "At the Democratic dinner, it was the two of them spoke to a crowd of about maybe four to five thousand people.",
        "And Hillary Clinton gave a good speech, got a warm reception, but when Obama walked into the room, the place just absolutely exploded with energy.",
        "They were shaking the rafters.",
        "So, it was a pretty dramatic difference.",
        "You recently interviewed both Democratic contenders.",
        "As we mentioned Senator Clinton told you that she wasn't predicting victory in North Carolina.",
        "However, the polls are showing she's narrowing the gap.",
        "Do you think she can score any points in the state?",
        "Well, it depends on what you consider scoring points to me.",
        "I mean, she is narrowing the gap some but it's still a pretty sizeable gap.",
        "Obama leads by somewhere around eight or nine points in most polls.",
        "That's even after she's picked up a few points.",
        "Now, I think a lot of folks would say that if she can get it to within single digits, if she can hold him to a lead that isn't overwhelming in a state that he was overwhelmingly expected to win, then, yes, it shows that she can reach out to African-American voters and still bring in the working-class white voters that Obama has said to have some trouble reaching.",
        "What else have the candidates been doing to leave an impression in North Carolina?"

        "There was a lot of sort of reassuring of the Democratic activists that were in the audience at that dinner that their race would not split this party, that the party would come back together and unite behind whichever candidate winning the day.",

        "Now, I think the aim of the al-Qaeda and the Taliban was to relieve pressure on the western border, where its sanctuaries are, and if they could have created a major escalation between India and Pakistan, that would have involved the Pakistan army moving from the Afghan border across to the Indian border to take on the Indians or confront the Indians and involve the U.S.",

        "And I think what the terrorists were also aiming to do was to, in fact, sabotage that initiative of Zardari.",
        "Now, the problem with all the civilian governments have been that the military has regained control of foreign policy, particularly our policy towards India and Afghanistan.",
        "And it's very likely that the positive statements that Zardari was making were possibly being made without a clearance or without consulting with the military.",
