        "And well, there are some points there.",
        "But U.S.",
        "intelligence, for what that's worth, supports the Indian claims that this group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, was involved in the attacks in Mumbai and there is that one survivor who has apparently told Indian intelligence sources that - where everybody came from.",
        "They've identified all the members of the attack squad as being from Pakistan.",
        "In any case, let's bring another voice into the conversation now.",
        "Joining us is Richard Haass.",
        "He is now the - Richard Haass is the former director of policy planning at the State Department, special assistant to president George H.W.",
        "Bush, and senior director for the Near East and South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council, now, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, and joins us from their studios in New York.",
        "I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Richard Haass, but we appreciate you joining us today.",
        "Thanks for having me, Neal.",
        "And that question, now that we have explained some of the background of this situation for the incoming president-elect, how does he prioritize the situation in Pakistan?",
        "Well, to begin with, he's got an awfully crammed inbox with challenges beginning with the economy, and then internationally, he obviously has the gradual drawing down of the U.S.",
        "role in Iraq.",
        "He's got a deal with an Iranian nuclear program.",
        "There's any number of other international challenges that we know about and those that we don't.",
        "But I would think the Pakistan-Afghanistan conundrum - and it's increasingly the same conundrum - is probably the most pressing and, I would argue, the most difficult specific or single challenge that he's got awaiting for him come January 20th.",
        "And he's got some of the people who were successful in drawing down the scale of the conflict in Iraq working for him, in terms of the military structure there, and he will still have the same secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, to go on there.",
        "But nevertheless, does he prioritize the possibility of a conflict with India and put pressure on the Pakistani government to crack down on groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba?",
        "Well, you would put pressure on Pakistan to do that even if there weren't the risk of a conflict with India.",
        "And what Ted Koppel described earlier, the war game, is actually not the first time the United States has done something like that.",
        "I was involved in a similar episode, actually, with Bob Gates, in the spring of 1990 to keep Pakistan and India from going to war.",
        "There was also a more - a similar episode in 2001, 2002, when, again, what the United States has essentially tried to do is sober up the two governments, in the sense of highlighting that it was in neither of their interests to allow things to spin out of control, if you will, to have a salvation version of \"\"The Guns of August.",
        "So, the United States has regularly tried to keep the two apart, and I think there's a decent chance that we will succeed.",
        "The bigger challenge, I would think, is that of a Pakistan that at best is dysfunctional and at worst is failing; and what to do about a country of 170 or so million people that is host to the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations, that probably has five or six dozen nuclear weapons in its arsenal, and that in many ways, holds the key to our ability to succeed, or at least not fail, in Afghanistan, and the fact that it's, on one hand, a somewhat friendly government, on the other hand, it's either unwilling or unable to do what it is we wanted to do, opposes some of the most difficult foreign-policy conundrums that I can imagine.",
        "Hello?",
        "May I jump in for a moment, Richard?",
        "You certainly heard what Ahmed Rashid had to say before, namely that he thinks the attacks in Mumbai may have been designed by a group that includes al-Qaeda and the Taliban as a means of provoking a confrontation between India and Pakistan and thereby drawing much needed Indian forces away from the Afghan border.",
        "You buy that?",
        "Quite possibly, Ted, that terrorists and radicals for the last - they would want to both provoke in India and Pakistan, want to try to weaken both governments.",
        "They also wanted to lift some of the pressure they were facing in eastern Afghanistan and in western Pakistan, and that's why the Indian government would be wise to hold off.",
        "I think the Indian government also has to do a lot to make sure that inter-communal violence does not break out inside India itself.",
        "There's as many Muslims, as you know, in India as there are in all of Pakistan.",
        "And the last thing India wants to see is the fabric of its own society to break down."

        "India also needs to take advantage of the Mumbai incident to strengthen its intelligence, its homeland security, its policing capabilities, because this was a real breakdown on India's part.",
        "So, I would think that as frustrated as India is with Pakistan's behavior, it actually needs to focus a lot on what this incident revealed about some of its own shortcomings to make sure, again, it does not spread within India itself and try to work with the United States to finally get Pakistan to do some of the things that, quite honestly, we've wanted Pakistan to do for decades now, but that it has either been unwilling or unable to do.",
        "What does this say about the metastasizing of al-Qaeda itself?",
        "I mean, now we hear, almost all around the world - al-Qaeda in Somalia, al-Qaeda in Iraq, al-Qaeda - now, we're talking about al-Qaeda in Pakistan.",
        "It seems as though it has become a far more institutionalized organization than it ever was seven years ago.",
        "I think your phrase, metastasizing, is unfortunately correct.",
        "We're not dealing with the terrorist equivalent of IBM.",
        "This is not an organization in the sense that it's centralized or hierarchical.",
        "So, even if we succeed in one spot, it doesn't in any way correlate to success in another.",
        "And the cellular or viral image that you conjure up, Ted, I think as exactly right in another sense, which is that we're likely to have to cope with this or live with this for some time to come.",
        "So, it's decentralized; it's pervasive; it's enduring; we can attack it; we can defend ourselves against it; we can protect ourselves; we can get - become more resilient.",
        "We can put into place mechanisms for recovery, but we can't eliminate it.",
        "And odds are the sort of thing that happened in Mumbai is now part and parcel of life in the 21st century.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line.",
        "Chuck is with us from San Francisco.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "I read in a piece in the New York Times by Zardari that - he said that the attack on Mumbai, in a way, was an attack on Pakistani civilian government or democratization.",
        "And that makes sense to me.",
        "I think probably, as was just kind of a main tenant of the Bush doctrine in many ways, the lack of freedom does give rise to extremism, and so basically my question has to do with U.S.",
        "aid and how we should spend it in that context in Pakistan.",
        "Specifically, we've given them a lot of aid and it's been historically, I think, military aid, and you know, the military is where the power center has been in Pakistan, I guess.",
        "My question is basically, policy for the new Obama administration, it would seem like a great thing if we could foster the growth of democracy and strengthen the civilian government and direct our aid accordingly and away from just military aid.",
        "But I'm wondering if that will actually lead to the furtherance of our interest in the sense of - it seems awfully ambitious to shift your aid from where the power has been and develop a kind of a whole new political structure there even if - but that would seem like the best answer.",
        "So, I'm wondering you would agree that that's how our aid should be focused.",
        "Richard Haass?",
        "Over the last half dozen or so years, the United States has extended on the order of $12 billion-with-a-B worth of aid to Pakistan, and roughly three-quarters of that, or nine billion, has gone to the military.",
        "And there's two problems with that.",
        "One is that, of that nine billion, most of it has been wasted.",
        "Pakistan has bought a large number of expensive pieces of equipment - modern airplanes, tanks and so forth - which are irrelevant to the real security challenge that they face, which is the sort of terrorist counterinsurgency task in its western areas.",
        "Pakistan has virtually no relevant military capacity to deal with those low-level challenges.",
        "So, most of what we've given them militarily has been wasted, and the three billion or so that has gone to the economic side is simply inadequate.",
        "If one looks at the needs of Pakistan, one looks, for example, at their educational system, which is in many ways something of a hot house for the development of an awful lot of young radicals who don't have the skills they need for coping with the modern global world - that's why, for example, Senators Biden and Lugar have introduced legislation, I think, to triple, give or take, the amount of economic aid going to Pakistan.",
        "I would simply say, though, that as justified as would be more economic aid, it's very hard sometimes to get a government like Pakistan to use the aid in the ways that we want.",
        "The military and others have pushed back over American - against American efforts to redirect it.",
        "In my experience in government, the only thing more difficult than dealing with your adversaries is dealing with your friends.",
        "And of course, the Pakistani military wants those tanks and aircraft to try to address that conventional imbalance we talked about earlier with India, but that'd be futile."

        "Right now we are conducting five town hall meetings over the phone to collect feedback about next year's school budget.",
        "Good morning.",
        "But I'll tell you a story that I heard from an Indian diplomat a number of years back, in which he told me about several very hawkish Indian generals who take the position - or at least back then took the position - that a nuclear war between India and Pakistan wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.",
        "And he said quite - it is blood chillingly direct, as Richard pointed out - Richard Haass pointed out a moment ago - Pakistan has a 170 million people; India has over a billion, and this particular general was quoted as saying, if we had a nuclear war, we might lose 50 million, they would lose 50 million, but as far as India is concerned, the Pakistan problem would be over.",
        "I'm not suggesting that many in India hold that position, but there are some.",
        "Ted's right.",
        "I've heard some of that talk myself.",
        "The good news is that it's a minority.",
        "The bad news is such talk exists at all, and the truth is, is that neither side would benefit at all from a nuclear war.",
        "As was said in the U.S.-Soviet context, there would be only losers, no winners, and India would still have a Pakistan problem, and more important, India would wake up and find itself with an Indian problem, given the more than 150 million Muslims that I mentioned before that are part of India, Indian society.",
        "So, the whole - I think the U.S.",
        "- over the years, United States has been quite correct in trying to prevent any war between India and Pakistan out of fear that it could quickly escalate.",
        "Let me say one thing about this relationship between India and Pakistan, if I can, Neal.",

        "Richard Haass.",
        "I think al-Qaeda is content on doing anything that is essentially is costly to us, is disruptive to us.",
        "They have essentially a negative agenda, which is to drain and distract American and Western and Israeli, in this case, also Hindu, societies.",
        "I think they have a very vague long-term agenda of trying to recreate some sort a 7th century Islamic society throughout the world.",
        "So, I wouldn't get too specifically geo-strategic, but that they have a largely negative agenda, which is to disrupt economies, disrupt the societies and kill people.",
        "And to the extent that they can cause the Pakistanis to pull their troops away from the border with Afghanistan, there will be more and more of these pilot-less drones, you know, firing rockets into the area; inevitably civilians are killed - it happens that way, it's hard to avoid - and the level of anti-Americanism in the region just grows.",
        "If I may, Neal, I'd like to just go back to a question that Chuck asked a little while ago, where he was talking about, why is it that we can't get more economic aid into places like Pakistan.",
        "And it seems to me that the one thing that we didn't mention is there is sort of a paradox, but it is particularly acute in bad economic times like these.",
        "And that is, somehow, even in the worst economic times, you can convince the American public that we have to put money into weapons, have to put money into a military budget, but trying to convince the American voter that money needs to go to provide economic support in a place like Pakistan at a time when there is a feeling that we need all economic support we can get in this country, I think that needs a comment and I wonder if Richard Haass would respond."
