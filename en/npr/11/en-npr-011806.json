        "Afghanistan is a sobering example, and I've been involved in it in several of my tours in government, and you're right.",
        "Almost like doctors who intervene, there's always examples where treatment can make situations worse.",
        "So, we ought to - as George Bush said in a different context - be humble.",
        "We've got to be smart.",
        "We've got to learn a lot about local realities.",
        "We have to be very careful about imposing some vague general ideas about nation building and democracy promotion and the like.",
        "But I think the lesson of history is not that because things are difficult or complicated the answer is isolation - things left alone by and large will get worse; neglect will be maligned - but rather is that when we do get involved, we've got to be smart and we've got to adapt our policies for local realities.",
        "We can't do it all by ourselves; we can't do it all with military force.",
        "But again, we will not succeed, we will not thrive, if we simply let things fester.",
        "Ultimately, we will pay an enormous price.",
        "Richard Haass, thank you very much for your time today.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Richard Haass, the former director of policy planning at the State Department, special assistant to President George H.W.",
        "Bush, now president of the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "He joined us today from the studio at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.",
        "Ted Koppel, I need to ask you; we've been talking about the possibility of a crisis war, even nuclear war, in one part of the world.",
        "Nevertheless, President-elect Obama has said another of his priorities will be to try to prevent genocide, and he has appointed Susan Rice, one his advisers on foreign policy who's been very active on that front, someone who has bitter memories of the conflict in Rwanda that got out of control, where so many people were slaughtered before the United States, or anybody else, for that matter, took any steps whatsoever.",
        "Nevertheless, we have a conflict that's underway now in Eastern Congo.",
        "It's a place where you have some experience.",
        "I know you've gone there to report on stories.",
        "I went there actually back in the summer of 2001, and ironically, we had a five-part series that was due to begin on Nightline, and the first day of the series was the 11th of September, 2001.",
        "And once again, poor Congo, which has received so little attention despite the fact that back then, I think, somewhere between two and three million people had died in the fighting in Congo; that number is now up, probably somewhere between four and five million people who have died.",
        "It's a war that almost nobody outside of Africa knows anything about, and that is a tragedy beyond measure.",
        "The fact of the matter is Congo is an enormously wealthy country in terms of minerals, and those minerals are now being stolen, quite frankly, by one militia after another, and they're then being exported out to neighboring African countries.",
        "And yet the deaths in Congo, many of which come simply from these competing armies and militias driving villagers out into the jungle, where they simply cannot survive - people are dying of disease and malnutrition - the notion that we can prevent it - God, I wish that was so.",
        "And I hope that we can find a way of galvanizing world opinion and not only world opinion, but the nations of the world to join us, and particularly the nations of Africa to join us, in bringing about peace in Congo.",
        "That poor country has suffered more than any other country in the world.",
        "And there is also, of course, the continuing conflict in Darfur, another sore that continues to bleed lives in another part of Africa, and the developing, and even worsening - though it seems impossible to imagine this - crisis in Zimbabwe, where now an outbreak of cholera has added to the terrible privations of the people of that country.",
        "And add Somalia, Neal, to your list, a country that has once again descended into total chaos.",
        "I couldn't sympathize more with what Susan Rice is proposing, and I couldn't be more cynical about the likelihood of it succeeding.",
        "We're talking with NPR senior news analyst Ted Koppel, with us from Potomac, Maryland.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And Ted, before we go, I also wanted to ask you about another situation on which you've reported extensively ,and that is our relationship with our most important creditor, and that is China.",
        "We see exports from China dwindling, as our economy and others around the world shrink, and this is going to cause, well, unanticipated problems.",
        "Well, it's going to cause unanticipated problems because one of the things that has kept inflation under control in this country is the fact that Wal-Mart and K-Mart and all the other marts out there had been buying incredibly cheap goods from China, and therefore, have been able to sell them at very, very low prices here in the United States.",
        "That's one reason why prices have not gone up for the average consumer.",
        "If, indeed, we are going to buy fewer and fewer products from China over the next few months and the next couple of years because of the economic crisis that we're facing, one of the consequences may well be inflation."

        "One other point, Neal, as I know we've discussed on this program before, we're only able to fight those wars we've been talking about in places like Iraq and Afghanistan because we have been borrowing money from, among others, the Chinese.",
        "We have somewhere between, or at least they hold somewhere between, $600 billion and $1 trillion worth of U.S.",

        "It is very difficult to find any silver linings in the economic crisis which is ruining so many people's lives in this country and around the world; nevertheless, one of the effects that we've been reporting on is the diminished demand for commodities - commodities like oil, commodities like the minerals that are being exported from places like the Congo.",
        "Is it possible to derive at least some small optimism from the fact that we may have bought ourselves a little bit more time before the competition for these resources has spiraled up out of control and before the effects of some of those expenditures, those resources in terms of global warming, gets even more drastic?",
        "I suppose we have to take comfort where we can find it, Neal.",
        "But do I believe that six months from now the price of gasoline in this country will be below $2?",
        "I do not.",
        "I think the price is going to go up again.",
        "I think the price of oil is going to go up again, but it's not going to - you know, I mean, the good news is that the price will not go up to where it was last summer, for example, not very quickly, at least.",
        "The bad news is that the reason for that is that businesses are contracting rather than expanding.",
        "As we deal with these economic crises, eventually - you talked about the money, the expenditures.",
        "It was an interesting article in the paper the other day - the F22, the stealth fighter, incredibly expensive, apparently amazing, piece of technology.",
        "Nevertheless, the Obama administration looked skeptically at this; indeed, the Bush administration looked skeptically at the prospect of buying more of these.",
        "Yet a piece in the New York Times suggested, well, a wait a minute.",
        "If we do that, all of the people who work building the F22 and all of their subcontractors at, I think, about a $160 million a copy, they're going to be out of work.",
        "And one of the things that you certainly know, Neal, is that the companies that create aircraft like these, that put them together, are very, very wise about distributing subcontracts to just about every state in the country.",
        "So, it's not just going to be a matter of, let's say, Boeing, which is in Seattle, and the state of Washington being intimately engaged in whether or not that plane continues to be built.",
        "It is a function of almost every state in the country having a piece of the action, and every local congressman is going to be in favor of continuing the development of this aircraft.",
        "That is certainly true.",
        "Also, just this one last interesting sideline: as we talk about this bill coming up before the Senate today - on which prospects don't look good at the moment - but nevertheless, perhaps in the next Congress with the new president, things could different, and that's to bailout American car companies.",
        "There are, of course - that's Detroit, that's Michigan - there are a whole bunch of transplanted car companies making Toyotas and Mercedes Benz and Subarus in other places in the country.",
        "However, they built those factories in, well, right-to-work states.",
        "Exactly.",
        "In Republican states.",
        "They may have miscalculated."
