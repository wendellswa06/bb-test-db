        "He lives down the block from Arnold and Betty.",
        "He had no intention of selling his home.",
        "He loves his home.",
        "But he's affected, too, because what he learns is that when Arnold doesn't buy Betty's home, when there are fewer people buying homes, the price of his home, the value does not go up.",
        "In fact, it might go down.",
        "And Claudio uses the value of his home, he gets a loan from the bank against the value of his home and that funds him buying TVs, buying a new car, taking his wife on vacation.",
        "So Arnold is sad.",
        "Betty is sad.",
        "But Claudio is sad, too, and there are a lot more Claudios out there who are affected.",

        "Why, then, should those investors Durwood(ph) and Eleanor(ph), why would they see the stock market go up in response to the bad news for Arnold, Betty and Claudio?",
        "Well, Durwood and Eleanor are looking at a fifth, sixth guy - I forgot where we're up to, Ben - Ben Bernanke.",
        "And what they realize is that all this bad news about Arnold, Betty and Claudio is bad news from last year.",
        "This data is a month old.",
        "So what they know is Ben Bernanke is looking at this and thinking, wow, the economy really was doing poorly even though I had a surprise interest rate cut last week, a dramatic move, I might do that again this week.",
        "He's meeting tomorrow with the Federal Open Markets Committee, these are the people who set that benchmark Fed funds rate.",
        "And now, Durwood and Eleanor, the investors, are thinking that he is going to lower interest rates again.",
        "Maybe half a percentage point, maybe three-quarters of a percentage point, very big moves.",
        "And that means there's going to be a lot more cash out there, companies are going to be able borrow and spend more.",
        "And that means stock prices might continue to rise.",

        "We're going to know a lot more about employment, how many people are working, how much money they're making, how they're spending that money.",
        "That is crucial information.",
        "We're obviously going to find out what Ben decides, and we're going to get consumer confidence numbers, which will give us a sense of how all these people are feeling about the economy, which gives us a sense of how much they're going to be spending next week and the week after that.",

        "For the 12th straight month, Ford's sales in the US declined, dropping 11 percent in May.",
        "The news from General Motors was only slightly better.",
        "Its sales were off 5 percent compared to a year ago.",
        "One reason for the trouble, demand for large SUVs has fallen dramatically this year.",
