        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Now you also mentioned in the past that, you know, they've had difficulty -they say there's been a lack of diversity because they had a lack of minorities applying to be on the show, so where did they find these three teams?",
        "You know what they had to do is they actually - they went out and they heavily recruited, and they went on Web sites like MySpace.",
        "They actually found one person on realtor.com.",
        "She was a real estate agent, and they found her there.",
        "They went outside and, you know, they always - outside sporting events - this, that, everywhere.",
        "They really had to go out and find people, because it's not just about finding a number of people.",
        "It's still a show where you need contestants to fit what you're looking for: big personalities, this or that in the mix.",
        "So it wasn't like they could just take five - excuse me -Asian-Americans, five Hispanics, and five black people.",
        "They still wanted to find the right people, so they had to get a big applicant pool to look from.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Because that always happens on Survivor.",
        "They start separately but then they merge together, and that is going to be really key as far as how this season plays out, I think.",

        "Right.",
        "As we spoke about, they're going to start filming the next one pretty soon as well.",
        "They'll start filming that in October, the end of October.",

        "If this group of people were really stranded on an island, how would they group themselves in reality?",
        "Would they form tribes based on race?",
        "It would be interesting to see this play out.",
        "Kudos to CBS for having the guts to try this one out.",
