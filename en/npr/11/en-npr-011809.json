        "The Massachusetts plan was four years in the making.",

        "It involved many pressures from many sources.",
        "Governor Romney personally delivered letters to leaders of the legislature.",
        "Senator Kennedy spent a lot of time on the telephone prodding the lawmakers.",
        "Near the end, supporters of the plan threatened legislative leaders with a petition that would put on the ballot a more extensive health plan, if they didn't pass the coalition proposal.",
        "And so last Tuesday, to the amazement of many citizens who hadn't followed developments, the bill passed the legislature with an overwhelming majority.",
        "Under the bill, all Massachusetts residents are required to obtain health insurance coverage by July 1st, 2007.",
        "Businesses with more than 10 workers are required to buy insurance for them.",
        "The state government will provide subsidies to help business buy insurance for the working poor.",
        "In this era of bitter political animosities, how was it possible to reach this accord?",
        "Paul Ginsburg, president of the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change, said, for a conservative Republican, this is individual responsibility; for a Democrat, this is government helping those who need help.",
        "For someone as startled as I was by this evidence of maturity, it's a miracle.",
        "This is Daniel Schorr.",
        "Major-league baseball's division series is coming to an end, and by tomorrow night, only four teams will be left to continue on to the World Series playoffs.",

        "The brooms were also out this past week at Fenway Park, where the Chicago White Sox bested the defending world champion Boston Red Sox, the first postseason victory for the Pale Hose since 1917.",
        "The New York Yankees face the Los Angeles Angels later today and the Atlanta Braves play the Houston Astros in Texas.",

        "Well, the Astros have a 2-to-1 lead.",
        "The Braves' bullpen has really, really struggled in this series, and Houston's starting pitching, which is the real strength of their team, has overall been pretty darn good.",
        "So it hasn't been a real surprise what's happened here and we haven't had a real nail-biting game yet, but I think the series is far from over.",

        "Well, I think that hurt the Angels just because of that reason.",
        "They were really rolling.",
        "You know, they had knocked Randy Johnson out of the game.",
        "They had one, you know, very compelling game coming back against the Yankees.",
        "They had gotten 19 hits and they were really rolling.",
        "And to lose a little momentum like that I don't think helped the Angels and it's also going to hurt them travelwise as this goes on, because they're going to have to go back to the West Coast, perhaps, and they could have used an extra day to do that.",
        "Now what do you think of the series so far?",
        "Good baseball?",
        "Yeah, he's gone?",

        "Sales of traditional large SUVs, which once totaled more than 3.1 million annually, are down more than 13 percent so far this year.",

        "The boomers, regrettably, are getting older and as they get older, they become empty-nesters.",
        "That means that they don't need the size or capability of the vehicle that they once did, and as they get older, they're somewhat less nimble and so the idea of using a stepladder to get into a sport utility vehicle is something that they're increasingly unwilling to do.",
        "But they are willing to buy so-called crossover vehicles, smaller, less expensive sport utilities.",
        "Built on car platforms, they have a softer ride and get better mileage.",
        "Last year, crossover sales doubled to 1.9 million.",
        "Tom Libby of J.D.",
        "Power, a market research firm, says the shift to the smaller crossovers has hurt the automakers' bottom line.",
        "The profit margins on those full-sized SUVs are substantial and they are smaller on the crossovers.",
        "In general, if you're selling a 25,000 to $30,000 vehicle, your margins are going to be lower than if you're selling a $40,000 vehicle.",
        "Both Ford and GM spent a decade focusing their engineering and marketing on the big, highly profitable SUV.",
        "Now that the SUV market has changed, Ford and GM are pursuing somewhat different strategies.",
        "Ford is making a major move to the crossovers, but GM, which plans 14 crossovers by 2009, is still putting a lot of emphasis on the big sport utility vehicle.",
