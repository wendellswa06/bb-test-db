        "A lot warmer than here in Michigan.",
        "The Democrats here in Michigan went into this with their eyes open.",
        "They joined with the Republicans and the Democratic governor passed a law created the primary but they allowed candidates to opt out of the contest if they wanted to, and Barack Obama and John Edwards did that.",
        "The party could have opted out of it and said we want to go the caucus route.",
        "They specifically said no, we're going to participate.",
        "And the result was Hillary Clinton got 55 percent of the vote; 40 percent, if you can believe this, voted uncommitted.",
        "Dennis Kucinich was still on the ballot and he got 4 percent and the rest is, you know, kind of inconsequential.",
        "So now the question is, what could they do?",
        "There isn't going to be another primary in Michigan, I can guarantee that.",
        "That would have to be paid for by the state.",
        "It would cost 10 to $12 million; that's what the one in January cost.",
        "The only option is possibly some kind of Democratic caucus system, but the governor, Jennifer Granholm, who was a big cheerleader for the January 15th primary, has said she thinks it would be a travesty if nearly 600,000 Democratic voters in January were disenfranchised by the party saying, that doesn't count.",
        "We're going to do this all over again at a later date.",
        "And of course the candidates have their opinions about the ideas of a caucus or a primary too - the theory that a caucus might favor Senator Obama; a primary might favor Senator Clinton.",
        "Well, a caucus here in Michigan is kind of a misnomer.",
        "Really, what a caucus is, is a party run close primary.",
        "The thing that's interesting about all this speculation that has exploded in the last 24, 48 hours, Neal, is that it seems to be coming a lot from Hillary Clinton and her followers, not only here in Michigan, but nationally.",
        "And you might ask why would Hillary Clinton want a redo of a primary that she already won.",
        "And I think the answer is as she gets closer to the hour of reckoning, she realizes she will never be able to claim these delegates if they're not seated.",
        "It's like owning a diamond ring, but it's in a bank vault and you can't wear it.",
        "What's the use of having it?",
        "And so she's saying, I am willing to risk redoing the result in Michigan, whether it takes caucuses or a primary or whatever in hopes that I can beat Barack Obama again and get the delegates from Michigan.",
        "Here's an e-mail we have from Jeff(ph) in East Lansing, Michigan.",
        "Of those within my circle of friends who are Democrats or tend to vote left or center, I can tell you we all feel like the fix was in for the Michigan primary.",
        "We were told repeatedly by local, state and national news media that our votes on primary day were meaningless and a waste of time.",
        "Now there are many who do want to count the Michigan primary, along with its delegates, as a win for Senator Clinton.",
        "I'd say we'd feel hoodwinked or bamboozled, but those terms are too comical for such a serious matter.",
        "And I think he's right.",
        "A lot of people said - both in Florida and Michigan - hey, this is not going to matter.",
        "Yeah, there's a lot of sympathy for his point of view.",
        "You're absolutely right.",
        "Hillary Clinton herself said last fall leading up to the primary, she said the results in Michigan are meaningless.",
        "We all know that.",
        "She said that.",
        "Now she's saying, well, we've got to count them or if we can't count the ones that I got, we got to do it again so maybe I can win that, and then we can count those.",
        "But I think whoever just wrote this is absolutely correct.",
        "That is the sentiment on the ground in Michigan.",
        "Well, I would not say that's necessarily the sentiment in Florida.",
        "The 1.75 million Democrats turned out.",
        "It was a record turnout in Florida, so that's what has the party here in an awkward position.",
        "To cast aside 1.75 million votes is a difficult thing for a party that talks about not disenfranchising voters."

        "They stayed away, right, Adam?",
        "When they were actually in Florida, they were nice enough to frequently come in and take money, but not actually talk to any voters that weren't (unintelligible).",

        "You don't have speeches (unintelligible)…",

        "Well, in Florida, they're operated by the division of elections.",
        "They're operated by 67 different elections offices, so it's a major governmental function to run a statewide election in a state as big as Florida.",
        "Okay, but I know that where I vote and where friends of mine vote, everyone in there is a volunteer.",
        "The people standing there handing you buttons and everyone in there is a volunteer, so who makes $25 million off that?",
        "Well, that's the cost estimate for thousands and thousands of voting offices to be staffed and opened and going.",
        "Now you have a bizarre situation where in Florida, you would have the Florida Democratic Party actually paying the state of the Florida to run an election.",
        "I know a lot of people are laughing at that; but maybe they should find another state - secretary of state to run their election.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Scott."

        "Hmm.",
        "Is that - so you're favoring a redo in Michigan then?",
        "No, I think it needs to stay the way they do because people said it's - if people wanted to get out, they could have.",

        "There has to be no money spent, and the Democrats who made it out no matter what the weather was aren't going to be upset with the Democratic Party.",
        "Bill Ballenger, what do you think?",
        "Well, no, I think he's right.",
        "Right now, the real question is if the DNC should decide to seek the delegates, the question is how are the delegates divided up?",

        "Would Barack Obama automatically get them?",
        "Frankly, I think that's the most sensible arrangement.",

        "Just give Barack Obama all the delegates other than the ones that Hillary Clinton won in the primary.",
        "She would net gain maybe 18 delegates compared to Barack Obama from the result in Michigan if that happened; that would not be enough to get her to a majority of the delegates at the national convention.",

        "And then you do away with a lot of the questions.",
