        "I am tired of going out to vote and then watching the national news later to find out my vote didn't count because of Democratic Party rules in 2008.",
        "It was thrown out due to a missing chad in 2000 - followed by 75 exclamation points.",
        "I really think the popular voter no longer has a say in our voting system.",
        "And in our Florida, no popular voter, now even our delegates, has any say in our government.",
        "Frustrated in Florida.",
        "And I suspect, Adam Smith, she's not alone.",
        "We hear a lot of that, and I tell you, some of the happiest people in Florida are the Republican Party leaders who, almost every day, are crowing about Florida Democrats disenfranchising voters and Republicans being the party that tries to count all the votes.",
        "Let's get Erica on the line.",
        "Erica with us from Tallahassee.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "I - it's interesting that that comment was just made because the decision that was made to move up the date was by a Republican governor and a Republican legislature, and it's the Democratic Party who is stripping us of our votes.",
        "And I don't remember voting for the Democratic Party.",
        "Again, people are very upset about this idea of being disenfranchised by party rules and there is a case to be made in Florida that the Republican governor and the Republican legislature did this and the Democratic Party did not have an awful lot of voice in that, Adam Smith."

        "If the Republicans had wanted to roll over the Democrats, they could have forced this early primary down their throats - absolutely.",
        "But the fact is, the Democrats were all for this early on.",
        "The Senate bill to move an early primary - move the primary early was actually sponsored by a Democrat.",
        "And then in the end, there was sort of a token effort to try to comply with Howard Dean and the DNC rules, and they made a token effort to delay the - to postpone the primary.",
        "And as expected, it went down in flames and the primary was moved to when it was moved.",
        "The Democrats in the state - in the legislature wrongly calculated that they were too important.",
        "And ultimately, the DNC would not punish the state with 27 electoral votes, and now they're paying the price.",

        "Okay, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And finally, we just have about a minute or so left, but what about the argument that if there is a redo - and you both said that you think it's unlikely for various reasons in different states - but if there is a redo, effectively, you're rewarding two states for moving their primaries too early by giving them incredibly decisive moments in the Democratic selection process, Adam Smith.",
        "Well, you do hear that.",
        "In a way, that would be the case.",
        "On the other hand, if you're a Democrat and you want to win in November, this is an issue that, certainly in Florida, will be used as a cudgel against the Democrats.",
