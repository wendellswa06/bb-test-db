        "With the device she can talk on the telephone.",
        "Face to face she has conversations, although she still relies on lip-reading.",

        "I have a tape in my car, \"\"How Great Thou Art,\"\" \"\"Amazing Grace,\"\" and I pretty much know the words, and so that I can manage pretty well.",
        "There's been controversy around Cochlear implants, especially when they were first used in children born deaf.",
        "Some deaf people objected angrily that children would end up with imperfect hearing and be cut off from the unique culture in sign language of other people born deaf.",
        "There was controversy, too, over giving implants to older people, questions over whether it was worth the risk of having surgery and and whether the devices worked well enough for older people.",
        "Many doctors thought the answer was no. Sig Soli says that's changing.",
        "The benefits of the Cochlear implant have improved as the technology has improved and as our understanding of how to rehabilitate people has improved.",

        "...surprisingly well.",
        "What we found was that age, per se, was a very poor predictor of how someone would perform with a Cochlear implant.",
        "The thing that mattered most wasn't how old the patient was but how long they'd been deaf before getting the implant.",

        "It's a qualitative change in that relation.",
        "So, we're actually seeing a country almost split in the middle along the lines of secular versus Muslims, which, in my view, the reason why this is dangerous is because we see the unraveling of this tradition that we call Turkey.",
