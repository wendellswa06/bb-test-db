        "Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the decision, declaring that the federal ban does not pose an undue burden on a woman's right to abortion because other methods of abortion are available.",
        "He acknowledged that Congress had been incorrect in its finding that the procedure is never medically necessary.",
        "But, he said, Congress has a legitimate interest in promoting fetal life and a moral right to ban a practice it deems to be too close to infanticide.",
        "The law, he said, need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of their medical practice.",
        "In a rare oral dissent from the bench this morning, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision alarming, saying that for the first time in 30 years the court was blessing an abortion regulation that has no exception protecting a woman's health.",
        "Today's decision, she said, cannot be understood as anything other than a bold effort by new justices to chip away at the right to abortion established 33 years ago and reaffirmed ever since.",
        "Advocates on both sides of the issue characterized the ruling as a seismic shift.",
        "Jay Sekulow is chief counsel of Pat Robertson's Center for Law and Justice.",
        "I think this is a momentum shift of significant proportions because, first of all, it's the first time you really have a substantive abortion procedure that's been prohibited and the court said it's fine to prohibit it.",
        "Nancy Northrup is president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.",
        "Today the court reversed over 30 years of commitment to making sure that abortion regulations do not harm women's health.",
        "Both agreed, too, that today's ruling would spur states to enact many new regulations that will likely make abortions more difficult to obtain.",
        "Again, Nancy Northrup.",
        "It really opens the flood to new regulations.",
        "In the wake of this decision, we're going to see a host of new states statutes that may be trying to go procedure by procedure by procedure to make abortion unaccessible to women.",
        "Sekulow said he expects much of the emphasis in states to be on informed consent laws.",
        "In South Carolina, for instance, abortion opponents have been trying to pass a bill that would require women seeking an abortion to be shown an ultrasound of the fetus.",
        "Justice Kennedy's opinion for the court did not close the door entirely to the possibility of women getting so-called partial birth abortions but, he said, women would have to go to court on a case-by-case basis.",
        "Doctors and abortion rights advocates said that's not realistic.",

        "The idea that women could bring as applied challenges literally as they are in the hospital bleeding or suffering some serious medical harm and need a banned abortion, the courts suggests at that point the woman could bring a federal lawsuit.",
        "But just saying that shows how absurd and unworkable that remedy is.",

        "This is a sea change.",
        "No one will say exactly when the switch occurred, but until the last week or so, the coffee shop, like other restaurants and cafeterias run by the House, sold only freedom fries and freedom toast.",
        "The single syllable F-word connoting a certain continental nation was banned by the House in March of 2003, part of a frenzied fit against all things French after that country criticized U.S.",
        "plans to invade Iraq.",
        "At the time, Ohio Republican Bob Nay chaired the House Administration Committee, which oversees the restaurants.",
        "He said renaming French fries freedom fries was \"\"a small but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-called ally, France.",
        "Since then Mr. Nay has stepped aside as chairman because his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff were being probed by the FBI.",
        "Another big backer of freedom fries in 2003 was Republican Walter Jones of North Carolina, who's since become a major critic of the war in Iraq.",
        "Today no one associated with the restaurants wanted to talk about the names.",
        "Meanwhile, the spokeswoman for the French embassy in Washington told a reporter that U.S.",

        "Wade.",
        "Alito's position when he was on the court of appeals was that a Pennsylvania law requiring women to notify their husbands before getting an abortion was perfectly constitutional.",
        "In the end, it turned out the Supreme Court did not agree with him.",
        "It looks as though then he has a much stricter standard for what he would find an undue burden in abortion cases.",
        "However, it's important to also note that in 2000 he did vote with the panel to strike down New Jersey's partial-birth abortion statute, finding it unconstitutional under Supreme Court precedent.",
        "That's important because it suggests that even though people are saying he's an activist, he was willing at the time to abide by stare decisis or the notion that settled law is settled law; you don't reverse it lightly."

        "What can you tell us about his rulings there?",
        "Well, Noah, we have a slew of cases in which he essentially tried to raise the barrier in either sex or race discrimination cases for plaintiffs to even get into court.",
        "So there's a famous 1996 sex discrimination case where he said the victims need to meet a higher standard of proof in order to even get in front of a judge; a similar case in 1997 involving sex discrimination where he said the plaintiff here does not have enough evidence to get into court.",
        "So in many ways, he was looking for the more restrictive use of the law to make it harder to bring these sorts of cases.",

        "There was the Christmas display case that he felt was constitutionally permissible even though there were overt religious symbols.",
        "So he's clearly been a fan of allowing greater entanglement between church and state in public plans.",

        "What else have you seen that's interesting?",
        "Well, I think that one of the things that's going to prove to be a big, big issue was a very controversial dissent he authored in 1986 in a case about whether Congress had the power to regulate gun sales.",
        "He said, `No, not only do they not have the power to regulate gun sales, they don't even have the power to regulate machine gun sales and possession.",
        "And that was a statement about congressional power, about the reach of the commerce clause that really, I think, sent up a flare to the political left because we have to remember Congress' power to regulate all sorts of things, including the environment and gender and race rights, really turn on the notion that they involve interstate commerce.",
        "When Alito takes a position that guns do not involve interstate commerce, that's calling out a very, very loud signal that he may have very grave doubts about the reach of congressional powers in other areas as well.",
