        "So we really need to see how the case develops, but the journalist's lawyer is calling it an effort to deter coverage, and that's something the government denies.",
        "Well, given that what you described is material that it seems, on the surface, any reporter would have if they're covering the news in that part of the country, what is it like right now to work as a journalist in Turkey?",
        "Well, the Turks have been ranked as jailing more journalists than anyone just a few years ago.",

        "Have Turkish officials defended themselves at all by citing the Pentagon and saying we just do what you do?",
        "I haven't seen that specific defense, but clearly, it sounds like a very similar point of view when you look at journalists.",

        "Well, me neither, so it's a very good question.",
        "I think when President Bush uses that term, he means that judges are ignoring the text and history of the Constitution and, instead, substituting their policy preferences, and the kind of decisions that conservatives like to point of as examples of legislating from the bench are, of course, predominantly Roe v.",
        "Wade, which they said was not well ridded in the text of the Constitution, and all of those decisions from the 1960s where courts, for example, ordered busing or came up with very legislativelike requirements that ordered people to do various things.",
        "Just to go more into that, the word `privacy,' for example, I don't think appears anywhere in the Constitution of the United States.",
        "Yet, the Supreme Court discerned a right to privacy inherent in the Constitution.",
        "From that flowed Griswold and then Roe v.",
        "Wade on abortion.",
        "It did.",
        "And what's so interesting about that is that John Roberts accepted that the Supreme Court has for more than 80 years protected a right to privacy.",
        "We'll see what Judge Alito does, but it now seems very difficult to get appointed to the Supreme Court, let alone confirmed, if you don't concede that the Constitution protects as least some right to privacy, even though the text doesn't mention privacy.",
        "And that concession reminds us that precedent actually carries a lot of weight in the law, and there are very few conservatives today who will take the position that Judge Robert Bork did in 1987, saying because it's not written down in the Constitution, it's not protected.",
        "So figuring out what Judge Alito thinks about those precedents, which have been on the books for more than 80 years, is obviously going to be a central focus of the hearing, and trying to come up with his theory of what precedents should be retained, even when they're inconsistent with the text, is also very difficult.",
        "But if you accuse a judge of legislating from the bench, is that a code word for saying, `He's a liberal'?",
        "Well, for conservatives, it is, but liberals happily are now using that epithet as well, and they accuse conservatives of legislating from the bench when, for example, conservatives strike down laws of Congress; prohibiting gun use, for example, that they say are not clearly forbidden by the text of the Constitution.",
        "Since Judge Alito has, indeed, voted to strike down the transfer and possession of machine guns on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power, people will accuse him of legislating from the bench, and then you just have to get down into the nitty-gritty details of what your judicial philosophy is.",
        "Eileen, we've been chasing our tails here in the studio.",
        "I'm not sure we've helped you at all.",
        "Well, my observation is that people complain--particularly the conservatives, complain if the court gives equal rights to some people, which the conservatives don't agree with.",

        "Thanks very much for the call, Eileen.",
        "All right.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Just to go back a minute, you mentioned Judge Alito's decision on a case that involved--where he said machine guns might--weren't forbidden by the US Constitution or the law that prohibited machine guns was not permitted under the US Constitution.",
        "His two colleagues disagreed with him.",
        "If you look at that, in one way, you know, it's a pro-gun decision.",
        "If you look at it another way, it's a pro-state's rights decision.",
        "He's not necessarily--that everybody should have a machine gun.",

        "Precisely right.",
        "It depends which way you approach it.",
        "Now it's an activist decision if you accept that neutral definition of activism I offered at the beginning, because he's voting to strike down a law of Congress, and the Supreme Court, over time, has not done that very often.",
        "So that's a really big deal.",
        "But he's justifying his decision by saying that the commerce clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, doesn't allow Congress to ban the transfer or possession of purely intrastate activities that don't have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.",
        "So those who defend the decision would say he's just following the text and original understanding of the Constitution, not legislating from the bench, and it just comes down to which philosophy you buy.",
        "And you would have to see if he's consistent with that philosophy, for example, in cases that involved the medical marijuana case that was decided earlier this year or still coming up, I think, in front of the bench is the assisted suicide law in the state of Oregon.",
        "You're a scholar of Justice Louis Brandeis, who served from 1916 to 1939.",
        "He's widely recognized as one of the greatest Supreme Court justices ever.",
        "What was it--in terms of judicial philosophy, did he have a distinct one?",
        "And did he succeed by staying with it or going away from it?",
        "I was just curious to get some insight.",
        "Being as that the framers of the Constitution actually allowed for amendments which would essentially completely rewrite any wording, you know, possibly, I was wondering how a justice could really form a strict constructionalist view of the Constitution.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"\"SPECTRE\"\")",
        "Very much so.",
        "It would be interesting if he were not consistent, if he made exceptions.",
        "On the other hand, you might say if he's so consistent that he will vote to strike down every congressional law that doesn't clearly fall within the commerce power, then he's a radical member of another judicial philosophy, which we haven't yet mentioned, which some people called a Constitution in exile, that he's really trying to resurrect limitations on congressional power that have been dormant for a long time, and consistency is a sign of zeal, critics would say.",
        "His refusal to move incrementally and to respect previous precedents is a sign of radicalism and, therefore, consistency is not only the hobgoblin of little minds but, in some cases, really an indication of constitutional radicalism.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "New Yorker last week or the week before had an article on Justice Breyer indicated that he upheld federal law much more often than the conservative justices on the Supreme Court.",
        "And it's very confusing when you listen to conservatives talking about these matters, that they talk about not legislating from the bench and strict conservative and so on.",
        "What exactly is the conservative argument about the matter of legislating from the bench?",
        "I'm so glad that you noticed that figure.",
        "That's a very telling figure that Justice Breyer voted to uphold more federal laws certainly than the conservatives.",
        "Now conservatives would say that's only half the story, because Justice Breyer voted to strike down more state laws than, for example, justices Scalia and Thomas, but when you add up the combination of the federal and state laws, you still find that Justice Breyer is among the most restrained judges while Scalia and Thomas are more toward the activist bent.",
        "But you ask what is their definition?",
        "In defense, they would say you're not legislating from the bench when you vote to strike down an act of Congress because Congress only has the powers that are enumerated by the US Constitution or a government of limited powers, and by enforcing limitations on governmental power that are implicit and explicit in the text of the Constitution, the judges are merely doing their job.",
        "That's ...(unintelligible).",
        "That's a circular reasoning, is it not?",
        "And what do you mean, circular?",
        "Well, I just mean that if, in fact, the only test--if the test is what they think the Constitution says rather than state's rights or the right of Congress to make laws, then it doesn't seem to lead anywhere.",
        "I think you're right that it's quite subjective, and that figuring out what the Constitution clearly requires is difficult because it doesn't clearly require an awful lot of at all.",
        "So I think you're also right to suggest that far--rather than just focusing on platitudes about legislating from the bench, ask how deferential a judge really is.",
