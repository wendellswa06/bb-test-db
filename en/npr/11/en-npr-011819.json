        "Another reason the question is so good is we've just seen that there's a report that Judge Alito wrote as a Princeton student about the right to privacy and the balance between privacy and security, in which in very philosophical terms evoking John Stuart Mill, he talks about gay rights and about computer privacy and all sorts of things that strike the balance between liberty and order.",
        "So I think he'd have an awful lot of interesting things to say about that.",
        "And if a nominee edged towards liberty, would you call him a liberal, and toward order, a conservative?",
        "Not necessarily, because he might be a libertarian, as we know, that there are many conservatives who value liberty more highly than anything else.",
        "They are willing to strike down lots of laws to protect liberty, and they often join with civil libertarian liberals in questions involving national security and post-9/11 detentions, because they are concerned about imposing limits on unbridled executive authority.",

        "In fact, even the way one calls balls and strikes or interprets whether a batter swings or doesn't swing depends on one's approach to the game, one's interpretation, and how those calls have been made in the past by umpires who have preceded you in the same league.",

        "There were plenty of examples in my own sort of limited career, which got as far as college and semi-pro baseball, that required me to figure out what was the purpose of the rule, and quite often, strict construction just didn't apply at all.",
        "And, in fact, it doesn't now in many areas of umpiring.",
        "There are even, you know, some fairly obscure rules that there's a lot of interpretation.",
        "The infield fly rule, for example, sounds pretty simple, but where does the infield begin and where does the outfield end?",
        "Well, it's not only that, which is an important part of interpreting the rule, but whether or not an infielder can make the catch with ordinary effort.",

        "That's the kind of judgment that umpires make all the time.",
        "It's written in the rulebook.",
        "I'm not sure whether umpires who make the infield fly call are legislating from the bench or are judicial activists or strict constructionists when they're trying to figure out what the word `ordinary' means, but that's the kind of work that judges and, in particular, justices do all the time when doing constitutional interpretation, because words like `ordinary' appear quite often in the Constitution.",
