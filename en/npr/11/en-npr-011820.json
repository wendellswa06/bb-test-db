        "(As Oberhauser) So James, why did you come?",
        "Well, it plays out all the time, and I think that it's already played out in the discussion that you've had with Professor Rosen and some of the callers.",
        "The difficulty of figuring out what it means to be an activist and to get past the bumper sticker slogans of legislating from the bench or strictly applying the law, in truth--and, I think, you know, Professor Rosen has laid this out very clearly--there are areas that require interpretation, and the question is what kind of interpretation you're using.",
        "We're seeing that in the Commerce Clause cases that he cited, 11th Amendment interpretation that you might want to go into, which has been radically rewritten by conservative jurists in surprising ways that have nothing to do with the original text, and, then, of course, there's the congressional power of, under the 14th Amendment, whether Congress has power to enforce the laws implied by the amendment.",
        "So this does come up all the time, and, you know, I was struck that the analogy to umpiring was made by a nominee of a present--who's a former owner of a baseball team...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and now we have a nominee who once wanted to be a baseball commissioner, if you read the local Philadelphia papers.",
        "And, in fact, there was a nice picture of him the other day in his Philadelphia Phillies' uniform when he went to Fantasy Camp.",
        "Maybe--I was going to say maybe the definition is a conservative who wanted to be the baseball commissioner and a liberal wanted to play second base, but maybe that's just sequential and it could be the generation gap.",
        "I don't know anything about that.",
        "Robert Schwartz, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Great being with you, Neal.",

        "Yes.",
        "My question would be, do they believe that the Constitution is to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority?",
        "Jeffrey Rosen, the Constitution seems to be set up, at least in part, to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority.",
        "It is, indeed.",
        "Although, of course, liberals and conservatives disagree strongly about which minorities deserve special protection.",
        "Conservatives are more interested in protecting property rights, for example, against legislatures that want to exercise the power of eminent domain; liberals in protecting racial and religious minorities.",
        "It's also the case that some conservatives and liberals believe that over time, the court has not been especially countermajoritarian, but has tended instead to follow the wishes of national majorities, and on the occasions when it doesn't do that, it's gotten slapped back.",
        "So asking that sort of question to a nominee, `Do you believe that this is the purpose of the Supreme Court?",
        "would be very interesting indeed, as well.",
        "Good question, James.",

        "Well, James, I think your phone ran out there right at the end, but, Jeffrey Rosen.",
        "You know, it's the kind of question that is fascinating to talk about.",
        "Right now, it's hard for Supreme Court nominees to talk about it candidly, but there are those who say that actually, it wasn't Brown vs. Board of Education that was the engine behind racial equality in the country.",
        "It really took the civil rights movement and eventually the involvement of Congress and the Civil Rights Act of '64 and '65 to make meaningful desegregation a reality.",
        "But that is the kind of thing that's awkward to talk about in the confirmation hearing, and we'd probably expect a nominee to say, yes, indeed, the court really is necessary to save minorities from the excesses of the majority.",
        "To continue our analogy, Jackie Robinson, of course, but here's an e-mail we got from Ted.",
        "`A good judge,' he writes, `is like a good rabbi.",
        "The quality of the interpretation of the Constitution depends more on the wisdom of the interpreter than it does on the words of the Constitution.'",
        "The mind is reeling with the analogies that are raised by the Jewish approach to the Constitution, which I'm all for in theory, but the idea--one difference, though, is the Talmudic tradition does put a great deal of weight on the temperament and wisdom of individual interpreters, and I think is less focused on the original understanding of the text.",
        "I should say I'm way out of my league here, I'm embarrassed to confess.",
        "Whereas the strict constructionists, in any event, are less inclined to lionize the great and wise.",
        "Justice Scalia often says, `We don't want judges to be wise and making good policy decisions that are in the interests of the country.",
        "They should do what the law says and let the heavens fall.",
        "So it's really a very--Justice Scalia is not a Talmudic scholar, perhaps, and contrasting those two things I think is worth at least many law review articles, if not a good book, so good question.",

        "He believed that legislation should be left to legislatures.",
        "But he also believed in protecting individual rights, and it was he who came up with the doctrine of incorporation essentially that applied the Bill of Rights through the 14th Amendment to the states as well as the federal government.",

        "And in the Olmstead opinion, which dealt with wiretapping, in which the constitutional right of privacy was raised for the first time, he talked about what the founders meant in the Fourth Amendment and applied it to modern times.",

        "And if you could look at some of the other justices, both those who are accorded this belief of being either accepted as pretty good or accepted as, eh, maybe not so good, again, how does philosophy play into that judgment, or is it simply a matter of getting, you know, caught out of time in some respect?",

        "Because if you can't articulate what your philosophy of law is, what you believe the law should be, then you don't do one of the things that Brandeis thought was a very important function of a Supreme Court justice--to educate both the public and the lower bar.",

        "Education is not a function of that court that we often think about.",

        "He always said that he felt most principled when he just had to grit his teeth and reach a result that he abhorred, because that was a sign that he was really being principled.",
        "He was literally restraining himself; he was binding himself because of his judicial philosophy not to enact his personal preferences.",
        "What's so great about the question--I've asked that to some lower court judges--I won't say which ones--I'm always struck by how rarely they're able to come up with some very good examples, and the examples they come up with will often be laws that you suspect they really don't mind all that much anyway.",
        "Now Professor Urofsky just gave a good example for Justice Kennedy--flag burning--we assume he doesn't like flag burning, but the First Amendment is kind of an area where people are able to protect the rights of dissenters without upsetting themselves too much.",
        "Naming a congressional statute that's struck down that the judge doesn't like would be very interesting, so thanks to Damon for that excellent insight.",

        "That's the short answer.",
        "The counter to that, of course, is it's very hard to amend the Constitution, and the people may believe something but not be able to work through the hurdles of Congress and ratification, and therefore judges can both take account of the people's fundamental views by not being entirely rigid in their interpretation.",
        "Mm-hmm, yeah.",
        "Very difficult to amend the Constitution, Mr. Urofsky.",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "And one would also argue that the words of the Constitution are not quite as plain as the textualists would have us believe.",
