        "For the most part, I think presidents have taken very seriously the fact that the people they appoint to the high court will very often be there long after they have left office.",
        "And from George Washington on, they have I think taken great pride in the quality of the people they have appointed.",
        "There are--follow-up on that, there are, of course, justices who are thought of as not as, quote, \"\"good\"\" or \"\"great\"\" or \"\"competent\"\" as others, but no bad justices per se.",
        "OK.",
        "Not even Justice Taney--I mean, that Dredd Scott decision looks just awful.",
        "It does.",
        "But if you take a look, Taney was there for--What?--30 years just about and he wrote an awful lot of very good opinions that still are considered good opinions.",

        "You opened your show with a comment that it's no surprise that Bush selected a conservative judge, and you talk about conservative judicial philosophy.",
        "Is there a liberal judicial philosophy and do those terms mean the same thing that they do in the political arena, and probably more appropriately, should they even be used these days?",

        "You know, you might--whether you call them liberal perfectionists or fundamentalists, as Cass Sunstein does in a new book, there's a kind of judge led by William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall who believed that the Constitution should be as good, as perfect as it can be, and they want to interpret the great phrases involving equality and human dignity broadly to make those ideals a reality.",
        "There are no justices on the current court who qualify as liberal perfectionists or fundamentalists.",
        "But you're quite right that to talk about liberal and conservative in the sense of judicial philosophy is not the same as political one.",
        "Take, for example, pragmatists.",
        "We can think of liberal and conservative pragmatists who believe that the Constitution should be interpreted in light of its practical consequences in making government work.",
        "Both Justice Breyer and Justice O'Connor are considered pragmatists; one is far more liberal than the other, therefore, it's more useful to discuss their pragmatism than their politics.",
        "Professor Urofsky, let me ask you.",
        "I mean, when you're teaching in school, do you use these terms?",
        "No, I don't, 'cause I don't think they're really applicable anymore.",

        "Packing the court.",
        "Packing the court--and then he was able to name eight people to the court.",
        "Now every single one of them was, quote, \"\"a liberal\"\" in terms of the economic philosophy of the time.",
        "And within two or three years, that economic philosophy, as far as the agenda of the Supreme Court was concerned, was no longer applicable and we began to enter the era of civil rights and civil liberties about which these people had no prior record that you could qualify them as liberal or conservative.",
        "I think it's a political shorthand that really is used more to obscure what people may or may not be than to really help us understand their philosophy."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "The emails show that the Clinton machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to the media organizations that she - listen to this - is given the questions and answers in advance of her debate performance with Bernie Sanders.",
        "Now, it wasn't a debate.",
        "It was a town hall.",
        "But Clinton was asked a near identical question at the Town Hall, and this gives Trump a credible anecdote as he defends himself against a wave of critical stories."
