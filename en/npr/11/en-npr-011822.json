        "Having returned from working in the city, he wanders about in search of his nomad family, only to rejoin them in what seems like an oxygen-starved hallucination.",

        "Up here, the narrator tells us, the altitude sharpened my awareness for detail, allowing many of the aspects of the story to remain crystal clear, so I know that I can't have made everything up.",
        "The people Ma Jian transfigures, the images of a Tibet where the living and the dead seem to mingle with beauty and unease, all this becomes quite a striking souvenir of our own high altitude pilgrimage through these exotic pages.",

        "Yeah, so we started by giving each of our founding centers a bolus of money up front, between 10 and $15 million, to make sure that they can engage in a very real way into our efforts by building infrastructure where needed, recruiting some faculty if necessary.",
