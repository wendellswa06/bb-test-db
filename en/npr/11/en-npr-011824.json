        "Marina Mahathir worries that the religious conservatives are gaining ground, not just in Malaysia, but all over the Muslim world.",
        "That view is shared by her friend and colleague Zainah Anwar, who heads the Malaysian NGO, Sisters in Islam.",
        "But where Marina tends to see Malaysia's glass as half empty, Anwar sees it as half full.",
        "Her proof, under pressure from Sisters in Islam and other groups, the Malaysian government has now agreed to review the newly amended Islamic Family Law.",
        "Even better, Anwar says, that review is being conducted by the Attorney General, not the Ministry of Religious Affairs.",
        "You know, we are for the first time involved as equals with Muslim and all the other conservative groups.",
        "Just as they have the right to speak out, we have the right to speak out and we argue our point.",
        "And the Attorney General has skillfully handled the meeting.",
        "And I don't think we would have gotten this far if it remained under the authority of the Religious Department.",
        "As a result, Anwar says, the battle between what she calls the progressive liberal forces and the religious conservatives is now being fought in Malaysia, at least, on a more level playing field.",
        "So you could see, as half empty, that the conservatives are getting stronger and all that.",
        "Or you could see that actually what is happening is the silent majority that is now organizing, that is now speaking out and that is now claiming their right as citizens, as believers, you know to engage with the religion.",
        "The current Prime Minister, Abdullah Badawi, is sympathetic to that argument, in part because he too has an outspoken activist daughter.",
        "But Marina Mahathir worries about what the final draft of the Islamic Family Law will look like after it is debated in Parliament.",
        "What we want, she says, is an entirely new family law based on the principles of equality and justice.",
        "She acknowledges that is a distant goal, but not an unattainable one.",
        "Michael Sullivan, NPR News.",
        "While most US senators had already left the Capitol yesterday for the holiday recess, not quite all of their business was done.",
        "We are not, in other words, tilling a lot of new ground in \"\"Spectre.\"\" In fact, the screenplay is pretty consciously tilling old ground.",
        "There are shout-outs to all three of Craig's \"\"007\"\" movies and also to those of his predecessors, including a battle on a train, with echoes of camera angles and even a couple of Sean Connery's punches from \"\"From Russia With Love.\"\" There are hints that the filmmakers also want to be of the moment - talk of drones and online surveillance drives the plot.",
        "But none of it feels especially urgent, even when red digital readouts are counting down to imminent explosions.",
        "It might feel more urgent if their writing were tighter, but I suppose if you have lots of villains, locales, homages and explosions, it's only natural to have lots of words.",

        "That feeling made \"\"Skyfall\"\" feel more substantial than most \"\"Bond\"\" pictures and set expectations perhaps unreasonably high for this installment, which is a perfectly entertaining mid-level \"\"Bond\"\" movie - just one that's haunted by the specter of its predecessor.",
