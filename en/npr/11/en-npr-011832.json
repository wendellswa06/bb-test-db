        "Just because he's black doesn't mean blacks are going to flock to him.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "So what's going to have to happen, you got to go out and talk to folks.",

        "We have to go out with the right message and pull people back in the party.",
        "People really flipped because they didn't like our message, like you all just alluded to, and so we have to get back on track.",
        "In order to do that, first he has to get the message together.",
        "He has to get some resources.",
        "He has to get some field people out there to know what they're doing so that then they'll come not just because Michael Steele is black, it has made a good statement, a different statement but because they believe in the values that the Republican Party believe in.",
        "What values would those be, George, that would be appealing to blacks in larger numbers than they've had so far?",
        "You know, we're talking about the whole faith-based piece.",
        "I mean, George Bush started the whole faith-based initiative.",
        "Obama had said that he would, you know, continue that.",
        "You know, African-Americans in particular believe into those things.",
        "Economic development, that's a very big deal for us.",
        "You know, to make sure that small businesses survive, you know, that we have a seat at the table, and those are just few of the things that, you know, that he has to start dealing with in getting this message together and out there.",
        "I think that's what spoke to you, wasn't it, George, as a small black businessman?",
        "Yeah, I mean, you know, I just felt that the traditional black - if you want to call them black leaders or the Democratic Party didn't speak to me.",
        "And I think the issue with a lot of African-Americans with the Republican Party is they've made a lot of mistakes in terms of communicating, not knowing how to communicate to African-Americans, and making honest mistakes in terms of policy.",
        "And so, I think one of the things that is not mentioned, too, is sometimes in the past the party just happened to have a black face and not a person as credible in the black community.",
        "So I think that's also important to Michael Steele where black folks cannot label him, you know, to be honest, Uncle Tom or something."

        "The question that I have as we bring this to a close, George, is for you, and it's this.",
        "It would just seem to me that the job that Michael Steele has to try to put a new face on the Republican Party at a time that America is just really enthralled with Barack Obama as president, both Republicans and Democrats who are supporting him, that's a really uphill battle.",
