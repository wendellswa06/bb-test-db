        "So, let's talk a little bit about the short term and the long term.",
        "The short term is that we're still in summer, and thank goodness for that.",
        "Enjoying ourselves, wrapping it up.",
        "If people want to go and get a great last-minute vacation, what are some things they should think about?",
        "Well, they need to be flexible, number one, because you may have your mind and heart set on something, and what we found is a lot of cruises right now, they're not such a bargain, because kind of the last-minute wrap-up, the last hurrah.",
        "So, you have to be flexible in whatever you're going to do, because what you may want to do may not be available.",
        "So, if you can be flexible, if it's seven nights you want, and maybe only the four-night is available, then that's what you may have to do.",
        "If you want to maybe go the Caribbean, and that may not be possible, maybe Myrtle Beach, ,Nags Head, somewhere like that may be something.",
        "On the West Coast, they have places that will be close, too, like San Diego, instead of taking that long trip that you might want to go on.",
        "Maybe going on down to San Diego Zoo or something like that.",
        "They can do that, and that's within their range.",
        "And once again, resorts that they stay at, they definitely play a large part in the cost of the trip.",
        "So, you may want to think about, you know, not staying at that two- or three-diamond property, and staying - I mean, I'm sorry, the four- or five-diamond property, and staying at the two- or three-diamond property.",
        "What about winter travel?",
        "Some people are already planning and buying tickets for the Christmas and winter holidays.",
        "Other people are like, what do you mean?",
        "It's, you know, it's the middle of summer.",
        "What do you think?",
        "MS.",
        "NUNN: Yes.",
        "Planning in advance is definitely a plus.",
        "The number one reason is that you're going to get what you want.",
        "A lot of people feel that they can just lay back, and wait and get that bargain.",
        "Well, that bargain for holiday travel, per se, is really a myth.",
        "And so you need to plan early, plan as early as you possibly can.",
        "You need to be flexible, flexible with your dates, flexible with your destination even.",
        "Look for alternative destinations, because if where you want to go is not available, I'll take a place like the Atlantis, down in the Bahamas.",
        "It fills up very quickly, and even though it's a very high-priced resort, it still fills up very quickly.",
        "So, you need to have an alternative there for you, and that's one thing you need to do.",
        "Alternatives and be flexible.",
        "Planning ahead is a plus to you.",
        "Right now, you know, people may think next - this is in advance.",
        "It's not in advance.",
        "We do have AAA members who have planned as far back as January of this year for their holiday travel.",
        "Wow.",
        "Just quickly, we've been hearing about airlines cutting back on capacity.",
        "Do you think some travel routes will just fill up, period?",
        "MS.",
        "NUNN: I'm hoping that they won't fill up, period.",
        "But you do need to be aware that they have cut back tremendously.",
        "And one thing we're telling people - like I said, number one, to book early.",
        "Number two, to be patient, and number two - number three, to give yourself a lot of time.",
        "There's so many changes that this industry has seen within the last seven, eight months really.",
        "And due to the fact that airlines are consolidating with each other, co-chairing, there's less planes out there than there used to be.",
        "So, you need to make those plans as early as you can, and once again, I say flexibility is the key right now.",
        "Make your plans early.",
        "Call your travel agent, of course.",
        "Make your plans early.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, Madeline, really appreciate the help.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's been my pleasure, thank you."
