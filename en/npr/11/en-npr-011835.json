        "The team has also worked on saving time for patients, literally.",
        "Couper wanted to know how long it took from the time they walked in the door until the time when they were ready to walk out.",
        "The patient was given a clipboard with a stopwatch and a pen, and they're told - keep track.",
        "And they're all over it.",

        "He can tell you, for example, that 98 percent of his hypertension patients now have their blood pressure under control.",
