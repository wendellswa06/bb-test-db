        "In the late 1980s, savings and loans were failing left and right, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was the savings and loan regulator, which meant Kaplan and his colleagues were getting noticed.",
        "When I went to work there nobody ever heard of it and suddenly it's on the news, so all of a sudden you could say, that that's us.",

        "And responding to public outcry, Congress begins to write legislation to reform the financial regulatory system.",
        "This should all sound familiar.",
        "And in 1989, President Bush, the first one, signs new legislation, banking reform.",
        "He walks out into the Rose Garden to make a speech and Lawrence Kaplan is watching it happen on TV.",
        "He remembers the moment well.",

        "It said the Office of Thrift Supervision.",
        "We went up, actually, on our chairs, there was a memo saying, you know, congratulations, we're now the Office of Thrift Supervision.",
        "They didn't get rid of the agency on the org chart, they just renamed it.",
        "And the regulators went back to work.",
        "Sure, there were new rules, new leadership, but the people stayed the same.",
        "Except Kaplan, he moved on to work in the private sector.",
        "And to be clear, Kaplan says he and his colleagues did not mess up.",
        "Regulators could only enforce the rules as they were written.",
        "And in the early 1980s, Congress changed the rules on them.",
        "Thrifts were allowed to take too many risks, so Kaplan says the regulators' hands were tied.",
        "But here is what happened next.",
        "The renamed agency, the OTS, later became regulator of Washington Mutual, AIG and Countrywide, all key players in our current financial crisis.",
        "And so, Congress is now sitting down to rewrite banking reform.",

        "The idea is basically that the industry being regulated - in this case it's banks, but it could be oil, mining, whatever - that industry will always work overtime to capture two groups of people, the people writing the rules, Congress and the people enforcing the rules, regulators like the people at the OTS.",
        "And the industry will use lots of capture tactics.",

        "And so hiring a professional to do that who's not going to be deployed next month back to Iraq or Afghanistan is very important to the quality of their care and to their own future.",

        "The underlying problem, though, is the fragmentation of the health care system and our need to make it seamless.",

        "Well, in addition to Senator Dole, who, of course, received his injuries which are life-changing in World War II, we had two recent veterans for the Iraqi war, both of whom were severely injured, on our panel, and the wife of an injured service member and another disabled health care leader who heads the Washington Rehab Center.",
        "So we had a lot of people with real day-to-day expertise.",

        "We learned to listen to people who have actually been through the experience in terms of what they needed to recover and what they needed to have successful lives.",
        "It was, for me, a remarkable experience because the panel was not made up of the usual suspects who represented major constituencies, but rather of people who had real life experience who could talk about those experiences.",
