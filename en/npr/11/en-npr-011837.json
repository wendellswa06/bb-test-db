        "Well, it appears that Mulder's team really wrestled with this issue.",
        "And ultimately, as you said, they didn't make a decision one way or the other on obstruction.",
        "But what the report makes clear is that if the special counsel was confident that the president clearly did not obstruct justice, it would say so.",
        "And it goes on to say that based on the facts and the legal standards, they certainly cannot say that.",
        "The evidence about the president's actions and intent, it says, presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.",

        "Also, the investigation did not establish that Trump was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian interference - not necessary for an obstruction case but it does affect, the report said, analysis of the president's actions and his intent.",
        "And then a lot of the acts took place in public.",
        "Bottom line - the report doesn't conclude that Trump obstructed justice, but it pointedly also does not exonerate him.",
        "Does not exonerate him.",
        "So what incidents were at the heart of Mueller's inquiry into the obstruction question?",
        "Well, there are at least 10 episodes detailed in the report.",
        "Most of these are things that are, at least in the broad brushstrokes, publicly known.",
        "Many of these were things that the president did in one-on-one meetings in which the report says he used his official powers in what it says were unusual ways.",
        "That includes the president's, for example, leaning on James Comey to go easy on Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was under investigation by the FBI; Trump's directing White House counsel Don McGahn to remove Mueller from the special counsel's office...",
        "A request that Don McGahn refused.",
        "He did not act on.",
        "The president's attempts to have Attorney General Jeff Sessions unrecuse himself from the investigation - take over and basically limit the scope of the investigation.",
        "Then there's this big public event that stands out, which we've talked a lot about.",
        "That's Trump's decision to fire Comey as FBI director."

        "Mueller's team says that Trump's actions on obstruction shifted after he became aware that he was under investigation after Comey's firing.",
