        "What's the economic argument for raising the minimum wage?",
        "The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour.",
        "It's been there since 1997, even though consumer prices have gone up about 25 percent since then.",
        "This bill would raise it over three years to $7.25 an hour.",
        "And the argument is that the lowest-paid workers in America have been left out of the recent economic expansion, and only by the government raising the floor will they be able to benefit.",
        "And the argument against it?",
        "Well, the argument against it is the classic economic argument.",
        "Conservatives and many labor economists and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan - among others - have said if you raise the minimum wage, you're just creating more unemployment.",

        "A stand-alone version of the estate tax bill failed in the Senate just two weeks ago.",

        "It's too early to say.",
        "The problem here is the estate tax is a ticking time bomb.",
        "Under the Bush tax cuts that were passed at the beginning of his administration, the estate tax comes back to pre-George Bush levels in 2011 unless something is done.",
        "The Republicans really want to get something done this year, because they're not confident they'll have as big a majority when they come back to Congress after the November elections.",
        "The question is have they put enough goodies in?",
        "The minimum wage, some money for abandoned mines in order to buy just a couple of Democratic senators and get over the 60-vote hump.",
        "It's just too early to tell.",
        "If it passes in its current form here, who would be the big winners, economically?",
        "It's not a full repeal of the estate tax.",
        "No.",
        "As you know, the Republicans had hoped to repeal the estate tax permanently once and for all, but there's no way that's going to get through Congress.",
        "So this is a compromise, which would limit its impact really to the very richest Americans.",
        "Interestingly, though, the way the thing is structured is the super rich - anybody who leaves over $25 million - faces a 30 percent tax rate.",
        "The people who get off well are the not-quite-so rich - people who just have a few million dollars.",
        "They get a lower tax rate, or exempt altogether."

        "Family farms and small business are always the preferred slogan: who wants to defend plutocrats?",
        "In fact, many family farms and small businesses are much too small to be covered by the estate tax, and even those that are a little bigger usually have found some way around it.",

        "Texas broke the mold after then-House majority leader Tom DeLay engineered, first, a GOP takeover of the state legislature, and then mid decade, used those new majorities to redraw the lines for the House of Representatives.",
