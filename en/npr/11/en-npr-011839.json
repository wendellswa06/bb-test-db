        "And his response was that, you know, his high school baseball coach had told this six foot three, 180 pound young man that he needed to get bigger in order to improve his chances of making the varsity team.",
        "And what the coach didn't know was that when Taylor walked back into the dugout, a little over half of the players on Taylor's baseball team were already doing steroids, so Taylor didn't have to look far to figure out how the other boys had achieved the coach's objective of getting bigger.",
        "Did you know he was using steroids?",
        "Had you noticed anything?",
        "Oh, we had noticed a lot.",

        "You know, if you go to the medical textbooks, you know, Taylor was showing all of the physical and emotional signs of anabolic steroid use.",

        "He became very aggressive at times.",
        "I mean we now know those were 'roid rages we were seeing.",
        "You know, just like some of the professional ball players who have sworn before Congress they've never done this stuff, you know, your 16-year-old denies it and he denies it and denies it even more, but it took a psychiatrist to finally get him to admit what the problem was.",
        "And what eventually happened?",
        "He went into a depression, is that right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The depression is at its worst when a user stops using the steroids.",
        "And as it turns out, once the psychiatrist got him to admit he had been doing steroids, part of Taylor's treatment was to come confess to his mom and dad as to what he'd been doing and then she had him stop cold turkey.",
        "And as it turns out, that's exactly the way you're not supposed to stop using steroids.",
        "And this depression is at its worst in the four to six week period following a user stopping steroids.",
        "And it was exactly during that period that Taylor became depressed enough and made the decision to take two belts and hang himself in his bedroom.",
        "And that's where you - where he was discovered?",
        "Yes.",
        "His mom found him and has never been back upstairs, since finding him that morning."

        "I wasn't necessarily angry at the widespread use.",
        "I think surprised and just felt an obligation to shine a light on the problem and let people know what we had discovered.",
        "What I was angry about, James, and that's the second part of your question, was the reaction from our educators and coaches who went into a - into a denial scheme.",

        "This about the health of our children.",
        "This is about our 15 and 16-year-old babies that are in an environment that - where our leaders, our adult influencers should be taking very hard, strong, aggressive steps to get it stopped.",
        "And instead of doing that, they - at least the ones or many of the ones we were exposed to shifted into denial mode, and that's just not acceptable in my book.",
        "It wasn't acceptable then, and it's not acceptable now.",
        "Performance-enhancing drugs are an issue in a lot of sports, but baseball does stand out, especially today.",

        "What role did you have in Senator Mitchell's investigation?",
        "Well, I was invited about two months ago to meet with Senator Mitchell and spent a couple of hours in a private meeting with him.",
        "And my message was really fairly straightforward, James.",
        "It was to get him to appreciate that this battle - it's about the life and health of our nation's youth.",
        "You know, whether or not these players like it - I don't care whether they like it or not - they are role models.",
        "And as parents and as ticket-buying fans, we need to hold these players accountable to behavior that sets a good example for our kids, you know, not leading our children to believe that the, you know, panacea to success and health and wealth is an illegal drug.",
        "It makes me sick to listen to this discussion whether or not we need to put an asterisk next to somebody's record.",
        "The question is: How many years in the federal penitentiary should some of these boys be spending?",
