        "The signal the Court sent today is let the redistricting festivals begin, because there is no way that the judiciary is going to step in and block partisan gerrymandering.",
        "And if that happens, says Norman Ornstein, the affect on voters and the political process will be profound.",
        "If you don't know from election to election who your representative is, because your district may change, and may change two or three times, it makes for any sense of accountability in this process being, basically, devastated."
