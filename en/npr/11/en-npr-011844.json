        "Yes, Rudy, that's right.",
        "And it's funny, because the law was the same back in 19th-century Ireland as it is here in America, and it's a bit of a catch-22.",
        "The law says, until someone is harmful to themselves or others, you cannot get them committed.",

        "My son is under out-patient committal and the judge has said, that as long as he - as long as two doctors say that he needs to take medication, he must take medication.",
        "However, when we go and prove to the court that he's not taking medication so well, that's too bad.",
        "And that only shows that he is not compliant.",

        "Well, yes, Rudy.",

        "But the medication, although it works wonders for some people, the fact is, is that for most schizophrenics, it doesn't do much at all.",
        "They still hear their voices, as you explained.",
        "And often they hear several voices, disembodied voices.",
        "There is a group called the Hearing Voices Network that was started in Holland and they're doing great, great work.",
        "It's schizophrenics or voice hearers coming together to talk about their problems in their lives and the voices they hear and what they're telling them, and they're managing their voices, encouraging their good voices and, sort of discouraging the bullying, more badly mannered voices that tell them to do things that might harm their family or friends or whoever.",
        "And Rudy, we appreciate your situation and understand your point, but it's also very controversial to commit people to mental institutions against their will.",
        "That's obviously something that ...",
        "Oh, no, sir.",
        "There's another way around it.",

        "You can become their guardians, which is what we did and since we became my son's guardian, it's not a 100 percent turnaround, but he has to take his medication because we are his guardians.",
        "He actually works now, not at a high position but he works.",
        "And so - but not everybody can afford to do that.",

        "That's right, Neal.",
        "Many, as it turns out, many more people hear voices than would care to admit it.",
        "And it does not mean that you're necessarily schizophrenic.",
        "I think if the voices reach a certain level you could call yourself schizophrenic, but it doesn't become a problem unless there is a - sort of, a thought disorder that accompanies it.",
        "And schizophrenics often feeling that their thoughts are being controlled or manipulated, or that thoughts are being put into their minds, or removed by an outside force.",
        "Their thoughts jump from topic to topic and very randomly.",

        "He thought my mom was trying to poison him, putting ground glass in his food, thought we were conspiring against him, things like that.",
        "Of course, completely, you know, irrational and unfounded.",
        "And I remember at that time just being very frustrated, very embarrassed, feeling somewhat guilty, feeling, you know, like, why can't we just get rid of him, mom?",
        "Why don't you divorce him?",
        "Of course, in those days, early '60s, people didn't divorce.",
        "But I was that level of like, what's going on and why can't we make this family better?",
        "There's a bright side to my story that connects with that three-legged stool and sort of fills in, I think, a missing piece that might be some help to others.",
        "My dad was a member of AA and his sponsor had information on Abram Hoffer, a psychiatrist in Canada who was doing nutritional work with alcoholics and schizophrenics, specifically, and suspected there was a strong genetic connection.",
        "They were able to get my dad on to a mega vitamin regimen that within a couple of years made him, as far as I'm concerned, unrecognizable as the same person I had to deal with in junior high school.",
        "Back in his right mind, functioning, you know, you could say good morning and he wouldn't fly off the handle and scream at you and stomp out the door and not be back for a day.",
        "It was just, you know, really, really amazing.",
        "Centered on the B vitamins, niacin, especially, but fabulous, amazing turnaround in his life and in our family.",
        "Well, that's a great story and congratulations on his recovery.",
        "And he is okay today?",
        "Well, he was okay, until his death at the age of 88.",

        "They're recovering from their illness on a daily basis, they have a daily reprieve.",
        "And schizophrenics within the Hearing Voices Network are finding a way to manage their voices a day at time, too, and get a daily reprieve from the worst of their voices.",

        "That's right.",

        "For so long, for several decades, the landscape was bleak, you know, we were all told that there was nothing that could be done about schizophrenia.",
        "And then in Ireland, soon after I sobered up myself, I learned of this discovery of this genetic link.",
        "And this gene is called Dysbindin and it's found in neurons of most in human brains.",
        "And this study had cracked the genetic code.",
