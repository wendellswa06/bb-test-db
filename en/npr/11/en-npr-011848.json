        "And he died in 1680.",
        "That was several years before Newton published the \"\"Principia.",
        "So this is - he lived 78 years, whatever that was.",
        "This is really the period that we now have a two-word label for, the scientific revolution.",
        "So he was steeped in these older notions, but he actually did - he adopted, he was an early adopter of technologies like the celestial tube, as they called it, or the telescope, the microscope.",
        "And - but he was probably still too steeped in the -in sort of the older methodologies to really make too much progress in what...",
        "The world was changing or just changing around him, and he couldn't keep up with it, and...",
        "He couldn't keep up with it, yeah, although he certainly tried.",
        "I mean, you know, this guy had more energy than I've ever, you know, than you can imagine.",
        "And, you know, he published something like 30 books in almost as many subjects.",
        "You mentioned a lot of them.",
        "Right.",
        "And he - those books served as sort of benchmarks of learning of the time.",
        "They were encyclopedias on whatever it was: optics, even music, that kind of thing.",
        "And even though they contained many propositions that could then be proven wrong by experiment, which is by the way a pretty valuable service in a way, you know, they were important works that almost all the major figures of that time had to contend with."

        "So Rome actually had a very sophisticated system in place.",
        "But he did survive that, and that's when he looked at a lot of the plague victims under a microscope, which was probably the first time anybody had every looked at human blood through a microscope.",
        "And what did he actually examine?",
        "Did he make an observation and a contribution after the observation?",

        "Wow.",
        "But it was really a parlor trick because there was also a magnet embedded in the cork.",
