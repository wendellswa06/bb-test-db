        "So what we see here is really the result of a very tragic and unfortunate pattern and trend of the rise of extremism and anti-Semitism over the past several years.",
        "In calendar year 2017, we saw the largest single increase of anti-Semitic incidents in recent times.",
        "We saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in 2017 over the previous year, 2016.",
        "In addition, we saw nearly a 90 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in K-12 classrooms in schools across the United States.",
        "Before we get to why you think this is happening, when you say anti-Semitic incidents, what are you discussing?",
        "When we're talking about an anti-Semitic incident at a school, in a classroom, in a K-12, it's everything from the scrawling of a swastika on a bathroom wall to instances in - most recently in a Western state, where a student made very callous and cold references related to the death of Jews in the Holocaust as part of a Valentine's Day project.",
        "And so it really takes all different shapes and forms.",
        "Just three weeks ago here in Northern Virginia, I was at the Jewish Community Center in Fairfax where 19 swastikas were spray-painted on the side of, really, a community center where people come to exercise and hold community-based events.",
        "So it really takes all forms.",

        "Some of the most vitriolic anti-Semitic attacks against Soros and others have really come out in the past year or two.",

        "Correct.",
