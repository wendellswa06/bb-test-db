        "Do you ever try to talk to artists about those issues?",
        "Yes, and the advice that I give them is to surround themselves with a professional team that would help them, you know, uphold and help them take their professional presence to the next level.",
        "I always refer to my clients to attorneys that I know that do good in fair deals, media coaches, image consultants, videographers, choreographers that are quality that - and you know, I only refer the same people over and over again, because I know that they will get good end results.",
