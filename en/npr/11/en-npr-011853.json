        "Well, so certainly President-elect Trump has issued a few statements on cybersecurity, including a campaign platform.",
        "Those are pretty thin on details.",
        "And some of his statements - it's been difficult to understand whether or not he - how literally to take those particular recommendations.",
        "Of his national security hires that have been announced at this point, none are known for having particularly strong cybersecurity backgrounds.",
        "So as we see more and more people coming into the administration, we might be able to start getting a sense of what exactly this administration's cybersecurity policy might look like.",
        "Surely when you become the administration, you have a vested interest in national cybersecurity that maybe you lacked before, don't you?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think while many of his statements during the campaign did not necessarily evince well-developed policy thoughts - he's going to have to come up with more specific ideas.",
        "One thing that Donald Trump might run up against is the existence of current laws.",
        "So, for example, he's indicated a number of times that he intends to transfer a lot of the cybersecurity mission to the Department of Defense to come up with a plan for defending critical infrastructure.",
        "And there are potentially rather serious consequences to sort of the militarization of civilian cyber defense.",
        "I think that they might find themselves coming up against an existing framework that doesn't necessarily square with the broad instinct towards wanting to turn towards the military to solve this problem.",
        "I thought the Obama administration was pretty clear in saying, after they asserted that Russian attempts to meddle in the elections had been ongoing, that the United States was going to reply in kind.",
        "Can we assume those efforts are going on now?",
        "It's not clear what efforts the current administration will undertake to respond to Russian interference.",
        "One of the - sort of the most vexing issues has been this question of cyber deterrence.",
        "Because of the particular features of cyberspace, that challenges a lot of our traditional deterrence models which really were based on sort of a nuclear model of threatening very strong retaliatory action in order to deter unwanted conduct.",
        "Because cybersecurity challenges that, we've seen the Obama administration attempt to be rather creative in how they might respond.",
        "They've talked about being willing to respond either in cyberspace or in other domains, but those responses might be secret - and also that some would be visible.",
        "So we've seen seen Obama - the Obama administration used sanctions, indictments, sort of this name-and-shame response to try and hold other nations responsible.",
        "Because they have in the past relied on these secret - that they will respond at the time and place of their choosing, and it might not be known, it makes it incredibly difficult to know whether there has been a response, what that response looks like and whether or not it's been effective?",
        "Susan Hennessy of the Brookings Institution and the Lawfare blog, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Canada has found itself in an awkward position, squeezed between two of the world's most powerful countries.",
        "The U.S.",
        "requested that Canada arrest and extradite a senior executive of one of China's tech giants, Huawei.",
        "And China is furious and threatening to retaliate.",
        "NPR's Jackie Northam traveled to Vancouver, where this Canadian crisis began.",
        "It's a typically gray, drizzly day here in downtown Vancouver, where an extradition hearing is underway.",
        "A gaggle of mostly Chinese protesters have gathered outside the court.",
        "One man sets fire to a small Chinese flag.",
        "Another, Louis Huang, holds a poster showing pictures of two Canadian men - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - who are in a Chinese prison."

        "Well, explain further about the one-drop-of-blood rule.",

        "But the strange, uncanny power of the one-drop-of-blood rule is that it does have this very powerful force in our society and in our imagination.",
        "So do you think people like Obama and Tiger Woods, who very specifically are trying to sort of straddle that line and say yes, I identify with my black heritage but I don't want to deny my mother, too, and sort of branch out and form this new something, whatever it is, that's not either black or white but some new creation is starting to change that?"
