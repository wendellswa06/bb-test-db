        "Yeah, when I was in elementary school, many of the kids were bussed in who were black, and they really - they gave me a really hard time.",

        "We hate that too.",

        "But I think it's worth keeping in mind in all of this that the very idea that the human species could be divided into neatly demarcated biologically-distinctive things called races is a myth.",
        "In fact, we all come from common ancestry in Africa.",
        "In fact, all of our family trees are mixed or the products of migrations and intermixtures.",
        "So I think what's - part of what's at stake in the new visibility of the idea of multiracialism is a kind of recognition that the very idea of race itself, which would categorize human beings according to their color and pigeonhole them in a certain way, is really fundamentally arbitrary, subjective and a matter of culture and history.",
        "At the same time though, race has an incredible power in reality in American society.",
        "You know, many of us live still - you know, and I was struck by Debra's comment of taking her daughter to a predominantly African-American scene.",
        "Many of us move in predominantly racially segregated environments in our daily lives.",
        "So race is at once a myth, but also this myth with an incredible kind of force in structuring our experience in America."
