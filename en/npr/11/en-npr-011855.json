        "We have e-mail from Melissa in Florida, who says: My son, Jordan, was the first to bring the multi-racial category to the public school system in North Carolina and in Florida, after a lengthy standoff between my family and the public system in the late '90s.",
        "The change helped pave the way for the U.S.",
        "Census finally allowing people to identify their entire background by checking multiple boxes.",
        "The multi-racial category in the public school system was a compromise.",
        "We fought for the right of mixed-race people to identify themselves simply as what they are.",
        "In my children's case, Swiss, German, Irish, African, and American Indian.",
        "I would be offended if they were forced by society or a government institution to neglect any part of their background.",
        "I mean, to that end, if we were checking every part of our ethnicity, I'd check a convenient box that says white, but I'd have to do, you know, Russian, English, Scottish, Spanish…",

        "Right.",
        "It's America.",

        "You know, you get your DNA tested and you find out you've got, you know, 15 generations back there is a Chinese person.",
        "You know, I'm not going to start.",
        "I, you know, you can't tell other people what to do, but I think in terms of what carries a cultural cache and what's going to carry this conversation forward is not the examples at the extremes.",
        "And I'm frankly - I'm not going to get into it.",
        "I'm not going to spend much intellectual energy on defending the rights of Swiss, German, you know?",
        "Right.",
        "We need to talk about cultural - we need the categories to make it easier to have these conversations, but we can't belabor the categories.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "For myself, as a product of an interracial marriage and interracial family, I grew up seeing black and white people together under the same roof, loving each other, celebrating holidays and birthdays.",
        "And so, to me that was the norm, was black and white together.",
        "And I do want to interject real quickly and say this is obviously much more than just the black-white issue.",
        "And black-white biracial people are probably a smaller percentage - I know, in fact, from the Census 2000 are a smaller percentage of mixed race people than, say, Native American-white or Latino-white.",
        "So we're a very small percentage of the mixed race population and yet we are often the lightning rod, you know, of the issue.",
        "We're sort of the most visible or controversial because of the chasm between black and white in the United States, in our society.",
        "You're…",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I just need to interrupt you to say you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "When I went to college is when I realized oh, you know, black people and white people don't get along.",
        "And that may sound naive to some of the listeners out there, but it was mid-80s.",
        "And in my family, again, we just didn't talk about race all that much and it wasn't as much of an issue.",
        "I go to the college campus and that's where I really start getting the questions and having to make decisions about who am I going to relate to.",
        "Who am I going to identify with?",
        "So I think at some point or other all of us who are mixed race do have those encounters in which we are asked, or challenged even, as to which side we're on.",
        "I think that's a big part of the classification issue.",
        "Why people want you to choose one is because they want to know where you stand on various issues as if, you know, well, I'm black could then, therefore, tell a person everything about you.",
        "Obviously, it doesn't.",
        "But I think that's what we're searching for when we ask people to choose one or to identify themselves of the label.",

        "I think I have an interesting perspective on this because, although my grandmother is Korean, she was married to white man who was raised in China by a Chinese family.",
        "He was orphaned and adopted by a Chinese family.",
        "So because he was the man, the culture in the family was Chinese, not Korean.",
        "So my dad grew up eating Chinese food, even though he's not Chinese.",
        "And this was very confusing to me when I was little because I grew up in Virginia, anything other than white, you know, it must be one category.",
        "Are you Chinese or Japanese?",
        "That's what people would ask me.",
        "I didn't really understand it.",

        "People don't notice it anymore.",
        "They perceive me as white.",

        "Does your dad do karate?",

        "And one of my African-American friends jokingly calls me an Asian quadroon.",

        "I mean, you can choose whatever you want, but people are still going to treat you based on how they perceive you.",

        "That's true.",
        "That's a distinction you make, Debra Dickerson, you know, the perception of others.",

        "And I found out the Choctaw and Cherokee part about 20 years ago, and I started learning the Choctaw language about nine years ago.",
        "Most people would still look at me and think that I'm Caucasian, but I speak the language to kind of denote that I'm not entirely Caucasian and it kind of slips under the radar sometimes.",
        "Mike, do you think an ethnic identity like Native American is, because it's so threatened and because there is such a movement to sort of restore it and keep those traditions alive, that it's slightly different from other ethnicities because there's sort of a desperation attached to it in terms of making sure that people embrace it?",
        "There's part of a cultural thing of that, but there's also a legal situation to that.",
        "Because if people are descendants of people that signed treaties 150, 200 years ago after the (unintelligible) process started with United States in 1778.",
        "These are people that have a history with this government and have ancestors that have a history that predates this government.",
        "And they just - I guess part of it is the preservation because they don't want this ignored or forgotten or lost so far into the melting pot that they're predating the American concept of things they've lost.",

        "Debra Dickerson, if your kids came to you and said, you know, I am my own thing.",
        "I don't feel like I'm black or white.",
        "Would you feel like something was lost?",
        "As I said, I'm kind of preparing myself for that, but as long as my children can go toe to toe with me, look me in the eye and defend themselves, they can call themselves whatever they want.",
        "But if they're just trying to go along and get along and, you know, a lot of times it's just - it's cool to suddenly be an Indian or suddenly be black or suddenly be things that used to be disadvantaged but now carries some cultural benefits with them.",
        "So as long as they can - so I'm focused not on raising them to be good black people or good biracial people, but I'm focused on their moral and intellectual and humanistic development.",
        "And if I do that job right, whatever they decide they will completely inhabit.",
        "And I just want to raise good, strong, moral, thinking children.",
        "They can call themselves whatever they want.",
        "And Sundee Frazier, have you had that conversation with your parents?",
        "Well, I'd like to just piggyback on what Ms. Dickerson just said, and say I affirm that wholeheartedly.",
        "That in my book, \"\"Check All That Apply,\"\" I think the bottom-line message that I'm trying to communicate is that we should find friends and peers and associates who share our heart and our values more so than our color or our specific facial features or ethnic background.",
        "That's what's most important.",
        "It's finding people who share our values, who have the same, as she said, moral fiber and desire to make the world a better place.",
        "To be ethical people, to stand up for social justice issues, if that's, you know, a concern, and fight with them for those things to come about.",
        "That's really what we need to do.",
        "That's a nice place to leave it.",
