        "Is the majority of the money that supports Goodwill's programs coming from the stores or is it just a small part?",
        "Its majority - majority of it is coming from the stores.",
        "And Charity Navigator, I don't know if George has heard of this, but Charity Navigator...",
        "MR. ROUTOLO: Yeah.",
        "I've heard of it.",
        "They rated us four stars for the seventh - for our seventh straight year.",
        "And they also - you know, the general public will be happy to know, why we're really promoting this is the fact that 93 cents of every dollar donated goes to our programs and services, that support job training and workforce development.",
        "You know, oftentimes, you'll see nonprofits in the 80, 85 percent toll(ph) range, that's really good, but we're at 93 percent.",
        "So people know - I think the understanding, you know, of what we do, the job - you know, the job development, workforce development, like that.",
        "Give me a concrete example of a program, you know, because when you hear job development, it can mean a lot of things.",
        "But if someone walks in, you know, to get some training, what specifically might they do?",
        "MR.",
        "SCHLITTENHART: Resume building, one-on-one career counseling, different job industries, these are all things that the general public might not now Goodwill does.",
        "But when they go to our stores, and they make a purchase, that money will go back into our programs and services.",
        "OK, thank you.",
        "How much do you think, George, that people pay attention to things like charity ratings?",
        "I mean, you know, a lot of people give, because someone asks them, you know, someone is walking around in the office and has an organization that they support, and you're like, well, I like Harry, so I'm going to give money to Harry's group.",
        "How much do people actually take a strategic look at where they're giving?",
        "I think that it's - we're in a situation right now, where people are going to continue to support the charities that they've been supporting historically.",
        "And it's really incumbent upon those organizations, those charities, to make sure that they communicate - exactly what Jeremy was talking about - that they communicate how effective they are in raising money, and spending their - those dollars exactly where the person or the donor determined it should go."

        "So, I think that that's kind of a standard right now for our business.",
        "People, who are very serious about philanthropy and give away large sums of money, either as an individual or through a foundation, will go back and track how those funds were used, and how effective that generosity was to the ultimate need.",
        "So, to answer your question, there are a number of different websites out there that people can visit, that will really talk about the effectiveness of the organization.",
        "And I think it's becoming more and more prevalent.",
        "Jeremy, what about strategies?",
        "Do you change your strategy at all, to try to make sure that you can do what you need to do during this period, and recognizing that your model is somewhat different from a lot of organizations, where you are on a model of selling products, you know, getting donations of products, and then reselling them more so than reaching out and say, mailing out donation forms.",
        "Right, I think our model pretty much stays the same.",
        "I think what you find is people can't control gas prices, rising food cost, but what they can control is how they become more smarter and savvier on how they shop.",
        "And I think we're seeing that more at our Goodwill retail stores.",
        "You know, again our model will stay the same, but we see more foot traffic, you know, in times like these.",

        "Yes.",
        "Strategy.",
        "What do groups do in a time like this?",
        "Well, you know, as you were talking about giving institute, really what we are is an association of firms that only work with nonprofits, only work with philanthropy, and advise them how to advance their mission.",
        "So, what we talk about is that during this time, and during a slow down or a recession, it really is incumbent upon the nonprofit to communicate more effectively with the donor, and to make the donor feel like they're very, very important.",
        "To explain to the donor that in fact, the needs that they had last year when the economy might have been a bit stronger still exist, and how important their generosity and their philanthropy is.",
        "We even recommend that you thank donors for no reason.",
        "Donors that have given to you in the past.",
        "You just call up, and you say, we just want you to know how important your support has been, and this is what we've been able to do with your donations."

        "Has that changed the amount of money that's available to go to charities and nonprofits?",

        "We did some additional statistics real quickly, that it showed both the year before - the year of an election.",
        "This is - goes back to 1968, the year of an election, and the year after an election that philanthropy grew at a greater rate, than it did normally over the course of that 40-year period.",
        "Now, we don't have any economic information as to why that happened, but so much of charity and so much of philanthropy is how people feel about themselves, and there might be an uplifting of people's spirits after an election.",
        "There's a certain amount of hope that comes with a new presidency.",

        "Well, the United States has been very explicit that this is all about Iran, and the United States has been discussing this since last year with the government of Poland and also with the government of the Czech Republic because, in addition to the 10 missile interceptors that the United States wants to put into Poland, it wants to put some kind of advanced radar near Prague to be part of this whole system.",
        "And the explanation for the Europeans has totally been all along that this is about Iran.",
        "There's been some skepticism in Europe about that, but nevertheless, that's the reason that the United States has been giving.",
        "What's interesting now is that, as a result of this crisis in Georgia and the actions of the Russian government, the Russian military - now there seems to be not an explicit, but a suggestion nevertheless that the United States and Poland might be doing this in response to what's happened in Georgia.",
        "And therefore, that suggests that this is somehow about Russia, as well.",
        "I should add that there are critics of missile defense in the United States who don't believe that it will work.",
        "But the Russians do, and the Russians say over and over again - well, maybe not the initial 10 interceptors placed in Poland, but over the course of years, in the future, they fear that the United States would acquire the technology to beef this system up, that it might actually challenge Russian missiles some time in the future.",
        "The foreign minister of Poland just told us that the agreeing to this deal last week is a coincidence.",
        "People there buy that?",
        "It's hard to believe that that's a coincidence.",
        "The Polish public opinion polls has been against it until Russia invaded Georgia.",
        "Now, there is a majority, according to the most recent polls in Poland, that favor it.",
        "The Polish government had said that it was willing to consider the deployment of these missiles in Poland, but they wanted a better deal from the United States.",
        "They wanted more money, and they wanted the United States to deploy to Poland patriot missiles, the most advanced version of Patriot missiles, in case Russia should look upon Poland unfavorably.",
        "And, in fact, it has looked upon Poland unfavorably once Poland agreed to this."
