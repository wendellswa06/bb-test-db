        "In 2009, researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Britain - they published a study showing that bilingual speakers could resist distraction better than monolingual speakers.",
        "So that totally fits with the theory.",

        "One of those tasks showed an effect of bilingualism.",
        "And that's the task that was published.",

        "And those tasks never made it into a publication.",
        "They were just put in a file drawer.",
        "So we had four studies, but only one was published.",
        "And that's the successful one, showing an effect bilingualism.",
        "Isn't that kind of misleading - to just publish the study that sort of backed up this theory?",
        "It is misleading, David.",
        "And full credit to de Bruin for coming clean about what happened.",
        "In fact, one of the authors of the 2009 paper tried to replicate the experiment that found a positive benefit for bilingualism.",
        "And that replication failed to work.",
        "So in other words, there were four experiments.",
        "Three did not show benefits, and they weren't published.",
        "One showed a benefit and was published.",
        "But it couldn't be reproduced.",
        "And then the reproduction was not published.",
        "Well, there are multiple reasons David.",
        "But the first is that when a study doesn't produce a result, it's hard to know if that's because there wasn't an effect or just because the study was somehow not conducted properly.",
        "And the second problem is that scientific journals really want to publish studies that find something.",
        "They want to publish studies that have a positive result.",
        "They want news.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so negative studies - as they're called -tend not to get published.",
        "Is this a widespread problem in science?",
        "De Bruin actually thinks this is a problem that goes beyond just the one set of papers that are co-authors worked on in 2009.",
        "She went back and analyzed studies of bilingualism that were presented at scientific conferences.",
        "Scientists often present the first look at their work at these conferences.",
        "And you're more likely to find eclectic work presented at scientific conferences.",
        "She analyzed how often these presentations at scientific conferences ended up in prestigious journals.",
        "And what she found was that the quality of the studies was not important.",
        "What mattered was whether the study found bilingualism had brain benefits.",
        "Here she is again."
