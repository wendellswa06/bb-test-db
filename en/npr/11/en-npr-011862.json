        "And she knew she was dying.",
        "She was ill with cancer and she knew that she would be ending her life soon.",
        "But she sat down and, with a pen, wrote out over 300 pages.",
        "Just an amazing tour de force - but not surprising, given her production.",
        "You know, between age 40 and her death in 1973, she produced - and I'm going to give you a few numbers here - 43 novels, about 30 nonfiction books, 242 short stories, 37 children's books, 18 film and TV scripts, 500 articles and essays and thousands of letters.",
        "That's really almost incomprehensible.",
