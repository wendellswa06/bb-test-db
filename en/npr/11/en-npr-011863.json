        "I think that this is incident is important.",

        "There's not any ambiguity about it.",
        "Of course it was a racist act.",

        "Now the thing is if he gets away with this, if he's not sanctioned, if his career isn't ended, if he's not kept from getting any other big TV deals or contracts or movies or whatever, then the implicit message will be that this is okay.",
        "You see, that the wheel has turned, that we don't have to worry about that anymore.",
        "That that's just a bunch of silly sensibilities from some old civil rights relics who have to have some axe to grind.",
        "And that's a sign of a kind of creeping, slow drift in the sensibility of American values that should be very disturbing.",
        "Now I find it ironical that this happens at the same time that this O.J.",
        "Simpson thing goes down.",
        "And I'm not equating O.J.'s possibly killing those people to this guy saying something racist.",
