        "One of the trials was designed to treat patients with - who have Stargardt's disease, which is the most common pediatric macular degeneration.",
        "And the second trial was to treat patients who have dry AMD, which is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world.",
        "And in both studies, we turn the embryonic stem cells into cells known as retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE cells, and those were injected under the retina into the sub-retinal space of the patients.",
        "And these RPE cells are responsible for maintaining the health of the photoreceptors, which we see with.",
        "So in both of these degenerative eye diseases, which are currently untreatable, there's a loss of these RPE cells, which leads to a loss of the photoreceptors and then blindness.",
        "So we were hoping that by adding new, healthy RPE cells, we might be able to prevent this process from occurring.",
        "Was this sort of a proof of concept stage?",
        "Well actually, this is a Phase 1/2 study.",
        "So it was essentially just to test the safety of the cells.",
        "We were actually going in in these first two patients with the lowest possible dose.",
        "These again, are patients with very advanced stage disease.",
        "So we weren't expecting to see any real efficacy at this early point.",
        "And you did find, at least in one of the patients provability that something was happening?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, it's first important to point out that when you measure visual improvements in patients with low vision, this is very difficult.",
        "There's no consensus in part because of current - there's currently no treatments.",
        "But that being said, the vision in both patients appears to have improved after transplantation of the cells, again even at the lowest dose.",
        "So before treatment, the Stargardt's patient could only detect hand motions.",
        "But within a week after treatment, she was able to actually start counting fingers.",
        "Indeed before the treatment, she couldn't read any letters on the standard visual acuity chart, but by two weeks, she started reading letters, and by one month, she could actually read five letters."
