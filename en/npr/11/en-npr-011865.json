        "Last month, the grand jury report in Pennsylvania documented more than 1,000 accounts of sexual abuse by more than 300 Catholic priests.",
        "In the weeks since that report, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico and now New York and New Jersey have all said they're going to investigate sex abuse by Catholic priests in their states.",

        "What do these new investigations entail?",
        "So yesterday, the New York attorney general's office issued subpoenas to all eight Catholic dioceses in the state, essentially asking for documents and records.",
        "And New York is sort of a special case because the attorney general's office doesn't have the authority to convene a grand jury - sort of like we saw in Pennsylvania.",
        "But in New York, it'll be a similar investigation, meaning that they're essentially looking at whether the dioceses covered up sort of allegations of sexual abuse.",
        "So they have allegations that are prompting this investigation?",
        "They suspect a cover-up?",
        "Well, they - this was, I mean, sort of as you said before, inspired by the Pennsylvania grand jury report.",
        "They are sort of looking into whether there was a cover-up.",
        "And they also asked district attorneys in the state to work with them on any possible criminal charges.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And it's also just sort of interesting how impactful that Pennsylvania report has been.",

        "But I wonder as a black woman whether you feel there's an added layer of complexity.",
