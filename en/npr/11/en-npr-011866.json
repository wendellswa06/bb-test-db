        "And so how do you keep them from assembling into other things besides the eye once you put them into someone's eye?",

        "So that's why this has taken so long to get into the clinic, at least in part.",
        "So when they're left on their own, these embryonic stem cells will turn into a hodgepodge of cell types.",
        "So in part of the dish, you might see cartilage or nerve cell and then in another section some beating heart cells.",
        "So the main issue is how to turn those reliably into the desired replacement cell type.",

        "But fortuitously, it turns out that these cells like to become retinal pigment epithelium.",
        "So you - in almost all these cultures, they will eventually have little freckles of pigmentation, which are RPE cells, and those cells expand very, very nicely.",
        "So we can take very small patches and turn them into literally millions of these cells.",
        "And you took these from embryonic stem cells.",
        "Yes, so we actually started out with a single cell from a leftover IVF embryo, and we turned that cell into a embryonic stem cell line, which of course are the body's master cells.",
        "So they can become virtually every cell type in the body.",
        "And since these cells are immortal, they can provide an unlimited supply of starting material.",
        "So for these studies, we turned those stem cells into these RPE cells, which were then frozen down, then shipped off to the clinical site.",
        "And then after they're reformulated, they can then be injected to a fine kenular(ph) into the subretinal space of the patient.",
        "And actually it's an outpatient procedure.",

        "Yes, I mean, obviously there are some people, such as former President Bush, who think it's wrong to, quote-unquote, \"\"destroy one life to save another.\"\" So we developed another method that's routinely used in IVF clinics around the world known as PGD.",
        "And this method allows you to remove one cell from an embryo without destroying it.",
        "And then we take that cell, instead of using it for genetic testing, we turn it into stem cells, and we now have several of these lines that we can use in the future where no embryos were destroyed.",

        "So that's not very many cells.",
        "And why has it taken over a decade for a published report on such a use of...",
        "Right, well, embryonic stem cells are amongst the most complex biological entities that have ever been proposed for clinical use.",
        "So the dynamic complexity of their biology poses regulatory concerns, and in particular, for instance, keratoma formation, which by definition these undifferentiated cells have to do if they're injected into a living animal.",
        "Advanced Cell Technology and you personally have been criticized in the past for overstating results because, you know, you've been having trouble raising money to stay in business.",

        "We are a public company, so obviously that impacts stock, but it just doesn't make sense not to just present the data as straightforwardly as possible.",
        "And why is the eye a good spot to try to do this now?",
        "Well, actually there are three reasons.",
        "The first reason, of course, is that there are diseases that affect millions of people.",
        "So dry AMD, for instance, affects 30 million people worldwide.",
        "It's currently untreatable.",

        "So if we can do something about it, that's important.",
        "Two, is the eye is what's known as immune privileged, which is one of the very few sites in the body where you can actually transplant cells without a risk of rejection, or at least the rejection process is reduced.",
        "Lewis and Clark with sex appeal.",
        "And then thirdly, it turns out that these embryonic stem cells, as I mentioned earlier, like to turn into what's known as neural ectoderm, into neurons and these retinal cells so that we can actually get these cells in very large numbers, and in effect, we can get near 100 percent pure retinal cells, which is very important, of course, going into a patient."
