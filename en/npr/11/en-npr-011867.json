        "And your argument is that the conservatives' current position did not arise suddenly, it's the result of 30 or 40 years of developing ideas and institutions.",
        "Yes, in many ways, I think at least since the 1970s, since the famous tax revolt in California that resulted in Proposition 13 out there, conservatives have really dominated discussion about the economy, about what government should do and shouldn't do, about taxes.",
        "And so this is the run-up to the Great Recession, I think, that when the banks began to fail, when auto companies looked like they were going out of business, a lot of people were ready to believe conservative analysis of what was going on, that big government was the problem, or at least big government coddling corporations, perhaps, was the problem.",
        "And so liberals, radicals were not really ready with an alternative analysis that was very convincing.",
        "And the same thing, the same decades of preparation, went - started back after the Civil War and led to, eventually, the New Deal.",
        "Yes, very much.",
        "In many ways, you know, there was what I call the anti-monopoly coalition, which really began after the Civil War, involved labor unions, involved small farmers, involved a lot of settlement house workers like Jane Addams, people we now think of as great progressives of the turn of the 20th century."

        "So preparation really matters when it comes to social movements.",
        "And indeed you argue that after the Second World War, the left was, to some degree, a victim of its own success.",
        "Yes, I mean, the New Deal and Harry Truman's Fair Deal, a certain degree Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, were successful in producing a limited welfare state and making labor unions more powerful than they'd ever been before in American society, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, various environmental laws.",
        "In many ways, the great American middle class was built with the help of these originally sort of left-wing social programs and economic programs.",
        "And that began - America's economic health began to wane in the 1970s, as we know, but the left didn't really adjust to that fact.",
        "And you describe it going on to other fights, in fact, not centering on the economy but fights over minority rights, gay rights, the environment, things like that.",
        "And those are very important fights, and they resulted in tremendous victories: civil rights laws, laws about women's rights, sexual harassment laws, the increasing popularity of gay marriage, for example.",

        "Where does that diplomacy stand?",
