        "Well, let me just say I edit a magazine which was founded by the abolitionists, a group Michael Kazin writes so beautifully about in his book, committed to a moral vision of this country's politics and who fought so hard to end slavery.",
        "I believe, like Michael I believe does, that large, sustained, independent movements in organizing are what bring about fundamental change in our country, and it is the case that despite continued mass unemployment, the economic pain in this country, the right has dominated the debate about so many issues and what kind of economy is going to emerge out of the ditch.",
        "But there are progressives, left thinkers, activists, working in this country not only to reset the economic narrative but also are out there organizing, demonstrating for jobs, for a different kind of country.",
        "And part of what is going on, it seems to me, from my stance, is that these efforts have received shamefully little media attention.",
        "And it seems to me that if people don't know, they don't care, and if they don't care, they won't act.",

        "So I think as people - you know, people are gathering October 3 for this movement I write about in The Nation, beginning to emerge as a movement, it's a collective of labor movements, progressive organizations called The American Dream Movement.",
        "I wanted to ask you about your point about - conservatives often complained about shamefully poor coverage in the mainstream media, as well.",
        "And one of the interesting points that Michael Kazin made in his article in the New York Times is that in fact they developed their own media access and resources to rally their cause, including talk radio and magazines of various types and television channels.",

        "But obviously labor unions fighting on the defensive, unlike the 1930s, when the labor unions were fighting on the offensive and were growing, is a very different kind of thing.",
        "But I think one of the things I stress in - both in my book \"\"American Dreamers\"\" and also in the article in the Times last Sunday, is the kind of institutions that people on the left need to build are institutions which really get out to what we call ordinary Americans, average Americans.",
        "You know, I'm struck whenever I go to Iowa, Nebraska, that you turn on AM radio or even most FM radio, and you hear mostly evangelical stations, country stations and religious stations.",
