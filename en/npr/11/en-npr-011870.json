        "And so were parts of - when you look at North Dakota, which is the only state I believe that has a state bank in this country, and which, for that reason, escaped some of the great disaster of this financial crisis, there are - there's a populist tradition.",
        "I hesitate to say that with the great Professor Kazin on the horn here, but - he knows more about it.",
        "But I was listening to your caller, and what interested me, Neal, is that, you know, there is a sense that it's not left-right, but it's top down, and you will be surprised to hear this, but Sarah Palin's speech of a few weeks ago was very interesting to me about corporate cronyism and the sort of elite establishment that seems to have rigged the system against ordinary people in this country.",

        "But I think there is a coalition to be built among people who have called in on your program today who feel terribly frustrated, who feel that they want to give up on our politics as they see it, that Washington is rigged against them, dominated by insiders, corporate money, when in fact it would be a grave mistake to give up on government.",
        "It's time to clean it up and rebuild a fair economy, but that needs to be driven out there by a movement with, as Michael said, a connection to the real-life experiences of people in this country.",
        "I think both callers today in different ways voice a real frustration and, you know, a sense that things aren't working right, that people at the top have too much power, but it's not quite clear what can be done about that.",

        "This is happening in Europe as well, and Japan as well, some other parts of the world.",

        "It wasn't let's have a dialogue about socialism and capitalism.",
        "I mean, Michael's book in many ways touches on this larger point about the need for an animating vision, and in some ways the politics of the left is about shifting, and in this case reshifting the nation's moral compass and once again expanding its sense of political possibilities, unshackling the imagination.",
        "It is very tough to do in a time like this, but it's also very possible because of the crisis we face, as Michael said, not just here but around the world, where there's a sense of the failure and the illegitimacy of governments.",
        "I was struck by a Rasmussen poll of just a few weeks ago where the view of the legitimacy of the government is at its lowest point I think in decades...",
        "Well, Michael Kazin, in your piece you said that may be due to the fact that politicians made promises and not delivered.",

        "Bush and what they see as the liberal administration of Barack Obama both failing to solve the nation's problems.",
        "I mean, the one thing, Michael, in your piece, I was struck, is you do make the right point, that progressives achieved success in the past - whether organizing unions or fighting for equal rights, they seldom bet their future on politicians.",
        "What would our moment have been like in these last two years if President Obama had not been in the White House?",

        "Yeah, I'm right here.",
        "I would say the Wisconsin thing revived my sense about the labor movement, which is what I've been most interested in.",

        "He's a very good labor lawyer in Chicago, yeah.",
        "I just wanted to read an email with an opposite point of view, this from Sean(ph) in Corvallis, Oregon: My simple point of view, having once been a member of a national labor union, is that unions are failing because they've priced themselves out of the market.",
        "The simple fact is that ordinary people and small business cannot afford to hire union labor, and small business is the backbone of the economy.",
        "If the left wants to create a revival, it must return to its basic message of fairness and equity and compassion and reason, and it must leave the unions behind.",

        "Unions clearly are not pure, virtuous institutions all the time, or even perhaps ever.",
        "But unfortunately or fortunately, there's still no institution which can help workers to get some sort of say on the job, some sort of democratic decision-making process set up, and also can, if they're successful, provide a kind of economic insurance policy for them.",
        "So, you know, around the world we have successful economies, very successful economies - in Scandinavia, for example, where there's much stronger unions, much stronger union density, percentage of workers in unions, than there are in this country.",
        "And so if you look at it internationally, usually the problem with an economy is not the unions.",
        "It's usually the kind of development, the kind of industries you have.",
