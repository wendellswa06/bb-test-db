        "Of course, I knew from the news that many Ebola patients die.",
        "And I knew that many of my Ebola patients would die.",
        "And I knew from years of working in hospitals and health care that care providers, doctors, nurses, everyone else, can't function if they breakdown every time a patient dies.",
        "So I knew that I would handle it.",
        "I'd compartmentalize it.",

        "So Martin (ph), a 19-year-old boy, was double negative today.",
        "That is he got the second of two negative Ebola tests separated by 48 hours proving that he was now cured and can go home.",
        "I remembered when he'd come in very sick and also he was tired of living, he said, because his father had died.",
        "And he said, I'm going to die like my father.",
        "And I said, no, you're not going to die Martin, you're going to fight it.",
        "And you're going to drink, and you're going to eat, and you're going to rest, and you're going to live for your father.",
        "And I thought about that while I was laughing and clapping for Martin.",
        "And then I thought about little Martha who had died and Hawa with the skin condition and Aminata (ph) and Ibrahim (ph) and Sori (ph) and Ahmed (ph) who had died.",
        "And I was crying inside my PPE behind my fogged up goggles just crying to myself.",

        "When a confirmed Ebola patient manages to defy the odds and fight the disease, they can be discharged.",
        "At that point, the patient is brought out of the confirmed award inside the hot zone, led into a little shower building that straddles the hot and the cold zones and which is referred to by the staff as the \"\"showers of glory,\"\" quote-unquote.",
        "And they emerge reborn, as it were, from the hot zone into the world.",
        "And the patient is welcomed out of the shower with all kinds of clapping and shouting, music and lots and lots of dancing.",

        "Yes, that's absolutely right.",
        "Kavanaugh has been at the Old Executive Office Building where they've literally set up a hearing room to look exactly like it would look like in the Senate.",

        "Are people critiquing his answers in this process?",

        "And then of course there has been protesting - fake protesting, so to speak - to desensitize him for those kind of distractions because those moments can get caught on camera, and they could define the hearing itself.",
        "There's been a lot of debate over documents from Brett Kavanaugh's time at the White House under President George W.",

        "However, I would disagree with her because there are literally thousands of documents available to review.",
        "The judge has presided over 300 cases, you know, on the D.C.",
        "Circuit Court.",
        "And to claim that they're not able to understand where Kavanaugh's coming from is completely absurd."

        "Well, see; and that's the challenge here, is that the Supreme Court nomination process, confirmation process has become a very partisan process much like a political campaign.",
