        "The other thing is that if there is a risk, I think it's fair to say it would be quite small because by now there's something like five billion people around the world who use cell phones...",
        "Use cell phones, yes.",
        "However, I should say that it is clear that cell phones are a true public health in one sense, and that is the government says that more than 5,000 people are killed every year by distracted drivers in the U.S.",
