        "But at the same time, is it a situation where you have multiple classes of women in Haiti, upper class, middle class, lower class - and my question is whether or not, if this is true, that the women in the upper classes are reaching down or back, as the case may be, to bring up and to assist the women who are struggling.",

        "Ms.",
        "ST. LOT: You know, especially in business.",
        "You see, they do business together, you know, but now you really need to educate both, you know, women from upper class and lower class, so that they can really modernize the way they do politics, the way they do business, and to be able really to build a strong network of businesswomen, of women politician."
