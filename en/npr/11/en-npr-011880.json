        "We're going to hear the argument in favor of rationing today from bioethicist Peter Singer.",
        "In a New York Times article, he argued the case for \"\"Why We Must Ration Health Care.\"\" Tomorrow, we will hear from the other side.",
        "Peter Singer is a professor of bioethics at the Center for Human Values at Princeton, and he joins us from the studios on the campus at Princeton in New Jersey.",
        "Nice to have you on the program with us today.",
        "It's good to be with you.",
        "And you make the argument, essentially, that there is no alternative but to put a price on human life.",
        "Yes, that's the sad reality when you have limited resources and medical care, medical technology, that could be virtually unlimited in costs.",
        "But it's not a new proposal to say that we must ration health care because we already do ration health care.",
        "We already deny health care to tens of millions of people, and in fact, even those who have insurance can't get everything possible.",
        "So the question is really not should we ration health care, but how shall we do it best and most sensibly so that we get the best value for the money we spend.",
        "Well, give us some examples of how you would argue we already ration health care.",
        "Well, I suppose the most obvious one is that the 45 million people who don't have health care insurance don't get health care unless it's an emergency and they go to an emergency room, then they'll get some.",
        "But of course, that's a very inefficient way of giving them health care because very often they're only in an emergency because they didn't go to their doctors earlier and they could have got very simple and effective treatment that would have prevented them getting at the situation.",
        "Where now, when they present themselves at an emergency room, they may need tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of care.",
        "You also cited a really interesting study that looked at people who were in traffic accidents and had no choice about going to the emergency room or not and found that, indeed, those who had health insurance got much better coverage - got much better health care, than those without it.",
        "That's right.",
        "And those without health insurance died more frequently as a result of their accidents, even when controlling for all the other variables.",
        "And what the study showed was that that would have been a very efficient way of saving extra life.",
        "It would have been much cheaper to save extra life there than some of the things that we already do in other cases, where we're spending a lot on drugs, for example, for people in the last year of life who might get a lot of drugs at a vast cost that does very little to extend their life.",
        "So that's just another example of how we're rationing now, but we're doing it in an inefficient way that means that many people die unnecessarily because we're not sort of open and honest enough with ourselves about the rationing.",
        "And to put it in the context, in the same kind of context in which we heard the debate over the mammogram argument in the past week or so, you cite a drug for advanced kidney cancer, a very expensive drug, and a decision made by the British board - they of course have universal health coverage in Britain.",
        "And there's a board that sits and decides, well, are we going to pay for - how much does this drug cost, and is it worth it for us to pay it?",
        "And it doesn't particularly help that this board goes by the sort of Orwellian acronym of NICE."

        "Yes, that's true.",
        "NICE here stands for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, but maybe it's an unfortunate acronym.",
        "But I think, you know, you could still say, well, what the board does is necessary.",
        "And it's actually - it is a nice thing to do because it means that more lives are being saved because, given that we have limited health care resources, and the British government has set aside a certain sum, a very large sum, but a certain sum to give free health care to the entire population, you have to sometimes decide that if a pharmaceutical company brings out a drug that costs a very large amount - in this case the drug was called Sutent, and although it had some uses where it was highly effective, when it was being used for advanced kidney cancer, it wasn't very effective.",
        "It did extend life by some months but at a very high cost.",
        "And the National Institute for Clinical Excellence said that's not good value.",
        "There are better things we can do with the money.",
        "So they recommended that the drug not be prescribed on the National Health Insurance for that particular condition.",
        "And easy to say, as you point out in the article, easy to say, well, this is - generically, this is an easy - not an easy decision to make, but it's one thing to say generically, well, you can save more life by not spending on this drug.",
        "It's another thing when it's your life that's at stake.",
        "Yes, of course, and then you get somebody with the condition who says, well, I could live longer.",
        "I'd like to have this drug.",
        "They go to the media.",
        "The media make a big story about it, and sometimes, of course, the political pressure does get too much.",
        "And the drug in this case was re-evaluated.",
        "Some more evidence was found, suggesting it was more effective than had previously been thought, and it was then allowed to be prescribed for advanced kidney cancer.",
        "I'm not sure, you know, how genuine that evidence was.",
        "Maybe it really was, but I do think it's unfortunate when the media gets hold of a particular case like this and basically says: How can you not save this person's life?",
        "Because what the media�",
        "Well, how can a soulless bunch of government bureaucrats decide not to save this person's life?",
        "That's the point.",
        "Exactly.",
        "That's the way it will be put, of course, yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But what they don't see is this bunch of government bureaucrats, with souls or without, as you may see fit to decide, is actually saying we can save more lives.",
        "It's just that the other lives you can't identify so easily who are the people who are being saved because we don't spend so much money on this one drug.",
        "There are other people who are going to be living longer because they get more treatment or better kind of treatment that's more cost-effective, but we don't know who they are.",
        "So we can't go to the news media and say here's somebody who is alive who would have died if the government had used the money that was used to help them less effectively to save a smaller number of other people.",
        "Yet you argue the case that, essentially, and I think this is - part of it is inarguable - health care resources are finite.",
        "You can argue about where the levels go, but I think everybody has to accept that they are finite.",
        "Not everybody will get every bit of care that is possible.",
        "That's just not in the cards.",
        "So therefore, there is a system of saying we will decide not to make the decision.",
        "We will not call it rationing.",
        "We will just do what the system is that we have now.",
        "And nobody argued that this was rationing in any sense of the word, but that's the way it works out, or we will have to sit and make some very difficult decisions.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
        "I think it's - what - the system that we have in the United States is an attempt to avoid difficult decisions or at least avoid them publicly.",
        "I say that because, of course, the health insurance companies and the HMOs do make decisions about what they'll cover and what not, and they do refuse treatments for patients all the time.",
        "Most people, a lot of people, know that and have some experience with it, but they won't call it rationing.",
        "They'll deny that the treatment is effective, or they'll say that somebody has a pre-existing condition.",
        "They'll find various reasons, and then they will deny them.",
        "But they're making decisions, certainly.",
        "I mean, the other example, of course, is in terms of the cost of prescription drugs in this country.",
        "A survey showed that in the United Kingdom, in Britain, where, you know, there is rationing, when they asked people, have you ever refused to fulfill a prescription for a drug that was medically indicated because of the cost of the prescription?",
        "In Britain, only 13 percent of people said that that had ever been the case.",
        "In the United States, the comparable figure is 54 percent.",
        "So there are far more people who go without medically-indicated drugs here because they can't afford it because, you know, there's various kinds of prescription coverage, but it's not complete.",
        "You have some very high co-payments of a sort that are completely unknown in Britain."

        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that's really important, and I think what Leslie did for his father was no doubt the right thing.",
        "He wasn't just concerned about extending his life as far as possible - his father, I think he said, was 87 - but was concerned to give him good quality of life at that time, and I think we need to take that into account.",

        "I mean, it may be, but I think that's the sort of choice that doctors and patients have to come together and think about.",
