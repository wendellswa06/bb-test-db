        "Well, just on the last point, of course, U.S.",
        "government agencies, like the Department of Transportation, have to put a figure, a dollar figure, on the value of a life because they have to decide how much to spend to, let's say, rebuild a road where there's been an accident black spot, and they can predict that over the next 10 years, let's say, three people will be killed unless they change it.",
        "And currently, the Department of Transportation's figure is much higher than that one million that your caller mentioned.",
        "It's actually about $5 million to spend to save a life, and often I think we could save many more lives if we covered the uninsured.",
        "We hope to hear from the other side tomorrow on why we should not have health care rationing.",
        "I hope you'll join us then.",

        "I'm not a maverick, the general said this morning.",
        "I'm a soldier and I want to have an army in five or ten years' time.",
        "Don't let's break the army, he said, on Iraq.",
        "But your caller was also making a philosophical point, I suppose, when he said, well, why shouldn't we use ability to pay in this area, as we do with many of the other things that we buy.",
        "I do think that health care is different, partly because it's a matter of life and death.",
        "And I think a humane, compassionate society, especially one that's as wealthy as this society, may feel that whether someone lives or dies should not depend on things like how much money they've been able to earn during their life or where they are now.",
        "The other thing is that we perhaps, you know, health care is special in that you don't buy it regularly and then say oh, this wasn't worth it, I think I won't buy that again, which might happen with many of the things that we spend money on.",
        "You only get the one chance to make your decision.",
        "And I don't think we want to really hold it against people to the extent of saying that they've got to die if they've made the wrong decision just once on that occasion.",
        "Yet you also, in your proposal, say yes, there should be a public system, a universal system that covers everybody, that's called - that makes decisions on the basis of these quality-of-life years and those sorts of calculations, but you also say it has to be in addition to a private system, so those people who want to opt out of it and can afford to opt out of it can do so.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "I would not stop anybody from buying more insurance than the public option would provide.",
        "I would provide the public option, or I call it Medicare for all, I would provide that, but that would provide a, if you like, a decent basic minimum of health care for everyone.",
        "And if you want something with all the bells and whistles that will not have the inevitable limits that a public scheme will, then you should be free to pay for that, and there will be insurance companies that offer that at a market price.",
        "That's a system that I'm quite familiar with because I am from Australia, and Australia has exactly this kind of system.",
        "It has universal health coverage, but it does allow you to privately insure on top of that coverage.",
        "And many people do, but also, you know, many people are quite content with the public coverage.",

        "No, my comment was: I would assume that the boards that the government would use would be similar to the panels that insurance companies use already in making the decisions, in making, you know, rational decisions about what medicines and what procedures to cover.",
        "So I don't see that there would be much of a difference, and I certainly don't think the comparison to - I think they call it a death panel - is fair.",
        "So anyway, that's what my thoughts are, that it would be using similar processes to what's already in place with the insurance companies, so - and obviously, they do make rather sharp decisions about what is and isn't covered and what's, you know, what's viable.",
        "It's interesting, Matt, you say - I take your point about the death panel, but nevertheless, if you're - let's say that board in Britain had made the other decision - as Peter Singer said, they went back and re-evaluated and decided to authorize the drug - but nevertheless, if they make a decision saying all right, we're not going to pay for this.",
        "We're not saying you can't pay for it on your own, but we're not going to pay for this.",
        "And the person is a normal person who doesn't have the $5,000 per treatment or something to pay for it, isn't that the same as saying, okay, I'm going to die very quickly?",
        "Well, yeah, it would be, but I mean, again, this is nothing different than what the insurance companies are already doing and the way that they're already operating because there are certain things they won't cover.",
        "There are certain procedures they won't cover.",

        "They're not visible.",

        "Right.",
        "Look, I haven't seen figures, although I do know that on the smoking one, curiously enough, some economists have done figures.",
        "And they have said that smokers don't really cost us - it may sound strange, but the reason is that they get lung cancer and they die reasonably quickly from that, often about the time of life when they're about to retire.",
        "So they might die when they're around 60, 65.",
        "And they've been paying their insurance, paying their Social Security as well.",

        "Where exactly you draw the line between something that obviously is very negative to your health, like smoking, and other things that are less obvious, like not exercising enough?",
        "It's going to be pretty hard to tell.",

        "We're talking with Peter Singer in the first of a series of conversations about the rationing of health care.",

        "Yes.",
        "That's right.",
        "And this certainly was perhaps the most controversial thing that I said in the piece because we were talking earlier about quality of life.",
        "And one of the reasons why, I think, we should spend money on helping people with disabilities to get over their disabilities, to get through it, to cure them or for that matter to try to prevent people having disabilities is because it's an improvement in the quality of life.",
        "If somebody is in a wheelchair and then they can walk again, most people would think that's an improvement in the quality of life.",
        "But the flipside of that is that if people have an incurable disability and it's a question of saving their life or saving the life of someone who has no disability, we would have to say that you're saving more life of good quality if you save the life of the person with no disability, assuming they have, let's say, the same life expectancy, 20 years each, for instance.",
        "So that would suggest that when it comes to saving life, we get better value for our resources by saving the lives of people without disability.",
        "And that's a disturbing implication I readily admit because we don't like to think that we're going to give second-class treatment to people with disabilities.",
        "They're already worse off, and we sometimes feel, well, we should even do more for them to improve their condition.",
        "But, on the other hand that, you know, when you get to an extreme probably people would agree, if somebody is not conscious, even if they're in a persistent vegetative state, most people would agree it's not worth spending money to prolong their life.",
        "So there is this question: So where do you draw the line?",
        "How serious does a disability have to be for us to say that somebody�",
        "How do you define the quality, yeah?",
        "Yes.",

        "I guess we're all talking about all these different options and programs and nobody has put a true cost figure to this thing.",
        "And if I'm happy with my insurance that I pay for and the company somewhat subsidizes, and they talk about options that the states can opt out at the public option, I still want to know who's paying for all of this and are my taxes going to go up.",
        "So that's my biggest concern.",
        "Well, we haven't seen the bill that would emerge from the Senate much less a bill that would emerge from a House/Senate conference committee.",
        "So it's a little difficult to put an accurate number on that, Greg.",
        "But, indeed, I think that's a question that a lot of people are asking.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I guess, the concern is, is we're already talking about options and the money's got to come from somewhere.",
        "And if I'm already paying for some, I think the responsibility ought to be on the patient for paying for it as much as they can.",
        "And I hope that - I hope we all don't see our tax rates going up because of all these options that people are talking about.",
