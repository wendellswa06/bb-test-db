        "After just two months in the top job, General Sir Richard Dannatt seemed surprised this morning that his interview with The Daily Mail had drawn so much attention.",
        "In the interview he was quoted as saying that British troops should be withdrawn soon from Iraq and that their presence there was making the situation worse.",
        "The Daily Mail, which is known for its frequent opposition to the government, has refused to issue the transcript of its original interview with the General, who spent the morning telling reporters he'd been quoted out of context.",
        "Given that we've been in Iraq for some three and a half years now, quite a long length of time, and that's put a fair pressure on ourselves as indeed it's putting a pressure on our coalition partners, then when the mission is substantially done, we should leave.",

        "Dannatt added that Britain stands shoulder to shoulder with the United States and that U.S.",
        "and British views on the timing of withdrawal is the same.",
        "Though Britain's Labor Party government cannot have pleased with this morning's headlines former Assistant Chief of the Defense Staff, Lord Garden, said troops in Iraq would probably welcome them.",
        "There is great concern among the troops today that the senior management of the three services have become politicians rather than being leaders and representatives of their services, and it's very clear that Richard Dannatt feels that and wants to be seen as standing up for his soldiers and making sure they're not put in impossible positions.",
        "Prime Minister Tony Blair said he fully supported General Dannatt, though he noticeably said he agreed with the interviews the general gave this morning and not the original one he gave The Daily Mail.",
        "If you read the transcript of the interview on the radio this morning and the television, he sets in proper context exactly what he was saying.",
        "What he is saying about wanting the British forces out of Iraq is precisely the same as we're all saying.",

        "So, do you think at this point that we've hit the bottom or do you think, as Dean Foust is saying, that there's another 15 to 20 percent to go?",
        "Well, as a producer of the Case-Shiller - S&P/Case Shiller Indices, I'm not going to forecast quantitatively, but I can point out that there is a futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and it is predicting for the typical city that's traded which are big cities about a 15 percent decline bottoming out in around two years from now.",
        "How do they know that - I mean when it seems no one knows anything about how much home values are?",
        "Well, that is a market price - although I have to say it's not a very thick market and so we shouldn't take it as God's truth and markets can certainly be wrong and so I don't mean to make too much of it.",

        "If it goes down another 15, 20 percent that would bring it down about 15 percent - 50 percent in real terms from the peak in some of the most volatile markets.",

        "What can you even say that gives us some concrete knowledge about the asset, the biggest asset, that most people own, if they own a home, what it's worth and therefore their financial position is?",
        "I mean is it just hands in the air, who knows?",
        "Let me go to you, Dean Foust?",
        "It's a little bit hands in the air, who knows.",

        "You raised your family, you paid it down over 30 years and you had something worth of value and not just this giant - you know homes became trading commodities or like a bubble stock.",
        "And I think we're going to go back to that area where you may see three percent appreciation every year or something along the lines of inflation.",
        "You'll get a modest return.",
        "What do you think, Mr. Shiller?",
        "Well, we have be through a speculative bubble and that caused a rapid and unprecedented increase in the home values in this country because I think of investor enthusiasm.",
        "It was a 'get rich quick' scheme.",
        "Ultimately the value of homes should be something in line with construction costs - without too big a land component.",
        "And that suggests that the kind of home prices that we've had for the last 50 years are kind of about right, and we've gone way above that.",
        "Fortunately the correction is well - it had moved along quite far.",
        "And so we've entered a kind of gray area where it's not so clear where we're going from here."
