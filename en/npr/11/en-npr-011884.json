        "All right, story number one.",
        "Donna Brazile, Kweisi Mfume, the former head of the NAACP, held a press conference this week in which he announced, admitted, if you will, that he had an affair with a woman while working at the NAACP, someone who was on the NAACP staff.",
        "As you know, there have been charges that he was practicing favoritism to women on the staff on the basis of relationships with him, and he wanted to run for, still is in the running, the replacement for Paul Sarbanes as US senator from the state of Maryland.",
        "Is this admission now going to absolutely end his ambition to be a US senator?",
        "I think it's going to cause his campaign tremendous problems in raising money and being able to, you know, get his message out.",
        "Already, these allegations have been in the media for three weeks.",
        "He took time out of his schedule on Monday to have a major news conference.",
        "He laid everything on the table.",
        "But, you know what?",
        "There are now more stories coming out as a result of Mr. Mfume's admission that he had relations with one of the females on his staff.",
        "So I think that if he's unable to raise money, and get his message out, then I think he has to reconsider.",
        "Robert Traynham now, the other side of the story is Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele, a Republican, has been considering making a run for the same Senate seat.",
        "Now that we see Mfume's troubles seemingly mounting, does it make it more likely...",
        "Yes.",
        "...or less likely for Steele to get in?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This is more likely.",
        "Listen, Juan, this is almost like the perfect storm, if you will, and the reason why it's because you have a very vulnerable individual right now, i.e., Kweisi Mfume, who, quote, unquote, resigned under a cloud, if you will, at the NAACP, who now is facing these allegations.",
        "And so it certainly gives people pause as to whether or not they want to give to this campaign, number one, but also, number two, it muddies the water, if you will, for all the other individuals out there that are thinking about running for that seat.",
        "So if I'm Michael Steele right now, I'm thinking to myself `This is a very vulnerable person right now.",
        "I think I should run as an African-American conservative.'",
        "Well, I'm thinking that Ben Cardin, another Democrat from Maryland, looks to be positioned to take advantage of this, but I'm also wondering what about the African-American congressman from that area?",
        "Here, I'm thinking about Elijah Cummings...",
        "That's correct.",
        "...and Albert Wynn.",
        "That is correct.",
        "Elijah Cummings is from Baltimore.",
        "He's very well-liked, and he's well-positioned.",
        "In 2002, he was the chair of the Democratic Party campaign in the state so he has tremendous name recognition and he can raise the kind of money you need to win a senatorial race.",
        "Albert Wynn, who is from the Washington suburb PG, kind of the fastest-growing colony in the state..."

        "That's correct.",
        "And he's also on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee.",
        "He's also in a position to raise the kind of money you need to compete.",
        "Look, Maryland is still a reliable Democratic state, in my opinion, although there was a little blurb in 2002 that elected Bob Ehrlich and Michael Steele but I do believe that Democrats have a shot at winning this seat, keeping this seat in the Democratic column, but we got to make sure that we put forward a candidate who can attract votes from across the state.",
        "There's no question about it that this is Michael Steele's to lose, and the reason why is because you have an enormous ground game, if you will, from the White House.",
        "You have a White House that's very, very hungry to pick up even more seats in the Senate.",
        "And you have a White House that's very, very hungry--or a Republican Party, if you will, that's very, very hungry to have an African-American among its ranks in the United States Senate.",
        "Second topic: The Congressional Black Caucus and the Service Employees International Union have been in a sparring match about Wal-Mart, that SEIU wants the Congressional Black Caucus to stand up to Wal-Mart, but what we're hearing from Elijah Cummings and other members of the Caucus is `No.",
        "Why, Donna?",
        "Well, first of all, I think members of the Black Caucus are deeply aware of the problems at Wal-Mart, the fact that Wal-Mart pays their workers very low wages, they're also concerned that Wal-Mart does not provide the health-care benefits to its workers.",
        "The Congressional Black Caucus received a letter from the Service Employees International Union calling upon the members of the Caucus not to meet with Wal-Mart, not to allow Wal-Mart to host their events, and many--some members of the CBC took offense at SEIU's letter.",
        "They thought it was offensive, they thought that SEIU should have called members of the Black Caucus and talked to them individually and privately, and they shot off a letter back to SEIU, basically, saying, `Butt out.",
        "We know how to conduct our politics.'",
        "Well, wait a second now.",
        "We know that over the last few years now, what we see is the Congressional Black Caucus becoming less predictable in terms of its voting record, but, on Wal-Mart, I think, the SEIU figured `You're gonna back us,' a strong union that always has backed the Congressional Back Caucus.",
        "So many members of SEIU are minorities, black people, so how can the Caucus separate from a key constituency?",
        "I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment and civil liberties but you have no civil liberties if you are dead.",
        "Well, the Caucus believed that it has an open policy.",
        "Remember the mantra of the Congressional Black Caucus has always been: `We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.",
        "And they want to hear from a Wal-Mart.",
        "Of course, Wal-Mart attended their political action committee function and Wal-Mart gave them a check.",
        "Robert Traynham, so looking at it from the Republican perspective, a sellout?",
        "No.",
        "Look, this--there's always room for improvement, and if you take a look at Wal-Mart's business plans, you will see, and everyone knows this, is that most of the Wal-Marts are in rural lower-middle-class areas, if you will, and take a look at where most Congressional Black Caucus members represent.",
        "They mostly proportionately represent those areas, and so, I think, Donna's right.",
        "I think the Congressional Black Caucus, for one time, I might add, is doing the right thing, which is to--having an open door policy."

        "So your thinking is that, really, Congressional Black Caucus is interested in seeing Wal-Marts locate even in areas with larger populations of blacks, to come to downtown areas.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There's no question about it.",
        "The last time I checked, Wal-Mart was still the largest corporation that employed African-Americans, and, obviously, that is a key constituency for the Congressional Black Caucus.",

        "Let's start with that hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee as we just heard, the two top U.S.",
        "generals say Iraq may be headed toward civil war.",
        "Is the administration now officially lowering expectations?",
        "I think so, Madeleine.",
        "You heard a week ago, when Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki was visiting the White House, President Bush say the situation there is terrible, and I think what you're hearing from Peter Pace, who is of course the joint chiefs of staff chairman, and John Abizaid, commander of U.S.",
        "military operations to the Middle East, is that they're saying, listen, we're on the verge of that, and you have to now look forward in terms of what's possible."

        "How do we handle this?",
        "It's not about terrorist insurgents coming in, it's about people - Kurds, Shiite, Sunni - fighting each other and putting Americans in the middle of the crossfire.",
        "Lawmakers are going home to their districts for the August recess.",
        "What are they expecting to hear from constituents on Iraq and on other matters?",
        "Well, I think they're expecting to hear a lot of discontent on Iraq.",
        "Most Americans, according to polls now, think that Iraq is not going to be a success, and of course you know, Madeleine, that for the longest time people have been unhappy with the conduct of the war by the Bush administration.",
        "So there's criticism of the Bush administration's handling of the war, criticism going all the way back to the lack of weapons of mass destruction, and even as we've gone through elections in Iraq, the writing of a constitution, Americans just have had moments of increased faith but overall think that we're just going in the wrong direction there.",
        "So I think they're going to hear lots of complaints about that.",
        "Secondly, they'll hear support for Israel, but at the same time concern that the United States has to do a better job of being a free hand, not necessarily so aligned with Israel, but in position to negotiate a possible settlement, even to help in terms of securing some security for Israel as it faces Hezbollah.",
        "And the Iraq War is the main issue in the Connecticut race, and Senator Joe Lieberman there facing a tense primary challenge, that election on Tuesday.",
        "Just how much trouble is Lieberman in?",
        "Well, according to the polls that we have seen just recently, he's still 13 points behind - and today is Friday?",
        "And the election is Tuesday.",
        "That's not good news for Joe Lieberman.",
        "It does come as something of a surprise.",
        "Bill Clinton was in there for him.",
        "But you think about the reaction.",
        "We were just talking about that hearing that hearing that took place in Washington, and you know, Hillary Clinton, the Senator from New York later came out and called for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to resign and said she had lost confidence in him.",
        "I think what you're seeing is the base of the party and their discontent with that Iraq issue, the issue that politicians are going to be hearing about as they go home for recess, is having impact on the political process, it's threatening Joe Lieberman's future, and I think the Democratic base, the left-wing base of the party is saying it's time to hold people accountable, and where they hold them accountable may be at the polls.",
        "Well, if Lieberman does lose the primary on Tuesday, how successful might he be as an independent, which is what he said he might do if he loses the primary?",
        "Well, then I think lots of Republicans might vote for him.",
        "Of course, you have a Republican candidate who's invested much money there, but I think lots of Republicans would say Joe Lieberman has served well in the Senate.",
        "He's been certainly delivering for the constituents in Connecticut, and they don't have the strong grievance over Iraq.",
        "So he might actually come back and surprise Ned Lamont in the general election after losing in the Democratic primary.",
        "Then the question would be does he remain a Democrat or does he become an independent or Republican as he begins another term in the Senate?"
