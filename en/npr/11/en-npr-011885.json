        "But all of this adulation has got to be something for him.",
        "I mean, it's a new role for him to have everybody fawning over him.",
        "And that's got to appeal to a politician.",
        "Well, you write about, in Slate this week, his authenticity conundrum.",
        "He does - his appeal now is partly that he seems so authentic and real and genuine.",
        "But suppose he becomes a candidate?",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "A lot of what you hear from people who are talking about Al Gore in such glowing tones today is that they talk about the new Al Gore, how he's authentic and full of energy and not holding anything back.",
        "But what happens is that once you become a candidate, you have to trim your sails a little bit.",
        "The additional problem for Al Gore is that at the center of his previous candidacy was this question of does he know his own mind?",
        "And that is something voters take into account.",
        "And it seems to me that the coverage of Al Gore's new candidacy, should he decide to run, will be sort of laden with that question at every turn.",
