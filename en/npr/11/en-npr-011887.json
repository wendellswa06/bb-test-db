        "Sarfraz said, I'm going to write a memoir about Bruce Springsteen.",

        "But without Bruce and Bruce's music, forget it.",
        "We don't have anything.",
        "We need his blessing.",
        "And then, luckily for us, in 2010, Bruce came to London for the premiere of his film \"\"The Promise.\"\" I took Sarfraz as my plus one, and we both stood on the carpet like fans...",
        "(Laughter).",
        "...You know, with cameras, waiting for him to come by.",
        "And as he approached, we got very nervous and very jittery.",
        "And Sarfraz - Springsteen recognizes him.",
        "And so Springsteen walked over and said to him, hey, man.",
        "I read your book.",
        "It's really beautiful.",
        "And Sarfraz is, like, oh, my God.",
        "Wow.",
        "You read my book.",

        "And that's how the movie happened.",
        "But why did it take so long?",
        "That was nine years ago.",
        "Timing is everything.",
        "And I was worried about picking up \"\"Blinded By The Light\"\" again because I was worried about the overlap with \"\"Bend It Like Beckham.\"\" And then Brexit dropped in Britain.",
        "I was just horrified and shocked at the amount of xenophobia that just hit us.",
        "And ordinary, middle-aged people who felt that they could get on buses or be in public places who would quite happily abuse people of color - like, elderly black women who'd worked in our hospitals all their lives - you know, they felt that they could just start abusing them racially.",
        "Oh.",
        "So I said, I've got to do something about this.",
        "I've got to use my voice.",

        "Well, there are some very tough scenes in it.",
        "I don't want to give it all away, but one that I'll mention is where this group of little white boys urinate through the mail slot of a Pakistani family's house.",
        "It's very disgusting.",
        "But the film overall is joyous.",
        "I mean, it's the joy of discovering an artist who speaks to you.",
        "Yes.",

        "Well, in itself, writing is not cinematic.",
        "So I worked on how to make words not only cinematic but emotional.",
        "So when the words do pop up, it's me making sure that you make the connection with what this American young man was writing in New Jersey in the '70s and early '80s and feeling trapped and wanting to get out - all that completely fits the life of this 16-year-old Pakistani kid a decade later.",

        "Put those two together, and as a filmmaker, what I have to try and do is be more transgressive, is be bigger than Bruce.",
        "So for me, this film is an antidote to what I see around me in many countries where people are leading voices of hate.",

        "There's been sort of a dance going on because members of the committee were only fully briefed on this program only yesterday so many of them actually know more now in their own minds than they can say publicly.",
        "And I think they've sort of been tempting General Hayden, trying to get him to confirm recent reports about the size of the program but he hasn't bit as it were.",
        "He's been very cautious about what he says, he's really only confirming what the President has already confirmed, which is that it's limited to al Qaeda members and international phone calls but he hasn't really commented on recent allegations in USA Today that the agency is collecting millions of phone records from average Americans.",
        "But we have learned that General Hayden really was the architect of this program.",
        "He was asked what else can you do, and he came up with this idea and it was, it was reinforced today how much he was deeply involved both in the program and with what he says were the civil liberties check lists that he came up with that is supposed to have insured and still is supposed to insure that average Americans, that innocent people, aren't surveilled that just al Qaeda.",
        "And he, and he defended the program's legality I understand?",
        "Yes he did.",
        "And, you know, he said that he was reassured by the General Counsel and the NSA he really had no doubts about that that they were all persuaded by the same argument to the Department of Justice as used which is that the President has under Article II of the Constitution the authority to do this kind of eavesdropping in order to protect national security.",
        "Well what else are senators asking him?",
        "Well as, you know, there's a lot of tension in the intelligence community between the defense aspects of intelligence and between the civilian aspects.",
        "General Hayden has played down that tension.",
        "He said, you know, we can sort of work this out.",
        "He's played down tensions that he has reportedly had with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and he's basically said that we are going to work out all these things.",
        "That he wants to reinforce the CIA's role as the center of human intelligence throughout the intelligence community.",
        "He also talked a little bit about the mistakes made in the intelligence community regarding the War in Iraq said we did take too much for granted regarding weapons of mass destruction there and basically we can't do that again."
