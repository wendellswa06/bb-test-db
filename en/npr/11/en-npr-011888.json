        "He really clearly wants this job; he's saying the kinds of things that I would say if I was applying for a job that I really wanted.",
        "He's not combative, he's assuring him, he's assuring the senators that he can work out the problems in this agency, which we have to remember the CIA has faced a huge amount of criticism in recent years, but he's eager to dive into an agency which has had trouble, which has been sort of demoted in its priorities and says, you know, I, I can do it.",

        "Here to talk about all this is Slate's legal analyst, Dahlia Lithwick, and Dahlia, first, the Supreme Court agreed today to hear about the federal ban on the procedure opponents call partial birth abortion.",
        "How is that significant?",
        "Well, it's very significant Madeleine, because essentially this is a federal law that has never gone into effect.",
        "It was passed by Congress after the Supreme Court struck down a very similar Nebraska ban in 2000.",
        "This is very substantially the same, and it does not contain, the federal ban, an exception for the health of the mother.",
        "That's why every court that's looked at it subsequently has said it's still unconstitutional.",
        "So the fact that the court went ahead and granted a cert and agreed to hear it means that even though by all old measures of what used to be unconstitutional, it's still unconstitutional, the court agreed to hear it.",
        "It leads, certainly, critics to believe that the difference is not in the law but in the composition of the court, that now that Judge Alito is on the court and Sandra Day O'Connor is off, the ground has shifted.",

        "So it is possible that the court could reverse itself.",

        "Its willingness to hear it again certainly raises questions about what's different.",

        "The government sought to regulate it under the Controlled Substances Act, and the members of a church said, no, because it burdens our religious rights under RFRA, the Religious Freedom Registration Act.",
        "They use this tea in a four-hour ritual to connect with God.",
        "And the Supreme Court unanimously, no, Alito did not vote in this case, but otherwise unanimously agreed that, at least for purposes of a preliminary injunction that had been granted to the church members, yes, in fact, the government claims are wrong, and that their desire to sort of uniformly apply the drug laws is not, in fact, genuine, because there's already an exception under RFRA for the use of peyote.",
