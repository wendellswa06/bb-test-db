        "But you've got a fundamental divide in here because - my colleague Greg Sargent at The Washington Post wrote about this - the four - there were 43 Democrats who took Republican seats; they lost three, so for a net of 40 gains.",
        "Those 43 seats are way more conservative and way more Republican than all the other seats held by Democrats.",
        "This creates a lot of tension, necessarily.",
        "Sure.",
        "David, this temporary peace that E.J.",
        "talks about, do you think it'll hold more than temporarily?",
        "Not really.",
        "I do think it's a fundamental difference.",
        "I see it more generational.",
        "There's obviously a moderate to more left difference, but it's the younger and the old.",
        "If you're older, like Nancy Pelosi, you could be pretty left, but you're basically a liberal of the John Stuart Mill variety - that you want to work within the system; you think compromise is inevitable; you believe in political dialogue, incremental reform.",
        "You're going to take what you can get, given the realities.",
        "If you're younger, you're much more likely to think, we need transformational change right away.",
        "We do want to work within the system; we want to blow up the system.",
        "And those are just not only different policy positions; they're not - they're different approaches to politics.",
        "And I do think that generational reality's in Congress and within the Democratic electorate.",
        "Well, weigh on the other side of the political spectrum.",
        "I want to get it.",
        "What could be Trump's strategy here?",
        "Because, in a way, the more he attacks the so-called squad, those four Congresswomen of color, and gets the squad and the rest of the other Democrats to attack him back, the conversation is no longer about actual issues anymore, like health care, the economy, right?",
        "It becomes this totally partisan conversation.",
        "Does that work to Trump's advantage, you think, David?",
        "Well, first, I always want to say the moral position before we get to the political one.",
        "What he did is immoral, and what he did was racist, and that should just be our lead.",
        "I do think he will - he wants this election not to be about health care but to be about America - what kind of country is America?",
        "And he tells a story about America which is slightly xenophobic, that the good-hearted people of the heartland are under attack from elites, from aliens, from Mexicans, from Muslims.",
        "And that's the story he won on last time, and he wants to tell that story, and he wants America to be that kind of place that looks backward to the past in nostalgia.",
        "And it'll be interesting to see what the Democrats say - no, here's our version of America.",
        "Our version is pluralism, it's diversity, it's forward-looking - if they can tell that kind of story.",
        "And then we'll have it out.",
        "E.J.?",
        "I think it's interesting that President Trump, he lied in the process, but he said that he really didn't like the send-her-back cheer at his rally.",
        "That's correct, yeah."

        "And what he lied about is he said, well, I talked really quickly to try to calm them down; in fact, he just sat there and enjoyed the flow of the screaming.",
        "Why did he pull back from that?",
        "I think he pulled back from that because, while a lot of people are saying he wins an election if we are divided by race and he's trying to do all this, turns out it might be a terrible strategy.",
        "There was one poll that showed 65% of Americans thought that this - all these statements were racist, outright, that very big majorities were saying what Trump did here is wrong.",
        "And so he can rally his base all he wants; if he alienates that big of chunk of the country, he's got a problem.",

        "I want to return to a point that David made about this being a conversation about how to write the story of America.",
        "One thing that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week said - he said, look - you know, Trump is not a racist.",
        "What's happening this week is instead just a conversation about socialism, about what we want America to be like.",
        "How do you read McConnell's remarks there, that this is actually just a larger conversation about what is the story of America?",
        "I think it was a terrible evasion because he was asked about his wife, who is, I believe, an immigrant herself, or her - the child of immigrants.",

        "No, it wasn't about socialism.",
        "That's where they want to move this story to create an alibi for Trump.",
        "And as this conversation has been heating up this week, I'm just curious what you both think - where does that leave moderate voters?",
        "Was there a way for either party to engage them or were they kind of ignored this week, David?",
        "Yeah, Iceland's really nice this time of year."

        "And in one sense, what he said about it being divisive, it seems to be prophetic, at least in terms of today.",

        "There are reports that at this moment it's getting a lot messier out there, that people are very angry.",

        "There were a few Republicans, very few Republicans, who defected from their party, but all the Democrats voted against it, that this is just seen as, you know, literally an attack on unions and on the political authority here in Michigan of the Democratic Party.",
        "And all of this blew up since election day.",
        "Yeah, that - that unions, after suffering through a couple of years of what they saw as a series of anti-labor legislation in our Republican-dominant legislature, and we have a Republican governor who used to be a businessperson, felt like they wanted to do something.",
        "And so what they came up with was Proposal 2, a ballot question that would enshrine collective bargaining rights in the state constitution (clears throat) - excuse me."

        "I was just going to say, in particular because the next legislature, the one that was elected on November 6, may not be as positive towards right to work.",
        "Well, it will not be.",
        "Right now the Republicans have very substantial majorities in the House and the Senate.",
        "They will still have majorities next year, but in the statehouse there will be five fewer Republicans because they kind of took a thumping here on election day, not to mention because Michigan is a term-limit state that there are a few Republicans who are on their way out the door who can cast these votes without really worrying about what it means for their political future.",

        "They say some of them may be targeted for recall.",
        "There's also talk of trying to recall Governor Rick Snyder, although I should point out that Michigan's laws for recalling statewide officials raise the bar a little bit higher than what existed in Wisconsin, where, you know, unions and Democrats tried to recall Governor Scott Walker.",
        "In the meantime, this seems to be set to Issue A in Michigan for the foreseeable future.",
        "This certainly seems to have catapulted to the top of the pile in terms of political issues, yes.",
