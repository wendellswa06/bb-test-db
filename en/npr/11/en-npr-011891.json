        "Plan Colombia is a $4 billion effort to reduce the flow of drugs from Colombia, the world's biggest producer of cocaine.",
        "In fact, the amount of drugs seized by Colombian authorities has risen sharply; so has the number of suspects extradited to the United States.",
        "The big drug cartels, such as Pablo Escobar's Cali cartel, are a thing of the past.",
        "But not everyone agrees that we are, indeed, wining the war on drugs.",
        "Francisco Thoumi is a professor at Rosario University in Colombia's capital, Bogota.",
        "He points to one statistic: the price of a kilogram of cocaine on the streets of American cities.",
        "The law of supply and demand would suggest that if fewer drugs are in circulation, then the price would go up, but it has not.",
        "It basically suggests that somehow we have not achieved too many results or we are just treading water.",
        "The big cartels, he says, have splintered into hundreds of tiny cartels, or cartelitos.",
        "They grow coca on small plots of land, difficult to spot by satellite.",
        "The US and Colombian governments are up against not only well-armed narco traffickers but, also, the laws of economics, or cocanomics.",
        "A Colombian farmer earns $2 an acre if he grows bananas, $700 an acre for coca.",
        "Choosing coca, says Adam Isaacson of the Center for International Policy, is simply a rational survival choice, especially for people living in Colombia's most isolated towns and villages, places like Ramolinos(ph).",
        "Not only are they off of the power and water in all other grids, they're even off the financial grid.",
        "There isn't even currency.",
        "The national currency doesn't reach Ramolinos.",
        "The way people pay for things is by bringing little crumbs and rocks of coca paste, the basic paste that the peasants make from coca leaves, and they weigh them in scales on the counters of the stores.",
        "You are completely off the grid.",
        "Getting villages like Ramolinos on the grid and out of the grip of the narco traffickers is one part of Plan Colombia, but most of the US money, some 80 percent, goes towards military operations.",
        "At times, in fact, the war on drugs and the war on terrorism seem like one and the same.",
        "Colombian guerrilla groups, like FARC, are both involved in the drug trade and on the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations.",
        "Again, Adam Isaacson.",
        "And so it was a very, rather, smooth move to go beyond the limitation on just the narcotics mission in Colombia to allow all of the dozens of helicopters and thousands and thousands of military trainees, other weapons that we'd given for the drug war to begin to be used for this larger mission.",
        "US officials defend the scope of Plan Colombia.",
        "As long as Colombia's terrorist groups are involved in the drug trade, they say, you can't fight one without fighting the other.",
        "Plan Colombia is due to expire at the end of this year.",
        "Both US and Colombian officials want to extend the program.",

        "Good to have you with us today.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "And what difference has the right to work legislation that passed Indiana, what, 10 months ago, made there?",
        "Yeah, it really is - I think it's fair to say that it's too soon to really tell a difference, Neal, on any impacts.",
        "Certainly organized labor has contended, as they are in Michigan, that right to work will mean lower wages, lower benefits, decrease in safety, those types of things.",
        "If in fact those things are to happen, it would take time for that to play out.",
        "I will say that economic developers around the state are talking about an increased number of calls from companies who say with right to work now on the books here in Indiana, that that has opened the state to be in the running for economic development investments.",

        "Economic developers have always said, look, this will give you state more at-bats, if you will, to compete for economic development projects.",
        "Those thoughtful people who really think about this issue, and those who are in the business, know that right to work is not the issue, typically, that a company would choose to locate in a particular state, but one of several factors that could potentially come into play.",
        "Sure, transportation for their particular product and the cost of living for their workers.",
        "Yeah, absolutely, it's a whole host of things.",

        "But in those states that are competitive - and I think you can put Indiana certainly in that ballpark - right to work, in terms of supporters they say right to work gives Indiana a leg up on some projects.",
        "President Obama said yesterday outside of Detroit, in advance of today's vote in Lansing, he said that he doesn't see these laws as being about economics at all but rather about politics.",
        "I wonder how that's playing out in Indiana.",
        "Well, certainly a very, very volatile political issue, and I heard the previous report from Michigan talking about the governor there not wanting to pursue this because it is such a divisive issue.",
        "Interesting that Governor Mitch Daniels, who will soon be ending his second term and leaving to become the president of Perdue University, he basically had the same, you know, commentary for the last several sessions, saying, hey - he did not want this to happen because he knew how volatile, how very contentious the issue certainly is.",
        "And that was the case this year at the Indiana statehouse, very similar scenes to what you're seeing in Michigan, what you saw in Wisconsin.",
        "I know that was a different deal with public sector unions, but thousands and thousands of union workers and supporters rallying and converging on the statehouse here in Indiana.",
        "And in fact, from a political standpoint, it even prompted House Democrats here to walk out.",
        "They walked out, drove across the state lines to Illinois and really for several weeks held the legislature for the most part pretty much at a standstill.",
        "Has there been any impact, well, since - in the election that has occurred since then?",
        "Actually, Republican - the Republican majorities in Indiana have actually strengthened, and now there is a so-called supermajority in both the House and the Senate here in the Indiana legislature, and Governor Mitch Daniels, who will be leaving, a Republican; the governor-elect, Mike Pence, is also a Republican.",
        "So actually in terms of - the majority Republicans feel, I think, perhaps a bit emboldened because their majorities have actually increased in this last election.",
        "And as you say, it's too early to gauge the effect on wages, or working conditions for that matter.",
        "It's a little too early to gauge whether new businesses will actually move to Indiana.",

        "Well, that's - not specifically in Indiana, but I think anecdotally and generally you can talk about the decrease in union membership in states like Indiana, just a function in large part of traditional American manufacturing going away.",
        "A community like Anderson, Indiana, which at one time had some 25,000 General Motors workers, today they have zero.",
        "And you look at other auto industry towns around the state that have shrunk in size.",
        "That alone has made for a reduction in union membership, and that's why - one of the reasons, I think, why this is such a very volatile issue, because organized labor looks at this and looks at a state in the Midwest, in the Rust Belt, the so-called Rust Belt, of Indiana, becoming right to work.",
        "Now with Michigan with that possibility, they see that as a real threat to their ultimate survival.",

        "And as you look at politically here in this state, one of the things it did, really the acrimony between parties, which, you know, the parties always have their rivalries, but it really exacerbated that situation.",
