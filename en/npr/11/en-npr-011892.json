        "Now what that does is it has an effect, obviously, on union income, and union organizers become a lot less aggressive in right-to-work states.",
        "Union organizing attempts drop about 50 percent because if you can't force the workers to pay the dues, there's just less money on the table.",
        "And with the less aggressive union organizers, the state becomes more attractive for businesses and investors, and you see an increase in manufacturing employment by about one-fifth to one-third is what the studies find.",
        "So it'll have an immediate effect on the workers, but it'll in the long term make Michigan a much more attractive place for businesses to locate and lead to more jobs being created.",
        "Could you point to an example in a state with a right-to-work law where that's been operative?",
        "Well, nationwide, the right-to-work states have unemployment that's sevent-tenths of a percentage point lower than the unemployment rate in non-right-to-work states.",
        "But there's a really good study that was done about a decade or so ago, where there was a researcher who compared counties that bordered each other across a state line.",
        "So you've got the same workforce, the same regional economy, the same local economic conditions.",
        "The only thing that's different is one county was on the right-to-work side of a border, and the other county was on the non-right-to-work side of the border.",
        "And he found that manufacturing employment was one-fifth to one-third higher in those counties that were on the same - on the right-to-work side than on the non-right-to-work side.",
        "And that's very strongly suggestive that the right-to-work law was the cause of that because everything else, you've got, you know, the same population, the same regional...",
        "I happened to read that study.",
        "He had some problems - the author had some problems with his own methodology.",
        "But I get your point in general.",
        "Michael Kazin, let me ask you: What difference from your vantage point do right-to-work laws make?",
        "Well, we can talk about studies, you know, all day long and how good they are.",
        "You know, one of the things that's pretty clear I think is that the states that have been right-to-work the longest are also very poor states, mostly in the Deep South, some in the Mountain West.",
        "And basically when unions are weak, which they almost always are when you have so-called right-to-work laws because people can get something for nothing, and so they're not really - there's no real reason for them to pay the dues, then you have a race to the bottom.",
        "And unemployment might be high, but the wages are low, job security is not very good, the education system is not very good in those states."

        "So, you know, basically you have an acceleration of what's been happening in this country for the last 30 years as unions have gotten weaker.",

        "It makes sense that a corporation would move across the border from a non-right-to-work state to a right-to-work state because obviously the wages are going to be lower.",

        "You know, I'm going to rely - I'm a public employee, and I'm going to rely on public employee retirement funds that I know in Indiana are very, very solvent as opposed to a place like Illinois, our neighbor, where if I worked there, I think I'd be very concerned that I would ever get, you know, a dollar on a dollar on my retirement.",
        "Just because the promises are far greater than their ability to pay out.",
        "All right, Don, thanks very much for the call.",

        "But it's fallen faster in the non-right-to-work states.",
        "Manufacturing employment dropped by about three percent a year in the non-right-to-work states versus only about 1.7 percent a year in the right-to-work states.",
        "And so certainly it's not a be-all, end-all.",
        "Certainly there's broader global and technological issues that are affecting manufacturing, and who would argue that it's a solution to all the states' economic problems.",

        "Michael Kazin, as you listen to those callers with very different concerns, certainly the problem with public employee pensions is not limited to Illinois, as our caller said, and Indiana, though, is one of the very few states that seems solvent.",
        "That's probably true, but of course a lot of this depends on the taxation in the given state.",
        "There's a lot more corruption in Illinois, I believe, as well.",
        "I don't think that has much to do with unions or with a lack of union strength.",
        "You know, I don't know enough about the comparative economies of Illinois and Indiana to make a comment on that.",
        "But I do want to say that I think, you know, the reason why unions - people who support unions, the way I do, think that right-to-work is the wrong idea is because is it's what sociologists call the free rider problem, that is there's no requirement in any states, including non-right-to-work states, for anybody to join a union.",
        "The only requirement, and Mr. Sherk knows this very well, is that it's called agency rights, that is if a union has a contract in a given workplace, then you have to pay union fees, you have to pay - you go to pay in to the institution which has won those benefits for you.",

        "They don't benefit from a union contract, but the union is insisting that, you know, they pay for it anyway.",
        "I mean unions could - the Supreme Court has recognized repeatedly the right of unions to negotiate members-only contracts that only cover their members.",
        "So they could say, all right, we'll negotiate for our members.",
        "You guys do your own thing.",
        "They don't do that.",
        "They voluntarily choose to represent everyone in the workforce - precisely because they want those new hires to be forced into the seniority system so they get laid off first and the more senior union members don't get laid off."

        "And I respect that definition.",
        "But the reason unions exist is because of a different idea of solidarity, of everyone sort of helping everyone else.",
