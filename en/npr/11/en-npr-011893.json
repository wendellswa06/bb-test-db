        "...as I said, you know, the idea of - that unions began was to protect the countervailing power to corporations.",
        "I mean what Mr. Sherk is saying in fact is that corporations have all the freedom they want to hire and fire.",
        "If it's a 22-year-old who's doing a better job than a 40-year-old, then that 40-year-old can be fired, and union contracts exist to make sure that kind of thing can't happen.",
        "Grace, thanks very much for the call.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, James Sherk, I wanted to ask you: Was that a fair characterization?",
        "Well, to some extent what he's saying, I mean there is certainly very - a different conception of freedom between those on the left and those on the right.",
        "And certainly those on the left tend to take a more collective view, and those on the right tend to be more focused on the individual.",
        "But I think you take a look at some of these union contracts, and they're very often not focused to collective good.",
        "I mean you take a look at public - like education.",
        "You've got this, you know, your first hire or your last hired, first fired seniority provisions.",
        "And so you have like the Milwaukee public schools in 2010 awarded Megan Sampson their Outstanding First Year Teacher Award, and then a week later fired her.",
        "Why?",
        "Because she didn't have seniority.",
        "Well, what happened to best interest of the children?",
        "No, I don't think it was, but she was fired because that was in the union contract that they wanted the new hires to go first.",
        "And I think it leads to tremendous unfairness for individual workers who the collective has decided you're going to take the hit for us.",
        "Let me ask you another question, and I want to hear from Michael Kazin too.",
        "Is this about economics, or is it about politics?",
        "If you look at the states that are right-to-work states, it looks a little like the map of the George W.",
        "Bush last election in 2004.",
        "Well, I think it's about both economics and the different conception of freedom, like you said.",
        "Again, you're going to get more conservative states are going to be more sympathetic to the argument for right to work that you, you know, shouldn't be forced to pay union dues in order to work, in order to teach.",
        "But at the some time, it's also about economics.",
        "Why is Michigan taking this up now?",
        "Why is Indiana taking it up now?",
        "Well, you know, you had Republican majorities in the 2000s, you know, a decade ago in those states, and they didn't touch it then.",
        "Why now?",
        "I think it's because the recession has been so bad that they want to do what they can to attract jobs and encourage economic development in their states, whereas that wasn't quite suppressing in the past.",
        "Michael Kazin, is it about economics, or is about politics?"

        "I mean if (unintelligible) to the economy, then why the golden age of American capitalism was the 1950s and 1960s when we had the highest percentage of private sector workers in unions, we ever have had before since in American history.",
        "There are many reasons for that.",
        "But one reason is because unions helped to level the playing field much more.",
        "But also politically, I mean one of the interesting things about this Michigan law is that it excepts firefighters and police.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Well, you can argue different things, but one of the reasons I think is that firefighters and police have a tradition in Michigan of swing Republicans.",
        "Mr. Sherk...",
        "I would just add that in the Michigan state Constitution they have collective bargaining for the public safety workers, directly in the state Constitution, so it's something that the legislature had no authority to change, that they consulted their lawyers and were told that it wouldn't pass muster under the state Constitution.",
