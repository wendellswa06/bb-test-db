        "Were you logging on Facebook and Twitter every day?",
        "Well, by the time I got to Egypt, actually, the Internet had been shut off, so effectively, no. When you hear about the social media revolution, it was the run-up, really, that affected that.",
        "And so when I got there, basically the entire city had been shut down, and everyone was very - you know, didn't know what was going to happen.",
        "And so instead of actually using social media, there were coming out onto the streets.",

        "I mean, you know, even though now Tahrir Square is billed - in the light of what happened in Syria, in light of what happened in Libya - as this very peaceful demonstration and the triumph of the peaceful revolution, you know, they really did have to face quite a bit of their own oppression during this period.",
