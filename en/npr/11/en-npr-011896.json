        "Yeah, we're hearing a lot of negative reports about the reaction of the Egyptians to America and its whole role in this Arab spring.",
        "What is your opinion, from the boots on the ground, so to speak, that you were there, of Egypt's attitude towards Israel?",
        "How is that going to change, if at all?",
        "You know, I am the Jerusalem correspondent, and I think it's a fundamental shift that we're witnessing, and I think it's one of the things that we have to keep our eye on very, very closely.",
        "Egypt had always been, under Mubarak, a staunch ally, certainly.",
        "They coordinated very closely on intelligence matters, on issues to do with Gaza, also on the peace process.",
        "And frankly after this, the popular sentiment is not with Israel in Egypt, and there is...",
        "It wasn't the popular...",
        "Well, the popular sentiment was never, exactly, but what - exactly.",
        "The popular sentiment has never been with Israel, and, in fact, the peace treaty is very, very unpopular.",
        "So - but what's happened now, of course, is that this is the birth of a new democracy and, you know, a representative democracy.",
        "And so those things will have to be addressed.",
        "And certainly when you talk to people on the streets in Egypt, it's one of their top priorities.",
        "They want to see fundamental change in the relationship with Israel.",
        "The very same people that were lauded for being the great democratizers of Tahrir Square, you know, the Google executives and the Twitter users, are the same people that we recently saw protest Israel's, you know, treatment of the Palestinians in Gaza.",
        "You know, these two things are not mutually exclusive.",
        "I - well, I don't know about overturning.",
        "It would say the laws prohibiting intentional infliction of emotional distress could not be applied...",
        "I think that there often is something I hear from people in America, that just because the people in Egypt are now expressing similar ideals of America, of democracy, of freedom, does not mean they agree with our policies.",
        "And those are two very different things."

        "Go ahead, Michael.",
        "Can I ask you just about our policy?",
        "We have had a policy of land for peace.",
        "We've also had a policy of billions and billions and billions in foreign aid to Egypt.",
        "What if we were to translate those billions into actually buying land somewhere there in the Middle East, which has, what, 70 times as much land as Israel - what if we were to buy some of that desert land that the Israelis are so good at making blossom like a rose, what if we were to buy it and start giving it to the Palestinians in that area so that they would have an option that's much bigger than the option that they have now in the West Bank?",

        "Hi.",
        "What changes have you all observed in the status of women since this spring began?",
        "That's a good question, and I think certainly, at the very beginning - in Egypt, particularly - there was a sense that this was going to be beneficial to women.",
        "You saw women in great numbers in Tahrir Square.",
        "They felt, they said, safe in Tahrir Square.",
        "Egypt is a particularly interesting country.",
        "There is a lot of history of sexual harassment there.",
        "After what happened to Lara Logan, you know, I investigated it, and really, Egyptian women suffer from that very, very heavily because of various cultural factors.",
        "I think the - talking to feminists in the region, there is a sense that perhaps the issue of women might have been lost in the shuffle, though, that possibly because there's other priorities to do with simply, you know, political organization, what happens next, that issues particularly related to women might not be taken to the forefront.",
        "And one of the, of course, big concerns is, of course, the rise of the Islamists.",
        "If there is a sense that, you know, the Muslim Brotherhood, for example, comes into power, how will that affect the laws and the customs of Egypt - is one example of that.",
        "Equally, in Libya, you know, women are not very present in that revolution.",
        "It's a bloody, brutal civil war with people fighting with weapons.",
        "And women are not - even though they've been the victims of the violence, they're not actively participating in the revolution in that way.",
        "So it remains to be seen how it will really play out for women in the region.",
        "And I would say in Libya, I mean, in Egypt, you see women from - everything from, you know, full veil to jeans and a T-shirt.",
        "In Libya, you do not see that.",
        "Women - you do not see that many women on the streets.",
        "You do not - certainly, they don't speak to men.",
        "It's a very different society, and it's a much more conservative society in Libya.",
        "I mean, women want different things.",
        "Women want different things.",
        "I mean, that's the other thing you have to remember.",
        "There's not just one way forward for women.",
        "Some women believe that the hijab and to be veiled is actually, you know, honoring their religion and honoring their family.",
        "And other women don't want that.",
        "And so, you know, it's a complicated question.",
        "And so there's not one way forward for women.",
        "It's a question of trying to figure out what will the best way for as many women as possible."

        "Do you think more choice will be available for women?",
        "I think some of the things that are definitely of interest have to do with laws, legislation to do with - you know, that's the bedrock of protecting women in any society: legislation that protects them and that also - and so that there's a society - so that there's repercussions if people step out of line.",

        "I was just wondering: In the past, the United States government, like '50s and '60s, had supported dictators in different parts of the Arab world because of national interests, which led to ultimately, you know, the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the formation of the Islamic Republic.",
        "And then, in turn, because of that fear, we backed dictators in the Middle East to try to stabilize things in, you know, like Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and we even backed Iraq, you know, with Saddam Hussein.",
        "And so I'm wondering now, as these revolutions come about in the Middle East and these governments are formed with people that have, you know, lived under these dictators for 30, 40 years, what is going to be the long-term reaction of these people to the United States government and the people of the United States?",
        "What's their view going to be, long-term?",
        "I think it's a very important balancing act.",
        "I think there's absolutely no question that the United States has, through its policies, propped up many of these regimes for a number of different reasons, stability being among them.",

        "And so now, what we saw, especially if you remember back, when you had the beginnings of Tahrir Square, you'd have the people come out and say: Look, you see these gas canisters that they're firing at us?",
        "Made in the USA.",
        "I mean, they'd show this to you, and they'd sort of - and they'd say, you know, it was a product of the billions of dollars of aid that was going to the Mubarak regime.",

        "But there is a great deal of anti-American sentiment in the region.",
