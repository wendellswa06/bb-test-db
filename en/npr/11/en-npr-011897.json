        "I'm not sure if it's changed my own view of it.",
        "I do - it's very interesting to me, right after the revolution in Tahrir Square, when Mubarak did step down and we started going to these meetings and talking to these people who were forming political parties for the first time and were trying to get together, and part of me - they kept on saying they were having meetings about the groups, and then they'd have another meeting in another town, and they'd elect representatives that have a big congress, and watching people sort of figure a way through.",
        "And they were looking back to both the American Revolution, to the French Revolution.",
        "They were trying to take inspiration from the revolutions that, you know, took place in the West a couple hundred years ago, and really, I did feel that as imperfect as all our societies are, that they are taking inspiration from - of some of those same enlightenment thinkers that inspired the American Revolution.",
        "Well, for me, I think more than anything, it just, it was an incredible sense of excitement.",
        "I think when you have established democracies like this one, a lot of apathy, there's a lot of vitriol at times.",
        "And when you see what's happening in places like Egypt, even in places like Libya, where there is a civil war and yet civil society is stepping into the breach, and they're having these exciting discussions, you know, and they're being imaginative, and they're being creative, and they're trying to be inclusive, many of them, and it's an exciting time to see that and to bear witness to it.",
        "And everyone feels like they're on the cusp of history.",
        "They're riding a wave of history.",
        "Every single person - from the street sweeper to the politician to the, you know, to the historian - all feel that this is something that they can have a stake in, that they belong to in some way.",
        "And that is an extremely exciting thing to witness.",
        "And the sense of pride both in Libyans and the Egyptians that, as a people, they are doing something, is remarkable.",
        "And they did it themselves.",
        "It didn't come at the, you know, barrel of an American tank.",
        "They like to say that a lot.",
        "Let's go next to Alan(ph), Alan with us from New Orleans.",
        "Yes.",
        "Neal, actually, my question is to your guests, and I appreciate them.",
        "They are not saying all the negative things - and there are plenty of negative, and they are positive.",
        "But these folks need to be encouraged, as well.",
        "But how do you know - I happen to speak the languages where you are, before.",
        "How do you know the translator is telling you - because unless you speak Arabic, you're really going by secondhand opinion or language."

        "One question, actually, to your guests, Neal, is: With regard to Libya, unless there's - something happened, that China's trying to get in.",
        "And there's other elements trying to get in Libya, taking this.",
        "I believe the U.S.",
        "should be really involved in supervising, seeing Libya succeed in this struggle.",
        "Okay, not just interpreters, people who - there's an important role played by people called fixers who are often very helpful local journalists who can help you make arrangements.",
        "The question is twofold.",
        "You know, on the one hand, of course, there's a language issue.",
        "But on the second hand, there's a local knowledge issue, which is, I think, what Neal was speaking to when he's discussing fixers.",
        "I can - someone can go in and speak the language, but they might now know what's happening in the neighborhood around the corner.",
        "For example, we recently went into Benghazi.",
        "We had been using someone who is Egyptian.",
        "And then we actually hired someone who was from Benghazi, and the first thing he said to me was: Did you know there was an assassination attempt just around the corner?",
        "My cousin's going to the funeral.",
        "...in this particular setting.",
        "...in a lawsuit against them.",
        "Now, you know, this is exactly the kind of local knowledge that you want, and which is why you hire people when you get to a place that has that local knowledge.",
        "And so that's - that, I would say, is the most important thing about what we do when we work with local journalists.",
        "And then, of course, there's the issue of the translator.",
        "You know, in places like Iraq, where we have many translators, you work with one interpreter, and then you come back, and then they type it up.",
        "And then another person - another - a second person will go through it to make sure that there's no - nothing is incorrect.",
        "I mean, we are very scrupulous.",
        "We are very careful about how we present people's views.",
        "And I think that there comes - having done this for many years now, there becomes a level of trust, and you do have to choose who to trust.",
        "And sometimes that trust is betrayed.",
        "That's very true.",
        "But on other times, I think that that trust - for most of the time, that trust is rewarded.",
        "And that is true in the Middle East.",
        "Or I was just in Japan, where, of course, we were working with translators there.",
        "And you have to.",
        "You have to be able to - but having that local knowledge and being able to speak to people about their place is very important."

        "Sometimes.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "And that comes with time and knowing the place, and, you know, and often having, you know, two different types of translators, for example, you know, because they would have access to two different types of stories.",
        "But I think as a journalist, and what we're trained to do - I mean, this is - I've been - something I've been doing for years, is you do go into a place, and you are aware of that.",

        "But if you could just talk a little bit about that, I'd appreciate it.",
