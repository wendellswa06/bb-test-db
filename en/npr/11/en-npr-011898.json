        "One is that it's a social influence, either an intentional one where the passenger sort of says, `Catch up' or `Slow down,' or an unintentional one where the passenger is being him or herself but the driver feels like they should change their behavior.",
        "Or it could be a distraction thing.",
        "The passenger could be distracting the driver either intentionally or not intentionally just by being busy in the car on a cell phone or whatever.",
