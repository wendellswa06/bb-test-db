        "The Trump administration missed an opportunity on infrastructure.",

        "Those probably would apply.",
        "Maryland, actually, passed such a law after this case was decided.",
        "Roberts said that that wasn't an issue in the case, but neutral laws restricting the time, place and manner of protests definitely still remain on the books.",
        "And this has, to some people, you mentioned the flag-burning case, but it would also smack of the case where the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis marched through Skokie, Illinois.",
        "Those are almost galvanizing First Amendment cases, the ones that people hate the most.",
        "It's precisely the protection of speech we hate, the court has said again and again, that most tests the First Amendment.",
        "Now, of course, there was a dissent.",
        "It was a lone dissent by Samuel Alito, who's become quite a passionate defender of privacy in cases like this.",
        "And he found it outrageous that the court would protect this speech.",
        "He said there's no question it was targeted at the family in question.",
        "He noted a blog posting on the Internet after the funeral that made clear that Matthew in particular was targeted.",
        "He said that Matthew was falsely asserted to have been gay, and Alito said...",
        "This is the U.S.",
        "Marine who was being buried.",
        "Precisely so, whose father sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress.",
        "Alito interestingly even cited a protest that occurred after the case was decided, noting that after the Tucson tragedy, the Westboro Baptist Church recently announced its intention to picket the funeral of the 9-year-old girl killed in Tucson proclaiming she was better off dead, which Alito found another outrageous example of their specific desire to target intentional infliction of emotional distress.",
        "And basically, Alito said this was speech about a private concern and it had to do with a private figure, and therefore, it should not be protected.",
        "Which raises a question: If this is not hateful enough, is there any speech hateful enough not to cross that First Amendment line?",
        "And that's also the question that Justice Breyer raised.",
        "I mean, if you're literally stalking someone or if you attacked someone and then did it in a situation where you knew that the news media would broadcast it more broadly, could that political motive save the fact that, essentially, you're engaging in stalking or harassment?",
        "And that question is - remains for another day."

        "And Chief Justice Roberts has enjoyed getting these broad majorities and other free speech cases, striking down the attempt to challenge the ban on military recruiting on campuses.",
        "So the speech is one he cares a lot about.",
        "Remember, the court was criticized in the Citizens United case for issuing a five to four divided ruling, saying that corporations are persons.",
        "But Roberts avoided that sort of division here, just as he did a few days ago, when he said that corporations don't have privacy rights for the purpose of avoiding disclosure, for the Freedom of Information Act and other case where free speech won over privacy.",
        "So we're definitely seeing a trend here, of a very strong free speech court.",

        "This was very traumatic for my family.",
        "However, our community rallied and support.",
        "A counter-protest of over 400 people completely muted anything they had to say.",
        "And my brother, at the end of the day, was fighting for our Constitution and for our nation.",
        "So while, personally, they most definitely cross the line, our community, including law enforcement, ensure that they did not interrupt a very traumatic time for us.",
        "So long as we can have people rally around to counter that kind of hateful speech, I think we can keep our Constitution intact."

        "We need to remember that fewer than one percent of the nation is actually contributing to this fight.",

        "And the court rejected that challenge.",
