        "The Supreme Court ruled eight to one today, if you're joining us late, that protest by members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who - at military funerals, protests that are very hurtful to those military families, that free speech trumps privacy and that those military -cannot sue the group for infliction of pain and suffering.",

        "I wonder if there's any parallel to the idea that you don't know - you can't define pornography, but you know it when you see it.",
        "And can the justices say, this is wrong, we know it's wrong, but we have to do this?",
        "It's a great analogy.",
        "And the court specifically said, we don't want to be in that business.",
        "They said that the - even if a few signs might have been related to an individual, the dominant theme was relevant to public discussion.",
        "And if there's any plausible relevance to something the public should legitimately be interested in, it's not the job of judges to try to decide what people should and should not find highly offensive.",
        "Such a deeply American idea.",
        "And what about the notion of vengeful protest, actually going to these folks' church and doing a counter protest just to say, hey, equality rules here?",
        "I suppose within the scope of the court's opinion.",
        "If it was political protest, that would be legitimate.",

        "You mean they're provocative?",

        "I think they are involving themselves in a, sort of, verbal violence.",

        "They weren't face-to-face.",
        "They were far away from the funeral site.",
        "But Justice Breyer, in a separate concurring opinion, said, I can imagine situations where Internet speech or speech in a different context might be viewed as an attempt to incite.",
