        "Eliana, in your reporting for Politico, have you seen any changes so far since General Kelly came on as chief of staff?",
        "White House aides are telling me that they've seen this week.",
        "And granted, it's only five days, but they've seen two major changes - that General Kelly is putting an enormous premium on limiting the flow of people into and out of the Oval Office.",
        "The president really liked to have an open-door policy where his aides were flowing in and out.",
        "And aides standing in the outer Oval would - he'd summon them in.",
        "He loved - you know, he's a social guy.",
        "And number two, the flow of paper and information up to the president - he's limiting the sort of conspiracy theory-type articles that get the president hot and bothered and get him on his Twitter account.",
        "So those are the two major changes that he seems to have fixated on.",
        "But I think the question is - the president I think understood a need for a change, and so did Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, his daughter and son-in-law who have been very influential on the personnel side.",
        "The question to me is, how long does the president want to stay with this sort of more disciplined regime - because he's not known as a particularly disciplined guy.",
        "Right.",
        "I'm sure that will come as a surprise to all of your (laughter) listeners.",
        "I want to end with last night's development in the investigation into potential ties between Trump associates and Russia.",
        "This is what the president said at a rally in West Virginia.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "They can't beat us at the voting booths, so they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.",
        "They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us.",
        "Of course this came right after the development that special counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington.",
        "E.J., briefly, is this significant?",
        "I think it is.",
        "First, that argument Trump used - Nixon tried to use that argument.",
        "My Washington Post colleague James Hohmann said this is going to make it more difficult to fire Mueller, having the grand jury there.",
        "And Mueller seems to be focusing on the financial aspects, Trump's ties to Russia in terms of money.",
        "And that could lead down roads connected to other financial aspects of the Trump empire."

        "Final thought, Eliana.",
        "And I think that really worries the president.",
        "Yeah, it occurred to me that impaneling of the grand jury makes it clear there's a very real chance that Mueller will bring charges against somebody on the Trump team and also that there is a real potential for an all-out political war here because 33 percent of the country, even if they realize Trump is guilty, is going to stand behind him.",

        "From a parent's point of view, is that the right move, and is it enough?",
        "It's a good first step, and it certainly makes me as a parent feel a little bit better about sending our youngest son back to the school where our daughter was killed - so, you know, certainly a good step.",
        "Are we where we need to be - no. Do I think we can prevent - will these measures prevent what happened before or something similar?",
        "No, I don't think it's enough.",

        "I mean, school boards are literally making life-and-death decisions for our kids and for our teachers.",
        "And I decided the best way for me to influence the policies and make sure that the security protocols are implemented correctly is to run for office, become a member of the school board and have a seat at the table.",
        "And what is it specifically you would like to get done?",
        "There's three things I want to do that I think are vitally important.",
        "One is I want to focus and prioritize on school safety.",
        "I don't believe the district did that in the events that led up to the tragedy at Stoneman Douglas.",
        "There were opportunities missed to intervene, and I think we need to enhance our early identification and intervention programs.",
        "I think we missed an opportunity there to not only identify the shooter but to prevent him from getting onto campus...",
        "OK.",
        "...And doing what he did, number one.",
        "Number two, I think we have got to deliver a quality education to all of our students, and I don't think in Broward County we - we're achieving the kind of academic performance we need to.",
        "And three, we need transparency and accountability in our school district.",
        "The school district has yet to really acknowledge the mistakes that were made, and I think to really make the changes we need to to keep our students and teachers safe, we have to acknowledge the mistakes.",
        "We have to be willing to recognize those mistakes and then of course make the changes that are necessary to make sure it doesn't happen again.",
