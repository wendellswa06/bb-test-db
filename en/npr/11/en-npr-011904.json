        "The question to the American people and to the people around the world is are we willingly decided and determined to create a situation where we are torturing other people in order for ourselves to be more secure.",
        "My answer to that is we should not go there.",
        "I think some Americans would say - and not just Americans - but some would say it is not just to be more secure, it is to protect innocence.",
        "The question is - and I want you to engage on this further, because you say that torture corrupts more than just the perpetrator, and I'd love for you to hear more on that.",
        "It corrupts everybody.",
        "It corrupts everyone, and I want you to expand on that.",
        "But I think the issue for Americans is are we willing to sacrifice our own innocence, our innocent peoples' lives - like many of the people who were killed in 9/11 for the sake of our own kind of moral purity.",
        "Well, I mean - but the first question we have to speak about is this question of innocence, okay?",
        "Because you realize that when you have somebody in front of you, you have no certainty that person knows, really, what is happening, as has happened constantly all over the centuries and has happened just recently where they took a Canadian citizen and the United States sent him to Syria to be tortured, and he was innocent.",

        "I mean, what is the devil's deal in that?",
        "And what I speak about in my op-ed is I speak about a young man who, in Chile in 1973, was tortured because he had bragged that he had weapons, that he was this big revolutionary, and he wasn't.",
        "He was just a fool.",
        "He was just a boaster.",

        "He had been possessed by the indifference of humanity, by the neglect of humanity, by people not caring about that pain.",
        "So again, it's like in the death penalty, they ask are you willing to send 20 guilty people to the chamber, and if one of them is innocent, too bad.",
        "No, the answer is you're not supposed to send anybody innocent.",
        "But you know what?",
