        "And hopefully he's going to join us now from a studio at the BBC in London.",
        "Jonathan Paterson, are you there?",
        "Good afternoon.",

        "So, first of all, just give us a sense of what the BBC's operation in Beijing is going to be like during the games.",
        "This is undoubtedly one of the largest operations that BBC has ever mounted.",
        "We've got about 450 people going to the Olympic Games, a small army of presenters, reporters, technicians, and engineers.",
        "The BBC is obviously a very large organization, and we are one of the rights holders of the Olympics, so we can broadcast most of the Olympic sports to the U.K.",
        "So, it's quite a big investment for us.",
        "If you're interested in sport, whatever sport you want to watch, if you're a fan of badminton, gymnastics, BMX cycling, you can watch it on the BBC.",
        "It will be there.",
        "We've also got a very significant news presence there, our news team.",
        "We have a long-established bureau who've been in Beijing for more than 30 years, actually.",
        "But we're bolstering that with extra resources from London and from around the world, because obviously this is a unique moment in China's history, and we want to be there to observe it.",
        "So, you have both a sports team and a news team, and they're sort of separate?",
        "You view them as complete..."

        "I'm in charge of the news team.",
        "I also have under me news journalists who specialize in sport.",
        "So, if there are issues around, say, drug testing, or the success of the Chinese athletics team, or individual personality stories, we will be bringing those to our news audiences as well as the stories about the Chinese economic boom, Chinese media freedom, all those sort of things that are very important part of our coverage.",
        "Sports news is a very big deal in the U.K., as it is in the U.S.",
        "So, half of our team is dedicated, yes, to bringing you live sport as it happens.",
        "The rest is dedicated to bringing you news events, whether they be sports or news.",
        "How concerned are you about the kind of access that you will be able to get to news events, if protests occur, that kind of thing?",
        "Well, it's been a very interesting period for us.",
        "Undoubtedly, it's a very interesting period in China, and undoubtedly.",
        "We have had greater access to parts of China than we have ever had before.",
        "By way of example, you will remember the problems with the toys that were contaminated with lead paint.",
        "When that story happened, we sent a reporter down to a factory there and interviewing people in the factories, filming the toys as they were being made.",
        "That was unprecedented access that we'd never have had two years ago.",
        "Just today, I heard a reporter talking to gay rights activists in China.",
        "So, that sense of freedom of movement around the country seems to be going very well.",
        "In terms of reporting in Beijing, we're not really sure how that's going to go.",
        "We've had a lot of - it's been a frustrating period where dealing with the authorities has been a long and torturous process that still hasn't reached a conclusion just before the games.",
        "Olympic venues, they tend to be OK.",
        "But if we want to be in Tiananmen Square, or if we want to be in - outside the Great Wall, we can't - it's not entirely clear whether we'll have all the permissions that we need to broadcast from these places.",
        "And often, we're talking about quite innocuous broadcasts.",
        "I mean, we've actually been refused permission this week to do a live a broadcast from a food market.",
        "This is the food market we've been to many occasions before, and we've actually done live broadcasting from before.",
        "And on this occasion, we've been turned down.",

        "Now, that doesn't really fit with the idea or freedom of openness which we have about in terms of moving around the country.",
        "So, it's a really difficult time for us, and we're just treating each sort of case, each sort of little thing, as it comes along.",
        "Clearly when there's protests, if there are protests in Beijing, we're going to have to see how that goes, because that's sort of something which hasn't really been tested yet.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to take a call now from Talia.",

        "But I think if you are a smaller organization, or you don't have that kind of manpower because you're already going to the expense of going to another country, I think it's almost - in terms of China, I think it's almost impossible to go to a place like the Olympics, with all these controversies surrounding it, to divide it.",
        "Because as human beings, especially - not just - I'm not talking about corruption.",
        "I'm talking about human rights violations.",

        "It's just that you have certain reporters that have certain areas of specialty and that this - is that right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And you know, if there are protests inside the stadiums, we will of course cover them, and they will be featured as part of our live sports coverage.",
        "I mean, we've made a conscious decision that if there are significant protests inside the stadium, then our live programming will show that and will reflect that, because clearly that's part of the story, but...",
        "Well, you're - I'm talking about smaller newspaper organizations, or I'm talking about smaller groups that go over there, because it depends how large it is, if you do have the manpower, you know, you have people who are dedicated to this or dedicated to that...",

        "It's going to be difficult for those smaller organizations to cover everything, because there's going to be so much going on.",
        "But again, thanks so much for your call.",

        "Yes.",
        "Well, when reporters moved in to the village and they saw these sites were blocked, they asked the International Olympic Committee about it.",
        "And the IOC said they would investigate, and they got back today.",
        "And the IOC press chief Kevan Gosper said, well, in fact, the Beijing Games Organizing Committee had announced that there would be censorship of the Internet within not just China, but within the Olympic Village as well.",
        "And the bombshell for some people was that the IOC negotiated this outcome.",
        "They were in on it all along, even though the International Olympic Committee chief, Jacques Rogge, was trumpeting the fact that, you know, China had promised full access to report not just on the games but on the rest of China.",
        "In fact, the IOC knew all along that that would not be the case.",
        "They had been in on negotiations with the Chinese government, and the Chinese government said the freedom will essentially only extend to the games themselves.",

        "I mean, is there any sense that journalists can protest this?",
        "Or is this just a fait accompli at this point?",
        "Well, I think Gosper and other IOC officials are probably hammering out these details late tonight.",
        "But it's very - I think it's doubtful that - it shows how little leverage the IOC has over the Chinese government, and I doubt China will budge on it.",
        "And as somebody who's been reporting from China for awhile, how surprised are you by this kind of news about the restrictions that are in place?",
        "Well, we've known all along that it's going to be a very bumpy ride for the foreign journalists here, that China is not ready in this regard, that many people still do not get it about the Western media and how they operate.",
        "What is surprising, I think - one, of course, is the IOC's involvement and complicity in all these, but also, the fact that the more enlightened Chinese officials say, we know you're not Chinese Communist Party reporters, you're not people's daily reporters, and we're not going to treat you that way.",
        "And so, you know, there's a sense that they differentiate between foreigners and Chinese.",
        "And when you stay in a foreign-run hotel, a Sheraton or a Hilton in China, you can watch the BBC, but that's not true for Chinese people.",
        "So, they're not differentiating here where it's just like any other censorship that goes on in China.",

        "Anthony Kuhn, I'm just wondering, let's go back to when China was bidding to become the host city for these Olympics.",

        "What was promised?",

        "So, we are not privy to the contents of the deal.",
        "It was not transparent.",

        "First of all, that we'd have free access to report, not just on the games, but on China itself, and that new rules would go into effect for the period of the Olympics, freeing up foreign journalists to report around the country without having to get official permission.",
        "And all along, we've had all sorts of difficulties with that.",
