        "Very much so.",
        "I mean, sport and politics are inextricably linked.",
        "The Chinese know that, and the IOC know that.",
        "It's not a big secret.",
        "I mean, I appreciate that your listener there was talking about incidents that weren't covered or at least didn't receive big international attention.",
        "But we can, you know, go back to 1936, of course, with the Berlin Olympics, Moscow, where there was the boycott by the West, L.A., where there was the boycott by Russia.",
        "You know, it's inextricably linked, and we're there to cover that and to cover those aspects of the Olympics, the effects that deal with politics, and clearly, there were a lot of those at these Olympics.",
        "But it's not the first time that that's happened.",
        "And you know, there may well be issues to come up with London in 2012.",
        "I don't know what they are yet.",
        "But the whole issue of sport and politics and the Olympics in particular is inextricably linked and - are inextricably linked.",
        "Anthony, do you have anything to add to that?",
        "Well, I think people - there are many, many people, I think polls show, who would like the Olympic Games to be separated from politics.",
        "And that's been China's line all along.",
        "Don't mix the two up.",
        "Don't sully the noble aspirations of the games.",
        "But in fact, they have tried to reap great political benefits from the holding of the games.",
        "They've tried to use it to legitimize their rule, to show off the best side of China's development, to unite the country, and sort of fortify their historical narrative of the past hundred years.",
        "So, it's actually quite political here now.",
        "Well, I want to bring in another guest now.",
        "Terry McDonell is the managing editor of Sports Illustrated.",
        "He and many of the magazine's writers and editors will be in Beijing for the games, and he joins us now from our bureau in New York City.",
        "Good to have you with us, Terry.",
        "It's a pleasure to be here.",
        "I love this show.",
        "Good.",
        "We always like to hear that.",
        "So, what do you think your readers are expecting from your coverage of the Olympics?",
        "We think of Sports Illustrated as being really just about sports.",
        "Do you - will you get into the politics at all?",
        "Really?",
        "That's what you think?",
        "I - well, I can't say that I read Sports Illustrated (unintelligible)...",
        "Because since the beginning of Sports Illustrated, it's been - just as it's covered sports, it's covered race relations and the growth of civil rights, which - a direct line from the '50s now in sports.",
        "Everything that we do takes the context into account.",
        "It's not just about the number of medals, ever."

        "So, how have you been preparing for these games?",
        "What have you been doing?",
        "Specifically back in 2006, I went to Beijing and made a deal to publish Sports Illustrated in China.",
        "So, we have SI China now, which is published in Mandarin, and that - the hope was that would link us into the culture in a way that would help us better cover it when the time came.",
        "What kind of access are you going to have?",
        "Are you having any trouble with getting the kind of access that you want or need?",
        "And I ask the woman a question, and it is the men answering the question for her.",
        "It's not - they don't do it, like, on purpose, but I think they feel it's normal for them because that's how they grew up.",
        "Well, as everyone said before, this could get very bumpy.",
        "Unlike rights holders, however, we're in a slightly different situation.",
        "We don't really - we're not really as directly connected to the IOC and the Chinese, so we're just sort of at large there to find what we can, and that's our intention.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to take some questions now, and I think that a member of the audience, Valerie, is standing by at the mike.",
        "Hi, Valerie.",
        "Hi.",
        "My name is Valerie.",
        "I'm from Los Angeles, California.",
        "My question involves the designated protest areas that will be in Beijing.",
        "In this case, there are three designated public parks.",
        "I know that in past Olympics, there have also been designated protest areas.",
        "In this case, it's getting some news press because there are certainly expected to be protests.",
        "Do you, Jonathan, or Anthony, or anybody, believe that the protests will in fact be limited to these areas?",
        "And how much coverage do you plan to have over at these parks?",
        "Anthony, you want to take that first?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, first of all, it's something they have never done here before, so I think we've got to say it sends a positive signal that they want to channel dissent rather than just stifle it.",
        "I think it's - you know, they've spent a lot of the past few weeks getting rid of protesters, particularly petitioners who have come from the outside provinces to Beijing.",
        "They've made it clear, though, that under Chinese law, any protests have to have official approval first.",
        "You have to submit an application, and they're usually not approved.",
        "So, it's hard to say whether there'll be anything different here.",
        "Also, we know that a lot of rights groups, for example, that might like to hold protests - Tibet groups, human rights groups, and such - are not going to get visas to come into China in the first place.",
        "So, it remains to be seen whether they're lighten up at all or whether these little protest pens will be quite empty."

        "Jonathan or Terry?",
        "Well, I mean, we will clearly cover protests, whether they're in the stadium or in public areas of Beijing, or the protest pens.",
        "I believe that we haven't yet been shown these protest pens.",
        "Although I do understand that they were part of the IOC's agreement with Beijing, as they have been with other Olympics.",
        "I had some colleagues who were in Athens who said that they became sort of rather a side show for all the other things that were going on.",
        "Whether we'll actually cover the protests in those pens or not, or whether we'll be covering other things, I - you know, remains to be seen.",
        "The Olympic charter, which goes back to 1894, I think, has in it a rule - it's called, I think, 51.3 - that outlines the fact, according to them, that no protests are allowed at the Olympics.",
        "So, the fact that these pens exist is sort of an interesting challenge to their own rule.",
        "But what is more interesting, at least to us, is what will happen if someone on a victory stand produces and lifts a flag of Tibet?",
        "Hm.",
        "We saw this in 1968 in Mexico City, when Tommy Smith and John Carlos gave a Black Power salute on the victory stand.",
        "They were reprimanded and sent home, but they were allowed to keep their medals.",
        "I think there are a lot of people in China now thinking about Rule 51.3.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's - there's a pretty good - do you think there's a pretty good possibility that that might happen, Terry?",
        "That something like that might happen?",
        "You know, I don't know.",
        "You know, I know that the athletes that I have known, you know, over the years that I've covered sports, fall pretty much in the two categories.",
        "Some are apolitical, but those that aren't tend to be very, very political.",

        "Don is calling from Detroit, Michigan.",
        "Hi, Don.",
        "My statement is, one, I'm a true blue American.",
        "I have a daughter in the military, and I almost feel like a traitor stating that I agree with China.",
        "I believe that the Olympics should stay about the Olympics.",
        "I don't watch the Super Bowl to find out anything that's not politically correct going on at that particular city.",
        "I don't agree with China's policies, but I want to watch the Olympics.",
        "And I believe that when something comes on TV that - about their inhumane treatment of their prisoners or whatever, I'm going to turn the channel.",
        "You just want to see the - you just want to see the events, the games."

        "Sure, of course.",

        "After we were hurt so bad, and the country after had to come back together, where did it come back together?",

        "I think we have a responsibility to the world to tell people about what's going on in China.",
        "And look at that story today that's come out about the blocking of the Internet access.",
        "That has been one of the top stories, certainly in the U.K., explaining about the restrictions.",

        "I mean, what kind of repercussions can happen?",
        "Anthony Kuhn?",
        "I don't think the repercussions are going to be very severe, and I think the fact that China has stuck to this position that it is going to sensor the Internet shows that international opinion is not all that important to it, and it may have underestimated the kickback.",
        "But I think it may indicate that, you know, they consider the domestic reaction more important.",
