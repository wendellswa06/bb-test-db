        "I always kind of enjoy the unwritten rules of hockey where the two perpetrators were allowed to be isolated and trade some blows and nobody else - I mean sure there is the occasional bench clearing brawl, but it's usually the two perpetrators.",
        "I guess I always wondered why on baseball they never let the pitcher and the batter go at it and trade a few punches and see who comes put on top.",
        "Well I think that, you know, that would be interesting if they kind of put a bull circle around them, like a little ring, and see what happens.",
        "But I think they're certainly afraid of a lot of things escalating.",
        "Even in baseball it might be a lot easier to get on to the field and the madness ensue.",
        "But you know that could be something to change things up.",
        "I think once people realize that they can't actually really fight for the most part, you know you might think twice about getting into that circle.",
        "Well, as I understand it, when you know the batter charges the mound and generally the pitcher - the catcher charges right after him to try protect his pitcher, and then the batter's team says it's nine guys, they have nine guys on the field and it's just our one guy, and so they go out, and then the bullpen's empty and everybody's there.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's a snowball effect.",
        "It starts and then everybody's getting out there.",
        "Now the catcher's got to protect his pitcher so he's trying to catch you with all his gear on.",
        "Odds are he's not going to but usually after you take one punch the catcher's on to you instantaneously so you know they have a lot of rules about who gets protected.",
        "And the thing about baseball, it's the endlessness of the grudge.",
        "Like you may beat up someone that day, but you're going to play this team 15 more times, they're going to see you in the parking lot and whatever.",
        "I mean I've seen a guy literally wait for the pitcher in the parking lot.",
        "Really?",
        "After a game so you know they don't forget.",
        "So that's the other aspect.",
        "You can get into that ring of fire sort of speak, but it doesn't end there.",
        "It doesn't end until you pretty much hang out your spikes.",
        "Thanks very much Dan.",
        "Let's see if we can go to Mike.",
        "And Mike's with from Dublin, Ohio.",
        "Right.",
        "Well mine was - my favorite story was back when I was in the Navy and we were playing the Venezuelan navy down in Puerto Rico and we weren't allowed to win the ball games that we played for grabs.",
        "They told us make a good show of it, but if you're going to win, make sure you lose.",
        "Well, this is like a political \"\"Rashomon,\"\" right?",
        "Only two men were in a room.",
        "One conversation happened, and they both walked out with two distinct impressions of what that was.",
        "We should note that the president's lawyer says that his impression was never to pressure the FBI director.",
        "And his lawyer gave a robust defense of the president and said this didn't happen...",
        "This is DAY TO DAY.",
        "I'm Alex Chadwick."

        "So we were sitting there, we actually got ahead quite a bit so we started kind of balling players and things and letting them catch up and eventually it got even, but then they pretty much fouled out straight back to the pitcher.",
        "So then it was our last time up and they were giving us a hard time about it and we had been plying the umpire with a few beers along the way and we knew that the umpire was a little bit shaky so we had two outs - one out.",
        "There was a guy - there was nobody on and a guy comes up to bat and so we devised this plan, one of the guys goes up and talks like he's talking to the third base coach and then all of us just kind of stepped on the third base and the next - the next guy hit the ground ball, and they threw out a second for the out and the guy in third who wasn't really there, run home and the umpire called them safe and said we'd won the game.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And needless to say the Venezuelans didn't take too kindly to that so.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah that's stuff only brawl material right there.",
        "I would think that - of course that was the day when Venezuela was an ally.",
        "That's true.",
        "That's also - it was not so that we got back to the boat that we found out we were in big trouble.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah that might have changed the diplomatic landscape that day.",
        "It's one thing for a major league ball player to get a fine or suspended, I guess it's another to get thrown onto the brig."
