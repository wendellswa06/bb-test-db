        "The best way to stimulate the economy obviously is to put money directly into pockets of taxpayers.",

        "The economy is badly damaged.",
        "It is very sick.",
        "And so we have to take whatever steps are required to make sure that it's stabilized.",
        "But we also have to recognize that if we're going to grow this economy over the long term, if we're going to create a better future for our children and our grandchildren, then we can't be fiscally irresponsible about how we do it.",
        "Ultimately, Mr. Obama says, that will require tradeoffs and hard choices.",
        "But for now he's looking to craft a measure that will include something to please everyone.",

        "I said, you know what, if I reverse the field, you know, I can outrun all these guys out there because they were a bunch of white linebackers and safeties and etc., and they did not have the speed that I had.",
        "So if there's one thing that has really changed in the game over the last 30 years that's been the speed of the game because there are more African Americans playing defense.",
        "When I played, there was no black, African-American middle linebacker in the league, and you know, so that today the outside linebackers, you know, they can run as fast as the running backs.",

        "You don't see that today.",
        "Well, yeah, I mean, that's, when one, generally that's been one of the most remarkable things is just the fact that the league is like 64, 67% black, and I'm sure when Cassidy and his league in the early 60s, they figured that would never happen, but that also leads to what, I think, is the next evolution because of everything that, and by the way, Lem Barney, the greatest cornerback of all times, and when I walked in, Mel introduced me to Miller Farve.",
        "Brother, I said, Miller Farve, this is one of the greatest cats of all time.",
        "I thought, I was like 16, I saw Miller Farve intercept a quick out, and I said I've got to play defensive back.",
        "But anyway, I think that because of everything Mel and Lem said, I think that's where we get the next evolution is at quarterback where brothers now are transforming the game, and although the system is kind of resisting it.",
        "You know, because what happened is every position got bigger, blacker, faster, stronger except quarterback, because that was sort of the American ideal of mister manhood and John Wayne and all that.",
        "And you had to be smart, let them tell it.",
