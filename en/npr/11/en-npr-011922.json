        "Yeah.",
        "But if you look at what's happening now, though, with Vince Young, that position, the quarterback position now, is going to be the last frontier of transformation...",
        "Lem Barney, let me ask you this, and Mel pick up after the point that will Lem will make here, and that's the idea, Lem, of the sense of this kind of old boys network that is also the NFL.",
        "Do you see that changing?",
        "Yes, I do see that changing in great facets, particularly with the coaching scenario, the front office administration, but again, going back to the offset of the evolution, Mel made mention of it, but the whole middle's perspective of the football offense and defense was void when we came in except for Willie Woods at free safety.",
        "Middle linebacker evolved into the first type of American, and Willie Lanier, then the center from the gentlemen from down at the Miami Dolphins and then the quarterback, first quarterback, I mean, Sandy Stephens was plugged, but the first active African-American quarterback to play was Marlin Briscoe, but the game has evolved around, Mel had a point about big guys during our years in the early, in the middle and late 70s and 60s was if there was a big guy on any team at 300 pounds, he was sort of like an oaf.",
        "He just blocked up the middle and clogged up the middle.",
        "Today, every team has five and six to seven 300-poounders that can run down four 440 running backs.",
        "So the game has made a tremendous evolution, Ed.",
        "Mel, let me ask you this.",
        "The persona, particularly of the black athlete.",
        "I grew up in Detroit.",
        "You know, when you guys came in the league, I was seven-years old, and I idolized you all, and you and Lem were two of the coolest cats to come into the city.",
        "I mean, there's no doubt about that, but we also the persona of the black athlete when that had been resisted for a long, long time, that you should tow the line, that you should be more corporate, that you should homogenize yourself more.",
        "Talk to me about how you dealt with that, and also what you see today in a Terrell Owens, or others, who many look at and say that that's the bastardization of what we've seen of the cool black athlete.",
        "Well, you know what?",
        "And I have to say, and I want to go back to my original point I made, when you said the change down the middle, you know, but if you look at, you mentioned my brother, you know.",
        "He was all-pro defensive back.",
        "He was a quarterback in high school.",
        "You look at Mel Farr.",
        "Mel Farr was a quarterback in high school.",
        "You look at Lem Barney.",
        "Lem Barney was a quarterback in high school, you know.",
        "So, but we all played the other positions because of the fact that it was not available for us to play back then.",
        "Now, you look at where the black athlete is today.",
        "They've got more opportunities, you know.",
        "I could not dream and aspire to be a coach in the National Football League when I retired.",
        "There were no blacks coaching the football league.",
        "So I couldn't be a head coach.",
        "I couldn't be a general manager, you know, so that was not available for us then.",
        "Now, the next step is that we've got some great black athletes out there.",
        "They're very intelligent, you know.",
        "Now, the next step, you know, we need to go look at ownership.",
        "You know, ownership is the next step for us, I think, as black athletes, not to want to play, but want to own.",
        "Lem, you and Mel are the personification of the athlete who in fact went from the gridiron to become successful in business.",
        "I want to get you to talk about that briefly, but I also want you to address the question of what we've seen of the black athlete today, the way the media portrays him, i.e., Terrell Owens and others, and whether or not they get a fair shake or whether they need to look in the mirror.",
        "Well, you know, Conway, when I was speaking with her earlier, praised Manafort.",
        "She praised his statesmanship, as she put it, said that he'll be continuing to stay in touch with members of Congress who are supporting Trump."

        "I think that the athlete today need to look in the mirror because as Mel mentioned earlier, during our years we had chances.",
        "Today they have opportunities.",
        "The money, the mega dollars that they're getting, and you look at a guy like Terrell Owens who seems to have over the years made a mockery of the game rather than being gracious and thankful for the God-given skills and talents and attributes that he received, he made mockery of the game.",
        "Keyshawn Johnson, Randy Moss, these guys, I mean, you couldn't make that kind of money selling dope if it was legal, and they seem to make a mockery of the game, but the case in point with both Mel and I and the gentlemen of yesteryear, as compared to the gentlemen today, we got involved in the community, Ed, as you know.",
        "The community always was base.",
        "It was where education and training was exposed, and to try and give back for the next generation that's coming so it'll be a much better society in years to come, is something that's always been at our hearts.",
        "Bill?",
        "But let me just say this, just as a journalist and writer who's kind of observed this progression.",
        "I think you've got a difficult time because again, I think that early on, you know, black athletes came in and there was people being grateful and that kind of stuff.",
        "Now, as you know, the more money you get, sometimes the less grateful you become, and you're kind of thinking, you're demanding stuff.",
        "I think the challenge now and, Mel, you really hit it when you said ownership, you've got a league now that's 67 percent brothers.",
        "Now the question is, there's a lot of power, there's a lot of potential power.",
        "And I think that the challenge of, I think, we just had a coaching thing where you had ten openings.",
        "Ten openings, and not one black coach was hired.",
        "And you've got a lot of young brothers who are really sharp coaches, really qualified.",
        "So to me, I think you really have to look at it because what that means is, wait a minute, you got a league that's 67 percent, but you guys don't control anything.",
        "You've got no power and I think that has to be the quest of this particular time.",
        "How do you transform that into power?",
        "Lem, I want to ask you and Mel the same question Lem, I'll start with you.",
        "The idea, and we heard in the first segment, James Brown attacked that and Bill brings it up.",
        "Were you shocked, surprised at all that with the number of openings we saw in head coaching ranks that we did not see one black hire, particularly after a year or two ago, the NFL saying that they wanted to make sure that minorities were given a fair look and shot?",
        "Was I shocked?",
        "Most assuredly again it's something that's always been in my heart.",
        "I've never had an inkling to coach, but I've always been coachable.",
        "And as Bill just alluded to, there are a lot of young sharp, African-American coaches who have been coordinators, both offensive and defensive but have never given a shot.",
        "You look at the Detroit Lions again they went out and got another coach this year.",
        "I have nothing against Rod Marinelli.",
        "I trust and pray that he'll do great with the Lions, but no interviews last year for African Americans.",
        "No interviews this year for potential African-American coaches.",
        "And it's a travesty, as to the reason, not only to the Detroit Lions, but the whole NFL does not look at that picture.",
        "Because when you look at it, Bill made the assertion, 64 percent are African Americans, they need some people to be able to be over them as head coaches.",
        "I think the response will be much better as for the output of ball players' performance.",
        "Mel, what about a former player like yourself who still has contact, connection, affiliation, a love for the NFL, how do you deal with what you see, in terms of the progress, but also what Lem talks about in the idea of the stagnation that's still there?",
        "Are you a force to talk to Tagliabue and the others to say, Look fellas, you know the trappings are good, but we need to really make end roads here."

        "So what I am looking, and I want to say that, you know, there are no black owners in the National Football League.",
        "So my quest is ownership.",
        "If we can change the ownership, then we can change the complexion of the coaches and etc., so you know, so I think the National Football League should look at having black ownership.",

        "I am stay on the point of let's get some black ownership there in the National Football League.",

        "And what they need to do is pool that money together.",
        "Their ownership would be something that could be realized.",
        "The league would have to look at it, as Mel has mentioned.",
        "Ownership is something that we have not been able to thrust upon, as of yet.",
        "But it's just right around the corner.",
