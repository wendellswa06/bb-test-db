        "Hey, David.",
        "I feel like we are throwing around so many big numbers, and this is moving so quickly.",
        "Can you just remind us how we actually arrived at this moment?",
        "OK.",
        "Well, this started out fairly small, as a dispute over Chinese alleged dumping of steel and aluminum.",
        "And tariffs on those were not terribly damaging to either side.",
        "Then the next one was to punish China for stealing or coercing U.S.",
        "companies into giving up their intellectual property.",
        "And the Trump administration announced $50 billion worth of tariffs, and China announced exactly the same.",
        "But those haven't taken effect yet.",
        "And so now Trump has promised to double that, go up to a hundred billion.",
        "But still, it's all just talk at this point.",
        "So all just talk.",
        "I mean, there's an expectation there are going to be some sort of negotiations going on at some point, but for now, what happens?",
        "Where does this go?",
        "Do both sides just keep adding more numbers of tariffs?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, China really had no choice but to respond quickly after Washington's latest threats.",
        "So what it says is that if the U.S.",
        "keeps on provoking it like this, it's going to strike back resolutely.",
        "It's not saying exactly what it can do.",
        "And here's the reason why.",
        "The U.S.",
        "tariffs total $150 billion on China's exports.",
        "But the U.S.",
        "only exported $130 billion to China last year.",
        "So they can't hit them with that.",
        "They'll have to do something else.",
        "Of course, these two economies are so deeply intertwined if they want to make life difficult for each other's companies, they have a lot of ways they can do it.",
        "If there weren't so much - if there wasn't so much money at stake and there weren't markets that were responding to all of this, I mean, I guess we could pass this off as something feeling like a poker game.",
        "But it's a pretty significant one.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Elliot.",
        "All right, thank you.",
        "I love Yiddish.",
        "As far as the direction of the campaign - Steve Bannon has a reputation for tough rhetoric.",
        "Lewandowski has described him as a street fighter.",
        "And you know, Conway was asked whether the campaign is going to get nastier now.",
        "She said you'll have to ask Hillary Clinton about that, but then she added that this is not a Tea Party - so sort of implying that, you know, we may see some tougher rhetoric."

        "What's notable about Bannon is that Breitbart News under his leadership has really channeled the anger of the GOP establishment from - anger at the establishment from the conservative movement - you know, this sort of vein of populism, a hard line on illegal immigration that Trump has taken.",
        "So if anyone's looking for a change in tone from Trump, hiring Steve Bannon doesn't signal that.",
        "And then Conway stressed that she wants this campaign to be about issues, which is really a big part of her job - being on the road with Trump, having his ear before he gives speeches, making sure his message is coming across effectively.",
        "You know, she is a pollster, so that's something she has a background in.",
        "And, Audie, one thing a source close to the campaign told me today is that Trump clearly, quote, \"\"wants someone who doesn't want to change him but just wants to make him a better bulldozer operator.",
        "In the meantime, Donald Trump received his first classified intelligence briefing today in New York.",
        "What more do you know about that?",
        "So NPR was told that Trump was bringing two advisers with him - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former federal prosecutor, and also the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.",
        "We know that he sat down for a national security roundtable here at Trump Tower today with more than a dozen advisers, including Flynn and also New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.",
        "I was allowed in that meeting just for a couple of minutes, and one of the big topics was anti-terrorism surveillance and how to frame surveillance of places like mosques.",
        "Giuliani noted that when he became mayor of New York, one of the first things he did was put police officers in mosques.",
        "And they were talking about how to communicate about that to the public.",

        "Immigration groups say he's guilty of racial profiling.",
        "Over the past few years, a federal judge has ordered Arpaio's department to stop detaining immigrants and stop pulling over Latinos on the mere suspicion that they're in the country illegally.",
        "Arpaio keeps ignoring those orders.",
        "In stunning court testimony back in April, the sheriff acknowledged that he started investigations related to the federal judge on the case.",
        "And Arpaio asked the judge to recuse himself.",
        "Joining us now to talk about the latest developments in this case is Jude Joffe-Block of member station KJZZ in Phoenix.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Good morning.",

        "Federal Judge Murray Snow has been on this case - it's a class action racial profiling case - for the last six years.",
        "Two years ago, Judge Snow ruled against the sheriff.",
        "He found Maricopa County Sheriff's Office discriminated against Latinos.",
        "And he ordered sweeping changes at the office.",
        "But then, it came out last year, the sheriff's office had repeatedly violated court orders.",
        "In fact, Arpaio even admitted he's in contempt of court.",
        "The judge set a contempt hearing to find out the extent of the violations and determine appropriate remedies, which are likely to include fines.",
        "And I think it's interesting to note here that Judge Snow represents the biggest challenge to Arpaio's authority in his six terms as the county's elected sheriff.",
        "The judge said he may even refer this case for criminal contempt charges against Arpaio.",
        "And the hearing was scheduled to resume next Tuesday.",
        "But it has been delayed after this recusal request.",
        "Explain what the accusation is that leads the sheriff's attorneys to call on Judge Snow to recuse himself from this case.",
        "So the recusal motion is mostly based on a line of questioning by the judge in April.",
        "Judge Snow asked Arpaio directly if anyone had investigated the judge or his family.",
        "Arpaio did say he launched two investigations.",
        "They began in 2013, right after Judge Snow ruled against the sheriff in the racial profiling case.",
        "And many believe these probes were an effort to expose possible bias by Judge Snow and force him off the case.",
        "In the first investigation, the sheriff's lawyer hired a private investigator to examine whether the judge's wife said her husband hated Arpaio and wanted to get him out of office.",
        "So I understand the reasons for the second probe are in dispute.",
        "That's right.",
        "And this is where the story gets even weirder.",
        "Arpaio admitted his department hired a man in Seattle named Dennis Montgomery to do a covert investigation.",
        "But Arpaio denied the investigation targeted Judges Snow.",
        "The sheriff's chief deputy testified that Montgomery had worked for the CIA and had evidence showing the agency was hacking into bank accounts of people in Maricopa County.",
        "But Judge Snow has suggested in court that Montgomery was actually hired to prove the judge was colluding with the Department of Justice against Arpaio.",
        "Because the Justice Department has its own lawsuit against the sheriff.",
        "So what's next?",
        "Once a motion to recuse is filed, it's up to the judge to decide whether to stay on the case or not, though Judge Snow could also choose to let another judge decide.",
        "Until then, the whole contempt case is on hold.",
        "And meanwhile, Arpaio had a big party this week.",
        "He's celebrating 22-and-a-half years in office, which makes him the longest-serving sheriff in Maricopa County history.",
