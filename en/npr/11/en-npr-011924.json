        "And he struck the ground in a way which hit his back and his neck and caused damage to the point where he was paralyzed.",
        "But we were very fortunate this was captured on video, and we were very fortunate that the video also showed our officers had this individual on an ambulance within four minutes and in a trauma emergency room within seven minutes.",
        "And this was shortly thereafter of Ferguson.",
        "And, you know, although we have made tremendous strides in our community over the last couple years with our police department, you know, any police chief in any community, you're fooling yourself, particularly in your most challenged communities, if you don't recognize the fact that it is a fragile relationship."

        "There's a cultural anthropologist named Simon Sinek.",
        "And Simon Sinek said the most important influence on the behavior of an officer on the street is going to be the internal culture of that police department.",
        "And so you need to focus on building a strong culture internally, where the leaders in the police department demonstrate respect and they set the tone for what they expect of their officers.",
        "Their behavior needs to model the kind of behavior they want to see on the street.",
        "So if you have a police department with a very strong, healthy culture and the officers know that if they are doing their best on the street and they're wading into a difficult situation, they know that their leaders will support them, even if things don't go well, if the officers are following policies and procedures.",

        "My question to them is: When some of you, which will happen, are seriously injured or incur other health care costs, who's going to pay your bills.",

        "If you can't pay, the hospital will still try to collect from you.",
        "But eventually, it may have to eat that cost.",

        "And what if the insurance I chose is not portable, it's not transferable to North Carolina?",

        "That's the substance of her question.",
        "That's right.",

        "As we just talked about earlier, except in specific situations, like if you lose your job and your insurance, you can only enroll or change plans during these open enrollment seasons.",
