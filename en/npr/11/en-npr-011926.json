        "Yeah, and I was going to say, you know, part of that, too, is that there is a kind of a fairness and equity issue, vis-a-vis, other employees.",
        "So if you give one person permission to work from home, then another person has to answer the phone because they're not there, is taking messages for them, is kind of doing other things and maybe starting to feel, well, if that person can work at home, why can't I work at home?",
        "And then suddenly, you've got everybody working at home and you've got no company and no sense of common purpose there.",
        "So resentments can build up and the office friction can build up, and it's another distraction.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "Nevertheless, for a lot of people, you know, some very talented people may say it's this or nothing.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, and when you're - when you have that situation, you have to make that decision.",

        "We have a lot of people who are not in the office because they're the Boise correspondent and they're going to be in Boise, for example.",
        "So it's not that telecommuting doesn't have a place.",
        "But I just think that given the choice, it's better to be in the office.",
        "If you have a very talented person who insists on working from home and you think that you really need that person and that talent, you can live with it if you have to.",
        "But all other things being equal, I think that there's a lot of power in having people in the same place, working physically close together, communicating very closely and collaborating closely.",
        "But can't that be done by conference calls, email, that sort of thing?",
        "Well, I mean, email's a great tool, and there are a lot of great tools out there.",
        "But conference calls in particular - I mean, think about a typical conference call.",
        "If it's a very directed thing with a very specific, quick agenda, that's one thing.",
        "But if you're trying to have a brainstorming session or you're trying to deal with more complex or in-depth issues, what you end up with is four people in the office sitting around the table.",
        "You've got three people on the phone.",
        "The people on the phone can't quite hear.",
        "They're sort of annoyed because they can't hear well enough.",
        "They're only half paying attention, partly because they can't hear.",
        "So they're, like, doing their email.",
        "And then you address them, and they say, oh, what?",
        "You talking to me?",

        "I've seen where it's been very clear whether employees are working or not is in the sales organization, for example.",
        "And that's an organization where you never want your employee in the office.",
        "And that's because you have a metric: Did they make the sale or not?",
        "But in software development or marketing, it's much more mushy, and people don't really understand what they expect of their teams are the ones who get in trouble when they try and manage telecommuters.",
        "Yeah, you - the point should be made, it's just as easy to play \"\"Battleship\"\" in your cubicle as it is to do at home when you're supposed to be working.",
        "But clear metrics, if you're supervising telecommuters, Jonathan Weber, a good idea to have clear understandings of how much they're expected to do.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's absolutely right.",
        "And I think that the point of the caller is very well taken in that the real issue with supervising and accountability and making sure people are doing their job does not have to do with looking over their shoulder - physically looking over their shoulder.",
        "It has to do with them understanding what the expectations are and having accountability in that way.",
        "One of the things that I've always loved about the media business is that it's a very accountable business.",
        "I'm supervising reporters and salespeople, and most of those jobs are things where, you know, the story is there and it's good or it's not, and it's not.",
        "So I don't find the issue with telecommuting, for me, to be the question of whether people are working or not or whether they're goofing off at home or not.",
        "That's actually not something I worry about.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "One of things I think that studies have shown is no matter if a company says, yes, you can telecommute, it's up to you, there's still a stigma attached to people who telecommute - even today.",
        "I would look back to a survey that CompTIA did in 2007, and it showed that, you know, 60 percent of companies were - the people who were telecommuting were actually productive.",
        "They were very productive.",
        "And, however, those 61 percent of surveyed executives believe that, you know, telecommuters are less likely to advance in their careers when compared with employees who work in the traditional office setting.",
        "So there's a real…",
        "Even though they're productive, they're not seen as being committed to the company.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Because they're - they don't have that face time.",
        "And I think that's what Jonathan, you know, likes.",
        "And think a lot of people, you know, have to have those personal relationships.",
        "But I would to point today, that, you know, the sea change we're all witnessing is that the Facebook and the Twitter and the Web 2.0 is really having - people are building relationships online.",
        "It is natural, especially when you look at the next generation of workers.",
        "If they have a laptop, a mobile device and an Internet connection, they're good to go.",
        "I mean, we've moved well beyond the industrial age here of the worker bees and the time clocks.",
        "And I think Jonathan(ph) made a good point about deliverables, and if they're not delivering, then they're not doing their job and they should not be able to have the benefit.",
        "But there has got to be that trust and expectation and deliverables, and I think that's important.",
        "We have this email on the career-killer part of what you were just mentioning.",
        "I worked as a full-time copywriter at a small advertising agency in New York, writes Harold(ph) in Southampton, New York, and I had a two-hour commute each way to work.",
        "As an 11-year employee, I requested telecommuting a few days a week and was told by my boss it would be fine.",
        "Not long thereafter, due to a loss of a client, I was laid off with no severance, no notice.",
        "A second copywriter was kept on staff, but I think the fact that I telecommuted endangered it, engendered ill will among the full-timers.",
        "That's why I was laid off.",
        "So telecommuting has its advantages and its inherent risks.",
        "So that goes to your point there, Tom.",
        "Yeah, I would also add, too, you know, sometimes I do have to commute back into Boston, to the office, and as I'm sitting there on 95 and the turnpike, just looking at all these people sitting in their cars like corpses, and I just - I think, what a colossal waste of time, energy, productivity that we're doing here, just sitting here by commuting an hour and a half to two hours, and I think that's what's important, that all managers should understand, is that first off, security gets thrown out there as a limiter.",
        "But today, and I talk to CIOs about this, is there's actually nothing from a technological perspective that should prevent anyone, you know, knowledge workers, from telecommuting today.",
        "The security is there, the teleconferencing, the instant messaging, the email, the virtual private networks, that's been figured out."
