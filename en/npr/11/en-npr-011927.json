        "And it attracts both independents, people who are writers or software developers or entrepreneurs, but also people who work at larger companies that are looking for a change of pace or a different working environment for the day.",

        "And that's part of what Jelly is about, bringing that back in, in a quantity that is actually productive.",
        "And it's that sort of social interaction, even if it's on the basis of, did you see that show on TV last night?",
        "Well, that just sort of makes life - it lubricates our existence a little bit.",
        "I think so, and I think it makes it a little bit more tolerable.",
        "When you're sitting at home, especially, and you feel kind of isolated, it's easy to not only just feel isolated from humanity but also to feel isolated from your professional community.",

        "And we bring in people from, you know, cutting-edge tech companies like Google and Yahoo and Twitter and so forth.",
        "And presumably you could bring them in on a feed from some remote location.",
        "But in the spirit of the Jelly, you bring them in live.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And they get broadcast out to the other Jellies that are occurring at the same time.",
        "So they are set out.",
        "But I guess it's just an example of a way that we can help people who are feeling a little disconnected because they're working from home and not only give them a local community, but also give them a broader community to be a part of.",
