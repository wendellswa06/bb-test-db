        "Now a gentleman, who now happens to know his guitars was probably doing that way before this market crisis came on up.",
        "And let's face it, if history's any guide, there are a lot of the investments that we've seen whether they're - and you mentioned the worm farms from the '70s, and we've seen the emus and the ostriches and the antique gold coins and the more sophisticated ones, ones like foreign currency trading and off shore tax shelters, but you know, these investments a lot of times, is they're not going to be worth the paper that they were printed on.",
