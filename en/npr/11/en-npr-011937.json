        "In 1988, for example, Justice Anthony Kennedy did not arrive at the court until late February.",
        "The court had operated for six months with eight justices, and in most instances, when they were equally divided, the justices simply listed the cases for re-argument before a full court later so that Kennedy could cast the deciding vote.",
        "Similarly, when Justice Harry Blackman arrived in 1970, the court had been operating for a full year with only eight justices and there were 17 deadlocked cases from the previous term that were re-argued for the second and some for the third time.",

        "As to the assignment of written opinions, O'Connor's a famously fast writer, so the assumption is that she will be assigned to write decisions in a couple of early cases that can be disposed of quickly.",
        "Much of the focus in the immediate future, though, will be on the new chief justice, John Roberts.",
        "On Friday, the newly sworn chief arrived at the court to begin work.",
        "He's hired all six members of the late chief justice's staff and brought two law clerks and a secretary of his own from the appeals court.",

        "Yes, the chief justice is only one of nine votes, but he has many duties as head of the third branch of government and even within the court.",

        "He summarizes the issues in each case before the other justices speak and vote.",
        "He assigns who will write decisions when he's in the majority, and he's responsible for making up the initial list of which cases among the hundreds that come in each week is to be discussed as a possible case for hearing."
