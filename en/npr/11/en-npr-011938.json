        "So there's going to be a lot of jockeying positions, dramatic change in the internal dynamics of the court.",
        "Viet Dinh thinks that Roberts will be an engaged and engaging chief who may have influence beyond his role of chief.",
        "I think where Chief Justice Roberts will have a significant role is in his, you know, vaunted interpersonal skills in dealing with members of the court whom he knows intimately as an advocate and knows the fault lines of their jurisprudence and also their personalities.",

        "Also to be argued next month is the challenge to the so-called Solomon Amendment, which cuts off all federal aid to universities if they don't allow the military to recruit lawyers on campus.",
        "The law was passed after many law schools required the military to recruit off campus because the school viewed the military's `don't ask, don't tell' rule as violating the school's anti-discrimination policy.",
        "It will be gradual, but I think it's a good beginning because Tibetans in 30 countries voted for me overwhelmingly and also, it's as per the authorization of His Holiness Dalai Lama that the head of the government-of-exile be the political spokesman and face of the Tibetan people.",
        "In that sense, I will enjoy his extended traditional and political legitimacy as well as the democratic legitimacy of being elected.",

        "Hello.",
        "What is absolute zero?",
        "How cold is it?",
        "Absolute zero is the lowest temperature, which is possible.",
        "Different temperature scales reflect a lot of history and human nature, but as a scientist, I would say there is only one point on the temperature scale, which is really universal, and this is absolute zero.",
        "And that determines what is zero degrees in the absolute temperature scale, which is measured by Kelvin.",
        "The lower the temperature, the less energy is available or the slower the atoms and molecules move, and at absolute zero, there is zero available energy; there is zero motion.",
        "So an atom or a molecule at absolute zero would just stop moving.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that makes it obvious why it is not possible to get to even lower temperatures because there is no less motion than no motion.",
        "But it's also impossible to reach absolute zeros, am I correct in saying that?",
        "It's just a theoretical idea.",
        "Well, I think this often leads to some confusion.",
        "We can get closer and closer and closer and we are within, you know, some millions of a millions of a degree close to absolute zero, but we can't really reach it because that would mean to do a perfect job, and a perfect is not possible.",
        "There's always a tiny little bit of energy which we can't remove.",
        "And why?",
        "Well, if you go to very, very low temperature, the atoms move more and more slowly, and in order to sort of cool them to get them to manipulate them, it takes longer and longer and longer.",
        "So the lower the temperature we want to achieve, the more patient we have to be or the more elaborate skills we have to develop.",
        "Like what?",
        "I mean, what does it take - this is not something you'd throw into the freezer.",
        "How do you get something so super cold?",
        "Well, in a way, we have freezers but special freezers, and you may even say that a major part in my Nobel Prize was building a freezer, but not a freezer which would be useful in the kitchen.",
        "It's a freezer which uses laser beams and vacuum and radio waves, a lot of, you know, nice gadgets and tricks to take energy out of a gas and bring atoms virtually to a standstill."

        "Well, Chinese government is likely to do that.",

        "Is it possible, though, for the United States to openly support you - I mean, considering its trade and its financial ties with China?",
        "You know, the founding principles of the United States, and the freedom struggle of the United States and the civil rights movement, and the election of Barack Obama all indicates that there are many, many other principles - like freedom, morality, civil liberties - which are underlying values ingrained in American people, in America as a country.",
