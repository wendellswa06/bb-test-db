        "Pretty soon there's going to be people that - who look at their own body image and they may not be that much overweight, but they don't like it and, darn, they just don't or can't diet and they want to get this thing fixed.",
        "Unfortunately, Shekelle says, there may be a surgery center or doctor willing to help them do that.",
