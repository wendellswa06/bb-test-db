        "Well, it's more whiplash as - on his way to his first big rally of his reelection campaign, that's when he said he was going to deport millions.",

        "On the other hand, he has competing political imperatives because his immigration policies are costing him with independent voters, with suburban women.",

        "And our reporters say that if he had gone ahead with the raids, it could've endangered the humanitarian border aid package that had not been finalized on the Hill.",
        "So we're back to square one on the deportations, too.",
        "All right.",

        "For centuries, the foundation of human society, the basic building block, was the family: parents, children, grandchildren, passing knowledge and wealth down through generations.",
        "But all signs seem to indicate that in many parts of the world, the family is on the decline, and singles are on the rise.",
        "By 2050, experts expect there will be two billion people on the planet older than 60, and for the first time in history, seniors will outnumber children 14 and under.",
        "So we're wondering if you've seen signs of this in your own neighborhood.",
        "Do you see your family or community aging, and what do you think it means?",

        "Well, that it really talks about is - you know, in a way it's what you referred to earlier.",
        "Family has been the building block of almost every society in the world as far as we can go back, and now we are in a situation where family is sort of beginning to become maybe a choice, certainly not the normative force, certainly not the dominant force in holding society together that it was in the past.",
        "This is happening, obviously, in some places more than others and in different ways.",
        "One of the things about our team is it was a very diverse team, people coming from different religions and perspectives.",
        "So we really tried to extend our reach as far as we could and to try to see the specifics.",
        "But the trend overall is a very powerful one.",
        "All right, so what is causing it?",
        "Well, there are many things.",
        "It varies in different countries, to a degree.",
        "One, some of it is a reflection of some positive trends.",
        "The growing prosperity in parts of the world certainly has led people to have different options, not being dependent on family.",
        "Certainly another good thing has been the liberation of women and their movement in the university systems and in the professions, which has given them other options.",
        "Another factor seems to be urbanization and densification, in other words people living in more expensive, smaller spaces, therefore not being able to have children or being less likely to have children.",
        "Those are three of the major ones.",
        "And then there are other factors.",
        "Certainly the relative decline of religion in many countries, you know, they make a joke about in Czechoslovakia, in the Czech Republic, that there are more people who believe in UFOs than believe in God.",
        "So I think that you have some factor there.",
        "We also see very low birth rates in most of the former communist countries, as well.",

        "It turns out in most of western Europe, the price of cigarettes is higher than it is in the U.S.",
        "We tax cigarettes, but Europeans tax them much more.",

        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "The second thing you would think about is income.",

        "That explains a bit of it, but nowhere near the huge reductions in smoking we see.",
        "Well how big is the difference?",
        "The difference is about a third.",
        "Roughly 1 in 4 Europeans smoke compared to about 1 in 7 Americans.",

        "The stringency with which things are enforced will vary as well.",
        "But on paper it's much, much stricter.",
        "So, just like in the United States, at least on paper, you can't smoke in restaurants and bars and that kind of thing.",

        "Medical discoveries are very big news in the United States, and I think in parts of Europe they're a little bit less so.",
        "And then I think the public pressure that comes along with the public health messages, the peer pressure, the social pressure among many groups--particularly better educated groups higher up in the social distribution--has led to a sense that smoking is so obviously bad that one should not really engage in it at all.",
        "We're talking with David Cutler, an economist at Harvard University about a study he co-wrote about why Europeans smoke more than Americans.",
