        "Maybe we're not paying attention to that part of the public health message.",
        "It is--you are exactly right.",
        "Americans have learned how to do some things extremely well, and other things we have not learned about at all.",

        "This rate of smoking, in addition to being low--it actually used to be much higher in the U.S., but half of the people who ever smoked have quit.",
        "Smoking tobacco is one of the most addictive substances we know of, yet people have managed to figure out how to get rid of that.",
        "On the obesity side, America is--if you look at the sort of developed countries of Western Europe and North America--America is the most obese country.",
        "And the second most obese country isn't even very close.",
        "So we have figured out how to cure our addiction to tobacco, and we have substituted an addiction for food in its place.",
        "I can hear the public health advocates already, writing in and saying we haven't figured it out quite yet.",
        "That statement might be a little bit premature, but I think we get your point in general.",

        "Hello.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Every time I go to Europe, and I will disclose that I am a smoker--every time I go to Europe I ask myself that question: how can these people be so tin and look so healthy when it seems like everybody is smoking?",
        "The question that I have for your guest is what does stress contribute to the issue of smoking or non-smoking?",
        "I see smoking as a type of relaxation, and it seems that a lot of people in Europe seem to be a lot more relaxed than us uptight Americans.",
        "Is there an issue with stress levels or work ethic, anything like that?"

        "It's an excellent question.",
        "I think part of the reason why people who are less high up on the social scale smoke more is because of the stresses of daily life leave people almost no outs, and so smoking becomes an out for them.",
        "Although, that much said, people who are higher up in the social scale face more stresses than they used to, but they don't take it out by way of smoking.",
        "It may be a little bit of that is taken out by way of obesity.",
        "I think, on obesity, there's a big part of it which is just that food is much more available in the U.S.",
        "than it is in Europe.",
        "You can walk into any building in the U.S.",
        "and find a vending machine with snacks that are cheap and that taste reasonably good--certainly much better than they did a couple of decades ago.",
        "One doesn't see that in Europe, probably because it's regulated or because it's taxed much higher.",
        "And so, the availability of the food is much greater.",
        "Indeed, the way that Americans, availability is a common thread between both smoking and obesity.",
        "The way that we get rid of smoking is by keeping cigarettes out of our house, out of our buildings, out of our restaurants, out of our public spaces.",
        "The way we get obese is we allow the food into those...",
        "All those places.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "And then, in each case we find it easy to resist when it's not there, or easier to resist when its not there, and virtually impossible to resist when it is there.",

        "That is, people who smoke pay more for life insurance, and that's one discouragement for smoking.",
        "Health insurance is very interesting in that, in almost no cases do employers make people pay more if they're smokers, even though they will use more in the way of medical care resources.",
        "It's one of the things that economists have wondered over, as to why shouldn't we have more of that.",
        "But probably, for some types of insurance, life insurance that would be, that may be part of the explanation.",
        "Also in, we just have a few seconds left.",
        "And Barrington, thanks very much for the call.",
        "We just have a few seconds left, but, you would think that cancer rates would at least, given this disparity, show a similar disparity.",
        "Indeed, they are starting to show that disparity.",
        "Lung cancer seems to lag smoking by about 20 to 25 years.",
        "And what we're seeing now in the U.S.",
        "is the substantial reductions in smoking that occurred over the past couple of decades seem like they're starting to have an impact on cancer mortality.",
        "That's something that the U.S.",
        "is likely to enjoy that a lot of Europe will not."
