        "Her generation, the millennials, who really will be shaping our society here in the United States over the next 20 years, certainly they have some attitudes that may lead them not to have children, but also let's talk about another factor, which is economics.",
        "I mean, the United States' birth rate was actually going up for quite a long time before the recession.",
        "It was above what we call replacement rate.",
        "In other words, that we were replacing ourselves, which is about where you want to be.",
        "And I think what we've seen is a precipitous drop in the number of younger people in particular having children, delaying marriage.",
        "Now, those people I look to who have analyzed the millennial population the most still believe that if the economy recovers that their value system will have most of them have children.",
        "But, you know, what Patrice is saying is what I hear from my own students at Chapman.",
        "Many of the students are saying, well, I'm not sure I'm going to have kids, whereas in my generation and even more so - I'm a boomer - and my parents' generation, having children was pretty much everybody was going to have to children.",
        "De rigueur, yeah, everybody did that.",

        "Well, hi, good morning here.",
        "Good morning.",
        "Yeah, I just recently moved from town to outer - outside of Honolulu suburban area, and what I have found is that you have many, many multigenerational homes, with grandparents and great-grandparents and grandkids living together, and they have been living together since the '50s.",
        "But all new people moving in and buying homes are either moving from the mainland for retirement purposes or are older with a lot of, well, income just because of the nature of housing prices.",
        "Right.",
        "So they neighborhood I'm going in used to a thriving family neighborhood, and the schools and the infrastructure were all for that.",
        "And now it's significantly graying, and the school populations are dropping, and you just have a lot less younger people coming to the neighborhood.",
        "OK, that's - thank you very much.",
        "That was Stan calling us from Honolulu, Hawaii.",
        "But Joel, why is this really an issue?",
        "I mean, the last I checked, we were overpopulated, the globe was overpopulated.",
        "We're still expecting to hit 10 billion by 2050, right?",

        "He'll also set benchmarks for measuring progress in the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban.",
        "Well, I mean in some senses you could say it's a good thing, but where - in the sense that, you know, maybe - first of all, we don't know exactly where the population is going to go because we're now seeing these trends in developing countries.",
        "My colleague who worked on the report, Ali Modarres, found some very interesting data in the Middle East, where some countries actually now have birth rates lower than ours.",
        "So I think that there's - this may become a problem.",
        "But here's the real problem.",
        "When you have very low fertility rates, it may be OK for a while, but over time your population gets older and older.",
        "And as your population gets older and older, as I think Stan was pointing out, what you start to see is, if you will, the ecosystem for families begins to weaken.",
        "You have - the schools begin to close down.",
        "The kind of restaurants and facilities you have, the tax system has to change in order to support the older people.",

        "That's an incredible statistic.",
        "That's really mind-blowing.",
        "I mean, you already have many societies, like Japan, where there are more people over 60 than under 15.",
        "It's just not a pretty picture.",
        "So we have to start thinking about how we can at least break this, slow it down and find a way that people can still have families.",
        "Not everyone will have families.",
        "Lots of people will choose not to have families.",
        "I think that trend will continue.",
        "But we have to be able to say how do we support, nurture family formation and people having children, or else we're going to be in an impossible situation, if nothing else fiscally.",
        "Well, just in the short term, though, I mean we have to take a break in a moment, but I assume that means just in the short term until the population sort of balances out.",
        "Well, you're going to have to continue to have children.",
        "If you don't have children, you just end up in situation where not only do you start having seniors, but you start having the very old being one of the largest parts of society.",

        "In 2010, a third of Japanese women in their 30s were single; one in five Japanese women entering their 40s were also single.",
        "One sociologist projects that in less than two decades, almost one in three Japanese males may be unmarried by age 50.",
        "So Joel Kotkin, these statistics came straight out of your report \"\"The Rise of Post-Familialism.\"\" What is it about East Asia that makes this a particular problem there?",
        "Well, I think there are several things.",
        "One, when we were talking about density, you obviously have very dense, very expensive housing.",
        "Right, and landlocked in Japan.",
        "Right, and also a very concentrated system in which really the only part of Japan that's really growing is Tokyo.",
        "So if you have any kind of ambition, that's where you go.",
        "So you certainly have that.",
        "You also have the factor that, and it's sort of an odd thing, but because very few people have children out of wedlock, that option is gone, as well.",
        "So, you know, basically if you make the decision not to get married, you're probably not going to have kids, either.",
        "That's certainly a factor.",
        "And then these are societies, in many cases, that are not particularly religious, and a lot of the sort of old Confucian morality has really dropped.",
        "I mean, when I started working in China and studying East Asia back 30 years ago, family was at the center of everything.",
        "These were Confucianist societies, which were very much based around the family.",
        "That has really changed tremendously, mostly in Japan but now in Korea, Taiwan and of course where I work quite a bit, in Singapore.",
        "Well, we're also wondering how many of you out there are seeing this in your own communities.",

        "So we're kind of - our family dynamic changed, in that I might not have my own family, meaning my own children, but my role in the family as a whole, you know, from being part of my parents' family and supporting my sisters' has really grown.",

        "What's scary is in much of East Asia, in the United States in the future and in Europe, there are no uncles.",
        "There are no aunts.",
        "And so that whole extended family network, which still exists for the current generation, may not exist in the future because obviously in the future, if you have a family where, you know, only one person had children, they only had one, the whole realm of aunts and uncles - in Italy it's now believed that the vast majority of young people in the next generation will have no aunts, no uncles."

        "No, they certainly weren't always nice, but they were important, and very often they still, you know, provided shelter, got a job.",
