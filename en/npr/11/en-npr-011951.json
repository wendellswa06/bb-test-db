        "But I want to make one very important point, and this is - may be a little bit on the contentious side.",
        "Yes, we have our, you know, our Facebook friends and our work friends and our neighbors, and we do care about them.",
        "I guess I can say as a father there is a big difference between having that commitment to children and having your own children.",
        "You know, somebody can say, oh, I love children, but you really love your own children.",
        "I think Freud was quite perceptive when he said that when we try to equalize our affections to a more universal group, we sort of downgrade and take away from those particular prejudices that we have because...",

        "I'm estranged from my family.",
        "I didn't have a particularly happy childhood.",
        "I imagine that for some people, the family experience is not sunshine and rainbows, and sometimes being able to choose your family is empowerment.",
        "Well, I think what we really are seeing here is people are making individual choices that are completely legitimate and completely logical for themselves.",
        "And so we went out of our way to say we're not making a judgment.",
        "We don't think there's something wrong with people not having children or not getting married.",
        "But what we're saying is if you take this as an aggregate, and you look over an entire society, the effects could be quite severe.",
        "So, sure, people choose not to have families for lots of reasons, lots of legitimate reasons.",
        "We're just saying if we go on this path in the future, we will start to begin to experience the types of things that, for instance, Japan is already feeling.",
        "A zero-sum game.",
        "All right, let's hear here from Karen(ph) in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
        "Karen, you say it's too expensive.",
        "Yes, I'm 34 years old, and I'm single, never been married, and I pursued a career and got my Ph.D. And it kind of put me out of synch with my peers in terms of where they were at in their career and getting married.",
        "And so I wouldn't be able to afford to have a child.",
        "And my sister, who does have a child who's five years old, my niece, she'll grow up without any first cousins because her father, his brother also doesn't have kids.",
        "So she's not going to have any first cousins.",
        "That's Karen in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
        "Thanks for calling, Karen.",

        "That was not my experience growing up.",
        "I found it interesting, though, we're speaking with Joel Kotkin, he's the author of this report, one of the authors of \"\"The Rise of Post-Familialism,\"\" and he's a distinguished presidential fellow in urban futures at Chapman University in California.",
        "But Joel, one of the things I found interesting is one of your solutions to this is further empowerment of women.",
        "Explain this: if it was the empowerment of women, high education, able to make choices about their career, if that's what leading to post-familialism, how do you solve it by empowering them further?",
        "You know, in Singapore, they have very nice stipends for people to have kids.",
        "And we had a wonderful conversation with a young woman who - we kept saying, how much would it take for you to have a kid, you know?",
        "And when we get up to $1 million and she still said, no, we figured we'd better give up."

        "Well, first of all, you have to understand you can't reverse this trend.",
        "This is just - so you have to sort of work with it, and this is particularly true in East Asia where we - where one of the reasons women told us they didn't want to get married is they figured, well, I'm working anyway, and I'm going to get married, and my husband is not going to help raise the kid or do any of the chores.",
        "So one of the things we kept saying is, men have got to step up - whether in this country...",
        "Here, here.",
        "...but in East Asia, they tend not to step up at all.",
        "And so the burden of having children becomes much worse when your partner doesn't help and so...",
        "Not to mention the fact that you also point out that having a child increases a woman's chances of being poor.",
        "They're paid less.",
        "We should also fix income inequality, right, Joel?",
        "Well, I think we have to increase upward mobility in general, and certainly have more options for women.",
        "I think there's also a lot we can do about whether it's male or female, or gay couples for that matter, in terms of having people being able to work at home, have more flexible hours.",
        "You know, one of the great culprits here that we identify is modern competitive capitalism which desperately needs human capital but in many ways works in ways to make it very difficult to produce the future human capital because of the demands put on people.",
        "This came out again and again in our interviews in Singapore with very talented young women who - many cases wanted to have children but felt that they could not have them and still have the careers they wanted.",
        "Well, let's go to Robin here.",
        "She's calling from Minneapolis, Minnesota.",

        "So I am 28 years old, and I have a partner that lives with me.",
        "We just bought a four-bedroom house in a suburb that it's in a great school district, and yet, we're choosing not to have children.",
        "And our reason for it is that, you know, our society has really been drilling it into us since we were in grade school, that the baby boomers are going to put such a financial stress and weight on the upcoming generations to care for them, that - I mean I remember being in third grade and basically being told by teachers and family members that the responsible thing to do is to prevent that snowball from happening.",
        "So my advice to try to fix this problem would be to go back to that point in our education program and let people know that the effect that we're having is reversing that.",
        "And now, the financially responsible thing to do would be to have a generation that can take care of our generation.",
        "We don't have to be concerned about the baby boomers weighing us all down.",
        "In fact, we all need to step up and do something.",
        "That being said, I'm still not going to have kids.",

        "We had the baby boom - at least in the United States - we had the baby boomer generation, and then eventually, we'll go back to another boom.",
        "Well, I don't think we'll have a baby boom in the same way for lots of reasons, having to do with the - first of all, there was a tremendous amount of pent-up demand.",
        "There have been a depression, then a war, and so, you know, it was sort of like, you know, bar the door in 1945, '46 in a way that probably we'll never see again.",
        "But I think the key thing may very well be that the millennial generation will have enough children, and they're such a large generation, that they may keep the United States, at least, at a position where our population will still be relatively younger than our competition.",

        "But through his research, do you see, you know, similar declines in birth rates in this country, or is it just a financial burden and a risks that we're asking our population to take on to have kids that's making this decline happen?",
        "OK.",
        "Thanks.",
        "That's Matt in Elkhart, Indiana.",
        "The answer, Joel?",
        "Well, I think, first of all, we have, you know, fairly mixed results in Europe.",

        "But it doesn't seem that an extensive welfare state is enough to push people into having kids.",
        "Wow.",
        "I mean, ultimately, the decision to have children has much more to do with the overall economy, the type of housing that's available, and at some level, the culture itself.",
        "Are we interested in giving up a lot, because there's no question that having children means giving up a lot of things.",
        "The question is, what really matters?",
        "What's important?",
