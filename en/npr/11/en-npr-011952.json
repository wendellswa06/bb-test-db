        "And the wonderful thing, you're on vacation, and you look at it, you know, as a columnist, you're always working, and you're always, you always have perspective on it.",
        "But it's kind of different when you're able just to digest it.",
        "And you know I think that while the Federer and Nadal match was just one of those great sports moments, you know as a sports writer, every moment is, like last month we had the great Tiger Woods moment.",
        "There are always going to be great moments.",
        "But I think when you look at the Williams sisters, there's not going to be, I don't think there's going to be an era like that again, at least in my lifetime.",
        "I don't think we're going to ever see that soon.",
        "And...",
        "It was really, it was something to watch.",
        "And I want to talk about that with you for a moment, because a lot has been written.",
        "First of all, by way of background for anybody that possibly missed it, Venus beat her younger sister Serena in the finals.",
        "And Venus now has five Wimbledon titles, although Serena has the edge and record head-to-head matches between the two sisters.",
        "But here's the deal.",
        "A lot has been written about how Serena took the loss.",
        "Now what I saw, it seemed perfectly normal, even gracious, although clearly she was disappointed.",
        "But what did you see?",
        "Oh, she was - listen, man.",
        "She's a tremendous competitor.",
        "And she, you know, she was angry.",
        "I mean she did not want to lose that match.",
        "This was a very important match.",
        "And I think even Venus, she was going for number five.",
        "And Serena desperately wanted to win Wimbledon.",
        "That's why that match between those two, people say that it wasn't a classic?",
        "Tony, there were shots that Venus had been hitting winners on all tournament long, and nobody could return them - except her sister.",
        "They were hitting, these were two titans, they were hitting shots that nobody had been able to return all tournament, and they were routinely giving it back.",
        "That's why people were well, it wasn't a classic unless it went three sets.",
        "Well, they were, they were never going to play something that goes three sets, because they know each other too well, they're too powerful, they're too athletic.",
        "I mean, to go three sets, they probably would both die."

        "Her mother kind of chided Serena, saying you know, well, you know she's got to understand that you can't win everything, and you got to learn how to lose.",
        "And so I think that was a mother's response.",
        "And that's why those two girls have stayed grounded all the time.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",

        "The real question now, though, is, what next?",
        "If this turns out to be a one-time, fire-and-forget response to a chemical incident, it will go down in history ultimately as a losing gesture, unless of course it suffices to get Bashar al-Assad out of the mass-casualty business once and for all.",
        "Talk more about that because you have said that even if the U.S.",
        "was successful in getting Syria to back down from the use of chemical weapons, it, in effect, can push the Syrian government to use other weapons against civilians - as we mentioned, barrel bombs.",

        "In the summer of 2013, the United States and Russia did succeed in binding Syria to an agreement where most, but certainly not all, of its chemical weapons and chemical weapons capability were removed from Syria.",
        "But at the same time, Assad doubled down on civilian mass slaughter.",
        "In effect, he put the chemicals on the shelf and went after civilians with literally everything else, including elements of kitchen sinks packed into barrel bombs.",
        "That's the history.",
        "It's a very clear history, and God - God forbid, it could be repeated.",
        "Basically you're saying without some kind of intervention by outside forces, the world is simply saying, go ahead and do what you like.",
        "We're not going to interfere.",
        "I think that is precisely the message that Bashar al-Assad has received over the years, and this counts for his absolute sense of impunity.",
        "Now, look, I don't think there's any appetite in the Congress or in the administration for invading and occupying Syria.",
        "But surely exacting a price of this horrible regime is totally necessary.",
        "We've made some comparison here between the reaction of the U.S.",
        "from 2013 to now.",
        "But much has changed.",
        "And do you get the sense that - that the action we might have been able to take in 2013 is still on the table now, or have things become far more complicated when it comes to military response?",
        "You know, things are more - things are more complicated.",
        "Russia intervened militarily in September, 2015.",
        "So it is more complicated, and those risks definitely have to be taken into account.",
        "Russia did not react operationally in any particularly significant way to the operation on April 7.",
        "If we find ourselves obliged to continue with these kinds of operations, I think we should tell the Russians there will be no surprises.",
        "We'll let you know when we're going to do something.",
        "But by far, the best course of action here is for you to get your client out of this dirty business once and for all.",
        "This conflict needs some adult supervision.",
        "The United States and Russia can help provide that.",
        "But it's going to be very, very difficult if the Russians are going to tolerate mass murder on the part of their client and then try to cover it up internationally."
