        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Well, it's a little early to tell that at this point.",
        "So far, there hasn't been a lot of dramatic moves.",
        "The new health care policy they announced is possibly going to be of some assistance to some people, but it's not, I don't think, intended to make a wholesale change in their overall health insurance policy.",
        "They got 1.3 million workers in this country, and 44 percent of them get health care through Wal-Mart, which is a very low number.",
        "That leaked memo last week didn't help them at all.",
        "It didn't help them at all.",
        "And this new plan is going to probably marginally, you know, raise that 44 percent.",
        "So it's not going to do all that much.",
        "Their environmental policies that they're talking about, reducing packaging size--there's some efforts there which could make a real difference, given Wal-Mart's size and clout throughout so many markets.",
        "Even porous paving surfaces to reduce the amount of rain runoff from parking lots, that sort of thing.",
        "They're talking about a lot of things.",
        "Whether they do it, we'll see how far they go.",
        "It's certainly not clear yet.",
        "What they have made very clear and Lee Scott, the CEO, has said several times that they don't want to change their basic business model and specifically their wages.",
        "That is probably where they have come under the most criticism, their wages and benefits.",
        "And the new health care plan is not a new benefit in the sense it's not an increase in the amount that the company, I believe, is going to pay to cover its employees.",
        "Yet at the same time, the CEO says he's going to lobby Congress to increase the minimum wage.",
        "Yeah, that was a shocker.",
        "That was a very odd thing coming from pretty much any major corporation, but certainly a low-wage retailing operation like Wal-Mart, although, you know, a number of economists have pointed out that their average wage is just under $10 an hour.",
        "The current federal minimum wage is 5.15.",
        "It's not clear how much they would actually be affected if it went up a dollar.",
        "It might not even affect them.",
        "They probably have workers who are getting paid 6 and $7 in some rural areas who might be affected, but overall, out of their work force, they may actually benefit from an increase in the minimum wage because rivals, especially mom-and-pop stores, would be squeezed by that and Wal-Mart might be less squeezed.",
        "So it might actually increase their competitors' costs more than it would increase theirs?"

        "That's a possibility.",
        "The fact remains, whatever the criticism, low prices are a draw for millions of people who shop at Wal-Mart very happily to get those low prices every day, especially lower-income people.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And that's something which Wal-Mart has, you know, taken a lot of credit for and plenty of economists give them credit for it, although, you know, it's funny, I've been reading some of the academic papers that have been submitted to this conference that you reference which Wal-Mart's going to put on this Friday here in Washington, DC, and--I've been following this subject for many years, the low-wage labor market in general and Wal-Mart in particular, and I guess I never looked into this particular aspect of it.",
        "The official US government position is that Wal-Mart's prices are no lower than anybody else's, which surprised me.",
        "Basically, the economists who calculate the Consumer Price Index for the country as a whole, what they do is they say, look, whatever you buy at Wal-Mart, once you've adjusted for quality, it's no cheaper than anything else.",
        "You buy a T-shirt for 5 bucks at Wal-Mart, it's worth 5 bucks.",
        "You buy one for 10 bucks at Penney, it's twice the quality, it's worth 10 bucks.",
        "That's their official position.",
        "And when they calculate Wal-Mart's prices into the overall Consumer Price Index, they don't make adjustments downward to say they're lower.",
        "What they're basically doing is the government is essentially saying Wal-Mart is aggregating low-price commodities and putting it all in one store, which may be a service, there's no question about it.",
        "That's a valuable service in and of itself.",
        "It's not clear whether they're really offering low prices.",
        "Plenty of economists think they are.",
        "US government says they aren't.",

        "Hey, yeah, this is a real great topic.",
        "I actually read a really interesting article in Fortune maybe a year ago on Wal-Mart and, you know, farming out of jobs and that kind of activity.",
        "But at a basic level, my opinion is that it seems like Wal-Mart has saturated their market, which--you know, certainly a low-income environment, and now the honeymoon is over and that we're just seeing the dip, they're seeing their revenues drop because the market is no longer, you know, willing to continue to grow in their environment.",
        "Is that an accurate assessment?",
        "Well, in a sense it is.",
        "Not entirely, but, you know, like I said a minute ago, they're pushing into more urban areas in New York and Los Angeles and places like that where they have not historically been.",
        "There are plenty of poor people there.",
        "So they haven't tapped out the low end of the American market, but at the same time they're reaching into areas where they're not so easily accepted."

        "One of the things in Silicon Valley--of course there's certainly a lot of money in this valley and housing and everything else, and there's a Super Wal-Mart that just went in about 20 miles south of here.",
        "And I've been there.",
        "And certainly the level, the people--there's a stigma about going to Wal-Mart.",
        "I don't think just generically as a society people are going to admit they go to Wal-Mart in the Silicon Valley environment.",
        "And I don't know if that's, you know, what's happening in California or not to Wal-Mart, but it's certainly an aspect that people consider here, that they're not going to be seen at Wal-Mart and they're not going to comment to anybody that they shop at Wal-Mart.",
        "Well, Aaron Bernstein, are people going to come out of Wal-Mart carrying their stuff in Saks Fifth Avenue bags?",

        "As you mentioned, this new health care policy and that leaked memo which was a bit of an embarrassment last week when they said maybe the best way to cut or one way to cut health care costs would be to dissuade unhealthy people from applying to work here, making sure that all of their jobs had some physical aspect to it, even a checkout clerk being responsible for, at one point in their shift, to gather together the carts so that they could have higher standards in terms of people's health.",

        "They have a lot of things out there which are--probably it's going to get worse before it gets better from the standpoint of the company's image.",
        "Just today there was a case involving child discrimination laws where it appears that Wal-Mart got a break from the government in terms of what penalties it was required to pay.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the Labor Department was chastised for cutting a deal with Wal-Mart about reporting on those incidents.",
