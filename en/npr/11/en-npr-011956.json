        "And the point about public health care plans is one that Wal-Mart has come under particular criticism for in recent years, which is that because they cover such a few number of their workers, a lot of their work force that gets paid very little, poverty-level wages, ends up going on Medicaid, which is obviously the federal health care program for the poor.",
        "Basically, what that means is taxpayers are helping to foot the bill for Wal-Mart employees' health care.",
        "And that grates on the public...",
        "Ben, let me ask you, some of the other people you see in your line of work, do they shop at Wal-Mart?",
        "Some do because of the prices.",
        "And I know that Wal-Mart carries a lot of the identical items that are found in other stores and they do have lower prices, but my economic situation is such that I can afford to stay away from them.",

        "Look, we're providing a service to all kinds of people, especially poor people in this country, by providing stuff for sale at low prices.",
        "That's right.",
        "And, you know, the broader issue here is what for several years critics have been calling the Wal-Martization of the US economy, which is, you know, cutting prices for consumers, which is a good thing, but doing so to such extremes that you immiserate(ph) the work force of America, which is paying wages that people can't, you know, sustain a family on.",
        "And the question is, if everybody does that, you know, the more companies that follow that model, the more we will have more poor people in America who can't afford to buy the products at some point that they even sell in Wal-Mart.",
        "I mean, it's a negative downward spiral for the economy as a whole, which is why the critics, you know, say, look, of course you can go get a job somewhere else, you know--many people, of course, can't.",
        "But even if they could, the point is, is that an economic model that is healthy for the economy?",
        "And, you know, Wal-Mart's point is, look, we're providing low prices for poor people, and that's true.",
        "And the question is, is there some way to do that without creating more poor people, you know, and growing their own market share by having more poor people shop at their stores because they're paying them so little they can shop nowhere else?",

        "We studied the effects of Wal-Mart stores at the county level across the United States over a period beginning in the late '70s up until about the mid-1990s.",
        "What we find, looking at the retail sector, first of all, is that retail employment on the whole declined somewhat when a Wal-Mart store opens, something like a few percentage points.",
        "Not entirely surprising.",
        "Presumably, Wal-Mart has some source of efficiency gains, and one of those is likely reduced employment for the same amount of sales.",
        "We also find when we look at the aggregate labor market, total employment or total earnings, that total employment is left about the same when a Wal-Mart store opens, but total earnings decline somewhat, again on the order of a few percentage points at the county level.",
        "Which suggests that the same number of people are working but making a little bit less money.",
        "That's right.",
        "And presumably some of them are shifting out of retail and into other sectors, which is what we might expect to happen.",
        "Now I understand you got this data at least in part from Wal-Mart.",
        "Yeah, it's an interesting story.",
        "There's actually a relatively long history, I've discovered, of research on Wal-Mart, much by advocates but some also by professors and the like.",
        "We got interested in the project about a year and a half ago because there were a number of local battles in California over the entry of Wal-Mart stores and decided to start doing this research and kind of came up with the design for the research project.",
        "We were working with data on Wal-Mart stores that another researcher had put together from a lot of imperfect sources and, really coincidentally, ran into somebody who I guess was doing some consulting work for Wal-Mart who gave us a contact.",
        "And to my amazement really--and I think it goes to the heart of some of the PR issues you're discussing here--they made available to us a data set on Wal-Mart stores, when they opened, their location, and some other characteristics of the stores.",
        "So you have to give the company some credit for providing information.",
        "They don't know what conclusions you're going to come to.",
        "All right.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We're talking about Wal-Mart's remakeover, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Not really, no. I was struck by the sort of anecdotal evidence that Wal-Mart pays relatively low wages and the claims, some of which you were discussing previously, that that increases the public burden through increased reliance on Medicaid, etc. As a researcher, I always ask the question, well, just because they pay low wages, does that really mean they lower wages?",
        "Or just because a lot of the workers tend to use public benefits, does that mean Wal-Mart's causing that?",
        "And we always worry about what we like to call the counterfactual.",
        "What would've been the case otherwise?",
        "And of course if the counterfactual is these workers were working in high-paying union jobs building cars and now they're working at Wal-Mart, sure, Wal-Mart will have lowered wages and lowered benefits.",
        "If instead they were working in other low-wage jobs with relatively poor benefits--and there's plenty of those jobs in the US economy; Wal-Mart's by no means the only one--then it wasn't all clear a priori that Wal-Mart had these effects.",
        "So that's really what motivated the research."

        "And that is certainly a good thing.",
        "Right.",
