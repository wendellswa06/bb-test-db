        "Absolutely not.",
        "That is something that I, you know--I agree.",
        "I don't know who, you know, is putting together a class-action suit, but I can tell you that yes, a lot of these women would be women that probably would not be hired in some of the other retail stores, discount or whatever, and they've given them a break.",
        "And, you know--but...",
        "Well, that's actually--that's probably not quite right, 'cause a lot of low-wage retailers, especially in the late '90s, were hiring anybody they could find and they were quite actively working with the welfare population.",
        "So I think that's a phenomenon that you find across a lot of low-wage employers.",
        "I guess my point is that that can be a good thing and Wal-Mart certainly participates in that along with everybody else.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "It still leaves the question about, you know, those women, like anybody else, earning poverty-level wages of, you know, 9 or 10 bucks an hour, which, if you work all year, will get you, you know, maybe to the poverty line.",
        "Right.",
        "Linda, thank you very much for the call.",

        "I think I'm going to need four or five hours, though, to refute a lot of the things that have been said over the last few minutes.",
        "Well, I'm assuming Linda's conversation was not one of them.",
        "But let me ask you a broad question first.",
        "Why has Wal-Mart decided now is the time to--well, people are calling it a public-relations campaign--but to publicize a lot of the things that it's been doing?"

        "I think you make a key point there, and it's important that folks understand that our activities over the past weeks and months are really not just about communicating outward and making it a PR campaign, but it's really an attempt to make sure we're thinking about the right things and make sure that people in the country are thinking about the right things.",
        "It's a little bit of a shift for us, because as we continue to mature as a company, we're thinking about our business in a new way, and key to that is that a lot of the issues, Neal, that we've dealt with from a defense posture, some of the wages, the benefits, the ethical sourcing, the environment--we're trying to look at those as opportunities to embrace proactively and become a stronger company along the way.",
        "So, clearly, there's more work to do there, but what Lee Scott tried to do last week was lay out a framework for our thinking and do just that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Who is responsible, if Wal-Mart has--to the extent that Wal-Mart has a bad image, who is responsible for that?",
        "Well, I think there are probably multiple folks who can step up to that.",
        "You know, we have different types of critics, and I think it's important that we understand there are some folks who aren't going to like us no matter what we do, people who want, you know, us to fail because it lifts them up, and those are some of our competitors and, clearly, the labor unions.",
        "But to be fair, we've made a lot of our own mistakes, so we try to turn toward the other group of critics, and these are people with genuine concerns in these areas who want to work with us and help us to become better in the process and make the country a better place, and we're spending a lot of time with those folks, having a lot of thoughtful discussions.",
        "And including this conference here in Washington, DC, where you've asked academics to write papers.",
        "You don't know what the results are going to be or even if they're going to be positive for Wal-Mart.",
        "No, and there's a lot of risk for us there.",
        "And there have been a lot of studies, some, you know, reasonably valid, some a little bit dubious, over the past few years, and in the defense of folks writing these, they really did not have all of the Wal-Mart data.",
        "And so our primary reason for having the conference this Friday is really to make sure that we have valid data on record for current discussion, but also for future studies.",
        "And that's why we provided not only our store information, but our hiring data, our wage data by stores.",
        "We want to get it all out there, for better or worse, so that we know what the real story is.",
        "We might take a few hits with it, we might not, but at least it's a starting point so that we know where we need to improve and others know where we're strong and where we have opportunity.",
        "I'm sure you saw the story in today's New York Times about the `war room' that Wal-Mart has set up there in Bentonville to get quick response out to the criticisms.",
        "Is it a political campaign, that sort of thing?",
        "It must cost a lot of money, for one thing.",
        "Well, this room that you saw in The Times this morning is just a few feet from my office, so I'm very familiar with it.",
        "And when you look at the opposition, the folks who are running the ads against Wal-Mart and out there, you know, agitating--and there's lots and lots of them who are making a living based on criticizing Wal-Mart.",
        "They come from a campaign background.",
        "They're approaching it like a campaign.",
        "And we felt that we needed to do the same thing.",
        "Our associates want us to get our story out.",
        "Our customers want us to get, you know, the real facts, the true story out, and so we've realized that we've got to be a little more sophisticated in how we do that, and that's what we're trying to do.",
        "We wanted to thank you for joining us today.",
        "We've got about 30 seconds.",
        "Is there one particular thing that you were anxious about, you wanted to correct?",
        "No, just to keep in mind that Wal-Mart does make life better for so many people in this country, and as you look at things that you guys called `reputation hits,' the health-care memo, the reputation memo, this economic impact study--these are all ways that we're trying to get better, because you have to know where you are to know how to get to where you want to be.",
        "And while we do a lot of things right, we're still working on getting better all the time.",
