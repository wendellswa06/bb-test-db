        "I think it helps, you have to have a passion for the products because to be tasting, you know, 600 cups of something a day, you've got to really love it.",
        "These days, Cheetham is sipping and spitting his way through Lipton's new premium teas.",

        "Did that surprise you to see those pictures?",
        "In some ways, it's a deeply traditional culture that still believes in the gods, that still goes to the shrine to pray for everybody every day, that still sees the individual as a very tiny speck on a much larger canvas.",

        "As somebody who has lived there for more than two decades, can you give us a sense of the extent to which the experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the aftermath of it is seared into the Japanese consciousness, even obviously with the many - the majority of people who did not directly experience it?"

        "He is indicating that he has no intention to take personal responsibility, as it were, for what the demonstrators are claiming is the malfeasance of the regime.",
        "On the other hand, he has indicated a willingness to what he called dialogue and communications, wants to talk a little bit and wants to hear.",
        "And the best way he thinks to do that is to shuffle the cabinet, maybe bring in some new faces, kick out some of the old faces and see whether or not that can keep things calm on the streets.",
