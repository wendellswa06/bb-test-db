        "And do we have any word at all what those plans may be, what kind of cuts we're expecting?",
        "We don't have specifics on the plan as of yet, but we know some of the general directions that they'll have to go in.",

        "Even the objections that were raised to this FCC vote were pretty thoughtful.",
        "This wasn't just written with the old-fashioned, you know, Internet-is-a-series-of-tubes type of mentality.",
        "You also wrote about tech companies lobbying politicians.",
        "Now, with this newly politicized Internet, does that mean that they're going to be getting into the game even more - more money is going to be flowing to K Street?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean, I don't think there's any question about that.",
        "Google has a pretty big office in Washington, D.C.",
        "now.",
        "Even Apple, which has been really standoffish, is lobbying now.",
        "Technology is too big of a bit too big of a business for them not to be lobbying now.",
        "Traditionally, Silicon Valley has not gotten overly involved in Washington.",
        "But I think basically any large tech company that isn't lobbying already is going to start, because there's so much money and it's touching people's lives in so many ways.",
        "And as politicians seek to regulate stuff, technology companies want to make sure that they've got a voice in keeping that from being done in a manner that's going to affect them negatively."

        "What about the reverse?",
        "How is politics going to change the Internet?",
        "Well, you know, that's been happening for a while, like every thing from the Communications Decency Act to the SOPA and CISPA legislation where politicians have come in and tried to legislate the Internet, often in ways that I don't think they've totally understood.",
        "But, you know, I think that's hopefully changing as politicians use the Internet more.",
        "I mean, now it'd be pretty weird if you're in Congress and you don't have a smart phone, you know, or if you don't have an email account, if you're not using Google.",

        "That easygoing attitude changed during the last year of the Carter administration.",
