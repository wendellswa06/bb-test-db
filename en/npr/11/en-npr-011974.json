        "And where are we in the extradition process?",
        "There was a revelation this past week again - an unauthorized one, but apparently accurate - of the three counts the U.S.",
        "government plans to file against him: one of espionage, one of theft and one of conversion of government material.",
        "Those are not in the same category as treason, which, of course, is a capital offense in many countries, including the United States, but they are ones in which they will presumably begin the extradition process soon with Hong Kong.",

        "Jim, let's go to Europe.",
        "President Obama visited Europe this week, as you know.",
        "Next week, he goes off to Africa.",

        "Kennedy.",
        "What did he say?",

        "Kennedy made 50 years ago in Berlin, the famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech.",
        "But the policy recommendation that President Obama made was similar to one that Kennedy had made in early June of 1963 where he talked about the long-term danger of a nuclear annihilation.",
        "President Obama did resume the call for serious nuclear reductions of all the major nuclear powers.",
        "What struck me about this is it's interesting how many presidents, as they go on in their term, begin to think that the existence of nuclear weapons itself is an issue.",

        "You know, in light of the frenzy, there's something called the Tobin tax.",
        "Could you explain what this is?",
        "The idea of the Tobin tax, which was named for the late Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin of Yale, was to make it harder and less profitable for this kind of speculative frenzy to happen on world exchanges.",
        "And his idea was to have a very, very small tax either on foreign currency exchanges or financial exchanges of any kind.",
        "You know, well under 1 percent - a tiny little fraction - that would not get in the way of real investment decisions - things you're going to hold for a month, for a year, for five years - but that would be an impediment to this kind of second-by-second day-trading panic whose affects we saw this past week.",
        "Jim, last week, Creve Coeur, Missouri; this week, Sioux Falls.",
        "What's going on?",
        "But many Israelis, including now many senior officials in Sharon's government, are hoping that this unilateral pullout from Gaza will prompt the renewal of the peace process.",
        "As Israeli police were pulling protesters out of the synagogue at Neve Dekalim yesterday, Danny Seaman, a spokesman for the government, said he hoped a gesture would come from the Palestinian side in response to the eviction of the settlers.",
        "We've uprooted them after 38 years in which people, their entire lives, lived here.",
        "But the government, the prime minister understood that this is what is necessary for the benefit of the state of Israel and perhaps to move the peace process forward in the Middle East.",
        "That's what we're hoping comes out of this.",
        "That's why this was very sensitive and very important because we as a nation have to move forward this peace process together, unified.",
        "One newspaper columnist worried this morning that the televised eviction of the settlers will eventually cause Israelis to shrink from similar actions on the West Bank.",
        "But Gerald Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University believes it's just as possible that given the right circumstances, this will lead to further steps on Israel's part for peace."
