        "Even though the Conservative Party got the most seats, that doesn't automatically give them the government or their leader, David Cameron, the prime minister's seat.",
        "That's right.",
        "There are 650 seats in the British parliament, and so anyone wants to be prime minister, their party has to get 326 of them.",
        "David Cameron is about...",
        "Fifty-one percent, 51 percent.",
        "Fifty-one percent, just over 50 percent, exactly.",
        "And David Cameron has got rough - about 20 short of that.",
        "So he doesn't have a majority, simple as that.",
        "He needs, therefore, to go into some kind of alliance with one of the other smaller parties.",
        "It's clear that Labour is defeated here, about 100 seats Labour has lost to the Conservatives.",
        "But David Cameron is most interested in the Liberal Democrats, the centrist party that everyone was thinking might do well in this.",
        "In fact, their vote, in the end, evaporated - rather, they didn't do very well at all.",
        "But their leader, Nick Clegg, still could be the kingmaker in all of this.",
        "And he is very important, and he came out this morning and made a statement about which way he's leaning, towards allying with the Conservatives or with the Labour Party, and this is what he said.",
        "It seemed this morning that it's the Conservative Party that has more votes and more seats, though not an absolute majority.",
        "And that is why I think it is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.",
        "And again, that's Nick Clegg, who's leader of the third party, the Liberal Democrats.",
        "Now, how did David Cameron, the man he was speaking with, about the leader of the Conservative Party, how did he respond?",
        "Well, David Cameron came out quite soon after that and also made a much longer statement with a lot more details.",
        "And here is something about - of what he said.",
        "I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats.",
        "I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems, and our broken political system.",
        "So David Cameron there, opening up an offer to the Liberal Democrats, who are not natural allies.",
        "The Liberal Democrats would be much more natural allies of the Labour Party.",
        "But the Conservatives have got more of the vote and are more likely to form the next government.",
        "Cameron said we can work together on certain things, like education and the environment, even possibly political reform, electoral reform, which the Liberal Democrats want.",
        "But he said really there's very little room for negotiation on things like Europe, defense and immigration.",
        "So what happens now?",
        "Will the current prime minister, Gordon Brown, try and bring the Liberal Democrats over to his side or will he concede?"
