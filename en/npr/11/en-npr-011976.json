        "Absolutely.",

        "As far as the battle in the swamp is concerned, it's going to be a defensive struggle that I think LSU might just win.",
        "Really?",
        "What do you think, Boston?",
        "Well obviously, in Texas and Oklahoma you both - both teams have two great quarterbacks in Colt McCoy in Texas and Sam Bradford in Oklahoma.",
        "But I really think that Oklahoma - yes, as D-Will has mentioned - have it on both sides of the ball.",
        "Their defense is very dominating and suffocating, and I think the Sooners will take care of Texas.",
        "As far as LSU and Florida, being Louisiana-bred that I am, I really think that LSU's defense really will go down into the Swamp and beat Florida.",
        "I think Florida, you know, showed a little weakness when they lost to Old Miss.",
        "Maybe a lack of focus, but losing to Old Miss was not a good thing for Florida.",
        "And I really think LSU is really finding themselves and finding their groove, especially with their young quarterback Jarrett Lee, who really stepped up big time a couple weeks ago in Auburn and led LSU to a victory at Auburn."

        "But these starters on both sides of the ball for these smaller schools are equal now in talent to the larger schools.",

        "So it's shown nationally on DirectTV and that sort.",

        "Yes.",
