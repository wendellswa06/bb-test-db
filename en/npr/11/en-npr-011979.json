        "Well, the topic that Matt and I focused on Iraq and I mean, that's obviously, it's a broad topic, and it was one that very few other student's in the class really wanted to approach because we know that there's no easy answers.",
        "What we came to and you know it's interesting when we began Matt was actually advocating for adding more troops.",
        "I was advocating for a sooner withdrawal.",
        "And what we came to was that the best strategy is really a measured withdrawal.",
        "We put a firm end date on it, and we want, you know, points to be based on - withdrawal points to be based on strategic military goals.",
        "And it's really fascinating because we come from opposite ends of the political spectrum and came to pretty much very, very similar stands.",
        "Ian it sounds like you are taking the position that has been advocated for by Senator Obama who we should mention actually attended Occidental College.",
        "And Matt, what about you?",
        "You say you're the Republican in the crowd so did you feel about this strategy that they came up with?",
        "I was tremendously impressed with the job that General Petraeus had done, and I supported the invasion.",
        "I still do, but Ian and I, I guess, got together and had what I call the Arnold Schwarzenegger negotiation meeting and had a cigar and talked about what we had read.",
        "We had this disagreement, but we're able to formulate something that we could all be happy with.",
        "Matt, you've kind of been a bit of the lone man in this situation.",
        "This report kind of goes off the premise that this current administration has really worsened our reputation in the world.",
        "How is that for you to hear?",
        "You know, I don't think - it's something that you can be tremendously concerned about on a day-to-day basis.",
        "I do believe that history will exonerate the Bush administration in my opinion, and I think I differ from my colleagues here that the damage to the U.S.",

        "Do you plan on taking any of that with you this fall?",
        "Of course.",
        "I mean, I plan to take this strategy with me, and more than that, the work and the collaboration that's gone into it.",
        "And, you know, I mean, going on what Matt said, and he really has the courage to stand alone among our group as one that isn't concerned with what happened during the last, you know, eight years or so.",
        "You know I really do see that after, you know, after 9/11 the tragedy there we had a tremendous amount of good will, and it seems to me that it's been squandered.",
        "And Alex, you know, you get a flavor from the students back and forth from the kind of debates we had in class.",
        "But what ultimately I said to them is we're not going to debate the past, and I told them if you did a good job I would send it to all the campaign advisors.",
        "And so it has gone to Obama's people and McCain's people, and there've been inquiries from all over the world about the report and people are downloading it and reading it all over the world.",
        "A lot of the suggestions in this report are very practical ones.",
        "One of the one's I particularly liked was in the section on oil and energy you suggest that all U.S.",
        "political envoys drive hybrids.",
        "Now I think that sounds like a great idea, but how realistic do you think it is and how much do you think something like that would suddenly make everybody else across the world think, oh, hey, U.S.",
        "they're doing an all right job now.",
        "Ian, what do you think?",
        "I mean what we were trying to do with most of these pieces is have things that can actually be implemented and when taken together, I mean, that was just a fresh idea that somebody had.",
        "Whether that on its own is going to have, you know, some watershed difference.",
        "I don't know."
