        "What happens is it begins to form a worm, and it's incredibly debilitating and painful.",

        "Peter first.",
        "Well, one of the incredibly valuable things about these images is that it does tell a series of stories.",
        "And one of the set of stories is look at how bad the failure to meet basic human needs for water can be.",
        "Look at the consequences.",
        "But the other story is that when you provide clean water and sanitation, which we know how to do, the incredibly wonderful things that happen, the girls that get to go to school because they don't have to spend hours each day trudging for kilometers, carrying hugely heavy quantities of water back for their families to use, the children that were sick and become healthy when they get access to clean water, the communities that come together around water projects, I think that's the value of the project.",
        "Obviously, this money, the money spent to make this book could have been spent to work on water projects in Africa, but the opportunity to reach thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people with information about how to solve these problems is what ultimately, I think, will be the value of this kind of a project.",
        "Gil, what sticks with you from your travels?",

        "Bingo.",
        "There it is.",
        "That's what safe water can do.",
