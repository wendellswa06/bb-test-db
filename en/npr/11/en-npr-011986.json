        "Well, except that in the end Scott McInnis did not win that nomination.",
        "He had certainly long-time been the favorite, but starting with those plagiarism allegations, his campaign went into a bit of a tailspin, and in the end he wound up losing to a businessman named Dan Maes, who is another Tea Party favorite, certainly very similar to Ken Buck in that respect but quite different in some other respects.",
        "Ken Maes is a guy you may have excuse me, Dan Maes is a guy you may have seen on MSNBC recently, defending his attack on the Mayor Hickenlooper bicycle program in Denver as something having to do with the United Nations.",
        "All right, Dave, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Let's see if we can go next to Chris(ph), and Chris with us from Minneapolis.",
        "Hi, thanks.",
        "I was wondering if you guys could explain in a nutshell what the difference was of opinion between Bill Clinton and Barack Obama on the race in Colorado.",
        "Well, with respect to Michael Bennet and with respect to Andrew Romanoff, maybe not as much as may meet the eye.",
        "One coincidence is that Andrew Romanoff backed Hillary Clinton in the Colorado primary for president in 2008, and Michael Bennet backed Barack Obama.",
        "Hello, Madeleine.",
        "That appears to have been at least of some importance to the Clintons.",
        "It was in 2008.",
        "And I think also that there were just some longer-standing loyalties going back into the Clinton years in their own campaigns with Mr. Romanoff.",
        "And the Clintons do tend to be fiercely loyal.",
        "There was not a great deal of difference on the issues between those two.",
        "It's not as great as the issues between many of the primary rivals we've seen in both parties this year, certainly on the Republican side as well.",
        "But their biggest difference there, I think, was just the sense that Michael Bennet had not been as much a part of the Democratic campaigns in the past in Colorado, that he was kind of a newcomer, that he come in to run the schools, that there had been some controversies about how he financed that, and his closeness to certain Republican figures raised questions among some Democrats.",
        "Chris, thanks very much for the call.",
        "No big surprises in the state of Connecticut.",
        "Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive, will face off against the Democratic attorney general, Dick Blumenthal.",
        "Everybody expected that all along."

        "And he was a senator here for six years, representing Minnesota from the year 2000 to 2006, did not settled into the Senate, did not enjoy it and voluntarily retired, but not entirely from politics.",
        "He decided he still wanted to be in state-wide politics, came back out of retirement to run for governor this year, and in a three-way race, a very tough three-way race, he appears to have won a narrow victory, with about 45 percent of the three-way vote.",
        "And he will be facing Tom Emmer to replace Tim Pawlenty, who is believed to be running for president of the United States.",
        "Believed to be, although I think we should add that he hasn't actually made an official announcement to that effect.",
        "But that's why people think he didn't run for re-election himself.",
        "In the meantime, yesterday on the floor of the House of Representatives, Democratic leadership thought it was going to be time to celebrate passage of a bill to give jobs to teachers and cops.",
        "Instead, much of the attention focused on the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the powerful chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, and that would be Charlie Rangel, who issued a long and confusing at times diatribe, well, against almost everybody, going wanted to clear up any confusion about his future.",
        "He's saying I'm going to be here.",
        "If I can't get my dignity back here, then fire your best shot in getting rid of me through expulsion.",
        "Now, Congressman Rangel faces ethics charges, through a long process declined to reach a deal with the Ethics Committee, and now is going to have to go on trial.",
        "That's right.",
        "The committee will hold a hearing, as they put it, beginning September 13th, with the first day of that hearing, which is being described as a trial and has some aspects of a trial.",
        "But it is a committee of Congress that's actually hearing this evidence."

        "And they're going to be considering 13 different counts against Charlie Rangel.",

        "Nothing criminal here.",
        "Well, let's put it this way: He is not under apparent criminal investigation, either in the state of New York or by the federal government.",
        "So if there are violations here that would rise to the point of being criminal, that would have to begin or it would have to at least be revealed as having begun at some later point.",
        "Right now, some people think one of the reasons he hasn't been willing to admit to some degree of wrongdoing, take a reprimand and let all this be bygones be bygones, is because he doesn't want to admit to something substantial that would look like a crime and then have more of a criminal problem down the road.",
        "We don't know that that's his thinking.",
        "We only know what he had to say yesterday in that 37 minute meandering kind of defense.",
        "And a lot of Democrats would like to see him go away to avoid the problems of an ethics trial in the run-up to the midterm elections, apparently including the Democrat in the White House.",

        "And not only did he make it his home, but he really became in some respects the leading political figure of the entire history of the state of Alaska.",
        "He was, in a sense, the king of Alaska, especially when it came to anything having to do with the federal government.",
        "And in a place like Alaska, where there's much federally-owned land, well, that's an awful lot of the public life of the state.",

        "It cannot possibly be thought that had the verdict gone the other way, or if these charges had never been brought, that he would not have had probably another pretty easy re-election.",
        "But in this particular case, because of the trial, because of all the bad publicity and then of course because of his conviction, he did lose his seat in November of 2008 and had been a private citizen since.",
