        "And I wonder what's been the response to the news of Senator Stevens' death from his former colleagues here in Washington.",
        "You know, the Senate I think it's hard to quantify what this guy meant.",
        "And the Senate's had so many losses in the past year, the loss of Senator Ted Kennedy, Senator Robert Byrd and now Ted Stevens, who, even though he wasn't still in the Senate, as Ron mentioned, he's been gone from here about two years now, he was still around Washington.",
        "He came and visited his colleagues here.",
        "He's best pals with Democratic Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii and really a charming couple, those two, a duo, Republican and Democrat, call each other brothers.",
        "Their relationship dates back to an earlier era, where parties mattered less, and friendship mattered more.",
        "The reaction has been very heartfelt, and people have lauded many tributes to him, but Senator Ted Stevens felt a little burned by the Senate when he left a couple years ago because he wanted more support from his colleagues as he faced those charges.",
        "He, as you mentioned, well, dating to a previous era, yes a Republican, yes very conservative but also willing to work with Democrats across the aisle and indeed, one of the Republicans who decided to vote against the impeachment of Bill Clinton.",
        "Absolutely, and he had other non-popular views among Republicans.",
        "He supported stem cell research.",
        "He was a huge proponent of public broadcasting, for example, also the arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and didn't always fall into party line on issues like abortion.",
        "And so he did build some alliances across the aisle.",
        "Now, that's not to say he wasn't a fierce fighter.",
        "You guys know the image of Stevens with his Incredible Hulk tie.",
        "He liked to pick a fight, and he liked to win a fight.",
        "Used to gleefully describe himself as a mean old SOB.",
        "Absolutely he did, and as reporters, we often encountered his vitriol.",
        "You know, you'd ask him a question.",
        "He'd look at you cross-eyed, and even though he was only about five feet tall, you sort of took a step back and, you know, gulped, and maybe I can rephrase that, you know, a little bit.",
        "He was an intense guy.",
        "Libby, I do believe when you came here to Washington, D.C., you asked Senator Stevens a question he didn't care for."

        "And none of us knew the indictment was coming down.",
        "He didn't know the indictment was coming down.",
        "And we actually had a really touching interview where he talked about his legacy and some of his goals and things that he still wanted to do even though he was 84 years old.",
        "And instead of having the intense bulldog, the scary senator, he was a lot more reflective and talked about the importance of family and of Alaska.",
        "And he talked about how, you know, he was really this guy, this kid, a poor kid who grew up during the Great Depression, who fought his way through.",
        "And to be someone who could speak on the floor of the Senate, that could represent the largest state in the union, at least geographically, was something that he felt very humbled by.",
        "Here's an email we have from Amanda(ph) in Buffalo, New York.",
        "He was amazing.",
        "He happened to be in a restaurant I worked in, and I had mentioned that I was new up there, and he wanted to know what I thought of the state.",
        "He also asked if there was anything I thought that needed to be changed.",
        "He really cared about what the people wanted and needed.",
        "It was Alaska first, Alaska always.",

        "Yeah, I was born in Alaska, and Ted Stevens, he was Mr. Alaska.",
        "My entire life, he was the politician that represented us, and he did a good job.",
        "The last scandal he was absolved from and it did not mark him, and even during that, he was just so forward-looking for such an old man.",
        "Was there one thing in particular that you will remember him for, Christine?"

        "All right, Christine, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",

        "That was considered at that moment a symbol of overspending by the Republican majorities in the House and Senate in those days and became very unpopular among many Republicans, and that program, well, while not exactly being totally rejected, the funding for that program was shelved.",
        "And of course became a rallying cry for, among others, Sarah Palin, his opponent in the Republican Party.",

        "And so the legacy extends beyond Alaska and comes down to the lower 48.",

        "These villages are very isolated.",
        "You can't get to them except by a boat or a plane.",

        "They don't have indoor plumbing.",
        "They have to use buckets and outhouses to deal with their waste.",

        "The Democrat, the Republican, two people who, for all their partisan differences, agreed far more often than they disagreed about the idea that money needed to be brought back to your home state.",
