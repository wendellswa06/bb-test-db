        "If I could just mention one thing, you know, the last time I talked to Senator Stevens was about Senator Byrd.",
        "And to hear him reflect on that relationship and that former era of the Senate was pretty powerful.",
        "And I don't think Alaskans are going to forget all that Stevens did despite the taint of that trial because he was never acquitted.",
        "The charges were taken away because of prosecutorial misconduct, but Ted Stevens wasn't acquitted, which is an important distinction.",
        "And Alaskans though, as they reflect on his legacy, are, you know, as you do when someone dies, remembering the good times and all that he did.",

        "We just heard a caller talking about powerful members of Congress who don't have two dimes to rub together and end up being caught up in corruption scandals.",
        "We learned today about the death of Dan Rostenkowski, former congressman from Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee for 14 years, played a key role in the 1983 Social Security overhaul, later indicted on 17 felony counts and a stamp embezzling scandal in Congress, causing him to give up the committee chairmanship in 1994.",
        "Later that year, he lost his reelection.",
        "You know, it's almost pathetic, in a sense, the size of the things he was accused of making off with - stamps, chairs, pieces of furniture, some other things.",
        "Some of the charges were somewhat more serious than that, but these were the two on which he agreed to plea guilty and for which he went to jail.",
        "This from the pinnacle of being the Ways and Means Committee chairman, as Charlie Rangel is today, and being responsible largely for the 1982-'83 rescue of Social Security and being responsible quite largely for the passage of the Tax Reform Act out of the United States House of Representatives 1985-1986.",
        "A big part of the Reagan legacy, really, were the tax cuts of the early '80s, which he had a big hand in and then the tax cuts of the later '80s, middle '80s that Rostenkowski also had a hand in.",
        "He was a major figure in congressional history, and he would frequently complain that his salary, which was very good money by the average American standards, was such a pittance next to all the people who were coming to him to beg for legislation on a daily basis.",
        "And even as he left Congress, he was unrepentant about the crimes that he was convicted of committing.",

        "Bill Clinton pardoned him.",
        "But, yes, of course, in the same sense that there's a taint on Ted Stevens because of that last final trial, there was also always, and always will be, a taint on Dan Rostenkowski's record because of that conviction.",
        "And interestingly, we have to note that Dan Rostenkowski's seat, lost in 1994 to a Republican, but then he was succeeded in that seat by a Democrat who later became governor of the state of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich.",
        "And we are waiting, even this afternoon, the results of his trial on corruption charges back in Illinois, and we'll wait to see what may happen to him and his brother.",

        "Conventional wisdom now is that the independents are going to shift over to Obama.",

        "And the relationship between the current George W.",
        "Bush and John McCain has always been a troubled one and probably always will be an uneasy one.",
        "So it's enough for McCain to have the Daddy Bush endorsement in Texas and to have no opposition coming really from the current White House until he gets the official nomination and then wants the support of the current White House, pro forma as it may be, maybe not too warm an embrace, don't want to give the Democrats too much ammunition, but just enough to keep the conservatives who do still support the current president onboard.",
