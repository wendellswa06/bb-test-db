        "If you're with someone who gets up and can't sleep, then using nightlights to read with, book lights to read with, trying to get quietly out of bed if that's necessary, but talking through what's causing it specifically, can sometimes be helpful.",

        "Thanks to NPR, he heard about daily sinus cleansing via SinuCleanse which is also helping with the snoring.",
        "Seems the poor man will do anything to keep me in the same bedroom.",

        "And unfortunately, he's had a hard time getting a solution.",
        "Often it's a little easier than that.",
        "Mm-hmm, and what is the CPAP machine?",
        "A CPAP machine - CPAP stands for continuous positive airway pressure - and it's a small device that fits over your nose or has plugs that fit in your nose, and when you breathe with that, it produces a little positive pressure that holds the airway open.",
        "And it's partial airway closure that causes snoring...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...and full airway closure that causes an apnea.",
        "So when you sleep with CPAP, it resolves both all the snoring and the apnea.",
        "The machines are quiet, and most bed partners don't care what you look like but like it to be quiet in the room.",
        "Is this - obviously the much lower tech version of that is the nasal strip.",
        "Can that help people?",
        "The nasal strips can help a little bit when there's nasal congestion that's causing the problem or very small nasal passages.",
        "There's a bulk of snoring that the nasal strips won't help, but they're easy enough to try.",
        "Mm-hmm, let's go to - this is Carol, Carol with us from Jacksonville, Florida.",
        "I just wanted to share my family's sleeping arrangements.",
