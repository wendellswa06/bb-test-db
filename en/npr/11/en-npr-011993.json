        "It's a relief to be here.",
        "Yes, after all of that.",
        "Let me ask you, why - we've been talking about some of the obvious reasons - snoring a big one - is that the biggest reason, you think, that couples sleep apart?",
        "You know, for each couple, I think, it's individual.",
        "And I interviewed couples who say they share a bed, but a lot of them sleep apart, and snoring is probably the most common thing, but sometimes they sleep apart because they're angry, or women going through menopause sometimes prefer to be somewhere where they don't have to worry about their tossing and turning and throwing covers off and pulling them on, disturbing their partner.",
        "And sometimes people sleep apart because one of them's sick or one of them's injured, or people want to read and the reading bothers the partner.",
        "It can be very, very individual, very different from one person to another.",
        "Also as we heard, people on different schedules that can be an imperative.",
        "Right.",
        "Although, you know, a lot of these things can be worked out, so some couples share a bed who have all these things, all these problems whatever they are - snoring or, you know, big differences in preferred temperature or something - but other couples solve it by sleeping apart part of the night or all of the night, some of the time.",
        "Is it injurious to a relationship, necessarily, if couples sleep apart?",
        "Oh, no, I don't think so.",
        "In fact, if anything, it could be the other way.",
        "Lots of couples probably stay together longer and happier because they can sleep apart some or all of the time.",
        "Sleep being the operative word there."

        "Mm-hmm, doesn't it mean that there's less opportunity for spontaneous intimacy?",
        "Yes.",
        "A couple of the couples I interviewed, the woman had decided she had enough spontaneous intimacy and had moved to have great amounts of distance many nights.",

        "Good.",
        "Since I was a wee lad, I've always held my breath while I was sleeping, and I would hold it for quite a long time, then just let it out very slowly in kind of a squeaking noise.",
        "And when I started dating my girlfriend, I was quite concerned, but it turns out she snores so I was very pleased that she wouldn't be bothered by mine.",
        "As far as sleeping at night, the only thing that bothers me is she likes to chase me around and snuggle up against me, and I prefer to have a little space.",
        "Mm-hmm, but this is not driving you to different beds.",
        "No, but I told her, you know, when we move into together that I am definitely going to bring my own bed and have my own room so that when she starts chasing me around after she's asleep, I'm going to go sleep in my own bed.",
        "Hmm, I wonder, Paul Rosenblatt, does it - at least in Patrick's case - there seems to be the sort of a mutually assured destruction of sleep noises.",
        "Does it work out better if one - if both people snore rather than just one?",
        "You know, I don't want to prejudge what's going to happen to Patrick and his friend, but I think for some couples having either partner make noise is a problem for the other, and the fact that we're both making noise wouldn't make a difference.",
        "But this part about her being - sort of pursing him around the bed, that's a pretty common thing for those of us who live in Minnesota.",
        "We have these long, cold winters that last seven months, or something like that, and lots of couples part of their chemistry is she's cold and is attracted to his warmth, and he likes snuggling, at least at first.",
        "But then down the road when she's heat-seeking and he...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "...he wants to not to be shocked by the cold, that could be a problem.",
        "But couples negotiate how she can be heat-seeking, you know.",
        "They might negotiate that.",
        "He'll warm up her side of the bed first when he goes to bed so she'll stay there, or they might negotiate that she try to keep the contact at her feet and ankle level rather than all over his body.",
        "And Dr. Emsellem, I was wondering about Patrick's description of holding his breath and releasing it slowly.",
        "Is that common?",
        "You know, that is not a common breathing pattern at night.",
        "And when he does have a constant observer in the same room with him, if she is observing you to stop snoring - stop breathing, Patrick, it may be worth looking at that.",
        "One of the advantages of one person snoring and the other not is that you do have an observer who can help you get help when you need it.",
        "Usually cranky enough to take notes, too."

        "I'm wondering about the issue of the bed itself.",
        "Paul Rosenblatt, can some problems be solved if you just get a queen-sized and a good mattress?",
        "Couples I've interviewed say, yes, having more space, even a few more inches, can help, and it's partly the distance and partly that the bigger beds often transmit less movement of one person.",
        "Also some couples get these dual mattresses that, you know, inflate to different pressures, and sometimes that solves some problems.",
        "Mm-hmm, is that something that - are recommendation's ever that simple, doctor?",
        "Sometimes it is.",
        "The ability to set the pressure on the - and the tension on a mattress does help people who have different sleeping preferences for the comfort level.",
        "Sometimes you can get a king frame with two separate twin mattresses.",
        "It doesn't transmit as much movement if someone kicks at night.",

        "It's made a world of difference.",
        "This may not work for those with young children, but for us, no children, it works great.",
        "This has cut down the instances of one of us ending up on the couch.",
        "The other thing that's helped greatly is a king-size bed.",
        "There you go.",
        "We attempted to sleep in a queen for a while.",
        "We just didn't like being right at each other's backs.",
        "We needed our space.",
        "So there are two practical solutions.",
        "The earplugs are fine if you can sleep with them.",
        "Some people feel that there's so little noise with the earplugs that they're uncomfortable.",
        "The other things is I think it's OK to drown out the snoring, as long as it's been checked out and we're sure that there isn't underlying sleep apnea."

        "There are some medications that will suppress it, but it's always a tradeoff to have to take a medication for that.",
        "Some people take medication when they're going to be sharing space with someone and not use it when they're by themselves.",
        "There are also some other disorders that can appear in adulthood, so the new onset of sleep talking behaviors could be a sign of a REM sleep behavioral disorder.",
