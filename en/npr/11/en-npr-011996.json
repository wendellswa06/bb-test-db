        "Her supporters, many of them women with daughters in tow, crowded the halls and balconies of the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.",
        "There Clinton not only closed the door on taking her hard-fought campaign any further, she unequivocally endorsed her former rival.",
        "She asked her supporters to do the same.",
        "The way to continue our fight now, to accomplish the goals for which we stand, is to take our energy, our passion, our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama the next president of the United States.",
        "(Soundbite of cheering)",
        "Clinton went on to mention Obama more than a dozen times in her nearly half hour address to modest applause.",
        "But it was when she spoke of what her presidential run meant to women when her crowd's cheers rose and tears fell.",
        "Clinton's campaign drew nearly 18 million voters, making her run the closest ha woman has come to earning a party nomination.",
        "Although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it.",

        "And the light is shining through like never before...",
        "It wasn't the party she planned, Clinton said, but she sure liked the company.",
        "Whether they will follow her lead and back the presumptive nominee remains to be seen.",
        "Democratic strategist and Clinton campaign adviser Kiki McLean was there with her two daughters.",

        "Well, personally, I would really like to vote for Senator Clinton, and I'm hoping possibly that we'll have a chance to at least go through a first-round ballot to show our support for her, but if she wants it by unanimous vote, then she's got my vote for Senator Obama.",
