        "Yale University Professor Jaroslav Pelikan, one of the world's foremost authorities on the history of Christianity, died last week.",
        "He wrote more than 30 books, including the massive, five-volume set, The Christian Tradition.",
        "Born in 1923 in Ohio to a Serbian mother and Slovak father, Pelikan was raised as a Lutheran but converted to Eastern Orthodoxy.",
        "He joined the Yale faculty in 1962 and later was named a Sterling Professor, an honor achieved only by the institution's most distinguished academics.",
        "The National Endowment for the Humanities gave Pelikan its highest honor, The Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, which he delivered in 1983.",
        "He was also appointed by President Clinton to serve on his committee on the Arts and Humanities.",
        "His awards and towering intellect never diminished Pelikan's sense of humor and humility.",
        "One of his sons said, For a man as talented and as accomplished as he was, he was also exceptionally kind and genuinely humble.",
        "The more he learned, the more amazed he was by how much he did not know.",
        "Jaroslav Pelikan was a guest on this program a number of times, most recently last year when he published his book, Whose Bible Is It?",
        "The work explored how people of different faiths, languages and cultures varied in their interpretations of the Bible.",
        "He was interviewed by Sheilah Kast, who posed the same question as the title of his book, Whose Bible Is It?",
        "Without giving away the plot of the whole book, I end up saying that's not an appropriate question.",
        "It's at best presumptuous and at worst blasphemous, because the Bible doesn't belong to any human being, the Bible belongs to God.",
        "But the question of who has the right way of looking at it, my final answer is that Christians and Jews need each other in an effort to understand the sacred text they share.",
        "In the preface to that book, Jaroslav Pelikan said his motivation to write it came from a question his Russian-born aunt Vonda once asked: Tell me, what do you think of Bible?",
        "Sheilah Kast asked him what his aunt Vonda would think of Whose Bible Is It?",
        "I suppose she would say at the end, you talk about everybody else, but you don't tell me what you think of Bible, which is of course what I've done all my life.",
        "I duck by retreating to 20 centuries and by the time I'm done reciting the 20 centuries, people are pretty nearly exhausted and then can't subject me to cross-examination.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "Religious historian Jaroslav Pelikan, he died last week at the age of 82.",
        "This Friday, 16 of the most controversial provisions of the Patriot Act will expire unless Congress does something about it.",
        "Disagreement over those provisions led to a Senate filibuster in December.",
        "One month later congressional and White House negotiators have made no real progress.",
        "And recent revelations about government eavesdropping have made some lawmakers even more nervous about giving up any civil liberties protections."

        "LARRY ABRAMSON reporting",
        "When we last left our hero, the Patriot Act was hanging by its fingernails, desperately close to the expiration date that would throw law enforcement back into the pre-9/11 world, at least according to some interpretations.",
        "Now, one month later, the law still dangles above the abyss.",
        "Senate Judiciary Chair Arlen Specter has been reaching a hand across the chasm, trying to win endorsement of a House-Senate compromise.",
        "This week on the Senate floor, Specter reminded his colleagues that he'd already extracted major concessions from the House.",
        "We took it to the House and got all of them, the most important of which was the sunset provision, changed from seven years to four years, and then still additional changes were requested and they cannot, could not be accommodated.",
        "But, there's been little response to Specter's warning that the White House and the House feel they've already compromised and will not budge another inch.",
        "Meanwhile, Democrats and some Republicans who back the filibuster are more adamant than ever about two issues: first, they want to prevent the FBI from using the Patriot Act to search the records of people with no clear ties to terrorism; and they want limits on national security letters, a common investigative tool which gives the FBI access to information without court oversight.",
        "Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont:",
        "This is not the way we do business in our country.",
        "It is too easy for completely innocent people to get caught in this, completely innocent people to have their lives or their businesses ruined, and the worst part about it, it does absolutely nothing to catch terrorists.",
        "Recent revelations about surveillance by the National Security Agency have only made negotiations more difficult.",
        "There is no serious discussion of addressing NSA spying within the Patriot Act, but the issue has re-energized civil liberties groups who say they won't get fooled again.",
        "Jim Dempsey of the Center for Democracy and Technology says he feels misled.",
        "Dempsey testified at a number of Patriot Act hearings where he rolled up his sleeves to hammer out compromise language with administration officials.",
        "Spending a lot of time arguing over some relatively modest changes.",
        "The administration was going off completely outside of any statute, outside of any congressional authorization, in doing what it wanted to do.",
        "The White House still wants senators to see the light and pass the version the House approved and which the Senate filibustered.",
        "In a preview of Tuesday's State of the Union address, President Bush told reporters this past week he will use the speech to gently nudge lawmakers.",
        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: Congress must reauthorize the Patriot Act so that our law enforcement and intelligence and Homeland Security officers have the tools they need to rat out the terrorists."
