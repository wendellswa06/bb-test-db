        "All of these things are complex decisions.",
        "And yeah, so I agree that we have, in some sense, a non-infinite ability to do all the calculations that we'd like to do, but that's perfectly natural.",
        "That's part of being human.",
        "So we may not be able to infinitely compute things, but I think there are also a lot of other mitigating factors that would cause us to want to conserve energy in some settings but not conserve energy in other settings."

        "We need to compete against somebody, at least on our own block.",
        "Yeah, I think that's remarkable.",
        "There's something about the neighbor comparisons here and in other settings that's very powerful, and the person I think who's done the most work in illustrating this is a psychologist named Bob Chaldini(ph) with a group of co-authors, and they show that social comparisons not just in terms of energy use but other environmental behaviors, you know, do you recycle your do you want the towels washed at the hotel, or do you steal firewood from a forest - in many of these settings we are influenced substantially by what we're told about what other people are doing in terms of the social norm.",
        "Yeah, we've talked about that on this program, studies that show if there are other, larger groups that are doing things, you'll want to join in on a positive side with those groups.",
        "So I guess one of your challenges is to find what kind of motivational techniques would work.",
        "Exactly, exactly, and I think, you know, in the case of energy, we've seen that, you know, that this motivational technique works very well.",
        "I think what (unintelligible) and I are arguing in the Science article is, it's really not about OPOWER.",
        "OPOWER is used as an example of how behavioral science, psychology, behavioral economics, sociology, can be used to generate other insights like this one, and I think that's what you were getting at.",
        "Are there other directions that we can go that would generate other, similarly powerful programs?",
        "Well, one direction that we have seen that works, have we not, is when the price of gasoline goes to $4 a gallon, people are motivated.",
        "For sure, yes, and you know, and that's perfectly, you know, that's perfectly natural.",
        "That's what we would expect.",
        "One thing that's interesting, and there's some research going on to kind of substantiate this, but one thing that's interesting is that, remember, gas prices varied a lot before they got to $4 a gallon, and in principle, you know, we should you might think that we would react even before gas reaches some very high threshold.",
        "And so you would expect that as gas prices change from 2003 to 2006, early 2007, that as gas prices went up, we should be, you know, more and more willing to buy hybrids.",
        "And what's interesting is that it appears that, yes, we became somewhat more willing to buy fuel-efficient cars but not as much as the financial differences would predict.",
        "And then in 2008, when gas prices really hit the roof, you couldn't give away an SUV, and you couldn't rent an SUV on the the rental car companies couldn't give away SUVs."
