        "Since his public admission, Fabrizi has worked hard to repair his image, going so far as to take a drug test for the local newspaper.",
        "And in a city where pay to play WAS the motto, he tells everyone the same thing.",
        "If for any reason, any reason whatsoever, if you feel that there are unnecessary roadblocks, you can call the United States attorney, you could file ethics complaints.",
        "And Fabrizi says he's making headway on Bridgeport's two other big roadblocks: developing abandoned industrial sites, and trying to build a tax base in a city where a huge chunk of property is controlled by hospitals, schools, and other non profits.",
        "Joseph Celli directs one of those non-profits, the Black Rock Art Center; the old bank building attracts people from outside Bridgeport to a series of world music concerts.",

        "Chris Bruhl, the president and CEO of the Business Council of Fairfield County, says Bridgeport now sees the value in being part of a New York metropolitan area, and that means sharing a vision with its wealthy neighbors."
