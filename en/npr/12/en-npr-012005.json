        "It was something...",
        "No, initially, it was brought about because this school has a lot of title-one children, low-income children with some learning disabilities, and there's also a lot of children that have high learning capability that aren't being addressed.",
        "And even though there's money in the system for TAG, it isn't there.",
        "And these kids who need the extra attention aren't able to advance they way need to, and it's almost like we're kind of settling and, you know, focusing on the lower level, and instead of encouraging the kids, you know, that have a lot of talent, knowledge to excel.",
        "And so, we're really hoping that this program will just, you know, raise the standards of the school, in fact.",

        "As far as the battle in the swamp is concerned, it's going to be a defensive struggle that I think LSU might just win.",
        "Really?",
        "What do you think, Boston?",
        "Well obviously, in Texas and Oklahoma you both - both teams have two great quarterbacks in Colt McCoy in Texas and Sam Bradford in Oklahoma.",
        "But I really think that Oklahoma - yes, as D-Will has mentioned - have it on both sides of the ball.",
        "Their defense is very dominating and suffocating, and I think the Sooners will take care of Texas.",
        "As far as LSU and Florida, being Louisiana-bred that I am, I really think that LSU's defense really will go down into the Swamp and beat Florida.",
        "I think Florida, you know, showed a little weakness when they lost to Old Miss.",
        "Maybe a lack of focus, but losing to Old Miss was not a good thing for Florida.",
        "And I really think LSU is really finding themselves and finding their groove, especially with their young quarterback Jarrett Lee, who really stepped up big time a couple weeks ago in Auburn and led LSU to a victory at Auburn.",
        "Greg Lee, I'm going to have to stop calling you Boston and start calling you Baton Rouge, I suppose.",

        "Well yes, they do as far as depth is concerned.",
        "But these starters on both sides of the ball for these smaller schools are equal now in talent to the larger schools.",
        "And as long as they can avoid injuries or get into a smash-mouth type of game the way that college offensive systems are, they can spread the field, run the ball.",
        "As long as you have a good set of core athletes, these smaller schools can keep up.",
        "And with the multitude of athletes across the country and the fewer scholarships that are allowed in college football, it allows these athletes to go to smaller schools.",

        "So it's shown nationally on DirectTV and that sort.",

        "Yes.",
        "Like USC versus Oregon.",

        "This is, of course, a television phenomenon putting the games on on Thursday.",

        "And particularly for the bigger schools.",
        "They don't need the exposure.",
        "They don't need to build a reputation.",
        "For these smaller schools like Oregon State - and it is a large school, but it's smaller in stature than USC is as far as its football program is concerned.",
        "That game was a Super Bowl type of game or national championship game for Oregon State.",
        "It is their one chance to play on national television and show the country what they're about.",
        "In the case of Oregon State, they came off a bye week, they had nine full days to prepare for that game.",
        "And this was everything to them.",
        "And this was everything to them.",
        "And that's how these upsets occur.",
        "Additionally, for the larger schools and the athletes in those schools, the athletes who are going to be professionals, those games often can only hurt their status in the NFL - coming NFL draft.",
        "A bad game on national television during the middle of the week when it's the only game on television can drop their draft stock from a first round draft choice to a third round draft choice because those - the sport jocks and the ESPNs of the world will never let them - never let you forget that they had that bad game under quote, pressure.",
