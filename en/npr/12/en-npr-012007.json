        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, I have a good friend who just lost both of her cats, and I believe it was from the pet food.",
        "And I was wondering if there was going to be anything done for the people who are actually losing their pets.",
        "Steve Dale, do you know?",

        "Sure.",
        "And I'm so sorry, and please express my condolences to your friend.",
        "I mean regardless of the reason why they did pass away, it's a tragedy.",
        "You know, veterinarians are hearing in enormous numbers from concerned pet owners, of course, and some of those concerns are, on the surface, valid.",
        "An example is something called polycystic kidney disease.",
        "I bring up kidney disease because it seems that acute kidney failure, it seems, is what is happening to the pets that are eating this tainted or who have eaten the tainted pet food.",
        "Well, this is a genetic-based disease.",
        "In a minute, they're gonna to have down there a hundred thousand people coming from New Orleans here, and it's gonna be hectic for the city.",
        "It's unlikely that this terrible kidney disease has anything to do with pet food.",
        "So you really need to see your veterinarian.",
        "And it's a difficult thing to confirm, but some of these people, well-meaning - and it's human nature -are assuming that it's the pet food that caused the problem when it might not have been."

        "Two weeks before she passed, she stopped eating and then she just went fast.",

        "Yeah, and I could say as a devoted cat owner and somebody who has seen many elderly cats - fortunately in my life had many, many cats live very long - that is how cats tend to die when they're 18.",
        "You know, that's how it happens.",
        "And cats I think even a little more than dogs don't really display when they're not feeling well, except for stopping to eat.",
        "So, you know, honestly, my reaction is that 18 years is a fantastic lifespan.",
        "And I hope that she would choose to do what I chose to do when my cat died, which was to absolutely celebrate the life because that's a very, very long, long life.",
        "And certainly you shouldn't feel guilty over a cat who appears to have died of natural causes at the age of 18.",
        "No, I would say - I mean, I think all of us feel guilty when our pets die because, you know, maybe Meka was there holding her cat when it was euthanized, as I was.",
        "And honestly even if you feel that that is absolutely the thing to do, you'll always wonder if your animal had another day, you know, in them when you made this terrible - you know, this agonizing choice to make."
