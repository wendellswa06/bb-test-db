        "And we're joined in the studio now by Ambassador Martin Indyk, former U.S.",
        "Ambassador to Israel.",
        "He now directs the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution.",
        "Thanks very much for being with us, Mr. Ambassador.",
        "My pleasure, Scott.",
        "And help us understand.",
        "Israel's reaction to the capture of two Israeli soldiers has been decried as disproportionate in a great many quarters, an arm and a leg, an eye and an arm and a leg as opposed to an eye for an eye.",
        "Help us to understand what Israeli policy is hoping to accomplish.",
        "Well, I think one has to understand the broader context in which Israel withdrew from Lebanon six years ago, completely, and was endorsed by a U.N.",
        "Security Council resolution.",
        "And in the meantime, Hezbollah, with the help of Iran and the facilitation of Syria, has been building up a vast arsenal of rockets, some 10,000, now missiles with longer range that can hit the Israeli City of Haifa, and as Nasrullah had said yesterday, beyond Haifa.",
        "And this has just been building up on Israel's northern border.",
        "The Lebanese government, notwithstanding U.N.",
        "Security Council resolutions which require it to extend its sovereignty to the south and send its army down there, has been too weak to do that.",
        "And so the context of Hezbollah's operation, particularly with what's going on with Hamas, led Israel, I think, to decide enough's enough, and we are going to take down this Hezbollah infrastructure that threatens our northern villages, towns and even cities.",
        "So that's the broader context in which they're operating.",
        "Let me ask you a huge question that presents itself very urgently now.",
        "Can Israel destroy Hezbollah and the infrastructure without at the same time destroying the infrastructure of the Lebanese government that had actually made Israel hopeful when it came into power that there were some co-existence there?",
        "Well, that is the heart of the matter.",
        "You've put your finger on it.",
        "And it's a very delicate line to walk.",
        "I think President Bush tried to signal to the Israelis that he didn't want the Lebanese government toppled at the same time as they tried to go after Hezbollah.",
        "But the trick here is not so much in the military area, although that's important, but it's somehow to use force in a coercive way to get the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people to turn on Hezbollah and say enough's enough, we cannot take this anymore, you have to disarm, you don't have the right as a militia, now that we have a Lebanese democracy, to operate like this.",
        "The U.N.",
        "Security Council Resolution 1559, which called for the withdrawal of Syrian troops, and that was implemented, also called for the disarmament of Hezbollah.",
        "For people like Hilton, who don't own property or have steady jobs, the decision to stay in Texas is easy.",

        "He launched into a diatribe about what he called a coup that's being launched by forces on the far-right aided by what he called imperialists.",
        "Venezuela has eight strategic military command centers around the country, and all of their commanders also separately announced their support for Maduro, a number of them doing that on state-run TV as well.",
        "So the army top brass for now is behind Maduro.",
        "If he loses their support, it's very likely game over for him.",
        "And the opposition, as you know, have been appealing to the army to abandon him and talking about an amnesty, although it's not yet clear how widely that amnesty would apply to the high command.",
        "And what about Maduro himself?",
        "Has he been spotted today?",
        "Oh, yes, very much so (laughter).",
        "He's been live on TV, making a lengthy speech at the Supreme Court.",

        "At one point, he broke into English and said, hands off Venezuela.",

        "Do we know where he is?",

        "He's been tweeting, mostly so far tweets thanking the long list of countries mostly in the Western Hemisphere that have stepped up and recognized him as the interim president of Venezuela after he made that announcement in such a dramatic fashion in front of a cheering crowd in the heart of Caracas yesterday.",
        "So he's been doing that.",
        "And there's been one very important development as far as he's concerned, which concerns the fact that the U.S.",
        "is now saying that not only do they support and recognize him, but they plan to channel revenues towards him.",
        "And that means revenues from the oil that they buy off Venezuela, which is a considerable amount of money.",
        "Right, it's, like, a billion dollars a month.",
