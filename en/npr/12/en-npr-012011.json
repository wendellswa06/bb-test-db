        "He has become one of the best-selling solo artists of all time.",
        "This week, he had a keynote speech during South by Southwest.",
        "He also hosted a free concert.",
        "And he was nice enough to make time to speak with us now.",
        "Thank you so much for joining me.",
        "You kidding me?",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's very sweet.",
        "Now, this festival focuses on music, technology and film.",
        "And it often talks about the subject of disruption and change in all of those industries.",
        "How has the industry changed since you've been involved in it?",
        "(Laughter) Oh, you don't have a - this show ain't long enough for that.",
        "You've got to remember, when I - when we hit, it was vinyl, cassettes.",
        "CDs weren't even out yet, right?",
        "So then I remember CDs were coming out right when the first album came out.",
        "So my first album that they gave me that was free cost me 300 bucks because I ran home so excited I didn't realize I don't have a DVD player.",
        "So I had to go out and buy one to hear the first CD of what we got.",
        "So it's been an unbelievable change through it - out.",
        "But the one thing that remains constant is the music and how that music affects people.",
        "I'm very fortunate to be involved with songs like \"\"The Dance,\"\" \"\"If Tomorrow Never Comes.\"\" For that someone's going to pull you over in the grocery store and say, I lost my son and we played \"\"The Dance\"\" at his - and then \"\"To Make You Feel My Love,\"\" \"\"Shameless,\"\" people are going to pull you over and go, that was the first song at our wedding, all right?",
        "Friends In Low Places,\"\" you don't want to know the story they pull you over for that.",
        "But it's so cool that the music kind of gets to be - let you be in their life.",
        "And it's been doing it that way now for 25 years.",
        "How did you come to that insight?",
        "And I do want to mention here that in addition to the singing thing, you also have a B.A.",
        "and you have an MBA.",
        "And I wondered at what point - because you obviously wanted to understand and master the business side as well - at what point did you have a - sort of an epiphany moment where you realized that the business is one thing, the art is another?",
        "Or was that something that you always felt?",
        "Because a lot of artists, just to be honest, are really angry about some of the changes in the industry.",
        "Well, they should be angry about them.",
        "But the artists should be angry for the songwriters.",
        "Those are the people that are getting left behind.",
        "And I'm telling you right now, we talk about movies, we talk about music, we talk about gaming.",
        "If it's not for the people that write it and create it, we don't have it.",
        "And if we do have it, it sucks.",
        "It's very stale.",
        "It's very white.",
        "It's just bleh (ph), right?",
        "And that can't be.",
        "So if anybody should be angry, it should be the songwriters.",
        "What I think I also hear you saying is that people will pay for the things that they value.",
        "And if they value it, then they will find a way to pay for it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean...",
        "...Is that what you're saying?"

        "There was a gentleman out there that asked a question about albums versus singles.",

        "And it might be off the movie \"\"Ghost\"\" when they're doing that clay thing.",
        "It's one of the coolest moments in movie history.",
        "You think about that song, that song's got to be worth more than 99 cents to me in my life, right?",
        "So I think the thing with albums for me, why I love them, is for 10 bucks, price of a movie ticket or maybe a little - you know, a little more, you can see that movie through music a thousand times if you want for the same price.",
        "It's all one upfront.",
        "But what - if you understand how music works, if you understand what that does for the songwriters, that's what makes songwriters survive long enough until they get to write the song that changes the world.",
        "And I think music is that powerful.",
        "So I'll stand behind that any day.",
        "And also, I think I also heard you say that one of the things that streaming does is it help people - it helps people to rediscover songs that perhaps were not well-received when they first came out, or it kind of - sometimes it helps them find a new audience.",
