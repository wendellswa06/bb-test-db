        "But Education Secretary Margaret Spellings says that instead of worrying about No Child Left Behind, states like Utah should be worrying about why white kids do so much better in their schools than minority kids, and she's made it clear in a recent speech that she's willing to play hard ball with the $76 million in federal education money that Utah receives.",
