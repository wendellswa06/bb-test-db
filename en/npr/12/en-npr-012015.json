        "...That I will faithfully execute...",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, that was a rather provocative line I used because I was trying to make a point that federal spending has increased so much on seniors that they are, compared to children especially, relatively well-off, particularly when you consider their health care.",
        "I actually started thinking about this a lot over the summer, when there was so much controversy over health-care reform and seniors are the group most likely to be opposed to President Obama's health-care reform plans - although interestingly enough, they are the people who receive government-backed insurance.",
        "And as I was watching this debate, and then most recently with the announcement that the president wants Congress to give seniors $250 tax because they won't get a cost-of-living adjustment from Social Security, I thought, well, wait a minute.",
        "Why is the federal government spending so much time pandering to seniors?",
        "I certainly know that there are some seniors who are strapped, but there are many more people in other age groups who are strapped.",
        "And well, as you noted, there are some seniors who live on this fixed income and, well, they may argue their expenses have gone up in the past year.",
        "Well, fixed income is an interesting term.",
        "Fixed only means you are no longer working, so you cannot expect to get raises.",
        "You are no longer in the workforce.",
        "But your retirement income might be fixed at a relatively high rate.",
        "Fixed income doesn't mean that you are poor.",
        "And there are many, many workers who haven't gotten raises in a very long time either, so their incomes are also fixed.",
        "Again, I'm not arguing that there are not seniors who are hurting, but there are many people in other age groups - the unemployed - who are hurting more.",
        "Well, they're asking for more unemployment and extension of unemployment insurance, too, so that may well pass as well.",
        "Yes, it may.",
        "But when did we get the idea that a cost-of- living adjustment should be automatic?",
        "The cost-of-living adjustment was put in place to account for inflation, to compensate for inflation.",
        "And in 1975, inflation was galloping and…",
        "Exactly.",
        "…I'm afraid I remember."

        "But, if there is no inflation, there is no need for a cost-of-living adjustment.",

        "Well, entitlement has become a dirty word, interestingly enough.",
        "But the biggest entitlements are those that go to seniors, those that cost the most money.",
        "Medicare and Social Security are the biggest entitlement outlays in the federal budget.",
        "And again, I don't want seniors to get the impression that I begrudge them Medicare or Social Security.",
        "But I am concerned that we are becoming an upside-down culture.",

        "Social Security passed by in the '30s.",
        "Medicare passed by Lyndon Johnson's administration in 1965 gave senior citizens health care.",

        "I didn't actually understand that there were so many seniors who read blog posts and who commented.",
        "But they're out there, they're very upset, many of them saying what you just suggested: Hey, my costs are going up.",
        "I saved my money.",

        "My savings have decreased so, you know…",
