        "Hi.",

        "I mean, and then…",
        "Well, Harold, if…",
        "…if you're talking about food, just in the recent history, dairy products around here - I don't know about where else in the country but around here, they went up 25 percent.",
        "Flour went up 15 - at least 15 percent.",
        "None of that's gone back down.",
        "So are you saying - and so you can do that a couple of years in a row and then - and the way they calculate the inflation, it leaves out important things like that.",
        "Now, to me…",
        "I - Harold…",
        "…it's ridiculous to say that people are doing just as well as they were when these necessities are going up, you know?",
        "I mean, just on the face of this.",
        "It's patented, on the face of it.",
        "Prima facie.",
        "I would certainly never suggest that people are doing well.",
        "The point is that most people are doing poorly in the recession, and there are folks still of working age who've been jobless for months and months and months who don't have Social Security, who don't have pensions, and they have no income coming in.",
        "And they are doing worse than seniors at the moment.",
        "I would also like to point out that fuel prices are actually down from their peak of a few years ago.",
        "Some food prices are still up, some are not.",
        "But the federal government factors in prices across the board, and across the board there is no inflation.",
        "And we can't speak to certain locales, I mean, it might be different…",
        "But that's what I'm talking about - across the board.",
        "That's how they figure it out.",
        "But that doesn't include - that doesn't include these very absolute necessities.",
        "Like food and fuel?",
        "Yes, it does."

        "And your rent - suppose your rent's going up too.",
        "I mean, rent's always going - you know - I mean, you can easily water down the necessities that seniors need by mixing it in with a whole bunch of other stuff.",

        "They want to leave it.",
        "You know, if you just took fuel and food and a few other things that are essential to the survival of seniors, you better believe it will be justifying that - to give them a cost-of-living increase.",

        "Two hundred fifty dollars is insignificant to an individual.",
