        "I think sometimes people who are exercise fanatics or who do a lot of running, they become, quote-unquote, the runner.",
        "That's their identity, and it's very difficult if somebody has to give that up.",
        "They can't imagine any other satisfying way to stay fit.",
        "Pereles says he empathizes, especially now as he, himself, a long-distance runner, is nursing a serious ankle injury.",
        "As we talk, he has one leg elevated and a walker on wheels.",

        "It's very hard.",
        "And people say, well, what are you going to do?",
        "What are you going to do?",
        "And you really have to adapt.",
        "You have to look at the long range, and it's a matter of transition.",
        "Which can be tough, because with the transition comes the acceptance that you may have to alter your expectations and acknowledge your limits.",
        "Myself, I just had this operation about a month ago, and so it is difficult.",
        "And you really do have to force yourself into a routine.",
        "And that takes will power.",
        "Pereles says his new routine, once he recovers, will likely include more swimming and biking, which aren't hard on the joints.",
        "He says with his patients, a big part of getting them over the hump is to help them design new exercise routines.",
        "In fact, I will sit with people, and I will make it part of the visit to establish a habit.",
        "When can we squeeze it in?",
        "Those who are successful in establishing new habits, Pereles says, tend to view their workouts as appointments that can't be broken, something that most runners already have a leg up on.",
        "Over the decades, Howard Stoodley says he's always tried to keep his appointments.",
        "As I've gotten older, I tend to wake up real early.",
        "I woke up at 3:30 this morning, but the first thing I did was about 40 minutes of exercise.",
        "So I do that every day.",
        "I don't miss a day.",
        "His routine is definitely not as rigorous as it once was, and Stoodley says sometimes in his sleep, he still dreams that he's running."

        "And though Amazon sells much more than books now, you can buy basically anything you would ever want on Amazon, it's their identity as a bookseller that drove them to make tablets.",
