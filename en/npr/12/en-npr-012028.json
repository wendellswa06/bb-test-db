        "By contrast, the earthquake that devastated Haiti was much closer to the earths surface and was very close to the capital, Port-au-Prince.",

        "The philosophy of earthquake codes until relatively recently was to prevent the loss of life, in other words to prevent the collapse of buildings or houses.",

        "Well, you start with the materials and there are choices of materials in Chile.",
        "For the most part they use - for high-risk buildings they use concrete, reinforced concrete or reinforced concrete and steel.",
        "But on the other hand you have materials which are very poor for an earthquake country, and that would be adobe for example.",
        "We were just hearing about the 15-story building in Concepcion that collapsed.",
        "So clearly this is not failsafe, these codes that youre talking about or else that building may have been poorly constructed.",
        "That may be so.",

        "I mean just by looking very briefly at the video I couldnt really tell.",
        "What did it look like to you, that building?",
        "Well, it seemed that it failed at the foundation level because the whole building rotated as a rigid body actually.",
        "When youre designing earthquake proof or earthquake resistant buildings, what are you trying to do?",
        "What are you trying to get that building to do when it responds to shaking?",
        "Well, you would like to make sure that the building will not fail and youre trying to achieve that by making what the engineers call a ductile -ductility.",
        "Ductility is - its very easy to explain.",
        "I mean, you take a paper clip and you bend it back and forth, and it doesnt break.",
        "On the other hand, you take a piece of chalk, which is brittle, and you bend a little bit and it breaks immediately.",
        "So, concrete in principle is also brittle material but by adding adequate amounts of steel you can make it ductile.",
        "When you heard about what had happened and you thought about what would be happening in Chile - which is where you're from - what did you imagine?",
