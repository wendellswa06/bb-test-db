        "We had that up until a couple years ago.",
        "Basically, nurses are assigned according to numbers and acuity.",

        "The vast majority of schools have no vice principal, no counselors; and we have only one secretary in most schools.",

        "And to cut back necessary resources for vulnerable children, is not in the best interests of the state.",
