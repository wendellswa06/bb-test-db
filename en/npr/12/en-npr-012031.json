        "Waxman says there are some gray areas in the law and that the only clear and universally recognized justifications for using force are self-defense against an armed attack or U.N.",

        "Waxman says administration lawyers are undoubtedly trying to find other legal frameworks for intervention in Syria.",
        "He says they could try to use a 1999 precedent, when President Bill Clinton ordered a NATO air war in Kosovo on humanitarian grounds.",
        "The U.S.",
        "did not actually come out and say that the intervention in Kosovo was legal; what they said was that it was justified.",
        "And they picked that word very carefully, to say that it was justified rather than legal, because I think the lawyers inside the Clinton administration concluded that there wasn't a strong legal agreement.",
        "But for policy reasons, for moral reasons, there was a strong imperative to go in anyway.",
        "Michael Scharf, an international law expert with Case Western Reserve University, says the Clinton administration argued that the Kosovo intervention should not be used as precedent for future justifications.",
        "They said, we are afraid of humanitarian intervention because it's a concept that can so easily be abused as a pretext for land grabs and political change in neighboring countries.",
        "And therefore, they said at the time, this is not a precedent.",
        "But what's interesting is even a situation that is claimed not be a precedent can become one.",
        "Scharf says the Obama administration may find some relief in other international agreements regarding chemical weapons: the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which Syria signed in 1968; and the 1992 Chemical Weapons Convention.",
        "Both ban the use of chemical weapons.",
        "Syria can't claim that because it didn't ratify the recent treaty, it's allowed to use chemical weapons.",
        "It's simply not.",
        "And also, the Geneva Conventions to which it is a party to clearly say you can't use chemical weapons against a civilian population.",
        "So, it is in breach of one of the most important prohibitions in international law.",

        "That's one of the wonderful things about jazz, is that we welcome everything into the melting pot.",
        "Yet I looked at the list of performers that you have in this upcoming, new season of PIANO JAZZ, and several of them - it surprised me - started out as classical performers.",
        "Yes, I know.",

        "So I mean, that's - then you're doing jazz, really.",
        "But it raises the question of where young people these days learn, and should we consider jazz now a concert - conservatory music?",
        "Yes.",
        "And the thing that is unique about jazz as a concert music is that you can change things.",

        "So obviously, one of the traditions of piano jazz, that collaboration - that sustains.",
        "I love that Marian had such a original idea in 1979, when she started the show - because there was no such thing as a jazz show, where you brought on an artist to talk about jazz and to improvise with the host.",
        "But Marian was perfect for that because she - her general knowledge is so tremendous; her musicianship is so wonderful; she's so personable.",
        "And she is the artistic director of PIANO JAZZ RISING STARS, the show that I'm beginning next week.",
        "And she loves Grace Kelly, by the way, who just is - at age 19, listen to her swing.",
        "That song, I believe, is called \"\"Philosophical Flying Fish.\"\" And she swings like she's been doing it all her life, and I guess she has.",
