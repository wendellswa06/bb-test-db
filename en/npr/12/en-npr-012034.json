        "Not many people who I talked to had actually read it and--or knew exactly what it said.",
        "But they understood the main concerns that a lot of Sunni Arabs have, the main one of which is the federalism issue that the new constitution would partition Iraq into semi-autonomous regional enclaves in the Kurdish north and the Shiite south and that the Sunnis, many people believe, would be left isolated and without access to resources, in particular oil and the revenue that it provides under the new document.",

        "Most people said that they turned out because they'd been asked to by their--or told to by their religious leaders.",
