        "Do you think that was a mistake to have promised cranes on the skyline by September?",
        "No.",
        "No, no. I think two things about it.",

        "What are the challenges in particular of working here in New Orleans?",
        "You have gotten into some trouble before with things you've said about this place, talking about a mendicant's mentality, comparing people here to buffoons.",
        "What do you mean by those statements?",
        "Well, I think the mendicant mentality is that people had their hands out looking for the federal government, and clearly there are some people who felt this was a game that they could, you know, basically run a game on the system, and I don't think that's right.",
        "I mean, here we have a system that's broken.",
        "It's not your turn to get money from the government and not fix it.",
        "It's your turn to put your shoulder to the wheel and fix it and to deal with some of the underlying problems, problems of race, problems of class, problems of poor education, problems of an economy that only had one thing going for it, and that was, you know, beds and food and drink, and you have to have more, you know, more economic alternatives, more diversity.",

        "Well, when the buildings are coming up, when the plan is in place, when all the programs and projects are moving forward, and the school district is running and humming; then I can say sayonara.",
