        "He says unlike most other states, the Texas law provides a much needed reality check to families who don't truly understand the limitations of medicine.",
        "He says loved ones are often influenced by inaccurate medical information found on line or the numerous medical TV dramas depicting patients being brought back to life despite dire situations.",
        "Fine says many families have unrealistic expectations that the same is possible in real life.",
        "All of us human beings, we go through certain predictable psychological stages.",

        "When we are first told our loved one is dying it is very human to say that can't be true.",

        "Many doctors, in fact, are being well paid to provide treatment that they think is inappropriate and it breaks their heart.",
        "I've had doctors say to me, I'm embarrassed that I'm being forced to do this by the family.",
        "I'm being paid, but this is wrong and it makes me really sad to have to do this.",
        "But critics of the law, like attorney Jerry Ward, say it gives doctors and hospitals an unfair advantage.",
        "Ward, who's worked with the families of several patients whose care was deemed futile, says a hospital only has to give a family 48 hours notice before holding a meeting with an ethics committee.",
        "And sometimes that 48-hour notice comes on a Friday afternoon.",
        "That is not sufficient time for a family to get an attorney, to get a second opinion from an expert or a doctor who's not affiliated with the hospital, or to do any meaningful preparation in order to make their case before the committee.",
        "Ward is a member of a group called the Advanced Directives Coalition, which has been meeting to discuss potential amendments to the law.",
        "The group's membership is diverse and includes some, like Dr. Robert Fine, who believe the law needs little in the way of change.",
        "But Jerry Ward is one of several members who hope to make it much more difficult for hospitals to be allowed to end life support.",
        "What I want to see is that hospitals in these instances have to treat until transfer.",
        "Because I do not think that they should have the right to take an action that ends someone's life just because of what they consider to be their ethical position.",
        "The Advanced Directives Coalition will meet today.",
        "To amend the current law in any way they'll need to agree upon a proposal within the first 60 days of the Texas legislative session, which begins next month.",
        "So far, the group has yet to reach a consensus as to what changes, if any, should be made."

        "Hundreds of thousands of people marched across the country in support of tighter gun restrictions.",
        "But what you might not have heard is that Congress and the president passed a couple of new rules about guns in the spending bill that was signed into law on Friday.",
        "One is meant to close a loophole that allowed the mass shooter in Sutherland Springs, Texas last year to pass a background check.",
        "The other frees the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence.",

        "That's the National Instant Criminal Background Check system run by the FBI.",
        "How does this law work to strengthen background checks?",
        "Because the background check system that we have right now is incomplete and sometimes inaccurate.",
        "Oftentimes, federal agencies or local law enforcement agencies do not upload that data.",
        "That was the case in Texas with the church shooting.",
        "And we've also found that states, really, are not on the hook for providing any sort of verification whether or not they are in compliance.",
        "And so FixNICS is intended to require public reporting and verification from various agencies to confirm that they are uploading the data because our background check system is only effective when we have accurate and comprehensive data submitted into it.",
        "Republicans have been hesitant to pass any sort of gun control measures and FixNICS isn't a new idea.",
        "Why did this finally pass now?",
        "It's always possible to make amends with a number of gestures to other nations.",
        "But I think it's a startling thing when, for instance, the British media says that never in the history of America has an American president gone on foreign soil and been so critical of his home nation.",
        "I think that's a mistake.",
        "And there is the incident of an op-ed that was published in The Wall Street Journal in 2002.",
        "It was cautioning the administration against invading Iraq.",
        "It was written by Brent Scowcroft, who had been national security advisor to the first President Bush.",
        "Many people at the time thought, wow, that must be, in some sense or another, a backdoor communication, but there's no indication that the first President Bush agreed with Scowcroft or disagreed with his son.",
        "Jon Meacham quotes the elder Bush as saying, I think Brent had some very different opinions and saying he was free to speak out.",
        "But Meacham really concludes that the elder Bush essentially agreed with his son about going to war in Iraq."
