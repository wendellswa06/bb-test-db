        "Send it to the president's desk, and do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.",
        "The bill essentially rewards states for reporting cases of people deemed mentally ill by a court to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.",
        "The State of Virginia had not reported Virginia Tech killer Cho's mental history.",
        "Joining the survivors was the bill's chief sponsor in the House, New York Democrat Carolyn McCarthy, who lost her husband in another shooting rampage.",
        "Mental illness alone, she said, is not enough to wind up in the NICS' database.",

        "But what really bothers him, he says, is that military veterans who sought help for combat-related mental problems may end up in the NICS' database and be barred forever from buying guns.",
