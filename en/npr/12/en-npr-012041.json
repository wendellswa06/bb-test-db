        "It's spot on.",
        "I've both sides of it, both in having films in the Oscar contention and trying to get notice and the process that it takes to - especially when you're a smaller film - to really get yourself to that level.",
        "But I think the thing that's really interesting now that I haven't seen in the past is - I'm one of the original members of a group called group PUGG, P-U-G-G, and our platform essentially helps documentary filmmakers as well as narrative filmmakers really find their niche audiences and pinpoint in what areas of the country and soon to be in other countries where your film might play.",
        "And basically it's just like Kickstarter meets Netflix for movie theatres.",
        "So in essence you have to meet a certain threshold of people interested to see your film and buy a normal movie ticket priced ticket to it, and the theater is yours.",
        "So we've done actually over a thousand events now but a lot of those have been, you know, filmmakers looking for a way to distribute their content nationwide, because your big dream is, oh, I'm going to play in Sundance, I'm going to play at some other big festival and we're going to get picked up and we'll have a distributor and our film is going to get out there.",
        "But even in the case of some of the bigger documentaries, you're really looking at very few cities, very little support in order to really help get that message up.",
        "So it's kind of like we need to present tools to filmmakers to get that voice out there, especially when it comes to things that may not be financially valuable to a distributor as some of these niche docs are.",
        "But what we've noticed is that you can actually do national releases with - whatever film it is, there is going to be an audience for it.",
        "And it's kind of like up to you to make that decision of which cities you play in, depending on on-demand market size.",
        "Well, it's interesting - finding that boutique market, if you will, Bob Mondello, making the film is hard enough, raising that money.",
        "Making money at it, that's almost impossible.",
        "Yes, the exhibition of these pictures is a real tricky thing.",
        "And it's one of the hassles that documentary companies have when they're trying to distribute them, is that outside of New York and L.A., a lot of these pictures don't play, never play.",
        "And I think the caller's program is a wonderful one for getting things out there.",
        "What is difficult these days is to know where - I mean a lot of these pictures, when you see them, you think, well, that's sort of an HBO documentary.",
        "That's sort of a, you know, not - whether it's made by HBO or not, it - maybe the style of those documentaries.",
        "And you think that the people have learned the techniques now and there's a way of making them.",
        "And this is what I said before about - you have to figure out what it is you're judging with this kind of thing, whether you're judging the adventuresomeness of it, the message of it, the simple - I mean, you know, with the last one, \"\"Invisible War,\"\" I ended up feeling, oh my God, this story is just wrenching.",
