        "I had been a conventional pitcher for some time professionally and, you know, I had to come to terms with my own mediocrity.",
        "And that's a hard thing to do for an athlete.",
        "And thankfully I had shown the knuckleball enough in my practice sessions and occasionally when I throw it in a game where Orel Hershiser, the pitching coach for the Texas Rangers, said I think you can do this the full time, because what you're doing now as a conventional pitcher just wasn't going to cut it anymore.",
        "And so I had to take that next step and I did that in 2005.",
        "It's relatively unusual for - Hershiser, of course, a great pitcher himself in his day, but a conventional pitcher, and - for pitching coaches to embrace the knuckler.",
        "Yeah, it's difficult because, you know, I mean, a knuckleball represents a very small fraternity of human beings in that there's probably only been 60 or 70 knuckleballers that ever have walked the face of the Earth, I mean really, without being too dramatic - without being too dramatic about it.",
