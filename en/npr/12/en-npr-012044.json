        "Havel says the disappearance of the Malaysian Air flight has revealed gaps in the law.",
        "I think this situation, since it's so unusual, is creating new issues of to what extent states ought to collaborate, with what level of resources they should collaborate and so on.",
        "So I think we're in a frontier area here as far as international search and rescue is concerned.",
        "Right now, Malaysia is leading the investigation as it was a Malaysian airliner which took off from Malaysia.",

        "I've not had direct contact with my counterpart in Malaysia, but there has been contact between the various investigative agencies, the FBI here and the relevant agencies in Malaysia, and that conversation, all those conversations are ongoing.",
        "Some Republicans in Congress have asserted that the FBI should take over the probe from Malaysian authorities, an idea dismissed by former NTSB managing director Goelz.",
        "We can't just go over and take over because this is an investigation being run by a sovereign country.",
        "If the plane is found in someone else's territorial water, then the investigative landscape changes.",
        "When an Air France jet crashed into the Atlantic a few years ago on a flight from Rio, the black boxes on board were eventually recovered by technicians from The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.",
        "That Massachusetts facility has also offered its assistance in this case, but so far has heard nothing from Malaysian authorities."

        "Wind currents, I would say, and also, you know, it takes a great deal of hand-eye coordination to be able to be comfortable with the feel of a good knuckleball.",
