        "Yeah.",
        "You know, last year was Tim's retirement year, and so after he left the game, it left only me.",
        "And it was a sweet moment to see that in the film when I watched it myself, because he and I have become friends.",
        "And you certainly have an instant bond there when you're trying to do this for a living and you come across other men who have done it for a living.",

        "And I didn't really use it until I was in my late 30s, and I started playing amateur baseball.",
        "And I lost my fastball and I had a little bit of slider, but I went back to knuckler.",
        "And it took a couple years to get so I could throw it so it looked like a butterfly.",
        "But I played until I was 48.",
        "And the looks on some people's face as I threw that, and a forkball, both, were just priceless.",

        "Yeah.",

        "So I can certainly, you know, relate to that story, that anecdote.",
        "I think, you know, that's why - I would say some - for some of us, that's a real rewarding feature of throwing a knuckleball, is that there's something very chaotic to it.",
        "And if I don't where it's going a lot of the time, there's really a good chance the hitter doesn't know where it's going.",
        "So if you throw a good one, you know it, and it comes out of your hands just right, perfectly.",
        "I don't know if anybody on Earth can hit it.",
        "And a forkball, for those not initiated, is a way to throw a changeup that also sinks.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "And in your book, you make the argument that learning to throw the knuckleball required learning to come to terms with yourself emotionally, as well.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It was no coincidence in my own life that, you know, they paralleled one.",
        "My growth as a knuckleballer and my growth as a human being kind of paralleled one another.",
        "And what I mean by that is when I really started to embrace who I was and what made me unique in my own personality and not be ashamed of that, it really allowed me to step deeper into my craft as a knuckleballer.",
        "And I was thankful for people that had taught me to be self-aware enough to know that there a lot of things in my life that I could get better at.",
        "And, you know, that really helps me perform in my career, as well.",
        "And so, yeah, I would say for sure that those things coincided.",
        "And that through struggles of a 35-year-old man, at one point, sent back down to the Minor Leagues, where most of those kids are in their mid-to-low 20s."

        "I mean, they call it a knuckleball because you see the knuckles sticking straight up in the air when your grip is coming forward to the hitter.",
        "But at the same time, it's your fingernails that are dug into the surface area of the leather of the baseball that enable you to stabilize it in a way where you can release it without spin.",
