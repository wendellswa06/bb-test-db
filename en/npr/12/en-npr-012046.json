        "Just weeks after his election, he fired several senior defense officials, effectively seizing power from the military government that ruled after former President Hosni Mubarak stepped down.",
        "He ordered airstrikes on Islamists in the Sinai Peninsula, cracked down on critics in the press, and President Morsi has been a visible actor in world affairs.",
        "He made his first trip outside the country, to China.",
        "He disappointed the United States by going to the Non-aligned Summit in Tehran where he then stunned his hosts and angered Syria with a full embrace for Syria's rebels.",

        "Nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Nice to be here, thank you.",
        "And President Morsi's boldest move, no doubt, was to fire some of the defense chiefs who had been trying to limit his powers.",
        "Yes, I think that really shocked everybody here in Egypt, observers of Egypt, because many people saw him as an uncharismatic leader who was in the pocket of the military council.",
        "And he took this bold move and got rid of the top two generals of that council and promoted his allies and has since continued to make bold moves in the same manner.",
        "Does that mean that he has effectively seized control of the military, that Egyptians' civilian-elected president is now in charge of the military?",
        "I think that might be going a little bit too far.",
        "It seems clear from what happened is that he negotiated a deal with younger members of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and was able to bring those men up while exploiting the dissatisfaction with the leadership from within the military."

        "And so I would say it was more of a deal that allowed him to take back both presidential power but also legislative power while continuing to please what is still a very powerful force in Egypt, the military.",
        "So the military's economic privileges and that sort of thing, those are untouched?",
        "So far.",
        "I mean, of course we don't know all the ins and outs of this deal until we see what the constitution looks like, which has still not been written, but the drafts that are leaking out show that their economic interests will be protected.",
        "And again, we won't have parliament oversight over that budget.",
        "It will be a one-line item that goes to parliament.",
        "So for now, it looks like the military still has the protections they want, which was probably part of this decision.",
        "But I wouldn't, you know, under - I wouldn't rob from that decision that Morsi made.",
        "It really turned things around for him.",
        "It came right after this major attack in Sinai that killed 16 Egyptian soldiers.",
        "He was unable to attend that funeral because there was so much animosity towards him.",
        "And he was able to really turn the tides by saying hey, I'm the president, and I'm going to change the military council.",
        "And since then, he's gotten a lot more widespread support, publicly, than he had before he made that move.",
        "And that attack in the Sinai at the crossing, that really is his first crisis.",
        "Islamist militants attacked the border post, killed 16 people who were completely unprepared for this and then crossed into Israel where they were killed, in turn, by the Israelis.",
        "President Morsi responded to this by attacking some of those forces in Sinai that have been allowed to, more or less, run rampant the last few years.",
        "Well at least publicly we're seeing that there's a (technical difficulties) campaign, but it actually seems that on the ground, the military campaign that's going on in Sinai is a lot less active than it's being showed to be - or than it's being showed on state television and state media.",
        "When you speak to Sinai residents and Sinai tribal leaders, they actually say a lot of it is quite exaggerated and for public consumption.",
        "But that, yes, is his first crisis.",
        "He has to show that he can not only secure Sinai but secure Egypt, which has been dealing with a larger security vacuum in general since the revolution last year.",
        "And in the process, he had his first dealings with Israel.",
        "Well, his - the military definitely has dealt with Israel.",
        "There's been no direct contact other than this letter, which was supposedly from the president here through official channels to the Israeli government, which was then denied by Morsi.",
        "But there has been coordination between the Egyptian military and the Israeli military about that border point."

        "I mean, the last major protest that we saw in Tahrir was an anti-Brotherhood protest.",
        "But because of the moves that Morsi took against the military just before that protest, it really undercut it, and it was only a few hundred people.",
        "So today it's just a traffic circle with a few tents of people who are against the Brotherhood rule - which is the organization that Mohammed Morsi comes from - and people driving through, really.",

        "As you say, he did fight in World War II, actually in Guadalcanal, and then he actually volunteered to fight in Korea.",
        "Correct.",
        "And from what I understand, in one battle he was leading not only his own platoon but two other platoons as well, and was trying to take a hill that the Chinese held, and when the Chinese were attacking these platoons, he decided to go it alone.",
        "Well, that's fairly accurate, Madeleine.",
        "This was a series of - a long battle that stretched out over 11 days in the Korean war.",
        "There were three bunkers up on top of a very steep, jagged hill.",
        "The company was not able to take those.",
        "And so Woody at about 1:00 o'clock that day loaded up with ammunition and just left on his own to go after one of the bunkers, first of all.",
        "And he was a baseball pitcher, so he had a strong arm, and he was very accurate with throwing grenades and was able to knock all three bunkers out, as well as riflemen that were around there, which enabled the company then, George Company, to move up and take over the hill, a very strategic location for the American army at that time.",
        "So he did that all by himself.",
        "Yeah, that's correct.",
        "And I understand he was a big guy.",
        "As you say, he was a baseball pitcher and before World War II was actually being recruited by the Chicago White Sox.",

        "He was shot up pretty bad.",
