        "There was another force in addition to those military leaders that was a break on his authority, and that was Egypt's supreme court.",
        "Indeed, and it's interesting that Morsi has not chosen to take on the judiciary until now.",
        "I think that that's a function of the fact that the judiciary is largely held in high regard by many Egyptians.",
        "The military certainly was, and the idea of the military certainly remains important to most Egyptians, but those senior officers had compromised themselves by the way in which they ruled Egypt in the 18 months between Mubarak's fall and Morsi's election.",
        "I think much depends, going forward, on what this new constitution is going to look like, what the formal relationship will be between the president, the government and the military, where does the judiciary sit in the separation of powers in the new Egypt."
