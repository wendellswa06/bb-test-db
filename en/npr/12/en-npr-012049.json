        "Well, in fact it's interesting that the caller raises the issue of Sadat, because in many ways, what President Morsi has done and the way he has gone about moving out this senior rung of military officers, is reminiscent of what Anwar Sadat did in May 1971, which was subsequently called the Corrective Revolution, in which he also cultivated a rung of younger officers to replace a group that was loyal to the previous president.",
        "I wouldn't draw the conclusion that these new officers that have been promoted by Morsi are somehow less competent than Field Marshal Tantawi and Lieutenant General Sami Anan and their fellow officers.",
        "Tantawi did not have a good reputation as a capable military officer, though Anan did.",
        "And if we want to go back to historical patterns, the people that Sadat cultivated and promoted at the expense of loyalists to his predecessor, Nassir, were the ones who planned and successfully executed Egypt's crossing of the Suez Canal on October 6th, 1973, which is Egypt's greatest modern military achievement.",
        "And Leila Fadel, how much do we know about this new cadre of top military commanders?",
        "Well, we know that they - for example, Sisi, the new defense minister, was one of the generals that defended controversial virginity tests.",
        "Women were basically sexually assaulted when they were detained by the military.",
        "So it's not that they're reformist or revolutionary or anything like that, but they are, as Steven Cook said, is that they're being cultivated to consolidate the Brotherhood power.",
        "They are not opponents to the Brotherhood.",
        "The Brotherhood is coming into a bureaucracy that has been raised to suspect them, and so now they're trying to consolidate power with allies in powerful positions.",
        "We're talking about Egypt after the Arab spring.",
        "If you've been following events there, what's surprised you since Mohammed Morsi took office as president?",

        "Women on state TV under Hosni Mubarak were effectively forbidden to wear headscarves.",
        "On Sunday, the midday news anchor took the air with a plain, bone-colored scarf wrapped around her head and neck, the first woman to do that on state TV in 50 years.",
        "Hello, I'm - was alarmed when I heard that Morsi went to Iran to I guess talk to them about the struggle in Syria.",
        "And now we know, I guess, we understand at least that Iran is supporting the Assad regime.",
        "And now I'm, you know, the people that are struggling against the regime are Sunni.",
        "And now supposedly Morsi is a Sunni also, but yet he's going to Iran to discuss Syria.",
        "That whole thing was very suspicious.",
        "Some call that religious freedom; others fear it's a sign the Muslim Brotherhood plans to enforce religious law in a country that's long kept religion and government apart.",
        "We're talking today about the new Egypt and what's changed in recent months.",

        "He wrote the book \"\"The Struggle for Egypt.\"\" And Leila Fadel, let me ask you about that newscaster.",
        "How much of a surprise was that?",
        "Well, I mean, of course it's a surprise.",
        "This is the first time in history that a woman was able to cover her head on state television.",
        "And most Egyptian women do cover their hair.",
        "And so for decades, they have not seen themselves reflected on state television.",
        "So this was actually quite a big step but also a superficial step.",
        "I think the bigger question about media is what do they do with these state institutions who have long been a servant to an autocrat, who have long been there to prop up a leadership and tell the people how great they are.",
        "Is this state television going to be, now, an apparatus to boost the Brotherhood, their ideology and their plans, or is this going to be an actual facet to tell the truth to Egyptians?",
        "And there's also been some other people, in the independent media, who have been coming under attack.",
        "Yes, I mean, Morsi has really been under fire for what his critics say is him trying to oppress freedom of speech.",
        "Of course, there are quite stringent media laws that will, if you're going to protect the press, you'll have to really reform.",
        "But right now, you have an editor of Dustour newspaper, which has been quite critical of the Muslim Brotherhood, to the point where they've called for a military coup.",
        "He's on trial.",
        "As well as a fiery television host who is accused of inciting violence against the president.",
        "So these are alarming indicators, although each case, of course, if you look at it in its own right, you have to see - like Tawfiq Okasha, who went on television, basically called the president's blood fair game, which I'm not sure would be OK in the United States, either.",
        "But generally, people are concerned that the only people going on trial for media crimes of any kind are those that are criticizing the Brotherhood.",
        "So this is an alarming indication, in his first few months, to right away go after his critics.",
        "And Steven Cook, that raises the suspicion that the Brotherhood is being elevated to a new one-party state.",
        "Well, indeed that is the suspicion on the part of the Brotherhood's opponents and some observers, that we would be swapping out the - Mubarak's National Democratic Party, and in its place is Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party.",
        "I think the Freedom and Justice Party has a long way to go before it institutionalizes the kind of power that the NDP once had."

        "But developments, particularly the way in which the government has gone after certain members of the press, the fact that the state still controls major media outlets, the fact that the government seems to believe that these are appropriate in the new Egypt raises concerns about the Brotherhood's commitment to forging a more democratic and open society.",
        "Let's get another caller in on the conversation.",

        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure, go ahead, please.",
        "I'd just like to express a kind of broad sentiment that I don't have a very nuanced understanding of a lot of the things going on.",
        "There's so much that I don't think any one person can really get a grip on, at all.",
        "But I am very, very glad to see that Mohammed Morsi has been a surprising leader to a lot of major powers in the area.",
        "And I think in some ways it's been a long time coming to see a power in the Middle East that kind of represents interests of the Middle East rather than, you know, the Western powers or, you know, Russia or - it's kind of the birth of a powerful voice that belongs solely to the Middle East.",
        "And I hope that he continues to surprise the world.",
        "And I reserve a lot of optimism.",
        "I - you know, things could certainly go south, but it's nice to see something so new and so promising.",
        "Thanks for the call, Andy, and Leila Fadel, are Egyptians optimistic?",
        "Do they think real change is happening?",
        "I think people are really unsure.",

        "So much is unwritten.",
        "They haven't seen their constitution.",
        "They don't know what it will say about the role of religion, the role of the parliament, the role of the executive, who will hold the power.",
        "So it's still really unclear.",
        "I do think that Morsi's move against the top echelons of the military did make people feel like OK, we have a powerful president.",
        "The fact that Morsi came out and said you know what, our foreign policy is going to be more balanced now, we are going to bring back the powerful Egypt, the respected Egypt of the past also made people happy - the way that he made Egyptians feel proud of their president, the way that he sat up a non-aligned meeting in Iran, Syria's biggest backer, and called Bashar al-Assad's presidency illegitimate, his government illegitimate, again that also was something that surprised Egyptians and made them feel that maybe they do have a powerful president."

        "But on the other hand, there is a lot of concern that the Muslim Brotherhood is trying - instead of reforming the institutions, is just reshuffling to put sympathizers within these organizations.",
        "So when you look at state media, for example, the new heads of a lot of these newspapers and state television are seen as Muslim Brotherhood allies, sympathizers.",
        "Will this just be superficial, a lot of talk with Muslim Brotherhood people being put in the top ranks of a system that does not really serve the people, or will there be true reforms in security, media and those - and freedom of expression?",

        "Norman, he went to Iran and promptly denounced the Syrian government, which prompted a walkout by the Syrian delegation.",
        "I think, Steven Cook, if I'm correct, his hosts were not terribly pleased at this.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Indeed they were very unhappy with the fact that Morsi spoke out so forthrightly against the Assad regime, as you said before, calling the Assad's presidency illegitimate.",
        "I think that there was some concern among some observers when Morsi went to Iran, that somehow this was the beginning of a new relationship between Egypt and Iran, some sort of Cairo-Tehran axis.",
        "I think in keeping with Morsi's desire to pursue a more independent foreign policy, there is going to be a new relationship between Egypt and Iran.",
        "But I don't think it's going to be one of strategic cooperation.",
        "Ultimately, the relationship will be better between those two countries, but more likely it'll be one of strategic competition.",
        "The Egyptians believe themselves to be in many ways a natural leader of the region, just as the Iranians want to extend their influence throughout the region, and I think that leads the two countries to a more competitive relationship rather than a cooperative one.",
        "And a more independent foreign policy, i.e., not so closely aligned with Washington.",
        "Indeed, that's the case.",
        "And I think that is what many Egyptians want.",
        "I don't believe that that is a function of Islamist politics per se.",
        "that's not just the platform of the Muslim Brotherhood.",
        "But the relationship, the strategic alignment between Mubarak's Egypt and the United States, was profoundly unpopular among a variety of Egyptians across the political spectrum.",
        "And a more independent foreign policy, one that is focused specifically on what Egypt's interests in the region are is likely to make Egypt a more important player in the region than it was over the course of the last 10 years or so."
