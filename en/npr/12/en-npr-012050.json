        "Well, I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood has given no indication that they plan to cover up all the women and institute Islamic law tomorrow.",
        "I mean, I think, ultimately, the Muslim Brotherhood, as an organization, sees Shariah law or Islamic law as the best law for the land.",
        "But we still haven't seen this constitution and what it will say about Islamic law, and those are hard-fought battles being fought right now.",
        "But I think it's a little bit alarmist to think that Egypt will turn into a Taliban state tomorrow.",
        "I think that the Brotherhood is a little too pragmatic for that right now.",
        "I don't think those social issues are at the top of their priority list when they have to deal with a faltering economy.",
        "And another thing that the Brotherhood often points out is that they were elected, and the parliament's about to be elected, too.",
        "So if the secular and liberal factions of this society want to do well here in the government and have their say, they should start mobilizing for elections the way the Brotherhood did, and I think that's a fair point.",

        "Well, on business for just a real quick trip.",
        "But the interesting perspective should be from the people that I came in contact with, the taxi drivers and the people in hotels, and they see this administration as kind of a foundation, if you will.",
        "I mean, there's a lot of pitfalls ahead of them that I think everybody is aware of, and it's not going to be perfect.",
        "But there's a sense of excitement, I think, for the people on the street that good things are coming.",
        "And tourism is another aspect that they want to get rolling as quickly as possible in Egypt.",
        "I think that's certainly the case.",
        "Tourism has essentially collapsed in Egypt.",
        "There was a trickle back over the spring and summer, but really, Egypt is - Egypt's tourist industry has been devastated by the events over the course of the last 18 months.",
        "And given the fact that tourism is one of the most important - it certainly is in the top three of foreign currency earners for Egypt.",
        "The fact that President Morsi, if he can establish some stability and the Egyptians can signal to the world that Egypt is opening to tourism, that would certainly help the Egyptian economy.",
        "But, of course, there are all these concerns.",
        "Will Morsi and the Brotherhood, will they ban alcohol in tourism hotels?",
        "What kind of tourism would they want to see?",
        "Egypt has become - particularly the South Sinai - has become an attractive beach destination for European tourists.",
        "Would that continue to be the case?",
        "Clearly, tourism factors extraordinarily large in Egypt's economy and will need to have a major rebound before the Egyptian economy can get going again.",
        "Leila Fadel, you've said several times the constitution and what it says is going to be critical to the future, not just for President Morsi, but to the future of Egypt.",
        "What's the timetable now?",
        "They're talking about the end of September now for a final draft of that constitution.",
        "Again, that is something that has consistently been put off, if you will, and something that - the biggest battle between the military, the Muslim Brotherhood, the seculars, the liberals is over right now.",
        "So, really, until we see that document and what it will say and whether people will accept it, we won't know what Egypt will look like.",
        "And another point that a lot of people talk about when they watch Morsi, this untested leader, take the reins of power, they talk about how this really is a test for political Islam.",
        "This was a banned group.",
        "Like you said, Morsi himself was imprisoned here.",
        "So if they fail or succeed, this may be the rise or fall of political Islam in Egypt and possibly beyond.",
        "Leila Fadel, thank you very much for your time today.",
