        "This does not mean that the people in Ohio got a fair deal, but in a weird way does it just sort of bring up the issue of what it means to have access to water?",
        "It does, because it reminds us that there is passive structural discrimination in our nation's history at the hands of government, and maybe perhaps it might be more useful for some communities to bypass government altogether and find private mechanisms and private means to meet their needs.",
        "Those resources are there, but this dependence on government isn't always helpful.",
