        "And they're shareholders in the corporation, and they deserve to know exactly what he's up to.",
        "And so what's most tragic is that there is a lack of communication between these siblings, and it sadly reminds us of the legacy when you mix money and power and family.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I'm not so sure of that, only because just looking at the history of civil rights and the civil rights struggle, you know, down through time, as related to the Kings and also to, just in general, it seems as though giving away that, that control wouldn't have resulted in some of the watering down that we all often see in, you know, talk about, you know, where the civil rights struggle has gone and how much it's achieved its goals and things like this.",
        "So I'm more in favor of keeping things close and keeping things in control, because once you give it away, you know, anything can happen.",
