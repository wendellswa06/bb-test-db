        "And nice to have you with us.",
        "And what's the forecast like in Nebraska?",
        "Well, it's actually a pretty nice day here, but we're watching some bubbling clouds to our west.",
        "And so we're positioned down here in Hemingford, Nebraska, which is a small town in western Nebraska.",
        "And what do you hope to achieve?",
        "Well, VORTEX2 is the largest, most ambitious tornado project ever.",
        "The National Science Foundation and NOAA have pulled about $12 million of funding to support over 100 scientists, 40 scientific vehicles, radars, deployable weather stations, cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, to basically surround tornadoes and tornadic storms and try to push back the mysteries of how they form.",
        "And the goal is to - if we can understand how they form better, then we can make better predictions and make better warnings, so people have longer time to get to safety.",
        "And more accurate warnings.",
        "I think right about now, probably something in the order of 70 percent of tornado warnings turn out to be false alarms.",
        "Yes.",
        "Right now, most tornado warnings don't result in tornados.",
        "Some of that's by design, because we'd rather over-warn than miss the big one.",
        "But we would certainly like to get that rate down, and even more importantly, increase that lead time.",
        "The average warning is 13 minutes.",
        "That means that half of those warnings are less than 13 minutes.",
        "And while that's much better than it was 10 or 20 years ago, we really shouldn't be satisfied with that.",
        "We want to give people half an hour or 45 minutes warning so if they're in a weak structure, maybe they can go to a community shelter and really seek shelter if there's a violent tornado coming like that Xenia tornado speaking of tornado you spoke of.",
        "And you described any number of the vehicles in that expedition that you're part of.",
        "One of the ones that is also there seems to be something along the lines of a tank.",
        "Well, I'm no loss for years."

        "Thank you.",
        "There is a tank out.",
        "He's not formally part of VORTEX2, but I have been working with him in order to collect data inside the tornado.",
        "And that's the tornado intercept vehicle.",
        "And what we try to do is have one of our Doppler on Wheels scanning over him, maybe at 50 or 100 feet in the tornado, and have him go through the tornado, measuring at about 10 feet altitude where it's just too slow for the radar to see.",
        "The whole goal of this type of experiment is to collect data on the tornadoes in as many different ways as we can - not just the wind fields, but also the temperatures and the relative humidity, not just at the surface, but also aloft, and get a three-dimensional, multi-parameter picture like we've never had before.",
        "And I wonder, have you been able, on the expedition thus far, to find any tornadoes?",
        "So far, VORTEX2 has been in a tornado drought.",
        "We're only 10 days into our experiment, and we've chased down some storms that were making hail and heavy rain, but so far, no tornados.",
        "It's been very quiet now, particularly the last several days out in the High Plains.",
        "And you're probably the only person out there rooting for bad weather.",
        "Well, we don't really root for the bad weather.",
        "We don't really have any control over it, of course.",
        "But what we hope is that if bad weather occurs, if a tornado occurs, it we'll at least be there to learn from it so that when future tornadoes occur, we can help the forecasters give better warnings.",
        "The technology involved in all of this - as Doppler radar in particular has improved and as you can look at particular sections of the storm at different altitudes and different depths within the twisters, how has that informed our picture of the structure of these incredibly violent - sometimes incredibly violent storms?",
        "Well, the technology has changed a lot.",
        "We have a fleet of these mobile radars.",
        "And I started up the Doppler on Wheels program 15 years ago.",
        "But now with VORTEX2, we have 10 of these Doppler radars and we can map the three-dimensional wind films in the tornado.",
        "But it's very complex.",
        "We have 50 Lenovo computers basically downloading data from the radar, processing the data and synthesizing the radar data with the surface mesonet stations in order to make this better-than-ever-before picture of what's inside."

        "Very well.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Good.",

        "I listen to it every day.",
        "Thank you for that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "My comment was basically on the real lax viewpoint of tornadoes.",
        "You know, I live right in the middle where the May 3rd tornado ran through back in '99.",
        "And, you know, they blew the sirens the other night, in fact, this past Monday night - last Monday, I'm sorry.",
        "And, you know, not a lot of people responded.",
        "And there was definite rotation in the area and, you know, just to me, you know, if there was more cause for concern for other, you know, for the tornadoes themselves, I think that it could really, you know, help save lives and, you know, have, you know, lesser issues with, you know, death and issues like that.",
        "Josh Wurman, is complacency one of the things you have to constantly struggle against?",
        "Well, if we could make the tornado warnings better with more lead time and with less - lower false alarm rate then we think that complacency would go down because people would know that when a warning is made that there's really a tornado coming their way.",
        "I was down there for that tornado that went through Oklahoma City back in 1999, and one of my radars measured a wind of 301 miles per hour.",
        "And it was devastating.",
        "It just wiped houses down to their foundations.",
        "And even the normal type of shelter that people would have sought, maybe inside a bathroom, would not have been enough in the core of that tornado."

        "But in Nebraska, you know, it's flat so you see the sky all around you.",
        "And you'd see those black wall clouds.",
        "And then as a kid, mother always taught us, you see that cloud, you go in, you go to the basement.",
        "And we would have bags of water and bags of food and pillows and stuff in the center room in our basement.",
        "But we, in our neighborhood, never had tornado devastation.",
        "It seemed like the tornadoes always hit the same places over and over and over again, the same neighborhoods, the same places, and didn't hit the ones, you know, the ones that it didn't hit.",
        "But I wanted to share a kind of a funny memory because truly, growing up there you saw the devastation that it did, the actual, you know, leaf being stuck in a telephone pole.",
        "You could see that horrible devastation.",
        "But if it didn't hit you, you kind of, you know, you kind of just brushed it off.",
        "And in school, in junior high, when we would get a tornado alert or warning, everybody had to go out of their classrooms, sit on the floor in the main hall and put your head between your knees and put your books over your head."

        "Josh Wurman, is she right?",
        "Do tornadoes tend to follow the same paths and hit the same targets again and again?",
        "Well, there's no evidence that any areas are either more likely to be hit or that are really sheltered or safe.",
        "Just like with anything that's random, like flipping a coin, you can always get strings of unusual occurrences.",
        "But we've really never seen - when we looked over 100 or 200 years of tornado history, we don't see any areas that are protected like that.",

        "People are very frightened when there are tornado warnings.",
        "Afterwards, people are really shell-shocked by the tornadoes.",

        "And it's, you know, it's very moving and it's, you know, a very emotional moment for us because we're trying to learn from these storms in a scientific way, but they really have a very real and terrible human impact sometimes.",
        "And I know that obviously there's a long history of tornadoes, they can strike anywhere.",
        "Obviously, they strike most often in the places where - like where you are, in Nebraska.",

        "Hilly areas, it's almost impossible to try to track the storms in the way that VORTEX2 is doing.",
        "And also just areas that are wooded are very hard.",
        "The radars can't see through them.",
        "Out in the high plains here like Nebraska, there's a very good road network that's just logistically very good for us.",
        "But we also need the conditions for violent thunderstorms to form, and those conditions are dictated by geography.",
        "And the high plains, where you have a source of warm, soupy air from the Gulf of Mexico combined with in the springtime a jet stream still coming overhead means that really in the core tornado alley, from Texas up through Nebraska, is where we see the most tornadoes, the most violent tornadoes.",
        "But, of course, violent tornadoes can occur out of the center of tornado alley.",
        "And they -violent tornadoes have occurred in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, Indiana, a lot of areas in the upper Midwest also.",
