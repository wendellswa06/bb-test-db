        "And let's see if we can get Brian(ph) on the line.",
        "And Brian is calling us from Lewes in Delaware.",
        "Hey.",
        "How are you doing?",
        "Very well.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Good.",
        "I was up in Newcastle, Delaware at the time.",
        "I was living there about four and a half years ago, about, say, four and half, five.",
        "And a tornado touch downed actually at the airport, damaged some C-5 transports that were there.",
        "And then it reformed in the parking lot of the warehouse of the company I was working for.",
        "It went by my window.",
        "It had flipped at least 25,000-foot street truck beneath my window, threw a dock plate across the parking lot.",
        "And it moved a semi fully loaded across - it couldn't flip it but it slid it.",
        "And it just made a left and it destroyed a self-storage unit that was across an industrial park.",
        "And it -you know, sort of you could see afterwards how random it was and the just sort of haphazard turns that it made through the…",
        "And I wonder, as you think about those haphazard turns, Josh Wurman, that makes it very difficult to track these storms, which is exactly what you're trying to do.",
        "Well, we're trying to forecast those paths, those turns.",
        "We're trying to forecast when they get weaker and stronger.",
        "Some of those things are very difficult to predict.",
        "Out here in VORTEX2, we have this super sophisticated equipment, these mobile Doppler radars that can cut through that tornado every five or 10 seconds and see exactly where it is and how it's turning.",
        "And that's how we position all our vehicles in just the right place to get them in front of the tornado.",
        "Or some of the vehicles of course don't want to be in the tornado, they want to be just outside because we're trying to be very ambitious targeting close to but not dangerously close to these tornadic storms.",
        "Here's an email from Wilhelm(ph).",
        "Seconds before a tornado hit Kalamazoo, Michigan, killing five people in the downtown district, I raced to the basement.",
        "The carnage was staggering.",
        "Also, I exited to the Kansas Turnpike and took refuge in a buried cement vault and listened to the hail hammer the metal door while fighting claustrophobia and the urge to climb the ladder, open the door and race out into the storm.",
        "And maybe he was bad on claustrophobia, but he's not the only person to find these both terrifying and very attractive, something you want to go see.",
        "Is that a problem?",
        "Well, there are a lot of people who storm chase, and they want to go see the storms.",
        "And they collect video and they just watch them.",
        "And I don't think that's problem.",
        "I think that's great.",
        "I go out to see the mountains in my hometown of Boulder, Colorado.",
        "It doesn't mean I'm a geologist.",
        "I'm just out there appreciating nature.",
        "And tornadoes, even though they can cause great devastation, they're also some of the most striking and many times beautiful atmospheric phenomenon."

        "Yeah.",
        "Hi.",
        "My question is, how is the research that you're trying to do differ from many research that's been done in the past?",
        "I'm assuming that tornado chasing has been - you guys have been doing this for about 20 years or so, I'm just guessing.",
        "How is your research going to be different from anything else that's been done before?",

        "(as Howling Mad Murdock) Well, we should did it, sir.",
        "Well, there's a lot of tornado chasing that goes on.",
        "Probably hundreds or thousands of people do that and they're not really collecting research data.",
        "It's primarily video or some measurements mainly for the wrong interest.",
        "What VORTEX2 is doing is surrounding these storms, collecting very focused data or mapping out the three-dimensional wind field.",
        "Underneath those maps of the wind, we're measuring the temperature or relative humidity.",
        "What kind of precipitation is falling?",
        "Is it rain?",
        "Is it hail?",
        "We're trying to understand the specifics of why one thunderstorm makes a tornado but another one doesn't, why one thunderstorm makes a weak tornado and another one makes a violent, long track, really deadly tornado.",
        "The differences are really subtle.",
        "And we have to target these with this unprecedented fleet of sophisticated instrumentation.",
        "All these mobile radars, these deployable weather stations, these vehicles that carry weather stations on top.",
        "And then, it's a very complicated process.",
        "We have basically 50 or so scientists after the fact - scientists, graduate students, postdoctoral researches who are going to be trying to synthesize the temperature fields with the wind fields and really trying to get those nuggets out of that data that show us why that storm made a big tornado.",
        "And why, you know, why did it do it at exactly that moment?",
        "And why did it go that direction?",
        "Why does it die when it did?",
        "A lot of questions that we really have a very hard time answering now without all that data.",
