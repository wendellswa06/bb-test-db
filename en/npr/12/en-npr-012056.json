        "What's the Communist Party Congress look like and sound like?",
        "It sounds very much like the national parliament that meets every year.",
        "You have a lot of colorful delegates arriving at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.",
        "There are a lot of red flags around.",
        "And it's all very tightly choreographed because it is, as you said, political theater.",
        "All the major decisions have been made in advance.",
        "And there's not much suspense about the outcome that President Xi Jinping will get his second five-year term.",
        "And I guess the speeches are not necessarily filled with particularly stirring or surprising rhetoric.",
        "And yet there you are watching.",
        "So what are the clues that you're seeing that indicate the direction of China's Communist Party and, for that matter, of China?",
        "Well, in his speech today, which lasted for three and a half hours, Xi Jinping outlined a lot of themes that I think suggest where he wants to go.",
        "First of all, he wants the party to be pretty much in control of everything - politics, the economy, society and particularly ideology.",
        "He wants this party to be disciplined and clear about its purpose and values the way it was during the time of his father who was a contemporary of Chairman Mao.",
        "His speech was full of tough words on national security, tough words against dissent.",
        "And he outlined an assertive foreign policy and was trying to robustly defend his territorial claims in places like the South China Sea and even added that China could be a model for other developing countries.",
        "And that's something that China has been too reticent, too modest to say before, really.",
        "So it was very clear that there was just a lot of confidence and assertiveness in the speech.",
        "Just one other thing, Anthony Kuhn - when the leader of the Communist Party in China gives a speech and it lasts three and a half hours and all the delegates - party delegates are there in front of him, do they all have to act extremely interested and virtually enraptured by the speech the entire time, or can they nod off?",
        "They nod off because they know the the Chinese media's cameras are not focusing on them.",
        "But the truth is that the party has been building up Xi Jinping over the past few months.",
        "Officials have been studying his speeches.",
        "The party has put on all these exhibitions trumpeting Xi Jinping achievements over the past five years.",
        "So the way it looks to the public is that people are celebrating his achievements.",
        "And it's all sort of the rationale to say why he should accumulate even more power in the next second five-year term.",
        "OK, that's NPR's Anthony Kuhn in Beijing, the scene of the latest Communist Party Congress.",
        "Anthony, always a pleasure talking with you - thanks very much.",
        "You bet, Steve.",

        "People rarely get it but when they do they often die.",
        "So far, six people haven't been contagious, but public health experts fear the virus might naturally evolve and start spreading like regular flu.",
        "Fouchier wanted to see if that was a real possibility.",
        "His experiment showed that certain genetic changes did make the virus spread through coughs and sneezes, at least in ferrets and ferrets are the laboratory stand-in for people.",
        "But Fouchier says it did not seem to spread very easily.",
        "And so, to then extrapolate that this virus would spread like wildfire in humans is really, really far-fetched at this stage.",
        "He said the virus could be lethal if high doses were put directly into the animals' respiratory tract.",
        "But ferrets who got the virus from the coughing or sneezing of other ferrets did not die.",
        "If the ferrets received virus via aerosol route, we have never seen severe disease in the ferrets.",
        "Fouchier could not go into many details about his work.",
        "It hasn't yet been published in a science journal and publication is in limbo.",
        "That's because of the conflicting recommendations of two high profile committees.",
        "One of them advises the U.S.",
        "government on biology that could be misused.",
        "It said some parts of this work should be kept secret so the recipe will not fall into the wrong hands.",
        "But now, government officials want that committee to take another look because, two weeks ago, an expert panel convened by the World Health Organization came to a different conclusion.",
        "It called for full publication, saying this research will help public health efforts to prepare for a possible pandemic if the bird flu virus mutates in the wild."
