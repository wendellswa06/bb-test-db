        "Companies that produce less carbon than they're permitted can sell what's left of their allowance to companies that produce more than they should.",
        "There's actually a market where these allowances are traded electronically.",
        "And whats happened over the past few months, but especially in the last week, is that some criminals were able to break into one of the registries where those carbon allowances were recorded.",
        "Next, says Henry Derwent, they were able to change who owns what.",
        "Then if you make sure that it's transferred to an account that you own and you sell it very quickly, then you've essentially got something for nothing, sold it for a lot, and you get out of town with all the dollars in your bag.",
        "A cybertheft like that would not have happened 20 years ago, nor would a carbon emission allowance have had any value 20 years ago.",
        "What this theft proves, Derwent points out, is that in Europe carbon emission allowances are now seen as commodities.",
        "Like gold, like wheat, like whatever.",
        "That means that people treat it very, very seriously.",
        "But it also means that it's got value on the market.",
        "And if you find that you're not defending it, as you would something of value, if your security is lax, hey, people are going to recognize if you, you know, if you dont recognize that this is valuable, we do and we'll try and steal it from you.",
        "So from Derwent's point of view, there's a silver lining to this story: It shows that European attempts to limit carbon emissions must be working.",
        "On the other hand, if companies start worrying that their carbon allowances could get stolen, the whole system could fail.",
        "So the European Commission is anxious to put an end to this new crime.",
        "For the time being, trading in carbon allowances has been suspended.",

        "Hi, Liane.",
        "So, what is it that prompted this series?",
        "This idea really goes back to late last year when one of our reporters, Chris Arnold, was interviewing a woman who had spent years trying to clear up some complicated paperwork problems that she had had with her mortgage lender.",
        "And Chris was focusing on what this mother had gone through while trying to avoid this foreclosure, but it was actually something that her daughter said that caught my ear.",
        "Let's listen to this daughter.",
        "Her name's Sydney Keyser.",
        "She describes what the constant struggle with these lenders and lawyers looked like from her viewpoint as a high-school student.",
        "That's how it's been for years - just constant stress.",
        "You try not to talk about it and then eventually some phone call comes up, and it's just like, OK, time to cry now, time to get angry.",
        "That's just been life.",
        "That's a lot of stress for a young person to deal with.",
        "Her comments helped get the MORNING EDITION staffers thinking about how tough the last four years have been on so many of this year's graduates.",

        "What did the reporters working on the series find?",
        "Reporter Zoe Chace interviewed a 23-year-old money-savvy young woman and her baby boomer father.",
        "The father had gotten into a lot of credit card debt, and now this daughter has been turning to her laptop to track her own spending using an electronic spreadsheet.",
        "There are a lot of young people who feel really comfortable using their laptops and their smartphones, tablets to track and control their money.",
        "So, new technologies can help them get off to a better financial start?",
        "Sure.",
        "It really can be helpful to be able to log in, for example, and check a credit card website any time to see how much money you've already spent this week.",
        "But, of course, it isn't just about the technology.",
        "You first have to understand why is it important to keep track of that debt.",
        "You need to appreciate just how punishing all those fees and the interest payments can be."

        "Still one that paints him as inevitable and the only guy who'll be able to attract votes in the general election enough to beat President Obama, but probably a much more aggressive, much more confrontational Mitt Romney.",
