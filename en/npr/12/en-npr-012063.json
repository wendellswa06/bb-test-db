        "My assistant is drawing blood from the femoral vein for toxicology.",
        "Zumwalt says where you die makes a difference, especially when your death is unexpected or suspect.",
        "It's certainly incredible to think that just the space of a few yards may mean the difference between competent death investigation and incompetent death investigation.",
        "But there may be areas where on side of the border, you have a statewide medical examiner and competent death investigation, the other side of the border may be a small county coroner with few resources and little training."
