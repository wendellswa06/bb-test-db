        "The research on vouchers is really hotly debated.",
        "There's one 2007 overview of voucher research that found some positive results for African-American students.",
        "But there are also a lot of important caveats in that research.",
        "A more recent review from 2011 found voucher students doing roughly the same as public school kids, really no better.",
        "And some of the newest research frankly - we heard a little bit of it in Eric's piece there - out of Louisiana and Ohio both found some negative academic effects for voucher students.",
        "So what might be some of the obstacles to a national school voucher program?",
        "There are actually several big ones, Audie.",
        "First in 2002, the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court ruled that vouchers are constitutional, but a majority of states still have what are called Blaine Amendments which prohibit them from using state money to fund religious schools.",
        "There are a few other obstacles.",
        "The price tag on Donald Trump's plan is roughly $20 billion.",
        "It is not clear where that money would come from.",
        "Also, it seems like to get this done, they would have to crack open the very big federal education law that Congress passed last year and took a long time to come to agreement on.",
        "And I'm not sure that Congress is in the mood to do that.",
        "But maybe most important of all really is that vouchers are not universally popular even among conservative voters.",
        "They may make a certain amount of sense in a large school district or a city where there are enough students to support multiple choices.",
        "But if you think about it, in a lot of small towns - we've seen this on the Ed desk.",
        "In much of rural America, schools are closing or consolidating.",
        "There just aren't enough students to support choice.",
        "And for parents who live in these places, vouchers just seem like an abstract concept.",
        "Does the government that Netanyahu leads today, given who it's his coalition partners are, is it capable, in your view, of reaching an agreement with the Palestinians, either in proximity talks or farther down the road in real talks?",
        "Well, not easily.",
        "But I think it's important to look at the composition of the coalition.",
        "The Sephardi religious party SHAS, whose minister was responsible for this particular, egregious zoning decision last week, had not committed to holding onto the West Bank.",
        "They're much more politicians trying to meet the needs of their constituency's religious Jews who, in particular, have housing needs.",
        "They have large families.",
        "And so if they build in West Jerusalem rather than East Jerusalem, it's not that important.",
        "Then there's Yvette Lieberman, who heads up this Russian immigrant party.",
        "He's the foreign minister.",
        "But he's actually a radical territorial compromiser, because he wants to separate Israel from the Arabs.",
        "And so he's ready to give up a lot of the West Bank, and he's also ready to give up the Arab suburbs of East Jerusalem.",
        "Bibi's big problem is within his own party.",
        "The Benny Begins and the Boogie Yahaloms don't believe in giving up the West Bank.",
        "And there are people to the right of them within his own party.",
        "That's the challenge that Bibi has.",
        "But the reality is, they have nowhere else to go.",
        "If he decides to be a statesman, he has a safety net of the center and the left that will support him.",
        "And he has these other parties that will go along.",
        "So I think he's in a much stronger position than anybody like Yitzhak Rabin or Ehud Barak, who come from the left, had when they tried to make territorial concessions in order to achieve peace.",
        "Mark Indyk, you talk about other contemporaries of Netanyahu's within his own Likud party, who remain profoundly, ideologically connected to the West Bank and really believe that Israel should retain it.",
        "What's your sense of him?",
        "Do you think that he still has that core Likud revisionist, Zionist view of the world?",
        "Or has he undergone any profound transformation on that score?"

        "My sense of Bibi, from working closely with him some time ago, was that he was much more a Republican - that is, a genuine conservative - than he was a Likudnic.",
        "He's a fairly pragmatic politician.",
        "And so if you ask me what's at his core, it's a conservatism.",
        "It's a kind of Thatcher-ite, Reaganism.",
        "But I don't see that it's a commitment to a Judean Sumeria.",
        "But when he goes home at night, it's a different story.",
        "And there, his father and even his wife and his wife's brother - who's got some headlines today criticizing the United States - the hevra, the people he lives with, are hard-line, Zionist, right-wing ideologues who don't believe in making concessions to the Arabs, and don't believe in giving up territory.",
        "Well, he's now at something of a crossroads.",
        "I suppose he could decide that he could tough it out with President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton and enjoy enough support, either from the American Jewish community or other American supporters of Israel, that they wouldn't have to give in much.",
        "Do you think he's up for that fight and for that pugnacious relationship with Washington, or does he have to get this behind him?",
        "I'm not sure.",
        "I tend to think that he will try to get it behind him because the politician in Bibi knows that the Israeli people will not reward him, the next time he may have to go to elections, for mishandling the relationship with the United States.",
        "Especially not now, in circumstances where Israel needs the United States to deal with its existential threat from Iran.",

        "Now, time for your comments about yesterday's program, and holy hot dog, did we receive lots of letters about redesigning the humble frankfurter.",
        "Some pediatricians believe that changing the shape or the size or the texture of the hot dog will keep children from choking on hot dogs.",
        "So, I spoke yesterday with Eric Hummel of Hummel Brothers Meat Products.",
        "And he said, when his kids were little, he always cut up their hot dogs.",
        "He also said this.",
        "The recommendation that we always give families with young children is to make sure that the hot dog itself is a skinless hot dog and you try to buy the skinniest ones that we make.",
        "Well, Maurice Wilson(ph) of Charlotte, North Carolina, writes: That is bad advice.",
        "The danger of the hot dog lies in the fact that when cut up, it is a round disc and therefore it fits perfectly into the esophagus of a child.",
        "Wilson goes on to say: A better solution would be to cut the hot dog lengthwise, and then cut it to make a semi-circular or triangular shape."
