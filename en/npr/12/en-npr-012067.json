        "TFA, Teach for America, has descended upon New Orleans, with hundreds of teachers coming from high-profile schools throughout the country.",
        "Andre Perr, of the University of New Orleans, leads a group that helps run six charter schools in the city.",
        "He's concerned that teachers from TFA and other programs may not stick around as long as homegrown teachers.",
        "Regardless of the test scores, he says, that hurts kids.",
        "Because also, what is needed in teaching is some longevity in the profession.",
        "In fact, the same effectiveness study showed that TFA-ers are much less likely to stay around than other teachers.",
        "Few lasted more than three years.",
        "Andre Perry doesn't question the commitment of the new arrivals, but he says consistency is important.",
        "And it's not romantic to say that people want to develop and grow in the areas that they lived in or grew up in.",
        "To lose that local flavor, it hurts the profession of teaching in terms of its local value.",
        "Sara Usdin, of New Schools for New Orleans, says retention is important, but not as important as student performance.",
        "The thing that's most important is student learning, whether a teacher was prepared and stays for 20 years - if a teacher is prepared and stays for 20 years and doesn't get student results, that's a travesty.",
        "The experience of New Orleans over the long term could answer an important question: Should teacher training programs be more selective?",
        "Should low-performing urban districts cast their nets nationwide to find the most dedicated teachers?",
        "Or should they focus on better training of teachers who are already in place?",

        "Why did Ecuador take this step, granting asylum to Assange?",
        "Well, the argument of Assange and his lawyers and supporters, broadly speaking, all along has been if he's extradited to Sweden, then he'd then be at risk of being dispatched from there to the United States under an extradition order of some kind, and that his work has always been to expose human rights abuses, corruption, you know, and malpractice by governments, and that the charges against him are politically motivated, and that he would therefore be at the risk of persecution.",
        "And rather than get a fair trial and due process, he could wind up in front of a military tribunal.",

        "The British have made that very clear.",
        "They said they will not give him rights of passage, and that if he steps outside of the embassy, he would be arrested.",
        "So they're arguing that, you know, giving him asylum really makes no difference.",
