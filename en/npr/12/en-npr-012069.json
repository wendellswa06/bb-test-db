        "We now have 2.38 million people in prison, and we're not solving the true challenges that we have in terms of harmful crimes that threaten our communities.",
        "We have five percent of the world's population.",
        "We have 25 percent of the world's known prison population.",
        "So, something is wrong.",
        "It's certainly no secret that in the last 20, 25 years, longer incarceration rates and more prisons has been politically popular.",
        "In fact, no one could go wrong being tough on crime.",
        "What do you say to people who still feel strongly that that is the way to go?",
        "I think there is a genuine concern in the country about the implications of violent crime and organized criminal behavior, and I think that has fed the political process in terms of the tendency toward higher level of incarceration.",
        "At the same time, they haven't really been addressing the problem, and we have to have the courage to step forward and say that.",
        "We have exponentially increased the number of people in prison since 1980, but a tremendous percentage of that increase has been for nonviolent crime, crimes related to drugs and, quite frankly, mental illness, and they are not getting treated for their problems.",
        "So, we've seen this huge increase, a quadrupling, of the people in prison.",
        "At the same time, our communities really aren't any safer as a result of the increase in gang activity and transnational gang activity.",
        "Let me talk about our own drug laws and the restructuring.",
        "You have a section in your bill that talks about restructuring the approach to the criminalization of illegal drugs.",
        "Could you tell me a few specifics?",
        "Well, first of all, I think mandatory sentences in terms of drug possession is absurd.",
        "The notion that nonviolent possession should have someone end up in prison is probably not a smart thing to do, and I would rather put this in front of a commission and see the alternatives that they would want to bring back.",
        "There's a lot of different ways that we could be dealing with the drugs issue.",
        "And there are a lot of different kinds of drugs, as you know.",
        "Historically, punishment and rehabilitation have kind of swung back and forth in this country.",
        "In the 1960s, some concentration on rehabilitation.",
        "By 1980, an idea that certain people were never going to be rehabilitated.",
        "Do you believe that?"

        "I remember when I was in law school, the big debates were do you punish a crime?",

        "How does society fit into this?",

        "For a lot of things people go to jail for now, they'd put them in a stockades for a day, and the community would walk by and throw tomatoes at them.",
        "And you know, the idea was bringing some sort of accountability for your acts.",
        "That was supposed to be the major focus.",
        "So, the real - to me, the issues that need to be examined are how do we deter crime?",
        "And I think you deter crime by people having a fairly good assurance they're going to get caught rather than the length of a sentence.",
        "So, what deters a crime?",
        "How do you then say that you have paid your debt to society and move on?",
        "And this is where we really need - we've got a huge problem with 2.38 million people in prison at any time - a huge problem in terms of being fair to people who have paid their debt and allowing them the chance to re-enter meaningfully in society.",
        "And there is always going to be a small group of people who choose the other way, who want a life of crime, who are going to be incorrigible, and those people need to be separated out.",
        "But I think we have leaned way, way toward a process that does not allow proper re-entry, and we can do better on that.",
        "So, do you think there will be a fight over your bill?",
        "Do you expect a lot of opposition?",

        "It's not a matter of serving someone that they may disagree with their views.",
        "It's a matter of these individuals, these small business owners, these organizations being forced to be participants in a ceremony that violates their belief.",

        "And so this Mississippi law would also ensure that government employees can't be fired for their expression of their personal believes on their own free time, as was the case with Fire Chief Cochran.",
        "If I could ask you kind of a big picture political question because for the last several election cycles, gay rights has been part of the debate, and it's not in the same way this year in the 2016 presidential election.",
        "And mainly that's because the Supreme Court has ruled that same-sex marriage is legal.",
        "How does that affect you and the work you're doing?",
        "I mean, do you, as a conservative, as someone who is supporting this kind of legislation to protect religious freedoms, do you wish that candidates were talking about these social issues more?",
        "I think what they're talking about reflects what's going on in our country right now and that a lot of people are recognizing that in terms of the gay rights movement, they've accomplished a lot of what they sought to do with the Obergefell decision and whatnot.",
        "I think what this legislation and why we're seeing a lot of it right now is we are seeing the fallout and the repercussions of those gay rights decisions.",
        "And I think we have seen some of the candidates touch on some of these issues of religious liberty and the balance that we're trying to strike and make sure that an important group of people that just want to live out their faith are not being trampled on by government entities and by groups that want to compel them to do something that violates their faith.",
