        "So the bigger that balance on the government's credit card, the more the government has to pay in interest costs.",
        "And that means it's got less money available to spend on everything else we want the government to do.",
        "What's more, if the government's borrowing a whole lot of money, that potentially means there's less money available for individuals and businesses that want to borrow.",
