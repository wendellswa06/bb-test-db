        "Unfortunately, Farai, she talked to me about this on the day she was leaving because she was so burnt out from having a hundred cases and not being able to visit her clients in the jail regularly.",
        "She's someone who was really straining to make a difference in the lives of her clients, but felt badly because she couldn't visit them and talk to them enough about their cases, so on the one hand, she was someone who was making a difference for a while, but she was burnt out, so she was leaving.",
        "She's now back at the courthouse, though, working as a supervisor and doing, from what I hear, great work once again.",

        "It's plea bargains hashed out, and when cases do go to trial, it's often before empty galleries because no one really cares.",
        "A lot of times, for the victim or the defendant, it's a real sad place, it's a tragic place, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't pay attention to it.",
        "In Cook County, we have a jail behind the courthouse with 11,000 people in it, and in big cities throughout the nation, we have those kinds of stockyards.",
        "We really need to be concerned about how these people are treated and what we can do to make sure that our courts aren't a revolving door.",

        "Harding, who talked about not nostrums but normalcy, not experiment but equipoise, and he went on for about 10 more alliterations.",
        "So, you didn't think there were too many Ns in that?",
