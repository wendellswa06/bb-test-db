        "He says he wants to green up the energy economy.",
        "Some people who hope to help him came to the Green Inaugural Ball last night in Washington, D.C., the environmental elite who partied side by side with corporate bigwigs.",
        "Expectations are high, despite a recession that could interfere with a green makeover.",
        "And NPR's Christopher Joyce was at the celebration.",
        "The first Green Inaugural Ball - no, actually it's one of at least three in Washington this week - is warming up at the National Portrait Gallery.",
        "Several hundred environmental movers and shakers are here to celebrate the ascension of an eco-friendly Barack Obama to the presidency.",
        "People are munching organic hors d'oeuvres and leaving as small a carbon footprint as the organizers could manage.",
        "We're going to go talk to some of them right now.",

        "Most of us, our day jobs are spending our time working on the environment.",
        "So, of course, we spent a great deal of effort to make sure that what we're doing here has the least footprint, the least impact as possible.",
        "Everything from what kind of food we ordered, to make sure that we had as many vegetarian and vegan options, because of all the energy and water inputs that go into that; to how people could get here, to make sure that it was on Metro, very accessible, and that we supported people being able to get here in that way; to the flowers that we're using being reused by people afterward.",
        "Sure, there was carbon in evidence.",
        "Big limos, for example, were two deep at the entrance.",

        "I mean we're in a recession.",
        "There's no doubt about it.",
        "And the solar industry is getting as hard, if not harder than most of the other industries in this country.",
        "So what we need in place is an economic recovery bill.",
        "And so as we step back and look at the bailout that they did for Wall Street - $800 billion - one would think there's an opportunity here to put 10 or 20 or 30 billion dollars in the energy industry to help ensure that we create these jobs, starting this next month.",
        "It is an extraordinary statement of intent from the people of Scotland.",
        "The Scottish lion has roared this morning across the country.",
        "Well, when you talk about Bush and the response to the hurricane--perception is everything in politics, obviously.",
        "And if you compare what happened to his father and the response to Hurricane Andrew when it hit Florida in 1992, what you find is that the perception in his father's response was that it wasn't effective enough.",
        "He was at the site quite quickly after the hurricane hit, but it took days for hurricane relief to reach people.",
        "And the area was sealed off and people felt trapped inside an incredibly dilapidated and destroyed area with no aid that could reach them.",
        "And that damaged the father's credibility.",
        "Now Bush faces the same challenge.",
        "He's got to look like he's in the center of the efforts to help people and the efforts have to be effective.",
        "And so far, I agree with Mary, the response has been anemic.",
        "We haven't seen a concerted concerned effort until yesterday, even though we knew the storm was coming for days.",
        "He's going to have to do a lot better or this is really going to hurt his public image, I think.",

        "And it had tsunami impact, but did the federal government have a `What if?",
        "Did it have a doomsday plan?",

        "Yes, I wanted to reinforce that it's not just New Orleans.",
        "As tragic as that is, and I love that place--but up and down that coast, all those poor people who live there and who have no resources and couldn't get out, and now with everything devastated, their lives--it's not just the--it's their jobs or lack thereof.",
