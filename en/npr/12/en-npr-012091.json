        "Where's the capacity?",
        "You know, FEMA says some 30,000 people are going to need shelter.",
        "Now, that's the size of a small city.",
        "And because the search and rescue is still very active and underway, that number could grow.",

        "Can you talk about that?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, words matter, right?",
        "And those three words have all been used at various times to describe what happened here in 1967.",
        "I think they're all incomplete in isolation.",
        "In other words, if you just call it a riot, you're not right about many of the things that went on that week.",
        "If you just call it a rebellion, you are wrong about many of the things that went on that week.",
        "If you'd call it an uprising, I think that is for me the word that captures more of what happened than anything else.",
        "Even those who were out smashing windows, stealing goods were rising up against economic conditions in the city.",
        "They were rising up against what they saw as systematic oppression across the city.",
        "And certainly, the people who were involved in the incident that started all of the things that happened that week were rising up against police brutality.",
        "And so I think for me at least, that's the word that I'm most comfortable using to describe everything that happened.",
        "So we're coming in, as we said, you know, for a week, but you've been talking about the riots or the uprisings on your program a lot longer.",
        "Are people in Detroit interested in looking back on this moment?",
        "And what are they interested in?",
        "You know, it really depends on who you talk to.",
        "There are a lot of people for whom this is a pretty dramatic marking point between their relationship with the city of Detroit, a good relationship with the city of Detroit and a bad one.",
        "There are many families who will point back to 1967 and what happened there and talk about how that was the thing that made their parents decide, hey, we've got to go.",
