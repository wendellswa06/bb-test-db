        "Some people say - in fact, I've often said - that there's only one opinion poll that counts, and that's the one on Election Day.",
        "And I'm not sure that's ever been truer than it is today and tonight.",
        "This is clearly a very strong night for the Conservative Party.",
        "Very strong, indeed.",
        "Not only did the Conservatives do better than any other party last night, they did better than their own performance five years ago when they took power.",
        "They don't even have to join with a smaller party to create a coalition government this time around.",
        "Conservatives won enough seats to govern on their own, which is a change from the last term and a real boost for them.",
        "OK, so a big victory for Conservatives.",
        "Certainly that's going to have an impact in Britain.",
        "I mean, will the rest of the world feel an impact here, Americans and others?",
        "Actually the global impact could be huge.",
        "One big question now is whether the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.",
        "Cameron has promised to give British voters a referendum by 2017 on whether to stay in the EU or get out.",
        "If he keeps that campaign promise, then the debate leading up to the vote and the referendum itself could have big, international consequences for business, for politics, for regulations.",
        "And to some extent this was also a vote of confidence for Cameron's austerity approach to boosting the British economy - really different from the approach Obama has taken in the U.S.",
        "The Conservative Party wants to eliminate the budget deficit without raising taxes.",
        "That means possibly deep cuts to social service programs to balance the books.",
        "And this vote suggests that British voters enthusiastically support that.",
        "Well, so how big a setback is this for the left in British politics, the Labour Party?",
        "They're looking at years in the wilderness.",
        "The BBC called it a gruesome night for Labour.",
        "Up until yesterday, party leader Ed Miliband had hopes of being prime minister, and today, he resigned.",
        "Here's part of his remarks.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "While we may have lost the election, the argument of our campaign will not go away.",
        "The issue of our unequal country will not go away.",
        "This is the challenge of our time.",
        "The fight goes on."

        "OK, so that's Labour leader Ed Miliband resigning.",
        "Talking about the fight going on, though, let me ask you about another fight, Ari Shapiro - people fighting for Scotland because they seem to get a pretty big boost in this election as well, right?",
        "Yeah, one of the big headlines from this election is the incredible comeback of the Scottish National Party.",
        "You remember they were the party that supported the referendum to break away from the United Kingdom.",
        "And last year, they were losers.",
        "They suffered a huge defeat.",
        "Today, they have virtually swept across Scotland, winning 56 out of 59 seats there.",
        "So, you know, anyone listening who is trying to bounce back from a personal or professional defeat, take heart from the Scottish Nationalists.",
        "They were total losers last year, and today, they have never been on such a high.",

        "NPR national correspondent Linda Wertheimer visited the normally Republican suburbs of Omaha, Nebraska, and talked to two groups of voters.",
        "We met first with a group of professional people, mostly in their 30s, all taking a seminar run by Leadership Omaha, the chamber of commerce project aimed at developing community leaders.",
        "These are generally independent voters, though all have voted for Republicans at least once.",
        "They say the Republican Party is on the wrong track, talking now about abortion and gay marriage.",
        "There's a large group of people in this country that believe in smaller government, that believe in balanced budget.",
        "I think that's a pretty popular concept.",
        "Where they run into trouble is strict adherence to a couple of social issues.",
        "There's maybe more pressing issues that really need to be addressed and dealt with - the war, the shrinking maybe of the middle class, and the growing of the lower and the upper - the divide we're seeing economically within our society.",
        "These are - I see as more important issues."

        "I'm really scared it'll be a Democrat because so many people are angry at Republicans just because of the war and because of the economy - the housing market, gas prices, everything - everything that goes on in the courts, Scooter Libby, on and on and on.",
        "I don't - I think a lot of even Republicans, even a lot of hardcore Republicans have turned against them just because it's like there's so many things messed up."
