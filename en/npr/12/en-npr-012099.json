        "One possibility is that something just passed between us, you know, that there was a cloud of dust or something in the galaxy and it got between us and the quasar, and so we can't see it anymore.",
        "Runnoe said astronomers have seen dust clouds pass in front of bright objects before, but the object's spectrum usually gives a clue when that happens - and in this case, nothing.",
        "Besides, another telescope caught a brief glimpse of the quasar in 2009, and it was still shining brightly.",
        "No - what Runnoe and her colleagues think happened is the quasar just ran out of gas, literally.",
        "All the nearby gas fell into the black hole, and there was not enough left to produce the brilliance quasars are known for.",
        "And as crazy as it sounds, the end came quickly from shining brightly to virtually nothing in a celestial blink of an eye, maybe just a couple of years.",
        "This thing is tens of millions of times the mass of the sun.",
        "And so for it to do anything on timescales that we can experience is kind of nuts (laughter).",

        "So there are probably more quasars winking off out there.",

        "BP wanted the Supreme Court to stop those payments while it asks the court whether businesses should have to prove direct harm from the disaster.",
        "The company argues that the terms of the settlement are being misinterpreted, allowing businesses to file claims for damages unrelated to the spill, costing BP hundreds of millions of dollars.",
