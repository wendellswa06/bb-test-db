        "So let's proceed.",
        "The Yemeni government has claimed victories against al-Qaida in the past.",
        "Is there any indication that this particular one will stick?",
        "Well, that's what we're about to go find out.",
        "We're going to go ask people in the town if this will stick.",
        "I mean, al-Qaida did, you know, spraypaint signs saying, look, we've left, we're sorry, we had (technical difficulties).",
        "You know, but we were talking to some folks yesterday from the region and they said look, it's easy to, you know, force militants to retreat with your big guns, and your tanks.",
        "It's another thing to administer a region.",
        "And this is what the Yemeni government hasn't been able to do so far, and al-Qaida was able to do in these towns and villages - provide electricity, provide a sense of security."
