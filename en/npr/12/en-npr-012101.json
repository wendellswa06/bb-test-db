        "How much extra income do these neighborhoods have, and what are they being spent on right now?",
        "It varies from city to city.",

        "Well, in many cases, one of things we pride ourselves on is our ability to measure the informal economic income.",
        "It's not the illicit income, maybe that second job they have, the tips they may earn as a waitress, or the money they earn in babysitting.",
        "So, in places like Los Angeles, where we just finished our most recent drilldown, we found that 10 percent of the income was in the informal economy.",
        "That's what the difference is between living a marginal existence or having discretionary money to spend, which often is the case.",
        "So, what kinds of businesses could really have an opportunity in these kinds of neighborhoods?",

        "If you look at some of the emerging research on the correlation between obesity and diabetes versus the lack of access to full service grocery, or research on the essence of crime, and the saturation of pawnshops or payday lenders, so these are bank branches, grocery stores, these are the types of businesses that can thrive in the inner city, once they have the information to know how to get there.",
        "It seems like a lot of people, instead of spending money at these businesses because there's not, let's say, a grocery store in the neighborhood, they spend the money on bus fare to get to where they need to go.",
        "As gas prices get higher, do you think more businesses will actually open up in some of these neighborhoods?",
        "I think that's absolutely the case.",
        "I mean, the two things that we are very confident on, where we founded our principles off from, is that the lack of information creates investment adversity.",

        "Isn't that a concern for a business owner?",
        "Well, crime rates have been coming down.",
        "But the perception of crime tends to outpace the actual numbers.",
        "And, so, you may hear about a sensationalized murder, or some sort of trend that may be occurring, but when you look at the actual numbers and where they're occurring, it doesn't tend to be in the places where you might put a grocery store.",
        "So, what we try to do with our information is to counter misperceptions of neighborhoods.",
        "East Oakland, for example, the perception of crime is so high, but it's really - the crime rate is lower than the city of Oakland as a whole, and so are most parts of San Francisco."
