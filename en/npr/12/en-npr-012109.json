        "Evans grew up moving from city to city with her mother.",
        "She writes about some of those places - New York, Tallahassee, Northern Virginia - and about navigating those worlds from the perspectives of mixed race and African-American teenagers.",
        "The stories have a fly-on-the-wall quality, as if you're listening in on private conversations about race and gender and class.",
        "But when she stopped by our studios recently, Evans told me she doesn't want her characters to be defined by only those things.",
        "Part of what I'm interested in is that we're in this weird moment, racially, where we're certainly not post anything, but that there are opportunities in the present that people could not have been prepared for by the past.",
        "Opportunities to talk about race in a straightforward way?",
        "That, but I'm thinking more on the level of the actual stories themselves - things like, the tensions that arise in interracial relationships aren't anymore that you have to kind of go to a different state because it's illegal, and hope nobody kills you most of the time.",
        "But then the fact that those aren't the pressures opens up an entire other range of possibilities, right?",
        "And so the more intricate, kind of messier personal stuff that people cannot have been prepared for by the past because it wasn't as plausible in the past.",
        "Things like people being asked to go back and forth between two or three worlds in a way that, you know, those worlds would not have been open to them at all previously.",
        "And so I think a lot of what it comes down to is people having to go back and forth.",
        "And not just in a sense of being interracial, but also between different class settings, between different voices even.",
        "Growing up, you had to - and presumably you still; all of us - sort of shift from one world to the next world.",
        "Sometimes you were the only African-American kid in a school of white kids, for example.",
        "Often, yes.",
        "They moved me from the school that I started at to the magnet school for gifted children.",
        "And I think I was literally, the only kid in my class who didn't have blue eyes.",
        "I think I was the only black child in the gifted and talented program in all of Fairfax County that particular year.",
        "You write about a high school - fictional high school, Robert E.",
        "Lee High.",
        "Can you tell us about this story?",
        "Yeah.",
        "The framework for that story is that there is this school where there's this kind of tracking in place - which I think is true in a lot of parts of the country.",
        "For various reasons, it's true - and various parts of the South, that there were gifted programs devised partly as a matter of educational opportunity, but partly because people were terrified of their kids having to go to school with minorities.",
        "And that was a lot of the ways that they got around integration orders - was, OK, everyone will physically be in the same building, but there's no way they're going to be in the same classroom.",
        "So that's the - sort of structural backdrop for the story.",
        "But part of what I was thinking about on the level of character is, you know, how these two teenage girls kind of navigate that."

        "Both of them are African-American girls in a predominantly white school.",
        "I mean, I was thinking about two things with that story.",
        "One, I wanted to play with that narrative because we often do have this kind of simplistic good kid-bad kid narrative.",
        "And I think there's a way in which the people who get marked as the exceptions kind of need the people who are the rule to function.",
        "And so I was thinking about that dynamic and that way in which - there's a point in the story in which Crystal says, Gina had already made me possible -and therefore, the implication is: I don't need her anymore.",
        "As it becomes clear that Crystal will become the valedictorian, and she's sort of on the up and up at this school, Gina stops talking to her.",
        "Can you read a passage from the book?",
        "Sure.",

        "The likelihood Republicans will do that?",
        "That is totally different than the ripening process that happens in other species."

        "Yeah.",
        "Now that we know that there is a hormone that is linked to the primary triggering factor, then we know how do we regulate them, how do we control them.",
        "There are a couple of ways we can do that in plants or cellular processes.",
        "One is either we can block the synthesis of this hormone itself before it is even synthesized or evolved and reaches the target.",
        "The second is if you can block the receptor that perceives the reaction of this hormone, then we can block the responses, basically.",
        "So we were administering these two techniques, basically, and we were very successful in achieving the goal, what we wanted, to extend the needle life for a much longer period of time.",
        "It is two to threefold increase in the lifetime of the needles, basically, that hangs onto the needle - trees.",
        "And how did you do that?",
        "Well, these two are two different compounds.",
        "One is - the ethylene synthesis inhibitor is applied through water, basically, to the trees.",
        "We can dissolve it.",
        "It's a solute.",
        "It's a chemical which is available, which is used predominantly in several crops, and we can apply that to the water which we apply in the basins.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And then once we allow them, basically, the tree sucks up, along with the transpirational stream.",
        "When it transpires, it reaches the spots in the needles where the abscissions takes place, and then it blocks the synthesis of ethylene.",
        "That's one technique.",
        "The second one is - it's called an MCP, which is a gaseous thing, which you can generate the gas by dissolving the salt that will produce 1-MCP.",
        "So that is, again, while we generate the gas and allow the trees to be incubated, basically, surrounded by this gas.",
        "So this gas goes to the stomatal opening, or the pores that are in the needles, and then reaches the target spot and prevents the abscission layers to be found.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Is this is something that all of us can use now, or find the ingredients for..."

        "We have to finalize and fine tune the concentrations, and also we'll try to develop some prototypes that will fit as an - as a storage, basically, so we'll be able to use the trees in there, to gas them up and then send them off, basically.",

        "Hey, Tom.",
        "This is Raj again.",
        "No, we have not done it.",
        "But the only problem with the trees is that the glycerin has got a higher viscosity, and that is very difficult to reach.",
        "When you mix it with water, basically, it does affect the flow of water, as well, basically.",
        "So it all depends on the viscosity.",
        "If it is a cut flower that is only probably up to about a foot or so, well, the trees, they have to reach much taller heights, about four or five feet, sometimes six, seven feet depending on the size of the tree.",

        "Oh, absolutely Ira.",
        "It is absolutely essential to keep your tree watered.",
        "But watering alone is not sufficient.",
