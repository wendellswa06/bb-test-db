        "Just so I understand, if you say Wal-Mart cashed the checks, does that mean somebody handed the check directly to Wal-Mart to buy goods or is Wal-Mart doing some banking here?",

        "Wal-Mart, unlike some other retailers, offered to cash these checks for no fee.",

        "Although I have to ask if the place that these are being spent is a place like Wal-Mart - isn't that a company that was already weathering the economic hard times pretty well 'cause they're selling cheap stuff and people might be going there instead of Nordstrom?"
