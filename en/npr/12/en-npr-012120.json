        "There were certainly many interested parties, but we had a certain reserve price we needed to meet, and we didn't quite get there yesterday.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "What was that reserve price?",
        "Well, I can't really divulge what that reserve price is, but it was certainly more than $3.6 million.",
        "So the reserve price wasn't met, which basically means you didn't sell Samson.",
        "We didn't sell her yesterday, but we're actually in negotiations with both private parties and an institution after the sale because they still are very interested in trying to bring her to a new home.",

        "Well, I...",
        "I think it's important here that this march was quite significant, and I think the common nation of this kind of a sentiment, and the real feeling--people feel that they were duped by going to Iraq, is going to really put more pressure on Bush.",
        "I mean, all of the polls are showing that people are basically saying, `Yeah, we want to deal with Katrina, and if it means leaving Iraq, then so be it.'"

        "I mean, he--in fact, he even had a speech in the middle of the day, like Wednesday or Thursday of last week, and it was very much the same statements he's been saying before, you know: `We have to stay here because if we leave early, the terrorists will win,' and so forth.",
        "I don't think at this point--unless you start to see some kind of a sense that the Iraqis themselves are getting the insurgency under control, I don't really think that there's going to be anything that the president himself can say.",

        "You know what he could do?",
        "Just a minute, George, please, because there's one thing we haven't addressed in this, and this is the dollars.",
        "The one thing that he's got to do--he's been extremely irresponsible in essentially talking about $250 billion relief for Katrina combined with the 300-plus billion dollars we've spent in Iraq.",
        "But I think even people who support the president--I don't know any of them--but even that 30 percent, I guess, his approval rating is--want to know how he's going to pay for this stuff.",

        "But the reality is...",

        "The reality was that the deficit was already a problem, was projected before Katrina landed, and we're going to have quite a deficit already because of the policy.",

        "The Republicans are going to have to make some sound fiscal decisions, and I think that Bush is seeing erosion in his own party because, one, the unpopularity of the war and, two is, these other people are up for re-election.",
        "And ...(unintelligible) about that.",
        "Julianne, let me ask you this: Put your economist hat on for me, if you will.",
        "George talks about repealing one of the tax cuts, but if the war continues to go on and if the war goes on in the projections that we've heard over the course of a couple of years, two or three, you're going to have to do a little bit more than just repealing those tax cuts.",
        "Can this president, in fact, pay for Katrina--and a reminder that we're still very early on in the hurricane season--pay for the war without, in fact, raising taxes, in your opinion?",
        "It's fiscally irresponsible not to raise taxes.",
        "George is right about the middle-class tax cut, but repealing that for just one year is not going to be enough.",
        "What--you know, but the Republican strategy has always been to starve the beast; in other words, to spend money so that you're forced to cut the size of government programs.",
        "We saw in the states in the last couple of years, you know, higher education tuitions, double-digit increases, Medicare costs spiraling out and people being disqualified.",
