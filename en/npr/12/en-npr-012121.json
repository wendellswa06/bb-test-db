        "One of the things that we're seeing is the idea that there are some overtures being made by our government in an attempt to, some suggest, influence and reach out to moderates in Iraq, including the Sunni minority, and that is, we've seen, 1,000 detainees released from Abu Ghraib prison in honor of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which, we should note, begins next week.",
        "If, in fact, we're starting to see this, George Curry--and then pick up on your point as well--is this an indication that this administration is getting the idea that there has to be some compromise if, in fact, solutions are going to be found?",
        "Well, this is being portrayed as a humanitarian gesture to Ramadan, but let's be real.",
        "The whole purpose of this is to broaden the support for the October 15th national referendum on the constitution.",
        "This is a crass political move, and it should be seen as that.",

        "Customarily, they release not this many, certainly, but there are releases--humanitarian releases of prisoners during the month of Ramadan.",
        "So I agree with you fully, but let's be clear, this has happened...",
        "A thousand?",
        "No, I said this was a lot, and this is--but this has happened before, and quite frankly, I think it backfires because they let go 1,000, they still got 10,000 more people they're detaining and only a fraction of them ...(unintelligible)."

        "The fact is, you know, whether it's a political move or, you know, a grace move in reflection of Ramadan, I mean, I think it's--I mean, it's, in certain ways, kind of irrelevant because, I mean, I think the broader message that the administration wants to try and show here is that the Iraqi government, the interim government that's there now is exerting a greater control on what's going on, and if they send that signal by releasing some of the detainees, I don't think that's a bad signal.",
        "Because remember, look, even though we can all disagree about whether it was a bad idea or a good idea to start going to Iraq, the fact is, we have to figure out a resolution right now that is not going to create basically the seeds for another civil war.",

        "So it's not like some humanitarian gesture to let people go who shouldn't be held there in the first place.",
        "So let's keep that in perspective.",
        "Well, let me ask this: Of all of what we're seeing, questions about movement of the Bush administration as it relates to the war, the continuing concern about the Katrina response and the like, we've been talking about whether or not Democrats will now be able to use this as a collective issue as we move toward elections.",
        "We're just coming out of the Congressional Black Caucus weekend, George Curry.",
        "Talk to me about whether or not Democrats, in your opinion, with the many that you talk to--and I suspect you talked to some over this weekend--are starting to form a game plan in hopes of gaining seats here.",
        "You know, they have a game plan every time there's an election.",
        "They trot out all the color-coded maps and tell you how they're going to unseat the Republicans.",

        "You know, George, I don't know if you went to the town hall where Harry Belafonte literally excoriated Democrats.",
        "He was livid and talked about the fact that--basically he said Democrats had no spine.",
        "Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were in the room where he--you know, Harry can be very scathing, and he really was.",
        "But the fact is that, you know, you look at several things.",
        "You look at this Roberts nomination; only five on the Judiciary Committee voting against it.",
        "You look at Katrina.",
        "Louisiana and Mississippi senators have been vocal and present, but this poverty issue, as Sheila Jackson Lee said earlier, did not start with Katrina.",
        "So one might ask, where were the Democrats, where were the Congressional Black Caucus members before that?",
        "There was a post-prayer breakfast meeting where minister Louis Farrakhan spoke, and several members of the CBC were present, especially Elijah Cummings and Chairman Mel Watts, and he--you know, he is attempting to galvanize people around the Millions More Movement, but he scolded Democrats as well and African-American Democrats and said, `Look, why would you run scurrying to the White House when you won't walk with me?",
        "You know, some...",
        "Well, act...",

        "Far be it from me to offer advice to Democrats; however, I will say this: For one thing, there's a structural problem in the context of redistricting, which basically makes it very, very difficult for there to be any large number of House seats, for example, up during the midterm.",
        "So, I mean, I think that's just something that the Democrats--that's a structural problem.",

        "A lot of Republicans fear that they are vulnerable because of some of the issues we were talking about before, the fact that the deficit has completely exploded under the combination of a Republican president and a Republican Congress.",
        "And if Democrats start putting together a message saying at the very least that the public needs a check on this, they need to have somebody, you know, put some kind of balance in here to demand some fiscal responsibility, that may very well be a message that Republicans are vulnerable on.",
        "Julianne, how much do you believe that all of these factors will wake up the sleeping giant, if you will, the faction of the Democratic Party that historically has been its most powerful, and that is the far left of the party?",
        "As I mentioned last week on the show, I was with Congresswoman Maxine Waters who suggested that--and she being one of the leading voices of that end--suggested that they had been too quiet and it was time to renew a vow to get out there and make noise.",
        "Well, they've certainly been very criticized for their silence, and I think that the march this weekend, any number of other things will energize the left.",
        "The fact that Howard Dean chairs the Democratic Party, I mean, he was hopping all over the Congressional Black Caucus prayer breakfast; I think someone finally had to ask him to sit down.",

        "But it was amazing to me at--last week, one of the relief pieces of legislation passed 422 to zip, and the thing about it is, all the provisions were really beneficial to the middle and upper middle class but not working people.",
        "You know, where was a Barbara Lee or a Maxine Waters to rail against that, as we've seen them do in the past?",
        "And--and...",
