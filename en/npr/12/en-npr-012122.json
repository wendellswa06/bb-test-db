        "Well, what I love was Veronica's roommate, according to Veronica's essay, which I read and really enjoyed, her roommate actually said to the relative who had basically announced that she was coming to stay, I think the roommate just said, no, that's not going to happen.",
        "I mean, when people are so bold, you get to match their boldness by being very, very direct.",
        "And also Veronica, you know, and her roommate set a nice precedent by letting people stay there who had bothered to ask.",

        "That was the important - yeah.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So, prioritize who you're going to let in, maybe, on that basis.",
        "But Amy, if people around the other side, you know, sort of awkwardly going over to the phone and digging up somebody's phone number from some really old phonebook that they've had in their dresser drawer for, you know, seven years now, how do you go about making that suggestion that maybe you could stay over at their house?"

        "Blah, blah, blah; do you still live in D.C.? And if so, I'm thinking about trying to come to the inauguration, and do you have any ideas where I might stay?",
        "You know, I mean, just be very open about it.",
        "That's fine because it's - you know, if you are, then it's easy enough for somebody to say, you know, I don't have a place, but let me look around.",

        "What's interesting, too, is that, you know, living here in Colorado during the DNC, a lot of people made quite a bit of money by renting out their house.",
