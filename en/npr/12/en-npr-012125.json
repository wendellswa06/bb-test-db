        "Mercury, in case you need a refresher on your solar system, is the closest planet to the Sun.",
        "Before MESSENGER, the only pictures we had of Mercury were from Mariner 10 way back in the 1970s.",
        "And it seems now that those images didn't do mercury justice.",
        "These new pictures show a dynamic planet with lots of volcanic activity and some mysterious blue matter.",
        "Joining me now to talk about that - what MESSENGER found and what scientists hope they will find is my guest, Sean Solomon, he's the principal investigator for the MESSENGER Science Team.",
        "He's also director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institute of Washington.",
        "Right here in Washington D.C., where they have the best sledding hill in the city.",

        "So, what did the latest flyby reveal to us?",
        "What was the coolest bit?",
        "Well, we of course have our entire payload turned on.",
        "And in some ways duplicated the measurements that we took on our first flight by - which was in January of this year.",
        "But we flew by the opposite side of the planet, and so that enabled a variety of new measurements.",
        "We imaged 30 percent of the planet for the first time by spacecraft, so we're seeing new terrain on area bigger than the land area of South America, that had never been seen by spacecraft before.",
        "We took some of the highest resolution - we took the highest resolution color images that have ever been taken of Mercury.",

        "Generally, the Environmental Protection Agency regulates anything that could affect underground drinking water supplies.",
        "But in 2005, the industry successfully lobbied for an exemption for fracking from the Safe Drinking Water Act.",
        "That leaves regulation up to the states, which don't have the kind of resources the EPA does.",
        "But Fuller believes the states are going a good job.",

        "To be sure, hydraulic fracturing is, in part, responsible for the low natural gas prices consumers are paying now.",
        "Colorado School of Mines professor Geoffrey Thyne understands that.",
        "Still, he wants the industry to start encouraging more scientific research on fracking.",
        "Let's prove to everybody what we're saying — that's there's absolutely no danger — but let's do it in a rigorous way we can defend.",
        "Not back into it with, well, we haven't seen a proven problem yet so there's no problem.",
