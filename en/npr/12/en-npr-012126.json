        "And then you reach Canterbury itself and its narrow medieval streets echo with the chatter of European tour groups, and students and visitors that turn this small cathedral town into a buzzing European city.",
        "It's inconceivable that any of the visiting Europeans would deny being European, but the British?",
        "Kylie Hazelden, Rachel Clarke and Sarah Collins are all students in Canterbury.",
        "They're sitting having a beer in the shadow of the mighty cathedral.",

        "Are the Brits going to become a real part of Europe, or are they just going to try to cling on to the so-called special relationship with the United States while keeping their closest neighbors at arms' length?",
        "And what about the massive influx of immigrants?",
        "Surely the country and its attitudes towards itself and towards outsiders will have to change.",
        "Well, I think in 20 years' times, what will happen is that England will be England, but without its Englishness in its kind of classical sense, I think.",
        "Frank Furedi is professor of sociology at the University of Kent at Canterbury and an immigrant himself from Hungary via Canada.",
        "We find that we're in the middle of a workshop, a culture workshop where a new culture is being forged.",
        "But the one thing that we do know is that British culture and English culture is about to go through a very radical transformative process.",
        "And that kind of melting of cultures and continuous ceaseless transformation of cultural and public life that is almost the norm in the United States is beginning to happen here in Britain.",
        "(Soundbite of church bells)",
        "And so, finally, to Canterbury Cathedral and the shrine of Thomas of Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury killed in the year 1170 by four knights who had heard Becket's former friend, King Henry II, exclaim in anger, who will rid me of this turbulent priest?",
        "(Soundbite of organ music)",
        "Well, soon after he heard that the four knights had taken him at his word and actually come and murdered Thomas of Becket, King Henry rode directly here to Canterbury Cathedral and is said to have stripped naked and paraded through the cathedral to be whipped by the monks as a penance.",
        "Well, I'm not going to be doing that.",
        "But what I am going to do is finally head up, fully clothed, to the shrine of Thomas of Becket.",
        "When you get there, though, of course, there's no shrine anymore, just a candle where Becket's tomb used to be.",
        "It was all swept away, like so many certainties of Chaucer's time by The Reformation of the 16th century.",
        "Much of what Chaucer's pilgrims thought they knew about themselves and their country was changed.",
        "And in some ways it feels as though modern Britain is in the midst of a similar type of change.",
        "The old certainties have gone, but the new ones don't seem to have yet been established."

        "Canterbury Cathedral itself, like so much of Britain's history, feels somehow strangely disconnected from the modern globalized world going on outside.",

        "You know you can't live in the past, but you're not quite sure how to go forward.",
        "And as a pilgrim here today, you do end up feeling, yes, what a wonderful country this is.",
        "This country that people all around the world feel they know because it's so much a part of everyone's history.",
        "But you also can't help feeling it's a country that in the early 21st century hasn't yet discovered its own modern self.",

        "It's now two days since President Obama issued new ethics rules for administration appointees, and one day since the White House started talking about waivers to the rules.",
        "As NPR's Peter Overby reports, this raises questions about how effectively Mr. Obama can fulfill one of his longstanding campaign promises.",
        "The rules themselves are a bit complicated.",
        "Here's how the president framed them as he signed the executive order on Wednesday.",
        "(Soundbite of speech)",
        "As I often said during the campaign, we need to make the White House the people's house.",
        "And we need to close the revolving door that lets lobbyists come in to government freely, and lets them use their time in public service as a way to promote their own interests over the interests of the American people when they leave.",
        "One stark example of the problem he referred to - energy industry lobbyist Steve Griles.",
        "In 2001, President Bush named Griles the number two official at the Interior Department.",
        "Griles pushed hard to lease federal lands to oil and gas companies, and he did favors for corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who allegedly enticed him with a job offer.",
        "The Abramoff case landed Griles in prison, and generally trashed whatever reputation lobbyists had left outside of Washington.",
        "But now, Defense Secretary Robert Gates has recommended William Lynn III, recently a lobbyist for Raytheon, as deputy defense secretary.",
        "The job needs Senate confirmation.",
        "Yesterday, Gates told reporters that Lynn was impressive in person and highly recommended by people Gates respects.",
        "And I asked that an exception be made because I felt that he could play the role of a deputy - of the deputy in a better manner than anybody else that I saw."
