        "Such waivers are possible under the new rules.",
        "But it's just not clear what the standards are, or how many waivers will be allowed, as White House press secretary Robert Gibbs acknowledged at today's briefing.",
        "Do you have any estimated - I mean, limited numbers that should we expect...",
        "I don't know anything more than limited number.",
        "Now, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin wants more information from the White House before he sends Lynn's nomination to the Senate floor.",
        "And a watchdog group, a project on government oversight, has called on President Obama to withdraw the nomination or risk undermining his own executive order.",
        "Longtime lobbyist Robert Kelner says the order is meaningful, but he also says this.",
        "I don't think it goes nearly as far as people expected from President Obama's campaign rhetoric, or nearly as far as the administration is suggesting it goes.",
        "Kelner sees another loophole besides the waivers.",
        "The order says departing administration officials can't lobby the administration until President Obama leaves office.",
        "Kelner says it's the difference between lobbying, that is, registering as a federal lobbyist, and engaging in lobbying activity.",
        "The executive order just refers to lobbying.",
        "One could make very strategic calls to senior political appointees.",
        "But if it did not constitute more than 20 percent of your activity for that client, you generally do not have to register.",
        "Advocates of stronger government ethics rules praised the executive order as the toughest yet from any administration.",
        "Still, at the Campaign Legal Center, policy director Meredith McGehee says lobbying itself - the networking, the providing of information and so forth - isn't really the biggest problem.",
        "Some of the questions arise because of the role that lobbyists play in the money game, not because of the actual lobbying activity.",
        "But changing the way money is used in Washington would require an act of Congress.",
        "This executive order, Mr. Obama did with just a few strokes of his pen.",
        "Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington."

        "Two prominent Republicans are calling for changes to the No Child Left Behind law.",

        "And, as the school year approaches, many college-bound students prepare for new challenges.",
        "We carried out more very precise alt symmetry, this time over regions that we imaged either on this flyby or back in January, so that we had for the first time an ability to compare topographic profiles with high resolution images.",
        "So we're getting three-dimensional views of faults, and craters, and other geological structures.",
        "We took new measurements of Mercury's atmosphere and its comet-like tail.",
        "New species, new combinations of measurement for the first time to unravel the question of how - what possibilities are contributing to that very tenuous atmosphere.",
        "And we took measurements of the planet's magnetic field.",
        "And it's - the volume of space dominated by that field, the so-called planetary magnetosphere, which is much more dynamic this time than it was when we flew-by in January.",

        "Maybe I could just ask, because I'm curious?",
        "When you talk about dynamic magnetosphere, what does that mean?",
        "Does it mean that the north is changing as you fly - because I looked at some of the pictures and it looks as if the direction of north is changing somehow?",
        "It's not that the direction of north is changing.",
        "We see - the earth of course has its own magnetosphere, and the earth's magnetic field is a thousand times stronger than the magnetic field of Mercury.",
        "And what that means is that when the solar wind carries a changing magnetic field between the planets, we see some effects within the Earth's magnetosphere when there are magnetic storms, the Sun is particularly active.",
        "We hear about losses to satellites in orbit, particularly in the area of communication.",
        "So, our own magnetic sphere is dynamic, but Mercury's magnetosphere is as we have learned much more dynamic, because the magnetic field of Mercury is smaller, because the interplanetary magnetic field is stronger, closer to the Sun."

        "The difference we saw was almost a night and day difference between the direction of the interplanetary, magnetic field back in January, which was northward.",
        "And in October when it was southward, that direction changes all the time, but the response of Mercury's magnetosphere to that change in direction is really profound.",
        "And we did not appreciate that until our flyby earlier this month on 6 October.",
        "Because with a southward-directed interplanetary magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field directly interacts with the planetary magnetic field at the north and south poles of the planet.",
        "And because the ionized particles streaming out from the Sun all the time, the so-called solar wind that consists of ionized hydrogen, or protons, and ions of heavier elements coming from the Sun, these ionized particles travel along the lines of magnetic force in the solar wind, in the interplanetary magnetic field, and when those lines of force intersect the planet at the two poles, it means that Mercury's bombarded by energetic ions coming from the sun, and those ions are a major source of Mercury's atmosphere, it's neutral and ionized atmosphere, and also a major source of changing the color, that is to say, changing the chemistry on a very small scale of Mercury's surface material.",
        "So...",
        "Oh!",
        "The magnetosphere is a governor of a lot of activity on Mercury, ranging from the way we see the surface, to the atmosphere and the environment of the planet.",
        "That's amazing, and I've been - interesting you hear - talking about atmosphere, I mean, we don't really think of Mercury as having much of an atmosphere, and I've heard - referred to as an exosphere or an - something like that?",
        "An exosphere is the upper part of any planetary atmosphere, where the density of atoms is so low that they don't collide with each other.",
        "I got it.",
        "The top of the earth's atmosphere has an exosphere, the top of the atmosphere of Venus, a hundred times more massive than that of the earth, has an exosphere at the top.",

        "Hi.",
        "You mentioned that there are volcanoes and faults that you've seen on the surface of Mercury, and so I was wondering if there is a basic kind of framework that's going on there, or if there's some other sort of - you know, prompt season are going on that changed the surface?",
        "Huh.",
        "Good question, Maggie.",
        "The quick answer is no. We know of no other planetary body beyond the earth that has an organized system of tectonic plates, that as you probably know on the earth are in constant relative motion, and have boundaries that are the locus of most of the earthquake activity on our planet, as in much of the volcanic activity.",
        "Whenever I discuss college with my relatives, instead of asking me about what classes I'm taking, the first question is always, what are you going to do with your hair?",
        "Lungs are my specialty.",
        "Mercury's volcanoes and Mercury's faults are mostly very ancient in terms of when they were active.",
        "But they're well preserved, because the only source of erosion on Mercury is the constant bombardment by meteoroids, and occasionally by larger asteroids and comets.",
        "And so we can see very ancient faults and very ancient volcanic landforms.",
        "The existence of volcanoes on Mercury was something that had been debated from the images from Mariner 10, because there were no clearly-resolved volcanic centers.",
        "There were smooth plains that looked very much like what we know to be volcanic plains on the moon - the Lunar Maria - but they're a little different, because they're not as dark as the Lunar Maria, and they also looked like some of the highlands plains on the moon that are the same brightness as the surrounding, heavily-cratered terrain.",
        "So, Mariner 10 left us with the debate as to how important volcaninism has been in the history of Mercury ranging in ideas from - as important or more important than on the moon to - of little to no importance, and MESSENGER resolved that back in January by showing us convincing evidence for ancient, volcanic centers, and giving us a lot of evidence that the - many of the plains on Mercury are products of ancient lava flows.",
        "The deformational structures are quite profound.",
        "They - some of the faults have relief of as much as a mile, and almost everywhere we look on Mercury, there has been an expression of deformation recorded in those faults.",
        "Nothing like plate tectonics, but quite an interesting history of deformation.",
        "OK, Maggie.",
        "Thanks so much for the call."

        "I know that some of the images are really vivid, and you see things that you could only dream up.",
        "I mean, some of the colors and the type of expressed, like spectrum that you're seeing.",
        "Could you give an explanation of what kind of type of equipment are taking these pictures, and what challenges you have to see these planets being so close to the sun, and their atmosphere being so different from our planet and just the overall conditions.",

        "First of all, we are carrying two imaging systems.",
        "One uses a narrow angle camera at a single wavelength.",
        "We also have a wide angle camera that has 11 different color filters.",
        "Those filters span the wavelength range from - throughout the visible and into the near infrared.",
        "The actual detector is a charge-coupled device.",
        "You might find something analogous in a digital camera, and we've taken great pains to show in the images that we've released - and I hope Joe will allow me to give the website address before the show is over - of images both at what might be the kind of color that you or I would see with our own eyes, although you and I might see things a little differently."
