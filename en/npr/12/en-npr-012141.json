        "First, they showed that it has connections to brain areas that perform higher functions, like using language, reading maps, and planning.",
        "Then, a few years ago, functional MRI studies began to suggest that the cerebellum was actively involved in these tasks.",
        "The big surprise from functional imaging was that when you do these language tasks and spatial tasks and thinking tasks, lo and behold the cerebellum lit up.",
        "But Schmahmann says some of the most compelling evidence has come from people who do not have a cerebellum, people like Jonathan Keleher.",
        "Years of research on them supports the idea that the cerebellum has just one job.",
        "It takes clumsy actions or functions and makes them more refined.",
        "So it doesn't make things.",
        "It makes things better.",

        "The brain's motor cortex tells your legs to start walking.",
        "The cerebellum keeps your stride smooth and steady and balanced.",
        "What we now understand is that what the cerebellum is doing to movement, it's also doing to intellect and personality and emotional processing.",
        "It's making all those things better, too.",
        "Unless you don't have a cerebellum.",
        "Then, Schmahmann says, thinking and emotions can become clumsy.",

        "He was anxious about holding the bus up.",
        "He totaled his father's car.",
        "Not because he lacked the physical coordination to drive, but because his brain couldn't coordinate all the information - the bus, the cars, the intentions of other drivers.",
