        "Rob, what's been the reaction to this huge settlement from the victims?",
        "Well, the victims that I've spoken with - one in particular this weekend since the news was released, and he was actually getting prepared for trial today.",
        "And for the last month, he's been taking depositions and he's kind of had to remember a lot of the abuse that he suffered.",
        "And so for him it was kind of a - he had conflicting feelings about it.",
        "I think he was relieved, but at the same time I think he was disappointed that the church waited this long to settle.",
        "But are there critics among the victims, people who wanted to go to trial to have this out in the open?",
        "Definitely, because I think that a trial would mean that Cardinal Roger Mahony would have taken the stand, that a lot of the personnel files would have been released.",
        "The personnel files now are going to be released.",
        "However, the caveat is that a private judge is going to mediate any objections from individual priests.",
        "So that might take a while and a lot of files might not see the light of day.",

        "Yes.",
        "A lot of parishioners are, I think, relieved.",

        "And that's a big question.",
        "So how is the Archdiocese going to raise that money?",
        "Well, according to the Los Angeles Times, the Archdiocese has around 1,600 properties and they're worth about $4 billion.",
        "So you know, $660 million - and I should mention that only about 250 million of that is actually going to be paid in cash by the church.",
        "The rest of it is going to be by insurers.",
        "I think the Archdiocese is probably going - it's not going to bring the Archdiocese to its financial knees.",
        "It will be able to continue its mission, keep its schools and churches running."

        "And he said, look, I've cut these glutens from my diet and it's made all the difference in the world.",
        "And you know, some people are having a - if you'll pardon the pun - a hard time swallowing that explanation, but the proof is in the gluten-free pudding.",
