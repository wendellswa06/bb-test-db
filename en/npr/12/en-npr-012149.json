        "And the conversation came up that gee, we couldn't go to the swimming pool that was three or so blocks away, in a white neighborhood, and that we'd have to except on Wednesday afternoon.",
        "So if we were going to swim that summer in that pool, we would have to go only on Wednesday afternoons.",
        "And the reason for that became because we were black, because we were African-American.",

        "That's correct.",

        "The instruction from adults that this is important and you should think about it and understand it, those things are kind of abstract and may be interesting, but they wouldn't be nearly as compelling psychologically, and they sort of take over your thinking and functioning as much as a real restriction tied to an identity.",
        "And a lot of your book is, in fact, a result of your investigation as to why specifically African-American, but later minority students, seemed to do so poorly academically at big institutions like the University of Michigan, where you worked, or at Stanford University, where you also work.",
        "And indeed, what you found out was it was this social identity and the negative consequences of it.",
        "Yes, the prospect if you can imagine, you talked to - you had a woman at the beginning of the hour talking about her experience in math.",
        "You can imagine being a woman taking a difficult math course, let's say in her second or third year of college, and experiencing frustration at that.",
        "That frustration in math occasions the relevance of the stereotype about women's math ability.",
        "And if she's invested in doing well at math, she could worry that oh my goodness, you know, I've invested so much in it, but here it is.",
        "Maybe what they say is true.",
        "And that could be upsetting and distracting and interfere with her functioning right there in the middle of that course or in the middle of taking that standardized test.",
        "And that has been what our research is focused on, is trying to test that idea, put it to test.",
        "I and my colleagues have done that over the last 20 years.",
        "And one of the fascinating findings is that, in fact: A, you do have to care about the outcome of this performance, and the more accomplished you are, the more this effect shows up.",
        "Yeah, yeah, you have more invested in it.",
        "So the if you really, if you don't care about if you're a woman, and you don't care about doing well with math, your life is on another path, then the prospect of confirming such a stereotype about your group's ability or - it isn't as upsetting to you because you're not invested in that area, but when you've really invested yourself, then the prospect of that stereotype being true or its being seen to be true and you being treated accordingly, that has considerable impact.",
        "It scares you, and that fear can directly interfere with your functioning.",
        "And you go on to prove this, as you mentioned, with white, female math majors, well, female math majors in general.",
        "There's a fascinating part of the test where, in fact, you somebody tests Asian female math majors to see whether both stereotypes will work: A, they're failing at math because they're female, or their expectation that they will succeed because they're Asian.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "I didn't do that, but some other very clever researchers did, and they found that the performance follows whichever stereotype you make most salient in the situation, most obvious.",
        "If you remind them of their gender, then they underperform, being affected by that negative stereotype.",
        "If you remind them of their ethnicity, then they don't underperform in relation to men.",

        "Well, it's probably part of it, that there is no group that doesn't have a negative stereotype, and when that if that stereotype is relevant to them in an important set of situations, like the classroom or the workplace or the basketball court or something that they care about, then they're going to feel this pressure.",
        "I mean, the beauty, of course, is that from this analysis grows some convincing strategies for reducing this threat.",
