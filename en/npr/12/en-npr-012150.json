        "Like, they're all greenhorns compared to me, but since I don't have the piece of paper, there's instantly a stereotype that I don't know exactly the same, like, how to make a grade in the trail, or I don't know the same, like, the same...",
        "We hear you, John.",
        "And let me ask Claude Steele about this.",
        "In fact, this sort of comes up with an email you got from somebody who attended one of your lectures and said: Gee, you've listed all these things that have negative stereotypes.",
        "You didn't mention mental illness.",
        "Yeah, that's a good example, and it connects to the caller's concern that this was, I was going on and on about these other stereotypes and performance in math and athletics and the like, and the email reminded me that in her case, she was manic-depressive or bipolar and that in the audience, she felt reluctant to raise her hand and ask about that because she thought everybody would begin to see her that way and to see her as having a mental illness and that that might affect her employment options and how people related to her.",
        "And she provided a perfect example of the vast array of forms of negative of stereotype threat that people can experience, just as the caller's experience does.",
        "That's one that I hadn't really thought of, but as he describes it, it's a very compelling experience.",
        "And it's precisely an example of stereotypes around in that there's something about him that, you know, authorizes this kind of stereotype, and he becomes aware of it, and that's the experience of the threat.",
        "And it affects his relationships with other people, his functioning at various times and so on.",
        "And let me ask you about the title of your book, \"\"Whistling Vivaldi.",
        "Yes, that comes from a friend, Brent Staples who writes for the New York Times, and his autobiography called \"\"Parallel Time,\"\" a great book I can plug.",
        "He describes being a graduate student, an African-American graduate student at the University of Chicago, walking down the street dressed as a student and realizing that his mere presence was making whites uncomfortable.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And they would avoid him or sort of cross the street to get away from him and so on.",
        "He realized from this kind of behavior that they were seeing him through the lens of a negative stereotype about African-Americans in that neighborhood, that perhaps as a young male, black male, he might be violent.",
        "And it was making his whole experience of the situation tense and awkward.",
        "He learned how to whistle Vivaldi to deflect that stereotype.",
        "When they heard the classical music being whistled, they said oh, this is a man of refinement."

        "I was in a place that had people from all over the world, you know, predominately men.",
        "And I think that in retrospect now, listening to this, that it seems to make sense because when I would take an exam, I would get everything right that I would finish, but I almost feel like I was trying to be so meticulous because I was fearful that I wasn't going to perform how I was used to performing that I actually didn't perform as well as I was used to performing.",

        "Yes, that really is a perfect description of it.",

        "That's a perfect description because somebody - it's not an effect that's tied to their real abilities.",
        "It's, in effect, it's almost like an intimidation factor, and the other critical thing in the caller's description is place.",
        "In some places, it can be very powerful, where there are a lot of cues that make one aware of one's identity and the contingencies that can be tied to it.",
        "That can make the experience of stereotype threat much worse, whereas in other situations, where maybe there are more women, you know, you're in a high school, and the girls are just as good at math at the boys, and there isn't as much visibility of this stereotype to give it credibility, it isn't a powerful thing.",
        "But as you move up the ladder, and there are fewer women in the classes and the like, the stereotype and the pressures of it become more intense.",
        "The examples you use in your book is Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman justice of the United States Supreme Court, felt intense pressure until she was joined on the court by another woman.",
        "That's right, Ginsburg.",

        "That kind of a message that critical mass sends, relaxes the sense in a person that they're under this kind of threat.",
        "And that number is a little hard to judge in each situation, two enough apparently for the Supreme Court, but 40 percent as it turns out for a philharmonic orchestra.",
