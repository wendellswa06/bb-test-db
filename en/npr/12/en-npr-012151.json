        "It's just that in certain situations where performance on a difficult task is the issue and is persistently the issue, one is at the frontier of their skills, moving through a math curriculum or a physics curriculum, or that's where this sort of daily pressure can begin to have more of a wearing effect.",
        "And indeed thank you very much, Chris indeed not just a wearing effect.",
        "You come across a phenomenon called John Henryism, which may help explain the shorter life spans, due to hypertension, of some African-Americans.",
        "Yes.",
        "This is again not my own research, but it's very relevant in the sense that it describes some of the costs of trying hard over a lifetime to resist a stereotype, that it can cause be a source of hypertension and other related diseases, the effort to if you're in a situation where you're consistently pushing against that and pushing against that, a tax is paid eventually, and some of that tax has to do with one's health.",
        "There are other implications to this, and you don't go into this in great depth, but you present some research, again not your own, about how easily we humans discriminate against each other, even when the categories we're divided in are seemingly meaningless: over-estimaters and under-estimaters, whatever that may mean.",
        "And yet when placed in those categories, we will work on behalf of our own group, to individuals in our group to the detriment of people in other groups, and this helps explain, to some degree, this phenomenon seemingly we're hardwired with it why - this is interestingly presented in the context of a young man from Lebanon, who is well, he's got all kinds of stereotypes, but he writes about violence in the Middle East.",
        "Yeah, the first it turns out this is again a whole lot of social-psychological research, not mine but just the minimal divisions among us, if they're made salient, we can begin to identify with whichever side we're on.",
        "It's like identifying with something like our school."

        "They stereotype us.",

        "I was one of the grad students who was TAing, and I had a teacher from northeast Ohio say well, you know, you're awful smart, or you know this very well or whatever she said, and where are you from?",

        "And what techniques do you use to do that?",
        "J.R.: Well, I wish I could tell you I was very effective at it.",
        "I don't know how effective I am.",
        "I'm only three years into teaching now, so I'm developing these things.",
        "The real ideal is to hold them to the highest standards that I can and I make them realize, hopefully, eventually, sometimes I fail at this, but I try to hold them to the highest standards and let them know that they can succeed even when it's hard.",
        "And that it being hard doesn't mean that it's -you don't - you're not smart.",
        "It just means it's hard.",

        "One of the - to put - bring it to a sharp point, one of the things we found is that if you give - if you're very demanding in a classroom situation of that sort and, at the same time, you affirm the students' abilities to realize those high standards that you're setting, you - the combination of things is very effective at the reducing the effects - the negative effects of stereotype threat.",
        "It signals to the student that they're not being seen as having limited ability.",

        "That's one of the sort of tricks of reducing this threat is to do something that makes the stereotype that would normally be relevant to them, not relevant in that situation.",

        "Yes.",
        "This is a strategy used to avoid stereotype threat.",
        "And I think, in some ways, it's some of the more compelling evidence of the existence of stereotype threat in real life that a couple of strategies, both passing, where people change their names, or if they have the appearance to do it, shift from being black to being white; representing themselves as white to avoid the experience of being negatively stereotyped.",
        "Or another strategy is to expatriate...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...to move to another society where the stereotypes are different and one doesn't have to, therefore, experience the same kind of stereotyping.",
        "Oh.",
        "I think both of those strategies, passing and expatriation, are similar to the Glen strategy that she's using there where she's deflecting being seen and treated in terms of the stereotype by representing herself differently."

        "Yeah.",
        "It sounds like in the school where she did poorly, did worse than expected, she was under some low expectations on the part of her teachers and that maybe the whole climate there had that.",
        "I'm not sure that's all together stereotype threat, but it's nonetheless a powerful social psychological pressure to be seen in terms of - and treated in terms of low expectations that can undermine motivation and undermine interest, and all kinds of things that you're describing were evidenced by your daughter.",
        "And we wish her continued good luck, John, in pursuit of math.",
        "And - but let me - we just have a minute left, but I wanted to ask you about the alternate theory, which is if you're looking at the situation, yes, there could be this psychological pressure that people are responding to.",
        "It can also be something inherent, that maybe women aren't as good as men at math, biologically, and something in their brains or that white men can't jump.",
