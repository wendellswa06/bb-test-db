        "Well, now that that seems to be sufficiently forgotten that the trial of Radovan Karadjic, or his testimony on his own behalf, can be stuffed below the fold - at least of the front page - is it a good sign that something really is behind what used to be Yugoslavia?",
        "Or is it simply dormant once again and capable of rising?",
        "I'm afraid that without confronting the past which Serbia and, to be fair, other nations in the region failed to do, it's a very dangerous thing.",
        "It's also easy way out, say, OK, let's bury the hatchet; put the past behind us and move on.",

        "Since 1972, every single presidential candidate who has won the popular vote has also won the Catholic vote.",
        "One in four voters are Catholics.",
        "Now, historically, they voted for Democrats.",

        "They were just beginning to be the rust belt at that time.",
        "That's exactly right.",

        "So 1972 is the turning point.",
        "It's - Richard Nixon, of course, wins the popular vote and more Catholics go with Richard Nixon rather than George McGovern.",
        "That's right.",
        "So what happens in 1972?",
        "What suggests the shift?",
        "You know, I think it's a combination of things.",

        "I mean, 1968, you know, it was 59 percent voted for the Democratic candidate in 1968 versus, you know, nearly eight in 10 in Kennedy.",
        "So we had begun to see kind of a slide.",
        "But it's not really till 1972 that we really see this division with Catholics really going Republican or Democrat depending on the election and looking really like the bellwether constituency that really goes with the general population.",
        "What's behind that, I think, really is 100 years of integration.",
        "So we have the biggest wave of Catholic immigration in the late 19th century and then we have several generations.",
        "By the time we get to 1972, we have nearly a century of Catholic integration with Catholics having upward mobility in terms of education, in terms of income.",
        "And I think, importantly, moving out of Catholic enclaves in larger cities like New York and Chicago.",
        "Let's talk about now.",
        "We still hear this notion of a Catholic voting bloc.",
        "But there is no Catholic voting bloc.",

        "I mean, one thing to say is that this is a really large group of voters, and they make up a quarter of all American voters.",
        "But I would say there are at least two Catholic votes in the country, and they divide pretty cleanly by ethnicity.",
        "So white, non-Hispanic Catholics, for example, in the last election supported John McCain over Barack Obama.",
        "However, if you look at the Latino Catholic vote, nearly three quarters of the Latino Catholic vote supported President Barack Obama.",
        "Which meant that Obama got more Catholic votes in total.",
        "That's right.",
        "But it was the Latino Catholic vote that put Obama over the top...",
        "That put him over."

        "How important is a very strong working relationship with Mexico to securing the border?",

        "The last people that you would call for assistance anytime that something happened on the border was the Mexican Representatives.",
        "There was no trust.",
        "There was no capabilities.",
        "Well, fast forward to today - Mexican and Canadian officials are the first ones that we call upon when something is happening along our nation's border either north or south.",
        "We have a an interest of having both Canada and Mexico as our staunchest allies when it comes to criminal activities, when it comes to cartel activities, when it comes to illegal immigration, when it comes to terrorist actors."
