        "Yeah.",
        "So what's interesting about what's called reminiscence therapy - which is not a new source of treatment and care - it's been shown to reduce agitation, improve mood and actually improve sleep quality.",
        "So it's something that we've been utilizing in our centers for some time, but now we're taking it to a level where we're creating more of a immersive experience for our participants and for their families.",
        "But does research show that Alzheimer's patients respond to sights and sounds that are from the time of their youth but may not have been important to them in their youth?",
        "That is, I'm pushing 70.",
        "I grew up in an urban high-rise.",
        "I could have moved to San Diego.",
        "But I wouldn't find a mock San Diego of the 1950s reminiscent of my youth.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a very interesting question.",
        "I think one of the things that we're really focused on is our expansion.",
        "And what we want to do is to create these environments that are reminiscent of the individual's past wherever they may be.",
        "So certainly kind of a Main Street, USA feel is consistent across many individuals' youths.",
        "But what we've seen is that when you take certain prompts - for example, we have a participant who saw we have a 1959 Thunderbird.",
        "Soon as he saw that vehicle, he was immediately triggered back to that time in his youth where he saw kind of a connection.",
        "And not only for himself, but for his family member, his wife, who was there as well.",
        "So you see those types of prompts are able to bring individuals back to that time in their life where there is a connection.",
        "Now, these buildings in the entire town square, they're miniature.",
        "They're not full size.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So the thought process is that the building itself will be about 8,500 square feet.",
        "So we're talking about quite a large space.",
        "Anywhere between 15 and - to 25 fully designed storefronts, everything from a fully functioning movie theater.",
        "So there's nothing fake, if you will, or a facade about the actual storefronts themselves.",
        "The participants and their families will be able to go inside.",
        "They'll be able to view a movie.",
        "They'll be able to go into a pet store.",
        "They'll be able to go into a '50s-style diner.",
        "So this is an opportunity for individuals to do things that, honestly, they really don't have the opportunity to do now.",
        "And the movies in the movie theater will be Doris Day movies and things from 1958?",
        "It will.",
        "It will be consistent with that time period."

        "And are you sure that this wouldn't be - for people who haven't completely lost touch with the present that it wouldn't be confusing at all as to what's happening during the day when they go and visit 1958?",
        "You know, I don't know about confusing.",
        "I think what we know about Alzheimer's - and we have an incredible medical advisory committee that we've spent many, many months working with on this project - is that the reality is that short-term memory is poor.",
        "And so when we're able to create an environment again where we're able to trigger some of those long-term memories, we find that that will be incredibly beneficial for our participants and their family, certainly a lot more than any kind of confusion we'd create about the change from the outside, if you will, to the inside.",

        "An attack in Nigeria this week that killed nearly 60 people was still less severe than it might've been because one of the teenage girls who was supposed to have been a suicide bomber removed her vest when she spotted a family member in the camp that was the target.",

        "We're told that two young women apparently blew themselves up in this refugee camp in Dikwa in northeastern Nigeria that houses 50,000 people.",
        "And that's just a fraction of the people who have been driven from their homes but - because of Boko Haram attacks.",
        "Now, apparently these two young women went ahead, although a third woman - young woman, a teen, we're told - decided - and it's a pretty brave decision - that she was not going to carry out the orders to blow herself up.",
        "And we're told that's because her father was in the camp, and she was afraid to blow herself up and possibly blow her father up but also frightened about going against that the instructions of the men who brought her to the camp and deployed her as a potential suicide bomber.",
        "Do you know what authorities have been able to learn from this girl who decided not to detonate her suicide vest?",
        "That apparently she was one among thousands being held captive for months by the extremists.",
        "And, Ari, there are still unanswered questions and details that the authorities are hoping to learn.",
        "Have these women been radicalized?",
        "Have they been terrorized?",
        "Have they been traumatized?",
        "And is that why they are carrying out these suicide operations?",
        "Increasingly we're seeing young women, women, even children being deployed as suicide bombers.",
        "Why?",
        "Because it's easy for them to conceal possible suicide vests or belts under, you know, very loose gowns that a lot of Muslim women wear in northeastern Nigeria.",
        "But those are the sorts of details that the authorities are hoping this young woman will be able to give them."

        "Money is the rub with this recovery.",
        "Employers are hiring more people.",

        "A month ago it looked like wages were starting to pick up, but now those November numbers were revised lower and in December wages actually fell a bit.",
        "What the authorities have managed to do in Nigeria's army after initial crushing defeats by Boko Haram is they have managed to push the insurgents out of towns.",
        "They no longer hold territory.",
        "They no longer hold towns and villages.",
        "But what Boko Haram has now resorted to is these guerrilla attacks, these hit-and-run raids or using women or girls as suicide bombers, which is causing many, many deaths, perhaps not in the same way, but perhaps we're not seeing people being abducted in their hundreds and in their thousands.",
        "But plenty of women and children, men and boys have been abducted in the past, so perhaps this young woman got away, as Boko Haram might see it, but there will be 10 more that they can deploy as suicide bombers, so they're certainly not history yet.",

        "They're called stem cells, and the great hope is that someday, they could be used to cure lots of diseases.",

        "There are many, many diseases that you could potentially cure if you put in the proper cells in the proper location and they function normally.",
        "But human embryos have to be destroyed to get these cells, which makes them extremely controversial.",
        "So, scientists have been trying to find other ways to make stem cells, and they've been able to do that.",

        "But Vacanti and his colleagues had another idea: Maybe they could make stem cells by mimicking what happens when the body naturally repairs itself.",
        "You know, if you're walking down the street and you fall down and bruise your leg, you know, if you're punched in the eye - wherever you're injured - is that the mature cells are actually reverting back to a stem cell to now repair the injured tissue.",
        "So, Vacanti teamed up with some Japanese researchers to see if they could make mature cells turn back into stem cells in the laboratory.",
        "The scientists took cells from newborn mice and subjected them to the same kinds of stresses that occur in the body during an injury.",
        "For example, they exposed the cells to increased levels of acidity.",
        "We found that if we injured them, almost to the point of dying, but not quite to the point of dying, the cells would revert back to a stem cell state.",
        "A stem cell state very much like embryonic stem cells.",
        "Then they showed they could use these cells to create virtually every kind of tissue in the body.",
        "They went even further.",
        "They used these cells to create complete mouse embryos.",
        "It demonstrates that you have the ability to make perfect embryonic stem cells that can then turn into a perfect copy of your own cells.",
