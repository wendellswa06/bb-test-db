        "Harry Holzer is a former chief economist for the Labor Department.",
        "He says the puzzle is that the official unemployment rate has now fallen to 5.6 percent.",
        "And, historically, that's meant that there's enough demand for labor to push up wages.",
        "So...",
        "How can it be that we haven't seen any growth, adjusted for inflation, so far?",
        "Probably the real answer to that is that there's still more slack in the labor market.",
        "In other words, the unemployment rate just isn't as good a yardstick this time around.",
        "Many workers have dropped out of the labor force or are working part time.",
        "That's not captured in the unemployment rate figure.",
        "Now, just about everybody agrees that if employers keep hiring more workers at some point wages will rise, but the question then is by how much?",
        "Holzer says if you look back at the 30-year period after World War II...",
        "The rising tide was lifting all the boats, so you had strong wage growth year-in, year-out, and over a 30-year period, you know, the average worker's earnings were more or less doubled.",
        "Since the early 1970s, though, it's been a very different story.",
        "Holzer says overall wages, adjusted for inflation, have only risen 20 percent since 1973.",
        "And when you look at big chunks of what used to be the middle-class - take, working-age men with a high school education - their wages haven't risen at all.",
        "In fact, they've fallen."
