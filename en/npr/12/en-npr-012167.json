        "It's all captured in Matthew Pearl's new novel, \"\"The Last Dickens.\"\" Part fact, part fiction, it traces that writer's 1867 tour of America.",
        "Matthew Pearl spoke with us from Boston, where Dickens began his journey.",
        "When Charles Dickens arrived in Boston Harbor, where he started, they had to keep it secret because there was such a mob of people expecting him, and they actually chased down his carriage at the hotel, the Parker House Hotel - which is still here - and as he got out of the coach, people would rip parts of his coat off, his little strands of his shawl, and this is how it was the entire time.",

        "And he embarked on his tour, this reading tour of the United States.",
        "He'd read from \"\"Great Expectations\"\" and \"\"Oliver Twist.\"\" He did this, in part, to make money because he wasn't making money in the United States on his books.",
        "How was that possible?",
        "We had a very strange copyright law, at least strange to our ears and eyes today, because we would not give copyright protection here in the United States to any foreign citizens.",
        "Well, what this meant is that someone like Charles Dickens could be published and printed by any newspaper, any publisher, without paying him a cent, either in advance or as royalties once copies were sold.",
        "Now this was a bit of a double-edged sword because on the one hand, Dickens lost untold amounts of money through this arrangement.",
        "On the other hand, he became extremely famous because there were so many editions - and quite affordable editions - of his book.",
        "So he was pretty savvy."

        "He was upset at first, for a while back - going back about 20 years from his first trip to America, but he figured out how to exploit this, by using the fame to earn money through, as you say, actual personal appearances.",
        "It was such a different time, but in a way he was inventing what we would know of as a book tour.",
        "Paint a picture of this world of the wharfs and the docks in places like Boston and Philadelphia and New York, where you had these book pirates, known as bookaneers.",
        "This was so surprising to me.",
        "When I was doing my research, it was one of these moments where I had to stare at the page.",
        "Since there was no copyright for foreign authors, the value in publishing a foreign author became who could publish it first, not who could get permission to publish it.",

        "It's a remarkable story.",

        "There was a very small chance of being wounded on the battlefield and living, say, in World War II, but we have developed techniques and people and medical capabilities that we are able to save about 90 percent.",

        "She trained as a paratrooper and then, of course, when we asked her why she had exposed herself to enemy fire she responded it's my job.",
        "It's really an extraordinary story where she - one of their vehicles runs over an IED and she ran to it, in spite of the fact that all sorts of people were shooting at her.",
        "And she literally shielded the wounded with her own body.",
        "I mean, it's just a remarkable story and I think, you know, we've always had this ongoing debate and discussion about women in combat and, frankly, many years ago, I had a very different attitude than I have today because I believe that women have proven themselves in combat and, therefore, they can add an enormous amount, frankly, to our ability to defend the nation."
