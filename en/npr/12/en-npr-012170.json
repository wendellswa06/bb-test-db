        "First, the medical development that could change political control in Washington.",
        "A Democratic senator from South Dakota, Tim Johnson, is in critical though stable condition in a Washington hospital after emergency brain surgery.",
        "Senator Johnson is 59 years old.",
        "He fell ill yesterday during a conference call with reporters.",
        "The Capitol physician today says the Senator suffered from bleeding in the brain.",
        "It was caused by a circulatory condition called arteriovenous malformation or AVM.",
        "We're joined from Washington by Ron Elving.",
        "He's NPR's senior Washington editor.",
        "Ron, what is the latest on the senator's condition?",
        "Alex, we're told that he is still in critical condition but stable condition.",
        "We are also hearing that while his condition does not seem to be immediately life-threatening, there has been some compromise - there has been some damage done by the bleeding on his brain, and that this will not be one of those snap-back recoveries or short-period recoveries, and that it will probably take some period of time for him to entirely recover.",
        "There could be some paralysis on one side.",
        "There could be some aphasia, which is the inability to understand or communicate in speech and language.",
        "So for him to return to the floor of the Senate and fully return to his duties will probably be a matter of some time; months, not weeks.",
        "What is the kind of protocol in a situation like that?",
        "Do you just wait it out or what happens?",
        "Historically, people in the Senate have generally waited it out.",
        "We have frequently had senators who in their later years of their lives, in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, have had extended medical conditions that had them in wheelchairs or had them really near the end of their life and in some cases barely compos mentis.",
        "Generally speaking, they have served out their terms.",
        "What would happen if Senator Johnson decides that he must step down or someone is forced to make that decision for him?",
        "The Senate only declares a vacancy in a seat if a member dies and there is literally a death certificate, or when a member chooses to resign, and in this particular case it would be up to the senator and his family to decide to have him end his career prematurely."

        "They could, of course, also decide that while he's in his period of recuperation and recovery, rehabilitation, a big part of that rehabilitation for him would be getting back to his place on the Senate floor.",
        "So if he did leave that seat, though - because this is what I've heard talked about on the political talk shows over the last day - that creates the possibility for a vacancy and then the Republican governor of South Dakota would be appointing a replacement, at least for a while, right?",
        "The governor of South Dakota, Governor Michael Rounds, would then appoint a successor who would serve out the remainder of Johnson's term, which lasts through 2008.",
        "And then there would be an election to elect someone to hold that seat for a full term.",
        "This would be someone of Rounds's own choosing.",
        "Presumably it would be a Republican.",
        "It's been 40-some years since a governor appointed someone of another party other than his own to fill a Senate seat, even if the Senate seat he's filling had been in the hands of the other party.",
        "So we would expect Mike Rounds to appoint a Republican, probably a person who would serve for just a couple of years, because Mr. Rounds himself is term-limited as governor and has expressed interest in running for this seat himself in 2008.",
        "And there's no - there wouldn't be any kind of, sort of etiquette or feeling that, well, it's a Democratic seat and I'm a Republican, but what the heck.",
        "I'm going to give the voters of South Dakota a Democrat to replace the Democrat they elect.",
        "I suspect there would be a great deal of that sort of feeling, mostly among Democrats, but this is the ultimate partisan decision, and as I say, over the last half century it has really been the precedent that people appoint someone of their own party.",
        "And in this case, of course, that would allow the Republicans to take majority control of the Senate.",
        "Can you think of an instance like this where so much political - so much political has hinged on the health of one suddenly fragile member?",
        "All right, Jim.",
        "Are you ready to play the puzzle?",
        "There's a belief that some of these antibiotics may actually alter your immune system a little bit, and this slight alteration that some of these have could be the reason that somebody develops the respiratory tract infections that we saw.",
        "Sorting this out will require much more research, says James Del Rosso.",

        "That study is far from being definitive in terms of telling us what we need to do.",

        "Del Rosso says he views the results of this study and the body of evidence on antibiotic resistance as caution flags.",
        "It gives us a signal of something we're already aware of.",
        "We know that it's best in an ideal world that patients are not on long-term antibiotic therapy.",
        "The reality is those patients are also there for treatment, and part of the effective treatment that we have to date is giving them antibiotics.",
        "So you're sort of caught in the middle until we have some better definitive ways to solve the problem.",
        "What many dermatologists are trying for now, is to reduce the dosing of antibiotics.",
        "Patient Andrea Read has cut back substantially on the dose of erythromycin she takes for acne.",
        "From twice a day to once a day, and now to every other day.",
        "Her dermatologist, Sandra Read, who also happens to be her mother, says the strategy seems to be working.",
        "We're finding that we can gain control and maintain control with lower dosing.",
        "And, of course, that gets us into the benefit of not only just lower antibiotic resistance, but also less side effects.",
        "Such as heartburn, yeast infections, and sensitivity to the sun.",
        "Every patient is different, says Reed, and increasingly she is trying out combinations therapies using retinoids such as Retin-A, and various formulations of over-the-counter benzyl peroxides.",
        "At the end of the day, Reed says, every patient is judging their treatment based on what they see in the mirror.",
        "We have very high expectations in our patients about how they want to look."
