        "What would you suggest we keep in our minds and hearts about Jim Foley, his life and his lesson this weekend?",
        "Well, you know, I think when you look at a guy like Jim Foley, who was a man of action, a man who wanted to help people - he could have done it in a variety of ways.",
        "He had a real knack of getting to know people and love people.",
        "He wanted to be there to help them, to give them a better life.",
        "That's one of the reasons that I think he became a reporter.",
        "He wanted people to know the truth.",
        "He wanted people to look at evil head on and try to make a difference.",

        "I think Ben Bradlee and Frank Mankiewicz knew the news business enough to realize that if two old lions die within a couple days of each other, they'll wind up sharing space in the same recollection on a weekly show.",
        "I knew Frank when he was president of NPR and became a friend after he left.",
        "I met Ben Bradlee just a few times, but it seemed to me they shared a certain swagger of charm, wit and street smarts even if those streets were in Georgetown.",
        "Of all the photos of Ben Bradlee that appeared this week, I thought the best glimpse of character was in one taken when he left the federal courthouse in 1971 with Katharine Graham, who owned The Washington Post.",
        "They'd gone to court to fight for the right of The Post to run excerpts leaked to them from the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department study that documented how the Johnson administration had lied about the war in Vietnam.",
        "It's important not to use a more polite word to Congress and the public.",
        "In that photo on the courthouse steps, Ben Bradlee and Katharine Graham are laughing.",
        "I like to think Ben had just muttered something like, Kay, we're going to fight this if it takes all your money.",
        "But when the case was still in doubt, they looked like two people doing what they believed in and enjoying it.",
        "Years ago, Frank Mankiewicz got so angry over something I reported that he called me to his office and punted a typewriter.",
        "I hope you understand that we became even better friends thereafter.",
        "Ben and Frank were talking heads who opined about the principles of journalism.",
        "They loved the game, scoops, big stories and rattling gilded cages.",
        "They moved comfortably among the rich and powerful, but were profane in the best way.",
        "They respected effort, irreverence and wit more than power.",
        "They could be famously inattentive managers - when Frank left NPR, the network was deeply in debt - but inspired motivators.",
        "Both men enjoyed their prime in a different time for the news business.",
        "NPR was once directly subsidized by the federal government.",
        "That percentage is very small today.",
        "Ben Bradlee ran a one-paper monopoly on the nation's capital for a rich owner who was willing to lose money for a while.",
        "When The Washington Post was sold last year, it was for $250 million, just what Albert Pujols is paid to play baseball.",
        "I'm not sure that Ben Bradlee or Frank Mankiewicz ever had a business plan to create national institutions, but they did what they loved and made it stand for"

        "Is Ukraine particularly vulnerable this winter?",

        "Well, I started to think long and hard.",
        "I mean, I was a psychologist anyway, and I saw a lot of teens.",
        "I also saw that there was a whole attitude about sexuality that I was seeing in my office that was very different than anything I'd seen before.",
        "And I started to think about how can I begin to talk about sex with my own kids and with these teens in a way that's going to empower them, but also fill in some of the gaps that's missing.",

        "And this is why I ended up thinking so much about this and writing the book because it was really clear to me that, you know, short of moving into a cave, there was absolutely nothing I could do to prevent him from understanding what a man - how a man uses his sexuality in a very negative way, and that I needed to get there first.",
        "I need to give him a frame of reference to be thinking about sexuality differently.",
