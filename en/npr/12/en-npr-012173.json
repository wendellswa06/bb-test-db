        "What did you find out about the context in which he told Robert Novak, the columnist, that Wilson, who was talking about his trip to West Africa, indeed his wife worked for the CIA?",
        "Well, Armitage met with Novak in his State Department office just a couple of days after Washington is in a tizzy over the Joseph Wilson column accusing the White House of ignoring his own warnings that the intelligence about yellow cake uranium and Saddam buying it from Africa was wrong.",
        "And it was quite a natural question for Novak to ask Armitage hey, what about this Wilson matter?",
        "But Wilson's wife was - well, the fact that she worked for the CIA was not known.",
        "And there's been a grand jury since and an indictment of Scooter Libby, I.",
        "Lewis Libby since, all about the disclosure of the identity of Mrs. Wilson, Valerie Plame Wilson.",
        "Did Armitage know that?",
        "Well, they need a lot of investment.",
        "There's no doubt about that and this is where the EBRD comes in, I think.",
        "We have to really help Ukraine with energy-efficiency credit lines through banks and so on.",
        "We need to get companies in Ukraine to become much more energy efficient.",
        "At the same time, we also need to help Ukraine with its immediate energy security needs, I think.",
        "One of the things we're thinking of doing is a gas transit project, really to help with the reverse flow of gas from Slovakia, for example.",
        "Not so long ago, there was a feeling that if Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia were kind of codependent - Russia obviously providing a lot of the energy - that was going to be good, that that would knit a working relationship together on the continent, which had been the source of, obviously, so much suffering.",
        "What's happened?",
        "What's happened is clearly a geopolitical mess, currently.",
        "And that has affected not just energy, but other fields too - investment levels elsewhere.",
        "So you can see, in terms of foreign investment outflows from Russia, they're in very, very heavy this year.",
        "The economic linkages were there.",
        "They're sort of beginning to break down because of the geopolitical tensions.",
        "Our reporting from Ukraine says that a lot of people there are stocking up on blankets and batteries.",
        "They're concerned about the winter to come.",
        "Yeah, well, I mean, if you look at the economic situation in Ukraine, we're projecting this year that the economy will shrink by 9 percent and next year by another 3 percent.",
        "So that has real human consequences.",
        "The budget is under extraordinary strain.",
        "You can imagine the war, the conflict, in the East and that was where heavy industry was concentrated.",
        "That's affected people very badly.",
        "What can the West do over the next few years before these energy efficiency projects begin to pay off?",
        "Well, I think I'd give an example of what we're trying to do because that's - in a way, says it all really.",
        "We really need to ramp up our investment in Ukraine, after really reducing investment in Ukraine over many years because of corruption.",
        "But we have a government, which is now tackling corruption, with our help.",
        "We have a willingness really, to reform.",
        "So we're putting a lot of money into Ukraine really to try and get the economy back on its feet as fast as possible.",
        "But it will take two, three years I think before we get positive rates of growth again in Ukraine."

        "Francis Fukuyama has written another door stopper, a big sweeping book that's the second volume in a set that strived to describe how political order - people forming nations and living by laws - came to be widely proliferated and the ways in which they're now being rocked.",
        "Professor Fukuyama may always be best known for his essay \"\"The End Of History,\"\" written just before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the pro-democracy uprising in Tiananmen Square.",

        "Well, I think that's right.",
        "I think the aspiration to live in a free society is pretty widely shared.",
        "But the actual ability to create a democracy is actually quite difficult because you need institutions and those are hard to create.",
        "Does democracy even look so good at the moment?",
        "Well, I think that it kind of depends on what you mean by democracy.",
        "The problem with holding elections in a place without stronger institutions, like political parties and the rule of law, is that you get very weird results, like the election of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.",
        "Or you get this kind of gangster society that rose in Russia in the 1990s.",
        "And that's really not democracy.",
        "Seems to me over the past few years, we've heard of a lot of instances around the world where a government comes in heralding democratic values, and a few years later the population that voted them into office complains that they're so corrupt.",
        "And then they become vulnerable to the appeals of groups that have a harder ideological edge, and are certainly not democratic.",
        "But to the people who are living in that democratic state, they hold the promise of being honest brokers.",
        "Well, I think the single biggest political deficit in many countries around the world today is actually a deficit of a effective governance, meaning a government that can actually deliver the basic things that people want out of government - personal security, education, infrastructure.",
        "And I think you're right that many of the failures in new democracies are very much related to this.",
        "So if you look at Ukraine, you had an orange revolution all the way back in 2004 that was supposed to herald a new democratic age.",
        "The orange coalition that came to power in the wake of that proved to be incompetent.",
        "And as a result, Viktor Yanukovych was reelected in 2010.",
        "And he himself turned out to be so corrupt that he required a second revolution earlier this year to oust him a second time.",
        "And so it's really that failure of governance I think that is the key problem."

        "There's a flurry of anxious meetings and phone calls, and that culminates with Taft informing the Justice Department that we here at State, and in particular Richard Armitage, have some information relative to your inquiry."

        "Well, I would differ--I think it's an astonishing spectacle that we see a president trying to repair an imploding presidency by capitulating, appeasing, rewarding, kissing the feet of unelected, right-wing power brokers who pushed out Harriet Miers in retreating to his base.",
