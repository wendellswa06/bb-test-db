        "It's commencement season and commencement speech season.",
        "Schools compete for eminent names to be commencement speakers, but I think unless you're Stephen Colbert, who told Wake Forest graduates that as soon as they've shucked their gowns they faced brunch first then yawning uncertainty, or Maya Rudolph, who gave her impersonation of Beyonce singing the national anthem at Tulane.",

        "You want dessert or an extra 15 minutes before bed - try saying please.",
        "See what happens.",
        "Listen, fifth graders, your parents may not be rocket scientists, but they want what's best for you.",
        "When they say let me tell you, chances are it's because they once - more than once - made a stupid mistake they hope you can avoid.",

        "That may help to explain why America and its allies have run into such serious trouble in Iraq and Afghanistan, and why President Bush now finds himself having to send more troops to the mean streets of Baghdad from units elsewhere in the country.",
        "For centuries, countries with sophisticated weapons have used their superior arms to help maintain their dominance in the world.",
        "It may be that a new page in history is being turned, and military superiority can no longer be counted on."
