        "Will Lutz is former editor of a prominent Texas conservative newsletter.",
        "He says Cruz didn't have time to meet every voter but he did the next best thing.",
        "What Ted Cruz did is for the past year and a half at least, he's been going to every conservative and Republican group that would listen to him.",
        "He has a stump speech that those audiences find attractive.",
        "Cruz gradually moved up in the polls.",
        "In a crowded primary, he was able to solidify the anti-Dewhurst vote.",
        "Then came a late endorsement from Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin.",
        "And finally, the Washington, D.C.",
        "based conservative group Club for Growth spent about two and a half million dollars on attack ads.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)",
        "Dewhurst backed wasteful earmarks and pushed for new wage taxes and a statewide property tax.",
        "Big spending-tax-raising David Dewhurst, wrong for Texas.",
        "That ad support coupled with Cruz's emphasis on reaching out to conservative bloggers and activists across the country, gave him national attention.",
        "Something that Lutz says dramatically affected Cruz's fundraising efforts.",
        "You will see people from all over the country giving money to Ted Cruz.",
        "He has made a splash in national conservative circles.",
        "I mean, being on the cover of National Review magazine, which is a conservative commentary publication, is a real coup for somebody running for office in one state.",
        "All that - the money the endorsements and the extra time to campaign - led to a second place finish in the May primary.",
        "Cruz only got 34 percent of the vote.",
        "But his supporters are mostly from the grassroots/activists/Tea Party branch of the GOP.",
        "And neither rain nor sleet nor July Texas heat will keep those voters from the polls.",
        "The Dewhurst campaign has failed to generate the same emotional fire.",
        "In an interview, Dewhurst said that means calling as many people as possible to make sure his supporters don't skip the runoff.",
        "We have polled and polled and there are substantially more David Dewhurst voters in Texas that we've been able to identify than Ted Cruz voters.",
        "But again, it's a question of turnout."

        "Absolutely.",
        "I believe that charitable giving is as important to your budget as your rent or mortgage or car payment.",
        "For my husband and I, we tithe, meaning we give 10 percent of our income.",
        "That comes out before anything else, before even a mortgage; that's how important it is to us, because if you make it an important item, you won't give it up in hard times.",

        "So, you know, first thing people usually list is their mortgage or their rent and car payment, utilities and so forth.",
        "Unfortunately, charitable giving ends up all the way at the bottom or in the miscellaneous category.",
        "And so, when times get hard, you start to cut from the bottom up, like pet grooming and, you know...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Things like that.",
        "And unfortunately, that's what charitable giving is.",
        "But if you move that line item to the top of your budget or near the top to the major things that are important to you, then you won't cut that first.",
        "Many charities will allow you to make regular payments on a monthly basis.",
        "If you make it like a bill, it won't get cut in hard times.",
        "And what if you just don't have any money?",
        "Is there another way to be charitable without spending money?"
