        "They've been accused of funneling tens of millions of dollars to the families of suicide bombers and terrorists who are affiliated with Hamas.",

        "What are the plaintiffs' attorneys expected to argue?",
        "Basically what they say is that the bank processed transactions on behalf of, for example, a charity - the Saudi Committee - that the plaintiffs say then sent those payments on to terrorists and their families.",
        "And they point to a spreadsheet that listed the names of martyrs and their beneficiaries, as well as the martyrs' causes of death.",
        "And say here you have the bank - Arab Bank that was processing transactions on behalf of the Saudi Committee.",
        "And the Saudi Committee, the plaintiffs allege, was then rewarding terrorists and their families for committing acts of terror.",
        "Now I gather in reading some of your reporting and other articles that the Arab Bank maintains they took every precaution possible.",
        "The bank says that, you know, it had nothing to do with who the Saudi Committee chose to give money to.",
        "And they said that they vetted all of the organizations and individuals against these international lists of designated terrorists and that there were no red flags.",
        "How does it happen that a U.S.",
        "court even has jurisdiction in this?",
        "This is the first case under the Anti-Terrorism Act.",
        "And the reason it's being tried here is because again it's a federal - it's a U.S.",
        "federal law.",
        "And many of the payments that we're talking about were processed through the New York-based operations of Arab Bank.",
        "So in order to clear payments, some of these transactions are routed through branches in the U.S.",
        "And so that's where you get jurisdiction.",
        "Jessica, are there implications for the banking industry in this case?",
        "The banking industry broadly is paying attention to this because they are concerned about the reputational risk and the regulatory risk of doing business in countries and providing banking servicing in countries that are risky - so areas of the country that are wracked with violence, for example.",
        "It could mean doing business in any of these places in the world may just become too risky altogether.",
        "This may not be something that you've had a chance to look at but I guess I'm sitting here and I find myself astonished that Hamas or other groups would use banks to make those kinds of payments.",
        "One of the very interesting parts of this story, at least for us, is that there is infrastructure that finances and relays payments to terrorists.",
        "I mean, their money has to change hands.",
        "And unless you're going to walk, you know, name your currency up and do a hand-to-hand exchange, you need an infrastructure to transmit those payments.",
        "And so this trial promises to really shed a light on how terrorism is financed - on what really is a shadowy and very interconnected network that enables payments to be sent all over the world."

        "And when - sometimes, you know, when I'm looking at the fashion industry and the latest trend in makeup is the so-called natural look, I find that even more disturbing than when they're talking about a hyper glamour look, because when they talk about the natural look, the reality is that there's absolutely nothing natural about it at all but there's just been a lot of makeup applied to look as seamless as possible.",

        "She felt like she did when she was in her 30s and 40s.",
        "But she didn't like the fact that people were treating her like an old person.",

        "But I think it does tap into this really complicated relationship that we do have with the idea that beauty is better on in terms of youthful beauty as opposed to the beauty that comes with age, and certainly as it applies to women.",
