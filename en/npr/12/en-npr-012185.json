        "It's not just active members of the service but reservists and contractors and family members who might be able to get on a military installation.",
        "But I think what it's interesting about these numbers is that this is the first time we've actually seen the problem quantified in some way.",
        "We knew there was a problem with the potential Islamists in the military, but we never knew what the numbers were.",
        "And so the number 100 of actual inquiries and then this other more important number of 12 serious cases, that's what's new about this.",
        "And does that number 12 include the serious case of a man who'd been AWOL who was, again, going back apparently or allegedly to try to kill people at Fort Hood?",
        "Now, see, that's a completely - that's a terrific question, one that I asked that I didn't get an answer to.",
        "His name was Abdo, and he was an AWOL very young kid from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, who drove to Texas and wanted to blow up a restaurant in Fort Hood.",
        "And what's unclear is whether or not they already had a bead on this young man, because my understanding is the way that they zeroed in that he was going to do something is that he happened to go to the exact same store and the exact same clerk who had sold ammunition and explosives to Nidal Hasan in 2009.",
        "And so when he asked for all of these things, the clerk was quite alerted and immediately called the FBI.",
        "Now, whether the FBI already knew about him or whether or not the clerk tipped them off, I haven't been able to get a clear answer on.",

        "And that leads to the question of how people are getting inspired in the first place.",

        "Killed by a drone attack last year - a U.S.",
        "drone attack.",
        "And what's interesting about this is that Nidal Hasan was the first sort of instance that they knew of, of someone who was radicalized in this way on the Internet and then who struck out.",
        "And what we don't know about these numbers is, are the numbers as high as they are, because now, post-Nidal Hasan, you have many more service members who are speaking up, not being quite so politically correct, or that you have a heightened alert on the FBI's part and the Department of Defense's part.",
        "So something that might have been given short shrift in the past now is considered a real threat.",
        "As you reported, though, the FBI and the Pentagon looking back said we should have seen Hasan coming.",
        "Yes.",
        "And certainly investigations into what happened with Fort Hood saw that.",
        "I mean there were in all 16 emails between Anwar al-Awlaki and Nidal Hasan, and that's a lot of emails.",
        "And they - the Department of Defense and the FBI didn't share information on that.",
        "And there was also an aspect that many of his superiors thought that he was a troubled case, to put it mildly, but sort of shuffled him from base to base - we don't want this problem.",
        "Yes.",
        "That's exactly the problem.",

        "In recent - probably in the last two or three years, there's been an extreme fear of backlash of saying anything that might be perceived as anti-Islamic, especially among the more career soldiers.",
        "So I think it's a good thing.",
        "I think it's going to have a positive influence on the military.",

        "Well, yes.",
        "And, of course, if you saw something that was - that really was egregious, you were going to report it.",

But there - perceived or not, there is a sensitivity of - if you have a number of Islamic Marine, which is particular rare, you really don't want to be digging too much into that because you're perceived as racist or, you know, anti-Islamic, I guess.",
        "But might that not also affect morale, if the feeling that someone's under suspicion merely because they're Islamic?",

        "So what is the military doing to try to prevent radicalization in the first place?",
        "Well, that's the big question, and that's a question that we asked in our story, is: How do you catch this before it gets to a Nidal Hasan point, or before it gets to the point where the FBI needs to open 12 serious investigations?",
        "And what this might be, if we have 12 serious investigations, is that whatever they're trying to do to blunt this radicalization isn't working, because 12 serious cases is a lot."
