        "And I think many people think there are many of them, and I'm not sure there are any.",

        "And that would be the ultimate thing to ignore.",
        "That will be a Maginot-line type of failure.",
        "It would be an enormous failure of intelligence, an enormous failure to think outside the box and exactly the kind of situation that presented itself before 9/11 when nobody thought that sort of thing might happen.",
        "Mike, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "But as he suggested and as we heard in some of the material recovered from Osama bin Laden's house in Pakistan after the raid in which he was killed, there's still a great deal of interest in spectaculars and symbolic movements, that bomb that was interrupted - Christmas Day bombing.",

        "This is the first time he has come out and given a public speech since 2010.",
        "And one of the interesting things I took out of the speech, the most interesting number was he used to spend about 75 percent of his time worrying about or opening cases on al-Qaida's core operation in Pakistan and Afghanistan, along the border there.",
        "He said now, that requires about 40 percent of his time.",
