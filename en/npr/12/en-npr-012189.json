        "And like other children who've been forced to confront mortality at an early age, I suspect you had to ask yourself, you know, why him, God?",
        "Yeah, it was difficult.",
        "I didn't really understand it, but we were thrust into it, and we had to deal with it.",
        "And dialysis has certainly come a long ways today from what it was back in my father's era, so a lot of the technology was not nearly as advanced as it is currently.",
        "And I grew up confronted with life and death decisions everyday and surrounded by people who didn't have medical care and often were not able to get the help that they needed.",
        "Thankfully, we did have medical care at the time.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But it certainly brought a certain sobriety to my thought process at that time.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Tell us, in this most recent book, you not only talk about your mother, but you talk about--talk to several other people about their mothers, as well; but what was the most important difference that your mother made in your life other than the obvious fact that, of course, she gave you birth.",
        "Well, you know, I think, my mother was an educator, and she had a philosophy that she used to share with me.",
        "I'll use this as an example.",
        "She said that the whole world is a university and everyone in it is a teacher.",
        "When you wake up in the morning, be sure you go to school.",
        "That type of ideology taught to a child at an early stage in your life gives you a broad respect for other people's opinions.",
        "It causes you not to be narrow-minded or critical, and opens your mind to at least hear other perspective whether you agree with them or not and to learn and to grow by that experience.",
        "That kind of approach to parenting was very, very significant to me.",
        "And the other thing that I thought that was important, of course, she taught me to have faith in God and to develop spirituality, but the other thing that was really significant is that she taught me to believe in myself.",
        "And I find that a lot of times, without proper parenting and mentoring, that's the only chance that we get to really build self-esteem.",
        "There are no college courses to build up self-esteem or high school or elementary school.",
        "If you don't get those values at a early age, nurtured in your home, you don't get them.",
        "That's why I wrote Mama Made the Difference, because I think mothers don't often recognize and are not often told how important their role is in developing character and infrastructure in the hearts of men and women.",
        "You say your mother taught you to love God.",
        "When did you feel--I don't know whether it was a call, or when did you try out the idea of the ministry?"

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "The time will come you'll come to hear me speak, and I'll--and they'll call you Tom Jakes' mother.",
