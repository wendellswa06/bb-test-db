        "He's with us today to talk about his ministries, his politics, and his mother's influence.",
        "If you have a question for Bishop Jakes about religion, politics, the church, give us a call: 800-989-8255; e-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "And let's turn to David(ph).",
        "David's with us from Nebraska.",
        "Hi, Bishop Jakes.",
        "It's an honor to talk to you.",
        "Thank you, David.",
        "What I want to ask you is: the Duke--the lacrosse rape case, and I want you to comment on--I hear from lawyers, I hear from defense attorneys, is there any role for Christianity, for preachers in that area, can America move past this and heal?",
        "Because it seems like nobody's going to win, both black or white, in the situation.",
        "And what's your feeling on the whole situation?",
        "You know, it's a very complicated issue.",
        "I'm certainly not an expert in any regard, but whenever there's a crisis in the community, there's an opportunity for the church to build bridges between segments of the community where there has been division.",
        "I don't think that we can begin to produce healing until we have facts as to exactly what did happen.",
        "And so the legal system has to run its course until we get the facts.",
        "And then, once we do that, I think that then a healing process can begin, and that's a huge responsibility for the church.",
        "And, I think, as I talk to more and more pastors around the nation, we assume that responsibility, but we also do it understanding that many times the church has been somewhat segmented and segregated in its own philosophies to spirituality.",
        "And sometimes, I'm not as aware and up to date as to what the mission of the church ought to be as it relates to reconciliation between races and cultures.",
        "Well, there's Donald Trump.",
        "What can we do?",
        "You know, I apologize.",
        "We left the helicopter at home.",
        "It's in the garage, forgot bring it.",
        "So we've really got a lot of work to do, and I certainly don't want to suggest that we've mastered the work.",
        "But we certainly should assume the responsibility.",
        "Government cannot change the hearts of people.",
        "We can change policies, but we can't change hearts; and I'd like to think that through faith we can change the hearts of the average citizen."

        "And secondly, how he stands on the issues that surround the discussion about church and (unintelligible) these days?",
        "Boy, that's a big question.",
        "Well, first of all, I don't think that it's a new thing that politicians are talking about faith.",
        "I certainly remember, as a young man during the Kennedy administration, we were clear in understanding that they came from Catholic backgrounds.",
        "They never were required to hide that information previously.",
        "But I do think that the conversation has heated up a bit.",
        "And, as a religious leader, I'm concerned that we do not allow God to be assigned to a particular political persuasion.",
        "I think it's dangerous--not that the politician has faith, I think that's wonderful if they have faith and they're able to express that they have faith, as long as they understand that their responsibilities as politicians are for the betterment of all people whose views may not be represented within the context of their own theology."

        "And so I don't deny any human being the right to have their faith, but my only concern, as we move forward, is that so many people today are trying to get God to be on the side of their party or their ideology.",
        "But I think that God is supreme, and it's not about him joining our parties, it's about us joining in with him.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And as long as we keep it within those contexts, then faith is appropriate.",
        "There are areas where there needs to be separation between church and state, but I don't think that those separations are so sharp that the people who make decisions and votes are not affected by their faith.",
        "Faith has affected our art, our history, our ideas about morality, as long as we have been in existence, and I think that it will continue to do so.",
        "But we don't want to franchise God down to a particular party and act like, this one is God's side, and that one is not God's side.",
        "I don't think we have the right to do that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You have appeared with presidents of both political parties at various times--with President Clinton, President Bush.",
        "I wonder, when you get those requests--I mean, sometimes it feels--President Clinton in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky affair that--do you ever feel exploited, that he's trying to be able to point to you standing over there, see I'm good with God?",
        "Well, in that particular case, I didn't feel exploited at all, because I think that most pastors are used to being called in when families and marriages are in crisis.",
        "And so I don't think that that's unusual, that a minister is brought in when people are going through moral challenges or spiritual challenges in their lives.",
        "Often how people--what people read into it, you cannot control.",
        "It's like an ambulance called to the scene of a crime, you've got to go, regardless to how people interpret it.",
        "And my role, as a pastor, has been to be broad enough to respond both to Democrats and Republicans in the time of need.",
        "And yes, sometimes I do think that those responses are misunderstood.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But I have always been clear, my rhetoric has always been the same, that I am non-partisan.",
        "And you're right, I've worked just as much with the left as I have with the right.",
        "And I think that our country often survives because of those polarities.",
        "Too much of either one would be detrimental to the welfare of our country.",
        "We survive by the balance between the two extremities.",
        "Do you see yourself in the tradition of ministers like Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesse Jackson, for that matter, people who took social justice as their cause and led their people in great crusades?",
        "I deeply admire those people who have gone before us and accomplished so much.",
        "They created a right for me to be who I am, or for my children to go to public schools and drink from fountains that are not labeled colored.",
        "My father is from Mississippi, my mother's from Alabama, and so I deeply remember how things were during the '60s and some challenges that still continue to exist today."

        "Katrina surely revealed to this country that poverty is very reprehensible and something that we all need to be aware of and fight against.",
        "And it's tragic that it takes those types of adversities for us to become aware of the reality that there are people in every city, not only New Orleans, but in every city, who are hungry and destitute, and cannot leave quickly, and do not have mobility.",
        "Also, I had just come back from Africa, where our congregation had been digging wells, and continues to dig wells for indigenous people that don't have water.",
        "And I'm just saying that there's nothing wonderful about being poor.",
        "When you hear me minister, I'm ministering--though it is broadcast around the world, I'm ministering to people who are in the--in part in the inner city, challenging them to get their children back in school, challenging them to own property."
