        "All right, maybe we'll take that question and put it aside.",
        "Let me ask you, though, obviously, given the recent history of preachers and some scandal, your ministry, like many others, has been investigated by skeptics and truth tellers.",
        "And, thus far, they've never found anything corrupt or wrong at all in your ministry, except that the fact that it generates so much money.",
        "Now, I know that the church's money is separate from your money, but does this cause you any discomfort at all?",
        "Well, you know, the wonderful thing that has happened to me down through the years--the questions are often raised.",
        "I'd like to deal with it in two parts.",
        "First of all, when you start talking about scandals in the ministry, we go back 10 and 20 years to bring up names.",
        "What other occupation can only name a couple of names that have had scandals?",
        "You know, when you start talking about journalists or countless names of people who've had scandals, physicians, politicians, any walk of life we have people who have had scandals.",
        "That does not negate the fact that there are many sincere physicians, journalists, and other people.",
        "And the ministry's no different from that.",
        "We certainly have the right to ask those questions and raise those issues.",
        "When you're dealing with the church that provides service to 30,000 people, just providing a facility for my congregation required quite a bit of money.",
        "If you're going to seat that many people you have to build a building.",
        "And we no longer live in the day where people would give you free wood and brick and block because you're building a church.",
        "They charge you the same thing that they would anybody else.",
        "And in order for our parishioners who give the money to have a place to worship, and be married, and be buried, you have to build a sanctuary that accommodates your congregation.",
        "When I had 30 members I built a church that would seat about a hundred people.",
        "When we grew bigger we had to raise more resources to accommodate that.",
