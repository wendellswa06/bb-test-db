        "Governor Christie in New Jersey vetoed a bill that had passed both houses in the state assembly, in the state legislature, and it passed by healthy margins.",
        "That had been vetoed.",
        "And a bill in Hawaii just died, and a bill in Nevada was essentially neutered, saying: We'll wait for the federal government to tell us whether it's legal or illegal - which is really odd.",
        "We're entering this really odd territory from a licensing-regulation standpoint, where you had state government - who traditionally license and regulate gambling in the United States - ceding this power to the federal government right now.",
        "And so it's in a really weird place in that front.",
        "And they're ceding it in part because some of the big gambling companies - MGM, Harrah's, Wynn - they all want a federal solution to online gambling and online poker, because it's easier to get a federal solution in terms of managing an online poker room.",
        "It's easier to build player liquidity if you can do it across multiple states or across an entire country, whereas doing a patchwork system, state by state, is very difficult.",
        "And some of those casino companies were involved with one of these online companies in a lobbying effort, and they ended that relationship last week, too.",
        "Yeah, they sure did.",
        "Steve Wynn was - and Wynn Resorts was involved with PokerStars.",
        "In fact, they were going to create a poker room onto his license and regulate it in the U.S., called pokerstarswynn.com.",
        "And that deal has been eliminated.",
        "They've withdrawn from that.",
        "And Full Tilt poker had a deal with Fertitta, which owns the Station Casinos out in Nevada, and that deal's been withdrawn, as well.",
        "And on the federal level, last year, Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, tried to attach a bill late in session, in the lame-duck session, to some must-pass legislation that would have legalized online poker.",
        "He didn't get a chance to do it.",
        "That was undercut by Obama signing off on some - President Obama signing off on negotiations over a tax bill.",
        "And that didn't go through, either.",
        "Well, Chris, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I was just going to ask you to come in, Melinda Sarafa."

        "I mean, we have quite a bit of legalized gambling in this country.",
        "We do.",
        "Essentially, the way it works it gambling is unlawful unless the state says it's okay, and the states have chosen to say that a lot of gambling is okay, as long as they are in charge of regulating it.",

        "The Wire Act is really the only one that prohibits transmission of bets or wagers across telephone lines.",
        "And the reason for that is it was a 1961 law that was passed as part of a package of anti-racketeering laws, and it was really focused on combating organized bookmaking.",

        "Now, this is the first major gathering of the GOP since the health care bill passed and became law.",

        "For over 10 years, this was going on with no success.",
        "And when you look at the alliances behind - when you look at the parties in support and in opposition to the various laws, it's very interesting, because you had land-based casinos, who were in favor of prohibiting online gaming...",

        "And what they've discovered, especially through the World Series of Poker and through online poker, is online gaming doesn't take away customers.",
        "What it does is it builds a new generation of people who are willing to come to casinos.",
        "And it's that change in thought process and that realization that they're building a new generation of gamblers, especially as they see their own customer base age, that's what's changed the argument here in United States.",
