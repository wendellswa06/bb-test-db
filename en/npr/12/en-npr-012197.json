        "But as Melinda Sarafa was saying earlier, it depends on how the states define games of chance and the element that chance plays in it, and I guess that's a debatable issue.",
        "But I wonder, Melinda Sarafa, if you think that the litigation that's going to surround these charges may involve attempts to extradite people who are in the Isle of Man or in Ireland or various places, if that's going to clarify these issues.",
        "Well, the real hammer in this indictment is the bank fraud charge.",
        "And that will probably be the way that if the United States chooses to pursue extradition, they'll probably focus on that, because they won't be able to extradite for violation of a law that - for the gaming violation because that's illegal in the jurisdictions where these individuals are operating."

        "Because the fact is, and he didn't say this I'm saying this to you, the fact is that the surge is about a two-year solution, just enough time for the President to complete his term in office and to leave the problem to be resolved by his successor.",
        "I don't say that that's his purpose; it's just that's the way that the numbers work out.",
