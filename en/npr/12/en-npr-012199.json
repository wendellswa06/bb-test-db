        "I couldn't fit more than one in my apartment, and hence there's the disconnect between user reviews and major, major reviewing association like Consumer Reports.",
        "They've got the resources to do that kind of comparison on those really big items.",
        "They also have a brand-name identity, and they work hard to retain their integrity.",
        "But brand names, are brand names any guide to reliability?",
        "Sometimes.",
        "Lots of magazines do reliability surveys when it comes to brands, but a lot of times, you don't really know who the manufacturer is behind the brand.",
        "Ah.",
        "Many people, for example, think that Sears makes a wide variety of Kenmore products.",

        "I know that some of the, you know, affiliated ones, may have a problem with a conflict of interest, but I guess I take things like Consumer Reports sometimes with a grain of salt because, you know, they don't have the ability to do long, like I said, long-term testing, whereas I see stuff that's out there for five, 10, 15, 20 years.",
