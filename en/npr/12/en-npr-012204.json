        "Right.",
        "A lot of people were giggling about this scandal, thinking it's very cute and very funny, but ultimately, it's about sexual harassment.",
        "Many male members of Massa's staff said that they were touched, or they were sexually propositioned by the congressman, and the question, as was the same question that we've asked of Republicans in 2006 with Tom Foley, that scandal in Florida, what members of the House leadership, Democratic leadership, knew about this, and if they knew about it early, what did they do about it?",
        "And by the way, we found a copy of Ken Rudin's tech rider in our garbage here at TALK OF THE NATION, and it turns out he does require a Learjet and bendy straws.",
        "Well, this is so strange.",
        "I mean, there's an institute, a college, the college system in California, of course, is suffering financially, and apparently, there were some negotiations going on to get Sarah Palin to speak there.",
        "Among the things she demanded were bendable straws.",
        "Bendable straws.",
        "It's not quite the case of Southern Comfort that some rock musicians demanded, but nevertheless.",
        "We'll talk more with Ken Rudin when we come back from a short break, and we'll focus on a who's who of the Republican Party that descended on New Orleans last week to talk about the future of the GOP.",
