        "The question has been as whether or not our president is a socialist.",
        "And I'm sure there are some people who believe it, and I know this conference has talked about that already, and I think it's very important, and he deserves a lot of criticism.",
        "But, you know, in the technical sense, in the economic definition of what a socialist no, he's not a socialist.",
        "What he is what he is, is a corporatist, and unfortunately, we have corporatists in the Republican Party.",
        "And that means you take care of corporations, and corporations take over and run the country.",
        "And as you mentioned, he came within a vote on the straw poll, but you could hear those remarks sticking in a few people's craws.",
        "And throughout his speech, you would hear the occasional shout-out in opposition from the audience.",
        "And he would just get kind of sly smile in the corner of his mouth, knowing that he had riled them up, and he would plow forward.",
        "I mean, those are his favorite moments.",
        "You can tell.",
        "Ron Paul also asked the audience if they'd ever heard of a place called Kyrgyzstan.",
        "There was a revolution over there.",
        "Why was it important?",
