        "Why don't you just tell me here, because the first one talks about families helping each other, supporting the community.",
        "The other talks about every family and home being protected, Similar language, but not identical.",
        "Right.",
        "So what Winterich is finding is that when a charitable organization focuses its language on what's of importance to the community and stresses values and traditions, that kind of message appeals more to conservatives.",
        "When the message is focused more on everyone has equal rights, every family deserves to be protected, that's a message that appeals more to liberals.",
        "Oh, here's the language.",
        "OK, Ocean County has had a long-standing tradition of families helping each other.",
        "That's the conservative pitch.",
        "And making sure every family and every home is protected in the event of a fire, that appeals - or is designed to appeal, anyway - a little more to liberals.",
