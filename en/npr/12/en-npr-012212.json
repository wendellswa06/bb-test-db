        "But does this change anything?",
        "Well, so what is at stake here, it seems to me, and why this is an important civil war that's going on within the Republican ranks is that while it is true that there are moral failings on all sides, the Republican Party used to be a party that claimed to believe that character was important, that character mattered.",
        "They said that again and again in the Clinton scandals, and for them now to suddenly completely abandon that standard even paying tribute of the hypocrisy is the tribute the vice pays to virtue famously.",
        "We've even abandoned that.",
        "We don't even have the decency to be hypocrites here.",
        "We just simply have so many Republicans, not all but so many Republicans have simply said, no, that whole character thing - never mind.",
        "It really doesn't matter at all.",
        "And that's a huge loss for the country.",
        "What should happen now, Mona, though?",
        "If you were a person who - let's say you're like Gayle and you think that the Supreme Court, for example, you know - selecting a justice who is going to follow in his footsteps of (unintelligible) is the most important thing because that affects not just the president, but the future.",
        "Sure.",
        "What do you do?",
        "Well, everything a president does is going to affect the future.",
        "There are things that President Obama has done that are undoable, such as the mess he has made of Syria and the deal with Iran that cannot be just simply waved away with the stroke of a pen.",
        "So every act that a president takes has long-term consequences, not just the court.",
        "But to believe that, first of all, that the court is the only important thing, I think, is to miss the larger damage that Trump could do on many other fronts.",
        "But further, he's not trustworthy.",
        "The notion that you can believe that he's going to appoint people that are acceptable to conservatives is a prayerful wish, but it may not come true at all.",
        "There's no reason to believe him.",
        "He's so dishonest.",

        "Well, you know, Danielle, let me go to you on this - and can I just bring up another issue along with this?",
        "Which is that we mentioned that Donald Trump has apologized for his statements about women.",
        "But another thing that happened this week that he certainly - most certainly has not apologized for is that he made new comments about the Central Park Five.",
        "Now, this was a case involving a group of five young men who were convicted of raping a woman in New York Central Park in 1989 - terrible story.",
        "The men were later cleared after DNA evidence proved they were innocent.",

        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "I mean, this just kind of - it's not so much that it's different in responses.",
        "I feel like in one case he was compelled to have to say what he had to say because the controversy had blown up so big around what he had been saying around women.",
        "But I feel like the Central Park Five case shows how he actually really feels about things, that he's unrepentant, like he may have said, you know, that he apologizes for what he said on that videotape.",

        "But does he actually mean that apology?",
        "Like he looked so angry, and the fact that he can't admit that he's wrong with Central Park Five and they've been exonerated when the real, you know, man who abused and brutalized that woman came forward when the city of New York paid over $40 million to the Central Park Five for them being basically railroaded and coerced into confessing to a crime that they did not commit, and the fact that he can't see that he's wrong - when he paid the money to pull out a full-page ad, you know - when he added to the incendiary and the racially-charged atmosphere - I mean, it's just appalling.",
        "This is who he actually truly is.",
        "He is a unrepented person who says out-of-pocket things, who doesn't want to take accountability for what he says and what, you know, what kind of chaos he causes and it's just, you know - it's just disgusting.",
        "Well, kind of hard to switch gears after that, but I will try because there is one other issue that I did want to raise with you which is that these WikiLeaks emails - that were released by WikiLeaks linked to Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta.",
        "The Clinton campaign has not verified their authenticity.",
        "They include excerpts of Clinton's past speeches to Wall Street firms.",
        "This all happened on the same day as the Trump video came out and just - in the time that we have left, you know, I apologize for making that hard turn from something that is actually profoundly emotional and affects a lot of people's lives and has really affected these young men's lives to this day, but I do feel it's fair to raise this other issue.",
        "Mona, do you want to start on it?",
        "It's a funny year because the revelations in these emails about what Hillary spoke to Wall Street firms about - would be considered sort of mainstream, centrist Republican views, you know, on free trade and immigration and so forth.",
        "It's only this year that they are - first of all, they're out of step with the Democratic Party which has moved significantly to the left on these issues with Bernie Sanders, and they're out of step with the Republican Party which likewise has moved to the left, considerably, on these very same issues led by Mr. Trump.",
        "Gayle, what do you think about it?",
        "Well, the bottom line of this story is that Hillary Clinton said favorable things about banking to bankers, so it's really a non-event.",
        "And I don't think that this WikiLeaks story is going to change anyone who supported Hillary prior to this from not supporting her.",
        "And I think the same is true with this tape of Donald yesterday, that no one who supported Trump previously - who truly supported - now, we have a lot of Republicans in Washington, D.C., who are elected officials who are backing away from him now, but I would argue that they weren't with him at the beginning.",
        "But it does matter though doesn't it?",
        "You don't think that these elected officials - because elected officials have things like organizations.",
        "Right, right, right.",
