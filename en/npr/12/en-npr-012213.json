        "Contractors setting up for the Cruze and good lunch specials kept her going throughout Lordstown's summer shutdown.",

        "For one view on Mr. Obama's choice, we called Michael Pollan.",
        "He's a leader in the sustainable food and agriculture movement, and he recently published an open letter to Mr. Obama, suggesting the Department of Agriculture be renamed the Department of Food.",
        "Well, the basic premise of the article was that, you know, you're not going to make progress as a president on climate change, energy independence, or the health care crisis unless you address the food system because the food system is responsible for about a third of greenhouse gases.",
        "It is responsible for the catastrophic American diet that is leading 50 percent of us to suffer from chronic disease, and that drives up health care costs.",
        "So I was arguing for, yeah, making it a Department of Food, a secretary of food, and focus more on growing real food, diversifying our farms, re-localizing the food system, in order to address all those problems at once.",

        "Well, I was very disappointed in that news conference not to hear Vilsack use the word \"\"food\"\" or \"\"eaters\"\" and that the interests of everybody except eaters was discussed: farmers, ranchers, people concerned about the land.",

        "Although, talking about making a great transformation in our farming industry, do you think it would be smart, even if it was possible, given that it would drive up the cost of food?",
        "Well, I think the first point you have to keep in mind is what has driven up the cost of food this year.",
        "It's the embrace of corn-based ethanol that has driven up all food prices.",

        "Vilsack has been a supporter of corn-based ethanol.",
        "I think what's interesting to watch, though, is that the new secretary of energy, Steven Chu, is a pretty fierce critic of corn-based ethanol.",
        "You have a Nobel Prize winner explain to you why it's a bad idea and I would imagine will be arguing for moving away from corn as a feedstock for ethanol toward other crops.",
        "And hopefully those crops will not compete with food crops.",
        "So the challenge is to move to things like crop waste - you know, trees, grasses that don't compete with food.",
