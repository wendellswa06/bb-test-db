        "But that would mean doing something that's never been done before - making changes in human DNA - changes that would be passed down for generations and deliberately creating babies with genes from three different people.",
        "To find out more, I spent some time with the scientists at Newcastle.",

        "In most families, it is a devastating illness.",
        "These mitochondrial illnesses are caused by defects in a very specific kind of DNA.",
        "This DNA is very different from the DNA that we all hear about.",
        "That DNA is in the nucleus of the cells, that thing right in the middle, like the yolk in an egg, the tens of thousands of genes that help make us who we are - the color of our eyes or hair, the shape of our noses, how tall or smart we are.",
        "The kind of DNA that causes these disorders is tiny, just 37 genes, and it's in a totally different part of the cell called mitochondria",
        "Mitochondria are like little power stations, present in all our cells.",
        "Power stations that provide the energy that cells need, and if the mitochondrial DNA is defective, the cells don't work right.",
        "So these are diseases where, in effect, the cells run out of energy.",
        "Mitochondrial DNA is only passed down from women to their babies through their eggs.",
        "So replacing defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA could fix this.",

        "That's where Irving does the DNA transplants.",
        "It's like microsurgery.",
        "First, she carefully grabs the egg with the defective mitochondrial DNA with the tip of a long, thin glass tube so she can hold it very still.",
        "We need to make sure that the egg it doesn't spin.",
        "Next, Irving pierces the shell with the laser so she can pull out the regular DNA from the nucleus of the cell, leaving the defective mitochondrial DNA behind.",

        "You need to be careful as this could just contain the DNA which could quite form a child.",
        "It's quite precious material really, so I think you do need to remember and kind of keep a steady set of mind when you perform the procedure.",
        "And the result is an embryo with healthy mitochondrial DNA of the donor and regular DNA of the mother and the father.",
        "If the Newcastle scientists get the green light, they transfer an embryo made this way into the womb of a woman trying to have a healthy baby.",
        "But the idea of scientists manipulating a human being's DNA like this has triggered an intense debate.",

        "For lots of reasons.",
        "One big worry is that scientists could make some kind of mistake - a mistake that could create new health problems that would then be passed down for generations.",
        "And critics like King say allowing scientists to tinker with human DNA for a medical reason could open the door for doing this kind of thing for other reasons.",
        "That's something that could potentially lead to this future of designer babies and consumer eugenics, whereby people would be able to purchase, for their children, sort of genetic enhancements and certain characteristics like athletic ability or intelligence.",
        "That's the future, that if we get into it, it will be absolutely socially disastrous throughout society as a whole.",
        "But that's not all he objects to.",
