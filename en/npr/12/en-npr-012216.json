        "Think of it as kind of energy bars.",

        "Does the U.S.",
        "send ships loaded with rice?",
        "It's a combination of things.",
        "There are ships, actually, on there way from Sri Lanka to the Philippines right now.",
        "They're carrying Rice that was grown here in the U.S.",
        "that was pre-positioned in warehouses in Sri Lanka.",
        "But the bigger part of the total is in cash.",
        "They're using that cash to buy food, like rice, in the Philippines or neighboring countries, and send it to where it's needed.",
        "But that's not typical, right?",
        "I mean, doesn't most U.S.",
        "emergency aid - and also, non-emergency aid - doesn't that get shipped directly from the U.S.?",
        "That's exactly right, in general.",

        "You can get food more quickly.",
        "But second, there's a lot of rice available for sale in the Philippines and relatively close by, like, in Thailand.",

        "has available to buy food.",
        "So how did it happen that there is this cash left over for the Philippines?",

        "There's probably plenty available for what is required for the Philippines.",
        "But that leaves less for later in the year for similar disasters.",
        "And, Dan, what are the chances that Congress will change the rules and make more food aid available as cash, as some propose that it do?",
        "There are not going to be any drastic changes right away.",
        "The rules for this program are set in the Farm Bill, which is actually being negotiated on Capitol Hill, as we speak.",
        "And there was a push to change the rules and make more food ale available as cash, but it ran into strong political opposition.",
        "There was a lobbying effort by people who actually earn money from the program as it stands - farmers and also the shippers who send the food aid abroad.",
        "The House kept the program exactly as it has been.",
        "The Senate increased the amount of cash for food aid by about $45 million each year.",
        "The two sides are now negotiating.",
