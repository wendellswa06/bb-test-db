        "Are African-Americans being heard, you think, Jamal?",
        "Well, you know, in Iowa, that's not really what candidates go to Iowa to campaign on.",
        "It's about 2.3 percent of the population in Iowa is African-American, and I think there's a concerted effort - at least on the Democratic side of the aisle in the primaries - to get those voters out and get them to vote.",
        "But clearly, they're campaigning among the 95, 97 percent of the population which is not African-American.",
        "I think in a Democratic process, that's why we added in states like South Carolina, which will go on the 26th of February and in Nevada which will go on the 19th of February, the week before South Carolina, because we want Hispanics and African-Americans to participate in a greater way in helping to choose the president.",
        "Angela, what are you looking for this caucus to decide?",
        "And I don't mean in terms of candidates, but in terms of, you know, maybe pointing to certain issues that people care about.",

        "In New York City, you have 45 percent black males that are unemployed.",
        "You are having higher incarceration rates.",
        "And I think there are certain issues that impact the inner city, the Hispanic community, and the black community more so than your white community.",
        "But looking at Iowa, it is the first start of the presidential election.",
        "And I think that it's very important.",
        "But I think, too, what is happening in the black community in Iowa represents a lot of inner city communities.",
        "And on this point, I think, Angela, is headed in the right direction.",
        "If you look at the Democratic side of the aisle, the issues that are really important are issues of the war in Iraq, the economy, health care.",
        "Those are the things that voters want to hear and talk about a little bit more than the Republican side where you see immigration and some of the other, abortion, and some of the other social issues that are still quite weighing in higher.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Jamal, I have to disagree with you on one thing.",
        "The reason why blacks voted for Bush in 2004, it wasn't because of health care.",
        "It was because of the sanctity of marriage and the abortion issue.",
