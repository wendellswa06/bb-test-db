        "It's not that I'm not grateful for your kind words about me, but my campaign advisers have been telling me that being linked to you might not necessarily help me with some groups.",
        "As you, yourself, told Chris Wallace, some animosity is probably directed against you.",
        "To put it bluntly, Mr. President, a lot of people right of you and left of you don't think well of you.",
        "And so, your praise might be counterproductive.",

        "But for now, could I ask you to cool it on publicly supporting me?",

        "Remember Mason, the toddler that was about to be adopted by the Buckley family when his great uncle in the Choctaw Natio intervened.",
        "In the end, Mason did end up with the Buckleys.",
        "Why - because the Indian Child Welfare Act allows the courts wiggle room if it's judged to be in the child's best interest.",
        "And in this case, the lateness of the intervention plus Mason's long relationship with the only family he'd ever really known decided it for the Buckleys.",
