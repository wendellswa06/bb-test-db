        "I think Hillary was right and also that things have changed.",
        "But the fact that the media treated her in very sexist ways, and there were these really awful kind of attacks on her - you know, the nutcracker and the cackle and all that nonsense - voters see through that.",
        "And I think maybe the media will be thinking a little bit more carefully about how they portray women candidates, now that women are so active on social media in calling out retrograde nonsense.",

        "OK.",
        "Well, let's dig into the last two points.",
        "The first one is that women aren't running for office because they don't want to.",
        "There's a lack of political ambition, in general, among women, for whatever reason.",
        "The evidence is as women and particularly teenage girls start seeing more women in office, they get a jolt of political ambition.",
        "So the solution is for more women to run so that more teenage girls have the desire to run when they're adults.",
        "And what about the final argument that you take on that the way that this political system is structured is kind of rigged against women?",
        "The United States has a winner-take-all system.",
        "What that means is that incumbents are very powerful.",
        "So looking at U.S.",
        "history as a whole, 11,813 men have served in Congress, and 294 for women have served in Congress.",

        "While Mexico's other lime producing states were hit hard by bad weather and a fungal outbreak, the orchards here have been flourishing, netting record profits for Michoacan's farmers.",

        "Last week the USDA said consumers paid on average 30 cents a lime, compared to 90 a few months ago.",

        "Most are still enjoying their record profits and the biggest boon.",
        "This is the first time in a decade many say they haven't been at the mercy of Mexico's ruthless drug cartels.",
