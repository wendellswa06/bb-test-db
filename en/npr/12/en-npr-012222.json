        "Well, first of all, Donald Trump has many things about him that I don't particularly like.",
        "Like what?",
        "Tell me what you don't like.",
        "Well, I don't like the way he treated Fiorina about her face.",
        "I don't like some of the language he uses occasionally, and he comes across often as an arrogant elitist.",
        "But Trump has been successful.",
        "You can't take that away from him.",
        "He is an outsider, which we all need for sure.",
        "And he does speak to the three big issues that I think will destroy our country unless we do something about them, and he is the only one who promises to do something.",
        "Now, will he do it?",
        "I don't know.",
        "But if we don't find someone who at least says they will do it, then we don't have a chance.",
        "And you don't think Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or John Kasich is making that argument?",
        "Well, to some degree - I like Cruz.",
        "I think he comes in second, but I do not think Rubio is - I think he's a lightweight.",
        "He's very glib, very smart, very inexperienced and has not accomplished much in his life except get elected to office.",
        "Kasich is a nice guy, but he is not - I'm off the board with him regarding illegal immigration.",
        "To me, the illegal immigration is the biggest problem that our country faces.",
        "It will destroy this country and our culture, and we must do something about it.",
        "You think Donald Trump can actually fulfill his promise to deport 11 million illegal immigrants?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I think that it's unfair to ask him all the details about it.",
        "But the fact that somebody says - I will do it if I get in office.",
        "I'll find the people to help me, and I will build a wall.",
        "All those things can be done if we have the resolve to do it.",
        "And if we don't have the resolve to do it, let's just fold our tent and forget that we're a country and become a Greece.",
        "How are you making the case to your friends and family who are still not sold on Donald Trump as the guy who should be the Republican nominee?",
        "Exactly the way I'm making it to you now, and I'm not convincing all of them.",
        "But I feel very confident that I'm correct.",
        "I will tell you this, though.",
        "Trump is redefining the Republican Party.",
        "And for conservatives like me, once this thing is redefined, we may not be so happy with it.",
        "I'm not sure of that.",
        "I'm very - a strong - a social conservative.",
        "I don't believe Trump is.",
        "But social conservatism can be put on hold for four years.",
        "Doing something about illegal immigration, security of our country, building up our military, doing something about our national debt and the jobs - that can't wait.",
        "Otherwise, nothing else matters.",
        "So what do you think of the idea of a brokered convention?",
        "I mean, if Donald Trump doesn't garner the number of delegates he needs and it does go to some kind of brokered situation where delegates could ignore the popular vote and vote against Donald Trump, how would you feel about that?"

        "I asked them if they had looked at alternatives in the United States, looked at them, and the answer was no. I was surprised that they hadn't looked at Fort Leavenworth and other places to build a courthouse to bring these people over, to keep them in secure custody, to try them.",
        "Jeff, you already have a situation where - although, we're not on the nicest terms with Cuba, we do have access to this little bit of real estate where we're keeping these prisoners.",

        "Well, I think it's a bit of a difficult process to do that.",

        "But I think that overall to spend $100 million or to direct $100 million, or even to attempt to in this time, it screams misdirected priorities.",
        "And I think that's evidenced by the bipartisan shock and awe at the mention of such governmental waste.",
        "You're talking about trying 60 defendants at $1.6 million per defendant and building something that has 1,200 beds, dining facilities for 800 people and a garage for 100 vehicles.",
        "And you sit and say, really, what is this all about?",
        "And considering the PR campaign that was recently launched by the Pentagon and some of the priorities that are coming out of there, I wonder if perhaps this was just an attempt to really build a $50 million courthouse and have people be in shock at the 100 and say we can't spend that much but maybe we can get 50.",

        "Well, I think that obviously there is an awful lot of money being spent on what would seem to be a relatively small, although very important target.",
        "And I suppose that's an old story, the government is very good at wasting money.",
