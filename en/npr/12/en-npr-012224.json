        "Tased, OK, - for having not really done anything.",
        "But he had the prominence to bring attention to this issue, and that's why Houston is now debating on this.",
        "It's worth debating.",
        "You know what worries me about this whole issue, though, is that we have to be vigilant and, yes, we do have to be vigilant about the issue of the intersection between race and police forces.",
        "But we also have to allow very inconvenient thing about life as a human being on this Earth interacting with others, is that there will be screw-ups and accidents and they will happen to black people.",
        "And the reason that I'm mentioning that is because in Houston we have to remember that everybody here is human.",
        "You know, we can't be so pessimistic as to pretend that it's still Bull Connor and teenage protesters being fire-hosed on the street.",
        "The police officers in this case are people who go home.",
        "They have spouses that love them.",
        "They have dogs.",
        "They have beds.",
        "They have mortgages.",
        "I hope they have cats.",
        "And well, actually, yeah, like we do.",
        "But if you talk to those officers in Houston, it has to be taken into account and thought of as equally as important as what happened to this individual who is making so much news because he is famous, which is that there were 700 assaults on the police over the past two years - that is 700 days in Houston.",
        "And also, over 30 officers in less than that time have been either fired or disciplined or reeducated based on the fact that accidents have happened.",
        "So there are definitely two sides to this one, and I'm not sure we have the evidence yet to say that black men and Latino men are being Tased more just because of the color of their skin.",
        "It's more complicated than that in terms of who is doing what when and in what way, and what the appropriate response might be.",
        "I want to jump in and tell everybody who we are talking to.",
        "This is, of course, NEWS & NOTES from NPR.",
        "I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "And we are speaking with John McWhorter, who we' just heard, Manhattan Institute senior fellow in public policy; E.R.",
        "Shipp, professor in journalism at Hofstra University School of Communication; and Jeff Obafemi Carr, host of the radio show \"Freestyle\" in Nashville, Tennessee.",

        "Cowher, the coach, has been given just a few days to give up the information one way or the other if he is going to retire or stick around.",
        "What do you think is going to happen?",
        "I want to - I weigh in to say that I would definitely I would not like to be on the end - the other end of a bullet or a Taser.",
        "This kind of issue has come up all over the place.",
        "It even came up here in Nashville, several months ago, and members of the African-American and the Latino community came together and had a study on - they wanted a study done on Tasers.",
        "And what ends up happening in many cities is that you find that the largest percentage in, I think, in Houston, I think there were 63 percent of the people that were Tased or Taserized or however we will say, were African-Americans.",
        "Here, the largest percentage of them were also black which really doesn't bother people who think when many of the criminals are black which is more a mentality than a statistic.",
        "I think the issue is how do you preserve, how do you walk that line?",
        "Will you preserve the officer's life and his safety, but also the life and safety of the person who is a victim of this kind of attack and how do you fairly make a choice in a situation where the stakes are extremely high, and there is danger present.",
        "So I think that Fred Weary brought this to mind because, only because he's a professional football player.",
        "And that big cat got out of that car and obviously there was a little fear there.",
        "And because of his fame, now this is front and center, but I think they're also talking about the Taser cameras, guns with Taser cameras in them, so that you can see and hear what's going on at the time.",
        "And who knows, perhaps that will make the issue a little easier.",
        "Want to connect this to the issue of what's being called stealth racism, because of so much of this, including what we talked about earlier today in Long Beach, is about perception and how people are perceived when they are alleged to have committed a crime or have committed a crime or sometimes when they're just walking down the street.",
        "The Reverend Nelson Rivers, chief operating officer of the NAACP, said white Americans have an absolute blind spot when it comes to admitting racism in societies - an obstacle for African-Americans.",
        "He was commenting on a poll done by Opinion Research Corporation this month.",
        "It showed that blacks and whites have different views on the impact that racism has in the modern day.",
        "And Reverend Rivers went on to say racism requires accountability.",
        "No one wants to acknowledge they're racists or have benefited from a racial system."

        "But Michael Masi, who's chairman of a black conservative group called Project 21, said many people have a raw visceral contempt for whites, and they are much more vocal than what I hear or experience from whites.",
        "He's talking about African-Americans there.",
        "How do you balance these statements by these two men?",
        "Is there such a thing as balancing them or are we doomed to live in worlds where we have very different perceptions of what reality is?",

        "Well, let's try this.",
        "White Americans do not want to admit that racism is a problem or that they've benefited from white privilege.",

        "What it's going to do for you?",
        "How is it going to change your life?",
        "It's a kind of performance that that sort of thing goes for.",
        "And the polling and what people's visceral opinions are, it seems to me that we really need to be having conversations about more urgent things, such as the fact that when you talk about the Tasing, to go briefly back to that - the unfortunate fact is that in many situations at many points in time in America, black men have committed almost half of violent crimes despite obviously constituting a much smaller percent of the population.",
        "That's a problem.",
        "Now, one problem might be police officers' overreaction.",
        "But just as important to me is what are we going to do about our community so that people don't wind up having to expose themselves to those manifestations of racism.",
        "I just think that for one thing, it's extremely controversial in 2006, that racism is an obstacle to success.",
        "That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.",
        "But is it an obstacle and could you look to your grandfather in the eye and really say that the obstacle you face is worth devoting whole radio and television shows about.",
        "And second is the fact that really in the grand scheme of things, okay, they're going to be these biases.",
        "But there are terrible things going on in the country, terrible things going on in the world.",
        "And it's at a point where to me, the whole issue of stealth racism which is a brilliant new term - I like that - is more a matter of kind of getting people a flutter when the new cycle of getting a little slow then really thinking about what serious injustice is in the real world as we know it.",
        "Before we move on, though, John, I just throw out one recent study that showed that if you have a black man and a white man, young men, who were going out as part of a study to apply for jobs.",
        "The black man with no criminal record will have a harder time than finding a job than a white man with a felony record.",

        "Raise your hand.",

        "But what was really intriguing is this notion of a truth in and reconciliation commission, where white people would admit guilt and black people would asked to forgive them.",
        "I think that's too simplistic because it doesn't even look at what's really going on as John was saying.",
