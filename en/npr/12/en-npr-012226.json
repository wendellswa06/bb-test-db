        "And, of course, you'd be wrong.",
        "According to my next guest, we know surprisingly little about these common natural phenomena.",
        "We don't even know what causes it to happen.",
        "Wow, lightning is hard to study because, you know, you don't know where it's going to hit, so you can't set up your equipment to catch it in action.",
        "Maybe you go to the top of the Empire State Building or something like that.",
        "But that's not pretty practical to that.",

        "So you can get lighting to strike twice.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, lightning frequently hits the same thing twice.",
        "The Empire State Building, as you mentioned, is usually hit about 20 times a year, in fact.",
        "Now, why, why don't we know so much about lightning?",
        "I mean, we've been studying it - certainly, even before Ben Franklin, people are wondering about it, but he was a pretty good scientist.",
        "Why does it - what is it so hard to know about what - why lightning occurs?",
        "Well, you've mentioned, part of the problem, even though we get a lot of lightning in some places, like here in Florida, we don't know exactly when or where it's going to strike, and so we don't know where to point our instrument.",
        "Another problem is a lot of the action happens up inside the thunder clouds.",
        "That's where lightning gets started.",
        "A lot of the interesting physics is going on up there.",
        "And it's very difficult to make measurements inside the thunderstorm.",
        "They're big dangerous places.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so you've developed a way of making your own lightning.",
        "Well, I didn't develop it myself, but we use it working with colleagues at the University of Florida.",
        "We have small rockets that we have a spool of copper wire in the bottom.",
        "And when there's a thunderstorm overhead, which in Florida, we don't have to wait too long for that in a sign.",
        "And we have a thunderstorm overhead.",
        "We know lightning is going to strike some place.",
        "And so, if it's going to strike any way, why not strike here now?",
        "Launch this rocket - as it flies up in the air, wire comes off the end of the spool, and we create maybe a 200-yard-long lightning rod very quickly.",
        "And that's usually enough to cause lightning, so we can bring it down to where we want it and we can make measurements.",
        "You're basically doing the exact the same thing that Ben Franklin did.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a similar idea.",
        "You do an experiment and then you do measurements, and you learn things about lightning.",
        "And Benjamin Franklin established that lightning was an electrical phenomenon.",
        "It turns out there is a lot we don't know, even in the 250 years since this kite experiment.",

        "It is the ice and the water particles bumping into each other that separates the charge.",
