        "Then there were questions about the president's own credibility with the American people - how he once spoke of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that were never found and how he has more recently been discussing another crisis scenario with regard to Iran.",
        "So is there a credibility gap he was asked, the president said no, that he was feeling spirited and good about life and that nothing in this new intelligence report had changed his opinion about his approach to Iran.",

        "The bill also calls for increased federal oversight, something critics say has been lacking.",
        "This morning, I sat down with Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings.",
        "She says she's been working to clean up the student loan industry for the last two years, and she says that not all lenders fall within her jurisdiction.",
        "People need to understand that, particularly, since costs have grown so dramatically, there's been such a demand for true private loans, which look more like regular consumer loans, like a car loan or a home equity loan or other sorts of financing systems, and those are completely outside of the jurisdiction of this department.",
        "That - those jurisdictions are with the SEC and the FTC and the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, and that's why I have taken it upon myself to convene the leaders of those organizations so that we can get a more holistic view of enforcement around this issue.",
        "With the growing reliance, though, on private loans - why not push for more oversight in that area?",
        "Or at least raise a hand at some point and say, you know - we no longer have control or oversight of these industries and so many of these loans are now private.",
        "Well, that's one of the things that I think we need to look at carefully because there's, you know, a myriad of laws that may or may not be vigorous enough or are on target enough.",
        "And, you know, I think anytime you have a lot of jurisdictional oversight and overlap, there's the potentiality for confusion on the part of the institution and possibly some slippage with respect to the borrower.",
        "And I think that's - this is what we call in education, a teachable moment, a chance for us to look again, particularly in light of these changing dynamics of rapidly increasing costs, a lack of transparency and information, and a high level of demand for higher education."
