        "You know, if you're - first of all, being inside the house is a good thing if there's a thunderstorm.",

        "I mean, there are - the plumbing, for example - lightning -even though maybe the metal pipes don't necessarily connect to the outside world directly - maybe there's plastic pipes in the middle.",
        "But, lightning can come in, say, on the phone line and then spark to the pipes, and then the pipes can spark to you.",
        "Ooh."

        "It's emitting the light just like the sun is emitting light.",
