        "Yeah, a lot of people think that it's somehow, this lightning, is just made from the atmosphere, from the heat, but that's not true.",
        "It's actually just normal lightning that's occurring in thunderstorms that are too far away to hear the thunder.",
        "So, you know, you have a thunderstorm maybe 20 miles away, you can still see the lightning, but thunder can't travel that far.",
        "Especially, heat lightning refers to inter-cloud lightning, lightning that lights up the clouds.",
        "So it's just normal lightning - you're just seeing it from a different perspective.",

        "And I was just wondering if you're expert had an opinion about whether or not they were effective.",

        "Okay, well, you're smart to be more afraid of lightning than tornadoes because actually lightning kills more people in the United States, on average, than tornadoes.",
        "And about lightning rods - yes, absolutely.",
        "Lightning rods are a good idea.",
        "They will protect your home or that will protect structures.",
        "And nothing is 100 percent, but they are a significant improvement.",
        "Do they draw the electricity out of the atmosphere before it forms a lightning bolt?",
        "Like, suck it off beforehand, so that the lightning bolt doesn't strike?",
        "Actually, the way it works is that as the lightning is coming down, it's getting ready to strike something on the ground.",
        "And if it's going to strike the area - your house or the area around it, there's nothing you really can do to divert that.",
        "But what you can do is that it's going to strike your house anyway, you can give it a safe place to strike.",
        "And the idea is the lightning rods, really tall and pointing.",
        "It's kind of like, you know, when you walk up to a door know after walking across the carpet, your finger comes to the door knob, you get a spark.",
        "You know, your finger is long and pointy.",
        "And so the - you get the spark that readies us up to catch the lightning coming of the lightning rod and not off your chimney, say.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And the pointy part is important then?",
        "Yeah, the idea is you want to build up to concentrate the charges on the tip and build up the field to get the spark.",
        "And then, of course, if you want to safely divert the current down to the ground and not through your electronics or your wiring or your plumbing.",
        "So you really enjoy watching electrical storms?"

        "College football has resisted the change - until now.",
