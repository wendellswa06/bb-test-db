        "Missouri is among a growing number of states where lawmakers have passed bans on abortion early in pregnancy.",
        "The law is one of several currently tied up in legal challenges, and the issue is likely to end up before the Supreme Court.",

        "Some states prohibit self-inducing, but Ziegler says prosecutors often have been reluctant to press charges.",
