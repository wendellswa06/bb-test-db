        "Now, most days Dove spends her time investigating the remains of birds who've died in very different circumstances: birds who've crashed into airplanes, like the flock of starlings that brought down a flight off of Boston Harbor back in 1960.",
        "The crash destroyed the plane and killed most of its passengers.",
        "After the Boston crash, the airline industry started to get really interested in birds that are causing damage to airplanes.",
        "Most bird strikes don't cause crashes, but it's still really important to know what species was involved, so you can change flight paths or alter the airport environment or design stronger aircraft engines.",

        "So they went out to Bagram Air Base and started looking for black kites.",
        "One of the things we discovered was that trash disposal at the base was in a spot that brought the birds closer to the runway and to the flight path of the jets.",
        "Once the trash was removed, the birds disappeared.",
        "One of the reasons Dove is able to identify birds from anywhere in the world is because the Smithsonian Museum has a massive collection of birds.",
