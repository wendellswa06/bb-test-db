        "OK.",
        "Thank you, Debbie.",
        "Well, I guess you could say, if you want to look at it that way, it's somewhat weaker than it was originally, because there are these new guidelines or provisions that are written into it.",
        "But from the civil liberty standpoints, of ACLU and many others, including quite a number of members of Congress, there's not enough, that these safeguards don't go far enough.",
        "So, really, as you said at the beginning of the show here, it's obviously a balancing act between security and civil liberties, and it's really where along that continuum, you know, the marker is going to be.",
        "And, in other words, you can't argue that the Patriot Act does not erode civil liberties.",
        "The question is whether it does so appropriately and necessarily.",
        "Precisely.",
        "And one man's appropriate is another man's inappropriate, perhaps.",
        "And that's what the whole debate has been about.",
        "And it got down to very, you know, a really handful of members, especially in the Senate, where as you know, you know, 40, or 41 members can, through a filibuster, keep the whole body from passing something.",
        "And that's what you had was holding it up in the Senate until this relative handful of Republican members led by John Sununu finally agreed to these terms that we've been talking about.",
        "And of course, that little group of Republicans that give the Democrats enough to, you know, hold up a filibuster, they have a lot of weight there because they're the swing votes.",
        "Exactly.",
        "At the same time, we have to point out that this was not just this group of Republican and Democratic Senators talking to the White House.",
        "There's another group involved here, the House of Representatives.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The House approved a bill that did not have some of these safeguards that we've talked about, or had them in a weaker form.",
        "And they feel, at least the leadership, those who support this bill, were somewhat unhappy in December when they thought that the Senate should've agreed to this and they were unhappy when the Senate did not, and insisted on these further, farther reaching safeguards.",
        "At that point they said we're not going to, we're going to agree to only a short term extension, and try to put more heat on the Senate to come closer to the House version.",
        "And probably in the end that succeeded.",
        "I think they were able to extract some more concessions from the holdout Senators than they originally might, it might've looked like they were going to get."

        "citizens, etc.",
        "And my question, I guess, really is, it seems as though many of the provisions in the Patriot Act, which was just renewed not long ago, have been broken by the administration.",
        "I'd just really like to get some thoughts on whether or not...",
        "What do you mean broken by the administration?",
        "It just seems to me as thought a lot of the laws that the legislature has been passing lately, when it grants access to the administration and the government in general, to access information about Americans, well, those laws seem to be bypassed.",
        "And we're currently dealing with hearings on that.",

        "Exactly.",

        "Charles Babington, does that come up at all?",
        "They are two different issues Neal.",
        "Although, just as Tiffany suggested, it's really hard to see them as entirely separate because in so many ways they do seem to overlap.",
        "In both cases, obviously, we're talking about trying to intercept communications involving terrorist suspects.",
        "That said, this larger, this newer issue of the recently revealed NSA surveillance program, which is going to be, is already the subject of some hearings and it's stirred up a lot of debate here, is sort of overshadowing almost, if you will, the Patriot Act extension.",
        "But they are two separate laws, two separate, the Patriot Act does not involve the FISA court.",
        "I guess what they maybe have in common is one difficulty that not only the average citizen has, but also a member of Congress has, is that it's hard to know exactly what is going on.",
        "And today, even members of Congress have a lot of questions because so much of this is secret.",
        "And it's not going to be talked about in an open meeting, even with, or even a closed meeting with a large number of members of Congress.",
        "Charles, uh, Tiffany, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let me ask you, when this New York Times report disclosing the NSA warrantless wiretapping came out, that was in the middle of the debate over the extension of the Patriot Act.",
        "There were even some who suggested that the Times may have been trying to affect that debate in the timing of the story, after all they had been sitting on it for a while.",
        "In the end, did this NSA story play a role in the debate over the Patriot Act?",
        "I think it did, Neal.",
        "That story broke really on the morning of the day that the Patriot Act renewal was scheduled for a vote in the Senate.",
        "I think it did play a role and I think it did make some lawmakers more concerned, more cautious.",
        "Looking at this in the larger picture, just as Tiffany suggested.",
        "It's hard to say exactly how it played out, but it was a very interesting timing and I think it did have some impact.",
        "Charles Babington, thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "Thanks for having me."
