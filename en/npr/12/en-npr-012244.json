        "Peter Swire, let me ask you about that.",
        "Yes, they did have a fair amount of intelligence, one of the things the Patriot Act does though is, as they say, break down those barriers so police information, FBI information, can be shared with intelligence agencies and vice versa.",
        "Yeah I think there did need to be some updating of the law.",
        "When I was in the White House, I chaired a multi agency working group on how to update the wire tap laws for the Internet age.",
        "That was 2000, the year before the attacks...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...and there were technical things that had to be changed and we proposed legislation that year that Congress didn't move on.",
        "So some things including some changes to FISA clearly were needed.",
        "The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
        "I'm sorry, I think it's a word, right.",
        "We all know that by now.",
        "And when you talked about updating information on wire taps, was the proposal close to the roving wire taps that were, in fact, installed by the Patriot Act?",
        "Well, roughly speaking, we had a certain set of proposals to increase surveillance and the Patriot Act doubled or tripled those.",
        "We also had provisions to update privacy protections to give e-mail the same protections you get for phone calls, but those got left out in the process in 2001.",
        "Mike?",
        "That was it Neal, thank you."

        "Shawn calling us from Las Vegas.",
        "I think we look for the person that is going to be best, and if they're the best, they're going to win.",
        "Hi, what's frustrating about this whole debate and all these powers that Congress are giving to the president is none of them seem to be talking about what happens one, if an American citizen is brought up on terrorism charges and those charges are dismissed because of the method of intelligence gathering, are these American citizens going to be taken into custody indefinitely as enemy combatants?",
        "And also, what happens if they find out during their intelligence gathering, through all these different powers, that somebody's about to say, rob a bank, steal a car, transport drugs into the United States?",
        "You know, nobody's talking about these basic civil liberties that we all have that don't relate to terrorism and I'll taken any comments off the air.",
        "Okay, Shawn, thanks very much.",
        "Great.",
        "So, there are proposals the Democrats made, which is that the Patriot Act should, this is back in 2001, should apply to terrorist crimes.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "And instead the Justice Department insisted they apply to all crimes so they can be used for child support payment or whatever it is.",
        "And so it's really a change in the overall legal system and not just in the anti terrorism system.",
        "Thereby answering some of his points, but the other aspect of this is, I think a lot of people are confusing it, and we've tried to clear it up with Charles Babington earlier, but this NSA warrantless wiretapping, again, a separate program from the Patriot Act.",
        "Well, yes, but I think they're more linked than separate, right?",
        "So the Patriot Act as it's being reauthorized right now makes permanent some of the changes to the Foreign Intelligence Law from 2001.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And other changes have been proposed for instance by Senator DeWine of Ohio and the Administration a couple of years ago opposed those and said they had all the powers they needed under FISA...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...so as we were trying to update the laws in this area, the administration said two years ago in Congress in sworn testimony they have all the powers they need.",
        "We now know that they were going ahead and doing things outside of FISA nonetheless.",
        "So I think it's linked, I think the key thing...",
        "For which they also say they have Constitutional and specific legislative authority, you can debate the point...",
        "Right.",
        "But that's what they say."

        "Well, and so this gets to the central thing right now which is how much executive power.",
        "When are we going to have courts?",
        "When are we going to have Congress involved?",
        "I think we all want to have effective tools against terrorists.",
        "And the people, my own legal training says that you don't want to have unchecked power...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...that you want to have for instance in the section 215 orders in the Patriot Act, you want to have judges with some say in how that works.",
        "A lot of the most troubling parts of the Patriot Act are where there is no judge involved and the executive gets to do it all by itself.",
        "And that seemed to be a point that many Senators brought up at the hearings on the NSA wiretapping last week, but what about the other point in the call?",
        "What happens if an American is brought up on terrorism charges and then questions are raised about the legality of the method by which the information on which the indictment was based, what happens then?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, so, there was a report in the press last week in the Washington Post that said the FISA court is going to refuse to issue any FISA warrants.",
        "They're going to refuse to have these ongoing surveillances...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...based on anything from the NSA program, and apparently the head of the FISA court said that a couple of years ago to the Justice Department.",
        "So that means that the Justice Department goes down this road of acting outside of the statutory framework, they can't use that in subsequent criminal and foreign intelligence investigations.",
        "That's one of many reasons to think we're going to have more effective tools if we write statutes that tell us what the rules are going to be here.",

        "Hello, yes, I just wanted to make a couple of comments and actually I'm an American Airlines flight attendant on my way to work in London.",
        "And the Patriot Act, as it currently stands, and as it's being debated does not make me feel any safer, neither at work, nor as an American citizen.",
        "I do not like being listened in to when I make calls to my relatives overseas, my spouse is foreign-born and a foreign citizen.",
        "And my concern is very much over civil liberties and especially being in a profession where we were very much affected by 9/11.",

        "Well, I mean, I'm not the sole defender of civil liberties, I try to, I hope we have effective tools for security and we also have civil liberties.",
        "My theme here, I think, is that we should figure out what the laws are that we need and then have those laws be ones where the courts and where the Congress are involved.",
        "We went down the road in the 1960s and into the '70s where we had the imperial presidency where there were hearings that turned out the executive was breaking the law a lot in the name of prevention and I think people who see history say that human nature hasn't changed very much in 50 years.",
        "And so if you have unchecked power you have this long term problem.",
        "And so going forward on the Patriot Act and on the NSA wire taps, I think the theme is, let's have the sensible checks and balances we've always thought we should have when it comes to these executive powers.",
        "Carol, good luck, that's a long commute to London.",
        "Yes, but Maine is a beautiful place to live, so I want to keep it that way.",
        "I'm very proud to live here and I hope that, as U.S.",
        "citizens, we can keep our civil liberties in check while also, you know, balancing what we need to do for safety and security.",

        "Have a good flight.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Peter Swire, are there, what examples do we know of, and again, a lot of this is shrouded in secrecy, some of those national security letters, for example, you wouldn't know about those because there are gag orders attached to them, but so far as we know, what, under the Patriot Act, what encroachments of civil liberties, you know, who's been affected?",
