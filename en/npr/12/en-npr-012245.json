        "Right, but that's different from this NSA program?",
        "Well, but I think the question, I don't quite see the difference because, to me, it's how do you use your statutory authorities under FISA and then what do you do outside of those authorities and we changed the law the way the administration asked on FISA, but then they went and did things beyond that and I think that's a big concern.",

        "But we made additional progress in three areas.",
        "One, we created an explicit judicial review for the gag order that comes along with the 215 subpoena.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We added language that clarifies that libraries operating in their traditional roles are not subject to national security letters, and we got them to drop a provision that would have required the recipient of an NSL to disclose the name of their lawyer to the FBI, and, you know, just on principle, I think that's something that could easily discourage people from seeking legal advice.",
        "So, and I know you've also said this is not everything you wanted, but it's as a good as you could get now.",
        "It's not, look, if you're sitting down to try to work out differences, inevitably, you're going to get, you're going to make gains, and you're going to have to make some compromises.",
        "It's totally unrealistic to think you can sit down at a table, insist on a list of improvements and get everything you want, but we made real progress in these three areas.",
        "We've made a lot of progress since the initial bill that was passed in the wake of the attacks on September 11th, and let's face it, the administration's original position when we began this process a year ago was make all the provisions permanent and don't change anything, and I think we've markedly improved from that original line.",
        "One other factor in this was, of course, the House of Representatives who were very supportive of the White House position here.",
        "Well, that's not entirely true.",
        "You've got to be careful when you attempt to speak for the entire House of Representatives.",
        "Okay...",

        "In conference, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the House, Jim Sensenbrenner, certainly aligned himself with the Justice Department, but remember the House voted on a number of these provisions, sneak and peek search warrants, sunsets, and on these and other issues, they supported the Senate's position, so on a straight up or down vote on many of these provisions, the House has supported the Senate.",
        "But when they got into conference, it was a different story and the, excuse me, the negotiations were a little bit more difficult."

        "The speaker of the House has supported, indicated his support for these three additional changes, the leadership in the Senate, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and, at a certain point, you'll have to take those commitments at their word, move forward with the bill that we've already introduced to make the changes, and get it done.",
