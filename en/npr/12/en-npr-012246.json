        "Well, originally it was five years or four years, that's why we're here today.",
        "Because they were set to expire January 1st?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And the most controversial provisions in the law, the 215 subpoenas, the roving wiretaps and what are called the lone wolf provisions now have another four-year sunset, so they will have to be revisited within four years, either reauthorized or set aside, and that's the kind of check that you're talking about.",
        "I mean, that's the one way that we can ensure that this has to be revisited and that we have to ask the hard questions you point out.",
        "And Peter Swire, let me ask you the other half of Stacy's question.",
        "The Cold War sure went on for a long time, too.",
        "At what point, how is this debate, was there an end to these abuses back in the Cold War is, I guess, the question.",
        "Well, first I agree with the senator on the key role of sunsets.",
        "That's how we get to look at it, that's why we got to have the improvements this year that the senator helped lead.",
        "In terms of the history, I think the big thing that happened was Watergate because after that came 1978, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, came a lot of changes to the laws in this area.",
        "It was basically when there was a thorough investigation that we cleaned up the act and that investigation is really, I think, key to the NSA wiretap story this year.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "When did the Japanese know that they were going to be free?",
        "I mean, when did the people that were under inquisition of the American civil liberties during McCarthy, when did they know that that inquisition was going to be ended?",
        "And so how can we, as American citizens, I'm a realtor and I have to sign, have my clients sign documents regarding to the Patriotic Act, and they're appalled, if they want to buy a house.",
        "This extends more to the library issues, it extends to most a lot of issues that we as American citizens are having to face.",
        "Stacy, thanks very much for the call.",
        "All right.",
        "And Senator Sununu, the library issue that Stacy (ph) referred to, that has now been substantially changed."

        "Look, libraries can always be subject to the 215 subpoena, which is used far less frequently than national security letters, which requires a statement of facts and some other material presentations and the approval of a judge.",
        "There are specific protections, however, for libraries that are served with the 215.",
        "What we did is for the national security letters, which are far more numerous, on the order of thousands of national security letters issued each year, is we made a good faith effort, I think, to clarify the language and to say that libraries in their traditional role of lending books, making digital books available, providing access to the Internet, are not subject to national security letters, which are intended to be used for other purposes.",
        "Senator Sununu, stay with us if you will.",

        "And Senator Sununu, let me ask you, what part, in the end, do you think the revelations about the NSA wiretapping played in this discussion?",
        "And what's the main thing in a salad?",
        "None.",
        "The timing obviously was significant or coincidental, but we had the votes to defeat cloture prior to the revelations and would have been able to delay the implementation of the bill at the end of the year, and having delayed it, I think we stood in good stead to force some discussion and negotiation of changes in order to move forward and complete work on the bill.",
        "So, I don't think it really had an impact on getting the work done or getting the votes necessary to delay the bill.",
        "You know, it certainly might have highlighted and reinforced concerns in some peoples' minds, or just raised these general issues to a higher level, that we give law enforcement tools that we believe are important and necessary to fight terrorism, but at the same time, we need to make sure there are appropriate checks and balances or protections for civil liberties, oversight on the part of Congress, and reporting to the American people, and that's how we can sort of rest assured that we're striking the right balance.",
        "Do you find that members of the Senate are, in general, more nervous about these issues after reading the White House's interpretation of the FISA Act and its justification for the warrantless wiretaps?"

        "I don't, I don't know, and I couldn't generalize.",
        "You saw the hearings in the Judiciary Committee.",
        "There are clearly Democrats and Republicans that have very substantial questions about the administration's legal rationalization, their description of how the work at the NSA fits into FISA, the discussion and debate about what the president's constitutional powers are in a time of war, or for that matter, in a time of peace.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Those are questions that the Judiciary Committee and the intelligence committees are going to have to wrestle with as they do their, their hearings and their oversight work.",
        "It's very important, however, that these committees who have jurisdiction know and understand what was done and take a hard look at whether FISA works effectively, or whether it needs to be amended.",

        "That's my comment and it dovetails into my question, which is American democracy is different than other democracy in the world because we have a Bill of Rights.",
        "Other countries don't have a Bill of Eights, and I'm, not that I am, you know, lecturing to anybody, but it's just, I'm concerned about my Fourth Amendment rights under the Patriot Act.",
        "I don't feel like my Fourth Amendment rights are preserved with the Patriot Act.",
        "I guess it's that 215 that you were talking about.",
        "Yeah, and Fourth Amendment, for those who haven't read their Constitution lately, searches and seizures, but go ahead."

        "Well, the point you make is a very important one.",
        "First, about the leaks, this question of the roll and responsibility of the press, the roll and responsibility of whistle blowers, is one that's been discussed for decades, and it will be discussed long after this particular event as well.",
        "We expect a vibrant free press, a press that's, you know, will both, behaves responsibly when there's a belief that national security is placed at risk by reporting something, but also behaves aggressively in disclosing issues that they think the public ought to know about.",
        "That's the role of the press.",
        "Those are the issues at stake here.",
        "I don't, I think if someone, you know, leaked this maliciously to undermine our national security, that ought to be dealt with, but I certainly don't think that there was anything malicious in the New York Times in their objectives or goals in publishing the story.",
        "The Fourth Amendment is just as you described it.",
        "It is intended to protect our individual rights, in this case, regarding searches and seizures.",
        "The Bill of Rights themselves are the best embodiment of protection of civil liberties and balances that were put in place because the framers understood we were giving the government a lot of power.",
        "We were giving the government certain police powers to conduct investigations, to subpoena people, to bring them, to charge them with crimes, you know, to collect evidence.",
        "We were giving the government a host of powers to do these things, and they recognized we had to put in place amendments enshrining these rights so that people knew they would have access to attorneys and due process, protection from, you know, cruel and unusual punishment, and protection of private property, and those are what the Fourth Amendment and others are all about.",
        "And that's where you have to draw your inspiration, I think, if you're going to try to tackle these issues and do what we did on the Patriot Act or ask questions about the NSA or any other law enforcement activity of the federal government.",
        "You have to draw some inspiration between both the letter and the spirit of those original ten amendments.",
        "Jan, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I'm just grateful that the debate is even coming up in the Congress.",
        "Well, I appreciate that, and I certainly agree with you that it's just nice to be debating these issues, and there going to be people who disagree with me and people who agree with me, but this is the kind of thing we should be spending our time discussing and debating in Congress.",
        "Thank you.",
