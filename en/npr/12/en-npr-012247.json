        "About a decade after those initial conversations, the two started production on \"\"No Mas Bebes.\"\" That meant finding the plaintiffs and defendants, all of whom hadn't spoken about the case publicly in 35 years.",
        "Tajima-Pena said those willing to talk - both the women who were sterilized and the doctors who performed the sterilizations - all men - echoed their court testimony.",

        "I suppose, by the rebels' logic, since they live in the People's Republic of Donetsk, the airport was controlled by a foreign military, which they couldn't abide.",

        "And they sent in paratroopers, as well, on what they called a clean-up operation.",

        "Well, assuming the election results hold and Poroshenko is declared the winner, when would he take office as president?",
        "He wants to do it as soon as possible.",
        "No date has been announced, but at the moment - barring legal complications - I'm told swearing in could happen by mid-June, maybe even a little earlier.",

        "Mr. Poroshenko still claims Ukrainian sovereignty for Crimea, for example.",
