        "Right, Edwards teamed up with a gynecologist by the name of Patrick Steptoe, and he was working in a small hospital about several hours away from where Edwards was working.",

        "It's allowed them to focus on their education and their careers, and delay having childbirth till later in life.",
        "But it's also forced society to re-think certain assumptions about family and relationships.",
        "For example, gay couples can use IVF to have genetically related children.",
        "And it's led to things like egg donation and surrogate mothers.",
        "And so today, you have situations where a child can have many mothers.",
        "One baby can have a mother who donated the egg, a mother who carried the baby, and another mother who actually raised the child.",
