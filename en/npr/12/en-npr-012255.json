        "Well, I'm not exactly sure if they could be a false positive.",
        "I think the explanation that the director of the lab gave was that the only problem that they would encounter testing old samples like this is the false negative and that both naturally occurring and synthetic erythropoietin would degrade in a sample.",
        "But he insists that the degradation wasn't as great as originally expected and that they were, in fact, able to distinguish between synthetic and naturally occurring EPO.",
        "I guess there would then be questions about whether there was contamination, whether the samples may have gotten mixed up, things like that.",
        "I would suspect that this entire case is going to be reviewed very carefully before anybody takes any action on it.",
        "This newspaper that published these charges is owned by the same company that runs the Tour de France.",
        "You now have the director of the Tour de France saying in L'Equipe of this 1999 race, `We were all fooled,' and he's calling on Lance Armstrong to explain himself.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Jean-Marie Leblanc, the outgoing director of the Tour de France, has said that he's convinced by what he's seen.",
        "And he's now demanding some sort of explanation; that Armstrong cycling fans around the world deserve an explanation.",
        "If these tests do hold up in some way, is there any possible disciplinary action that would be taken against Lance Armstrong?",
        "I think there's a big question about that right now.",
        "Dick Pound, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, conceded immediately that there really wasn't much that that agency could do, and he said that the ball was essentially back in the court of the sports governing body, the UCI.",
        "The Tour de France could conceivably change the record book.",
        "I think the most immediate impact may be the number of civil suits that Lance Armstrong's involved in right now, including a lawsuit against the authors of a book, who made similar accusations a year ago, and an insurance company that has declined to pay a $5 million payout for winning his sixth tour.",
        "Charles Pelkey of VeloNews, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",

        "They reached capacity.",
        "So, I ended up in a better space, at the Harlem Armory.",
        "So, I watched the inauguration with thousands of kids.",
        "And I guess the moment that stands out for me was when President Obama - then President-elect Obama - when he first appeared and the kids just absolutely erupted, and you can see the future on their little faces.",
        "You know, we talked to Robert Smith from NPR earlier in the program about that.",
        "He was also at that event.",
        "L'Heureux, talk about something that stood out for you.",
        "Well, the temperature was absolutely freezing in D.C., and I know people were really cold, and we were waiting for the inauguration to get going.",
        "And when Barack Obama started to come down the stairs, his image was projected on the JumboTron and all of, almost, the complaining and the bustling froze for a moment as he walked down.",
        "His confidence was exuding when he was taking on what's fundamentally almost an impossible task, but it just seemed like the transition in power had occurred, and everyone snapped to attention in a really powerful manner.",
        "You know, one of the things that seems to be heating up on the blogosphere, from what we're hearing here on News & Notes, is the benediction as delivered by Reverend Joseph Lowery yesterday.",
        "Here it is if you missed it."

        "How does he see these recent advances?",
        "I crossed into northern Syria, and I interviewed Abdul-Jabbar Akidi at his headquarters.",
        "And he laughed when I suggested that the regime, and the rebels, were in a stalemate.",
        "He said for the rebels of Aleppo, the recent capture of Base 46 - and it's west of the city - was a major breakthrough.",
        "It's been under siege for months.",
        "It's where the regime forces launched daily artillery strikes on Aleppo.",
        "And so for Akidi, the capture of Base 46 showed the experience of the rebels.",
        "And here's what he said.",
        "(Through translator) First of all, it's a big base.",
        "It's an elite base.",
        "It was reinforced with tanks, rocket launchers, howitzers.",
        "Now, those weapons are in rebel hands.",
        "The base also has a strategic importance.",
        "It's located on a key highway between Aleppo and the capital of Damascus, so the rebels control the highway, said Akidi.",
        "(Through translator) In this way, we can block all resupplies sent from the regime, to the army in Aleppo.",
        "But Deb, it seems that the Syrian Air Force still is in control of the skies.",
        "How big a deterrent is that, as the rebels try to extend their reach on the ground?",
        "It's a problem, but Akidi said it's God that has provided a no-fly zone.",
        "What he means, is the weather.",
        "It's rainy.",
        "There's lots of heavy clouds as the winter sets in, so the airstrikes have diminished.",
        "The other thing that we've noticed here, is the number of defections is rising after almost none over the summer; and Akidi's confirmed that there were more.",
        "He said that when you have battles, what happens is, it's just easier for some of the soldiers to escape; and some of them do defect."
