        "For the first time, Robert, Akidi said he believed the rebels no longer needed outside help.",
        "They have complained for months, that they want the international community to supply anti-aircraft weapons; to take out the air force.",
        "Now, he says, the rebels are capturing what they need from the bases that they get from the Syrian military.",
        "But for all of this confidence, and all the gains of the rebels, it's not as if they've actually taken control of a major city in Syria.",
        "We hear again and again, from commanders, that they are focusing on the military bases; amassing weapons before they turn on the city.",
        "They know that the Syrian Air Force can still exact huge punishments on these cities.",
        "So they have to be sure that they can degrade the air force.",
        "We saw this on Sunday.",
        "They took a helicopter base; and then the Syrian Air Force dropped cluster bombs at a school, killing more than 10 children.",
        "And do you think what you're seeing isn't just a swing of the pendulum toward the rebel side; but an actual shift in momentum, in the Syrian civil war?",
        "I don't talk to any military analyst who calls this a stalemate anymore.",
        "I talked to one today, who said the time may come when the Syrian military can no longer sustain the price in some of these cities - Aleppo, in the north; Deir ez-Zor, in the east - but they may not be capable of a coherent pullback.",
        "Now, for the rebels, what they're talking about is going on to Damascus.",
        "They say the plans are set.",
        "And what we may see is Damascus, the capital of Syria, is the next major battleground.",

        "They will push for better border security and better ways for employers to verify an immigrant's status.",

        "Financial markets were also underwhelmed today by the EU's plan to bail out Spanish banks.",
        "As NPR's John Ydstie reports, initial relief in the markets faded quickly.",
        "Spanish bonds had a burst of strength shortly after markets opened, sending interest rates on Spanish government debt sharply lower.",
        "But by afternoon European time, investors had reconsidered.",
        "And the interest rate they demanded to hold 10-year Spanish debt shot, back up to more than 6 and half percent.",
        "Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, says that's partly because there are still a lot of questions about the bailout.",
        "Now, on the blog, some people are giving a number of different points of view, one saying that, quote, why weren't Lowery's racist comments allowed - Why were they allowed to taint this historic event?",
        "And who are these yellow and red people he's talking about?",
        "Another said, it's day one of the Obama presidency and the race card already has been played.",

        "Faye, what did you think when you heard it, and what have you been seeing in the blogs?",
        "Well, I've seen what you just said.",
        "Let me say, I know Reverend Lowery very well, and frankly, I was a little bit disappointed with his benediction, not because of any racial implications, but you know, it was a historic, momentous occasion, and that's a schoolyard taunt that every black child knows.",
        "And so, Dr. Lowery is old-school and I had hoped that he would have risen to the occasion.",
        "But I think it's a reflection of black culture; there will be very few black people who don't know what Reverend Lowery was talking about.",

        "When he opened up with \"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\"\" that was the first implication of race.",
        "We are in an era when people are willing to look past race quickly, but race has always been at the forefront of this campaign, whether it's said or unsaid.",
        "So, when Reverend Lowery brought out \"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\"\" and in the end, when he ended with the homily that was about race relations, this is him signaling to folks, even though this is a powerful transformative moment, it is not an ahistorical moment.",
        "Let's remember history and responsibility that we all have for changing America.",
        "Let's talk for a moment, if we can, about how far Barack Obama's presidency relates to the issue of changing perceptions of black Americans.",

        "And I've heard others say that this isn't going to change a single thing.",
        "Faye, how do you - how are you interpreting it, and what are you reading in the blogs in terms of how people across the country are looking at that particular issue?",
        "You know what, Tony?",
        "I've been surprised - well, not shocked - but surprised how many times I've read in the last few days that, well, Obama, he's not the first black president; he's the first biracial president, the first mixed-raced president, anything other than he's the first black or African-American president.",
        "So, I think whites want to see it as post-racial, but certainly blacks are not buying into it.",
        "And again, looking at those thousands of kids and what must be going - yesterday, at the Harlem Armory - what must have been going through their minds that their first president, for practical purposes, is a black man and the possibilities it opens up for them.",
        "So, I think it would be very hard to look at black folks in the same way.",
        "And just to finish, that I've read on - I've forgotten on whose blog - about rappers that they have to clean up their act.",
        "How are you going to talk about the B word and assume that pimp persona with a black man in the White House?",
        "Is it not palpable, L'Heureux, the sense that something has changed between blacks and whites since Obama's candidacy and now his election and ascension to the presidency?",
        "Although the question, I suppose, remains, how long will it last?",
        "Yeah, I think there is a noticeable change in the orientations towards folks.",

        "He is a cut above almost every human being that we see in terms of intellect, in terms of confidence, in terms of political ability.",
