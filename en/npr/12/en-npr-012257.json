        "Well, they come in a variety of flavors, so to speak.",
        "The mice we use, we essentially are trying to either create a model of human disease.",
        "And what we can do is take a human genetic mutation that is associated with schizophrenia or autism, and create a mouse which has the exact same genetic mutation in the same gene that would be perturbed in a human being.",
        "And then we can look at what effect that has on the mouse.",
        "The other way we do it is a little more of an engineering approach, where we use various tricks which allow us to confine changes to individual cell types, so that we can literally put on a light switch so that we can look at a mouse and temporarily turn off a function of a particular cell type or activate it at a higher level than it would normally and see how that affects the mouse behavior.",
        "And that's very informative for letting us understand how the mouse brain works and hopefully how our brains work.",
        "So how does it set you back to have lost all of your mice?",
        "Well, in a way, it presents a challenge - and scientists should be challenged - and gets us out of a comfort zone.",
        "I mean, we had worked over a decade to get this collection together, but my lab and I think many of the mouse community really believe that since it costs upwards $150,000 to create and breed and make these animals, that we need to share them.",
        "And my lab has been very good about that.",
        "Matter of fact, of all the mice we have ever created, they exist - their cousins, at least - exist in other labs around the world.",
        "So we will...",
        "So there are backups.",
        "There are redundancies.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We will be able to get them back.",
        "What really sets us back is that, generally speaking, in the way we do genetics, it's not just one gene - or one allele, as we would put it - that we're manipulating.",
        "But we use mice which have three or four different genetic manipulations.",
        "And the way we get them all in the same mouse is by breeding them.",
        "So the real setback is that it will take three or four generations of mice, even in the best of circumstances, to get back these mice which have the right genetic background to really answer the questions the way we want to.",
        "Do you have any sense of how long it'll take to rebuild?",
        "There's no simple answer to that.",
        "What will happen, some of our experiments will be back up and running within two or three weeks.",
        "Some of the most complex genetic processes will probably take over a year to get back together.",
        "And, you know, disruptions like this push us to think hard about what we want to do and where we want to go."

        "So I think even though I wouldn't have chosen this - and it really is tremendously sad to have lost our partners in these mice - it's going to push us to think about some new directions which we might not have tried had this not happened.",

        "Hania Sholkamy is an anthropologist at the American University in Cairo.",
        "So it's the first rite of passage that differentiates a boy from a girl, that establishes this newborn as a continuation of the family, that establishes a mother's and a father's roles because the ritual itself is all about advising the newborn about warding off evil spirits, about strengthening it, about giving it, you know guts and a will to live."
