        "But he says even these may not meet engineering standards to support a load vertically, and definitely cannot handle the side-to-side lateral forces of an earthquake.",

        "And imagine, you know, the shaking in that direction causing a bigger hole so the wall collapse, and eventually the slab falls down.",
        "The slab being the wall or ceiling.",
        "Filiatrault says televised images of Port-au-Prince suggested this kind of collapse was widespread.",
        "The video showed a complete dust over the entire city, and apparently that dust lasted quite a while - 10, 15 minutes or so.",
        "And this seems to indicate these types of buildings, concrete buildings, pancaking, creating a lot of dust.",
        "Several big aftershocks followed the earthquake.",

        "I thought it would be great to perform in the house where the engineer was somewhere far away from the musicians in a room and you never see the engineer.",
        "You can hear him, but you can't see him, and that's - the musicians react to that in a different way, and I think they share the music in a more open fashion than they would if they're isolated in booths and they have to communicate through the engineer's apparatus."
