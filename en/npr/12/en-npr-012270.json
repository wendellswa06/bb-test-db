        "And we all know that the cholera situation has gone totally out of control in the country, and the government has no means to deal with that situation.",
        "So, it's a humanitarian situation that is out of control, but this humanitarian situation is totally manmade.",
        "It's the unwillingness of the government to do anything about this situation that is a real problem in Zimbabwe.",
        "And an unwillingness on the part of President Robert Mugabe to form this promised power-sharing agreement with the opposition?",
        "That's absolutely correct, Madeleine.",

        "South Africa, of course, is the preeminent voice, and if there's going to be a solution, if there's going to be a rapid solution to this, I think that the regional bodies are going to have to step up and force this illegitimate regime of Robert Mugabe to do the right thing by its people.",

        "The liberals are affluent, well-educated, highly secular group of people, liberal on social issues, oppose Bush's assertive foreign policy, strong environmentalists.",
        "Conservative Democrats are much more conservative on social issues, moderate on many other issues, older group highly concerned about individualism and issues such as that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the disadvantaged Democrats?",
