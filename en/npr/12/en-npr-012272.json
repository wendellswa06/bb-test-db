        "One of my criteria is that if one tries this in a human that is very consistent, but the biology we know about the cell and consistent with the biology we know about the disease.",
        "This, with a great deal caution, is one area where I would, kind of with a lot of care, try this in humans.",
        "And there is a clinical trial that is completing phase one now, where the patients are getting almost like a taste of stem cells, probably not enough to make a difference, but enough to show that they will be safe, and maybe a little bit of - have a little bit of efficacy.",
        "I think we can cautiously extend those trials for this particular disease as long as we recognize exactly why the cells are working.",
