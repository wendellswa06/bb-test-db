        "You say that everybody in this process is totally overwhelmed.",
        "Setting aside whether it's a good idea or not, is it something that can be implemented?",
        "Is there capacity to do this?",
        "It's going to be hard.",
        "And look.",
        "The question here is, what's going to give?",
        "ICE only has so many resources.",
        "And I think the Trump administration likes to act like they're pushing ICE, you know, in a ways, whereas the Obama administration was not.",
        "But the reality here is that ICE has always operated 100% of its capacity.",
        "So the question is, when you look at who is ICE focusing its enforcement efforts on, as it now takes on this additional responsibility, who are they going to diminish their enforcement efforts against?",
        "And I guess my biggest concern would be, are we going to see a diminishment in the focus on individuals with serious criminal histories or coming out of federal prisons or state prisons who actually pose a threat to public safety in order to focus on this population?",
        "So is the crunch with the actual ICE agents who would be finding people and putting them into deportation proceedings - where is the crunch?",
        "Yeah, the entire system.",
        "The number of ICE agents who are going to go find these individuals - it's very labor-intensive work to find these individuals.",
        "So now when you're out there doing that work, maybe you're not being able to respond to a jail or a prison where there's a serious, you know, violent felony offender being booked.",
        "It's also going to be the crunch, though, with the - you know, just in terms of the charter flight network and the detention beds.",
        "ICE is already at 52,000 beds.",
        "They're only budgeted for 40.",
        "So they're already stretching their budget very thin on - in terms of detention.",
        "This is something that has to be done very carefully.",
        "When you're talking about - a lot of these are going to be family units with minor children.",
        "Now, fortunately, unlike the family separation, they will keep the family unit together, but there is no way to do this without some detention of including vulnerable minor children.",
        "And that is incredibly sensitive.",
        "And what concerns me is, have there been adequate plans put in place to ensure that this is done as carefully as possible?",
        "What do you make of the discrepancy between the acting ICE director Mark Morgan implying that thousands of people are going to be deported and the president saying it will be millions?",
        "I think the acting director's, you know, prediction of thousands of deportations is much more likely than millions.",
        "In the most vigorous year of enforcement in ICE history, ICE only removed 400,000 people.",
        "It'll be very difficult for us to remove anywhere near that level of individuals, no matter how hard the president pushes them.",
        "That's John Sandweg.",
        "He served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement under President Obama.",

        "Of course we know what the candidates talked about, very heavy on the economy, a lot of health care, a lot of detailed discussion of policy.",
        "But what didn't they discuss?",
        "Interestingly, the White House apparently agreed to an agenda for this domestic policy debate that was three units out of six, 50 percent about the economy, all right that's the number one issue, everyone understands, part health care and then essentially governing and trying to get something done in Washington.",
        "If you throw in maybe the debt and the deficit, that was the agenda list, and really none of those is an advantageous topic for the president.",
        "They did not insist on talking about immigration, where the president does have an advantage, especially with Hispanic voters.",
        "They didn't want to talk about anything having to do particularly with women's health care or any of the issues surrounding that.",
        "There was no talk of gay marriage, which has actually become something of a positive for many Democrats, at least in some states, whereas eight years ago it was considered a killer issue, and the Republicans were pushing it very hard.",
        "Never came up last night.",
        "And abortion, which back over the years, all the way back to the 1973 Roe v.",
        "Wade decision, has been a mainstay of political debate particularly and even at the presidential level, and that never came up last night, not even a passing reference to the right to choose or the right to life or anything of that nature.",
        "So in all of those respects, this debate stands out quite distinctly from the list of agenda items that we would have seen at any time over the last 30 years or so."

        "Explain what the converter box is and why calling this number will make a difference.",
        "Well, the converter box, what it does, it takes the analog signature and switches it to a digital signature so that you can receive the picture like you regularly receive the picture today because come 2/09, if you have an analog set, which means that it's not digital, you will not be able to receive picture or sounds."
