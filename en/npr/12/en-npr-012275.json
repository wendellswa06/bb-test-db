        "The politics, fact-checkers if you will, Politifact, you know, factcheck.com and a number of the other places that people go to check the actuality of some of the statements that politicians make, were pretty tough on Mitt Romney this morning and I think will continue to be.",
        "I expect this is an area where the Democrats will try to tear down Mitt Romney performance, which has been so widely praised today, largely on style and largely on impression without necessarily taking apart all the things that were said.",
        "In fact I believe if you look at strictly the transcript of the debate and just look at the words that were said without the hesitations and the haltingness of the president's presentation, you would get a quite different impression and that if you laid all these arguments out and analyzed them carefully word-by-word, you would get quite a different impression.",
        "But in those 90 minutes, in the moment, what people saw on television, what people's impression likely was, was a highly confident business executive full of confidence and putting forth his point of view and his view of the world and a rather hesitant government professor who was sort of trying with caution to choose just the right word.",

        "If you say to somebody, you know, the president wasn't very articulate, they kind of look quizzical at you because the man is reputed to be the greatest orator of his time, and when he does a press conference in the White House, he often seems rather magisterial.",
        "He is so much in control.",
        "He seems like a law professor taking questions from his students.",
        "Of course the reporters do not appreciate that particular analogy, but the president usually looks pretty good in a talking situation.",
        "This is one of the things that he's best known for.",
        "But if you go back to the debates that he had against Hillary Clinton in 2008 and against the full field of Democratic candidates in 2007, he's not particularly outstanding.",
        "He does hesitate like this.",
        "He does halt like this.",
        "And there are times when he has done that in public, under certain circumstances: if he's distracted; if he's thinking about something else; if he's tired.",
        "One would have expected, though, that in an instance like this, a critical moment in a presidential campaign, he's only got one re-election campaign, and at the moment when if you look at it from the other side he might have put Mitt Romney away, he's got a little bit of a lead, most people think he's supposed to win this election or at least they did before yesterday, and had he been able to really parry all of those thrusts that were coming at him from Governor Romney, he might very well have begun to sprout the obituaries for Mitt Romney's campaign, if he had had a strong performance.",
        "And it almost seemed as though they didn't feel as though they needed to prepare or get him particularly focused on it, that they could just sort of brush Mitt Romney aside...",

        "He'll be talking, but there's no substance.",

        "That was quite a stunning moment in one of the Republican primaries.",
        "So he was on the side in the primaries of getting tough on illegal immigration and building that wall and so forth and really was not particularly interested in supporting the aspirations, say, for example, of what are we calling them now, the DREAMers, or the DREAM kids, people who were born in this country, brought here by their parents and very, very young - excuse me - not born here but brought here when they were very young by their parents who were undocumented and who have no status.",

        "But on the other hand, we couldn't really give them legal status, either.",

        "But I think President Obama could have made the point when Mitt Romney was talking about $90 billion subsidized for the clean renewable energies that I've read that independent studies show that there's more jobs creating and transitioning to clean renewables that rather than the business as usual.",
        "And, you know, every academy of sciences around the world is in agreement that climate change is happening.",

        "And if we don't do something, the world as we know will be changed and - for many generations to come.",

        "And it was a perfect opportunity to educate the masses about this issue, which is huge and looming and it's happening, and also how we can turn, you know, the lemons into making lemonade and creating a whole new infrastructure to prepare ourselves for this.",

        "Thank you.",

        "And as a result, the efforts that were made to really jumpstart this industry in this country were largely stillborn or at least hugely restrained.",
        "He didn't want to get into all that.",

        "He allowed really the $90 billion to be portrayed as somehow in the course of three years having been 50 percent as great a subsidy as we had given to oil and gas over the entire history of oil and gas, in addition to the fact that we continue to subsidize oil and gas production despite its profitability, in addition to that he was comparing apples and oranges in terms of dollars and largely getting away with it.",

        "And we have 46 million Americans now living under the poverty line.",
        "So there was no discussion about poverty, and it should been raised as a moral issue by both (unintelligible) economic justice, economic inequality.",

        "He referred to the increased number of people on food stamps, and he said that that was a huge policy failing.",
        "And it was an indication that the president's economic policies hadn't worked, and that we all needed to care more.",
        "I believe he might even have made reference to it in terms of a moral issue but all, of course, as part of an indictment of President Obama's economic program and not as an argument for more programs for the poor, more as an argument for a different kind of economic policy that might create more jobs.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, I kind of thought the cards were sort of stacked against Obama last night as far as social issues went just because there really weren't much mention of them, especially LGBT issues, which is the - an issue that's pretty close to my heart, and he's done so much for it.",
        "I mean, the repeal of \"\"don't ask, don't tell\"\" and the addition of marriage equality to the Democratic platform.",

        "Interesting, really, when you stop and think about it.",
        "One of the things that has been observed but maybe not nearly as much as some of these other points about the debate is the degree to which both of these candidates seem to be contesting the middle.",
        "They were looking for undecided voters who are relatively few, according to all the polls, or those people who might still be reachable as they say.",
        "And they did not want to emphasize either of them.",
        "Their appeal to their hardcore base, which is so dominant in so much of our discussion now and so much of the media, it was not really an appeal by Romney for hardcore conservatives."
