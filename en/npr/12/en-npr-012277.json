        "It can help you make a sale.",
        "And hopefully, there's something additive at some point in that relationship that allows you to recoup the cost of that free shipping.",
        "O'Shea says some big retailers, like Walmart, Target and Best Buy, are well-positioned to absorb those free shipping costs because they already have a complete supply chain in place to feed their many brick and mortar stores, which can also serve as pickup locations or even last-mile delivery hubs.",
        "He estimates that shipping will cost Amazon close to $15 billion this year with only some of that offset by Prime memberships, but the online retail giant seems willing to take the hit in order to expand its market share.",
        "But other retailers with slumping store sales can't afford to lose more money on free shipping, especially, O'Shea says, as that arms race escalates to two-day, next-day and even same-day delivery.",
        "O'SHEA: And with any arms race, at some point you're overshooting.",
        "As for those of us online shoppers who think we're not paying for delivery, well, think again.",
        "There's no such thing as free shipping.",
        "There's also no free lunch.",
        "O'SHEA: That's Anne Goodchild of the University of Washington Supply Chain Transportation and Logistics Center.",
        "She says even though we might be staying home and shopping online instead of driving to the mall, that one trip to the mall for six or eight things might now be replaced by six or eight different trucks delivering to our home.",
        "My informed opinion, based on having conducted research in this area, is that we're increasing traffic.",
        "In addition to worsening congestion, Goodchild says our radical change in shopping habits is taking a toll on roadways and bridges not really designed for the e-commerce boom."
