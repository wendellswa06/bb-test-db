        "How do we ensure the training that we're putting in place with police is staying with them, and they're not becoming corrupted themselves by the older generation that had operated this way and sustained themselves for decades that way.",

        "You know, there was no formal way for them to retire in the past, and so you had a lot of graybeards that stuck around, and these people had no formal training.",
