        "I would tell you that I agree with him, what he said that the army NCO corps is weak.",
        "The NCO corps is weak, and I think what we have to do is take a step back here and think about where we are and where we've been.",
        "Now NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan stood up on the 21st of November, 2009.",
        "So we're just over one year old.",
        "Now, that's not to say we haven't been training the army prior to that, but what we had was, especially in the police corps, multiple countries working bilaterally without any coordination.",
        "The goal of NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan was to bring all these countries together and have a coordinated, synchronized way of training the ANSF forces.",
        "Now, in the last year, we built the foundation of the systems that need to be put in place.",
        "We haven't even started to professionalize this force.",
        "Our goal this year is to start that process.",
        "And it includes things like developing professional education courses, follow-on education, which is what I think is important towards the professionalization of the force.",
        "So I agree with Brian.",
        "Let's bring Tom Bowman into the conversation, NPR Pentagon correspondent, who's been in Afghanistan, embedded with Marines and Army units.",
        "And those units work closely with Afghan forces, and you've seen the Afghan police in operation, as well, and I just wonder: Are things getting better?",
        "Are things improving?",
        "Is there a prospect that in three years' time they're going to be ready to accept the handover?",
        "Well, that's a big question: What will they be able to achieve in three years' time?",
        "They hope to transition to the Afghan security forces by 2014, turn over the lead role to them, but it's an open question what it's going to look like at that point.",
        "I was in Kandahar province in Southern Afghanistan with the 101st Airborne and also next door in Helmand province with the Marines.",
        "Now, when I was with the 101st, they were with a company of Afghan soldiers, 120 soldiers.",
        "They lost 80 of those 120 soldiers; they just walked away.",
        "And the ones who were remaining were really pretty green troops.",
        "I mean, they weren't really doing anything.",
        "They were standing around watching the 101st Airborne soldiers destroy IEDs in this stretch of dirt road.",
        "Next door with the Marines, it was a little better story.",
        "They had a small Marine training team working with Afghan soldiers, and from all accounts, talking to the Marines and seeing these Afghan soldiers, they were pretty squared away, had a lot of initiative.",
        "They would go out on their own patrols, wouldn't need too much supervision.",
        "But we were talking earlier about logistics with the caller Brian.",
        "Now, these Afghan soldiers didn't have their own water.",
        "So they were drinking out of the canal, and the Marine who was there basically said: Listen, I'll get you some water because we don't want you guys getting sick drinking out of the canal.",
        "And the Afghan soldiers said, well, can you bring the water down to us from the main base?",
        "No, listen, you go get it on your own.",
        "You should have your own supply people who can bring it down to you.",
        "But I'm not going to bring it down.",
        "I'll provide it to you, but you have to get it on your own."

        "Well, first, I'd just like to follow on with what Tom said, and he was talking about logistics.",
        "And what I would say is that last year, there was a conscious effort made to grow the force.",
        "So we had plans in place where we were going to build enablers to include the logistics system and several other systems.",
        "OK, you are obviously a true believer.",

        "...Kore-eda Hirokazu for \"\"Shoplifters.",
        "But the logistics system was put on hold so that we could increase the number of the forces, and this coming year is when we're going to build that.",
        "So obviously, we're going to have problems with logistics.",
        "What I would say is that as we move forward, I think we should see gradual improvements within the logistics system to the point where it will be self-sustained, and that's our goal.",

        "Nine years after the United States went into Afghanistan, why are we so late, it seems, catching up with this training issue, which everybody knew from the beginning was going to be key?",
        "The war in Afghanistan took a back seat to the war in Iraq, even before the invasion of Iraq started.",
        "We were already shifting forces, resources, in 2002, away from Afghanistan toward Iraq.",
        "And the real priority switched back from Iraq to Afghanistan only last year, during the Obama administration.",
        "And a good quick snapshot of this fact: From 2001 until 2008, the international community spent $20 billion on developing the Afghan security forces.",
        "In 2009 and 2010 together, those two years, the U.S.",
        "will match that total, $20 billion, just in two years.",
        "So we're finally starting to put a priority on this mission that frankly should have been there from the start.",
        "Well, was that first 20 billion wasted?",
        "An awful lot of it was, I'm afraid.",
        "The international effort to rebuild Afghanistan was divided up among a number of countries.",
        "Different missions were given to different countries, and I don't think any nation's efforts could be given an A grade, but an awful lot of them I think would be in the failing grade, and in particular I think the effort to raise, equip, train the Afghan police force was money very poorly spent for the first five years or so.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Brian(ph), Brian with us from Tulsa."

        "Our biggest problem was the corruption in the officer corps.",
        "They would get food money, a lot of them, through the NATO, the U.S., and I think at that time, it was eight or nine dollars per day per man to feed these guys three meals.",
        "Well, by the time it got trickled down to the company-size element that I was working, they were trying to buy food for three or four dollars a day per man.",
        "Traditionally, another way of manipulating the system, so-called ghost soldiers.",

        "No, no, that wasn't the case.",
        "It was a case that the higher-ups that got the money, as the money was supposed to be handed down through the channels, they just kept a little bit for themselves.",
        "So by the time it got down to the person who's actually providing the food, they had just $3 per man as opposed to the $9 they should have had to begin with.",
        "Exactly, and, you know, and another thing is we kind of crippled them a little bit because they expected the Americans to pay for everything over there, you know.",
        "If they needed a truck part, we were supposed to go out and buy that for them.",

        "I think there are a lot of things that we've put in place now to mitigate a lot of the corruption that's taking place.",
        "From my perspective at NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan, one of the biggest is ensuring training takes place.",
        "You know, that initial training wasn't a guarantee in the police until recently.",
        "One of the reasons for that is that the recruiting was decentralized.",
        "So commanders all over the country could recruit on their own.",
        "Once they identified a recruit, they could - they had the luxury of determining whether he could go to training or whether he should actually start working before training took place.",

        "Let's go to Bryan, Bryan with us from Canton, in Ohio.",
        "We now have requirements in place, and it seems like a little thing, but it's actually pretty big, where every person who is recruited in the police, it's mandatory for them now to receive their full training before they're put on duty.",

        "We have to show them what is right, out in the field - not only the army, which we're doing really well with, but also in the police.",
        "We have to show the - and there is a - there's strong evidence, a lot of data that supports that when you are partnered at that lowest level, that you show progress.",
