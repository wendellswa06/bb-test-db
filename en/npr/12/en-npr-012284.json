        "Yes, there are many challenges in the Afghan military, but they are able to be dealt with.",
        "Until we stop trying to impose our own version of military culture, Western military culture, and allow the Afghans to organically develop its own cultures, traditions and values, we will experience what Afghanistan has always experienced: mission failure.",
        "The country of Afghanistan was cut off from the world for the better part of half a century and the damage that was done during that time of neglect will not be undone overnight.",
        "And John Nagl, I think that's a point that a lot of people would agree with, beginning with the argument that you hear a lot of the time, that the Afghan army and the police don't have to measure up to American standards, they have to measure up to Afghan standards.",
        "The fine art of Afghan good enough.",

        "These are people who take a licking and keep on ticking, and the courage, I think, of the Afghan soldiers is not in doubt.",

        "How much training, how much support will they need before we can start backing away and they can start taking over for security for their own country.",
        "But you know, another question is, we keep focusing now on 2014.",

        "forces would start to leave Afghanistan.",
        "Now it's 2014.",

        "Interestingly, during the flooding in Pakistan earlier this year, they actually sent an Afghan mission - no American advisers, no American support - into Pakistan.",
        "It conducted a number of relief missions, flew the Afghan flag in Pakistan and really provided a bright ray of hope that these are people who can make things happen.",

        "Yes.",

        "And the problem we had was the ethnic issues between the Pashtuns, Hazaris, Tajiks and all the other different ethnic tribes out there - the Pashtuns being the largest.",
        "It was such a problem because all the Pashtuns were in charge, and when we tried to make a, you know, push up a Hazari to fill a void, maybe he was an officer or a major, we'd get a lot of pushback because they want all the Pashtuns to have all the power, and all the lower tribes to be just the -basically, a solider.",
        "So we had a lot of problems.",
        "And I can't stress enough how bad corruption was.",
        "It was at a level that the American people just don't understand.",
        "And it was really disheartening sometimes to see how much money we are spending over there with getting zero results gained and looking for where the equipment was at and coming up with zero.",

        "Now, what I would say is that, especially within the police, you know, in some cases, you know, years ago, we had no way of tracking the police who was trained, who was not trained, and I think that was a problem.",
