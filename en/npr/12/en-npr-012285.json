        "Well, the results that we published this week had to do with the relationship between mind-wandering and happiness.",
        "So we analyzed the -people's answers to three questions, in particular.",
        "We asked people how they felt at a specific moment in their day, and they could respond on a scale ranging from very bad to very good.",
        "That was our measure of happiness.",
        "Second, we asked them what they were doing, and they could respond on a list of 22 different activities, including things like talking or working or exercising.",
        "And then finally, we asked them if they were thinking about something other than what they were doing.",
        "And they could either say, no, which is to say they were focused on their task.",
        "Or they could say, yes, I am thinking about something else.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So in the same results, we also - we show sort of the range of happiness across the different activities in life, and that was actually something people seem to be fairly unhappy doing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And you say that mind-wandering, when people's minds wander, they're at their unhappiest state.",
        "But we keep hearing about people doing all this multitasking, their mind is going all over the place.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So there are three main results that we present in the paper.",
        "The first one is that people seem to be mind-wandering a lot.",
        "About 47 percent of the time, people said they were thinking about something other than what they were doing.",
        "And that rate of mind-wandering was greater than 30 percent in every activity, except one.",
        "So it really seems to be something that's pervading people's experience essentially no matter what they're doing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So which comes first?",
        "Does your mind wandering make you unhappy, or you're just unhappy sitting there and then your mind wanders?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "So we did see the strong negative relationship between mind-wandering and happiness, such that people who mind-wandered were unhappy, both when they were wandering, and people who mind-wandered more often were more unhappy on average.",
        "Of course, it's possible that mind-wandering is causing unhappiness, but it's also possible that people are mind-wandering because they're unhappy to begin with.",
        "You know, I can see it as that, but it's not focused enough for me to say that it's actually that intentional.",
        "I think it's just Kanye having a good week.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "I mean everybody shouldn't have pushed, so that's where I say that the problem needs to be solved at the system level, where somebody has decided how many airplanes should actually have landed in New York in the first place, and you can't just turn around.",
        "You can't make a U-turn like you would, say, on a street.",
        "You've actually probably shut down both engines and are running an auxiliary power unit to maintain power on the aircraft.",
        "Well, so the problem lies in, it looks like, a variety of places.",
