        "Andrew Harrell conducted that study.",
        "He's the executive director of the Population Research Laboratory at the University of Alberta in Canada.",
        "He told our Farai Chideya that his work on the topic first focused on the behavior in shopping malls.",
        "Unattractive children were allowed to wander off in the mall, and their hands were less likely to be held by parents, and parents were less likely to talk to them.",
        "So we weren't surprised when almost 30 years later we looked at children and their parents in grocery stores and found pretty much the same thing.",
        "It's not done well done enough to be intentional.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "To try to tease that apart, we looked at how these things are structured in time to see does mind-wandering precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness precede mind-wandering?",
        "And the data suggests that mind-wandering really is a cause of unhappiness.",
        "And while the reverse may be true, we don't see much evidence for that in our data.",
        "You don't see evidence with it, yeah.",
        "So what activities, I guess, the activities where your mind is not wandering make you the happiest?",
        "What activities would those be?",
        "Yeah, the one activity where people reported a very low rate of mind-wandering was when they were having sex, which was about 10 percent.",
        "I think the next activity where the rate of mind-wandering was lowest were doing things like talking to other people.",
        "Active leisure activities had mind-wandering rates around 30, 35 percent...",

        "Yeah.",
        "We see all of those things happening.",
        "So when we asked people to categorize their mind wandering as either pleasant, neutral or unpleasant, we see a fairly equal split across those things: a little bit more pleasant than neutral, and a little bit more neutral than unpleasant.",
        "What's perhaps even more interesting is that, when we look at the relationship between those different topics of mind-wandering and happiness, not surprisingly, we see a huge negative relationship between unpleasant mind-wandering and happiness.",
        "So it's actually incredibly - seems to be incredibly destructive to happiness to be doing things like worrying.",
        "But even when we look at pleasant mind-wandering, that's actually still not quite as good as just being focused on what you're doing.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "Well - and that would say that if you're happiest being focused on what you're doing, then maybe you should try to find things to help you stay focused, right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Methods, techniques, something like that?",
        "Maybe that's why we have some of these, you know, some of the great advice you get about focusing and maybe, you know, mantras and things like that make you happy.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And I think a lot of people have developed techniques, formal and informal, that may help people in this respect.",

        "Okay?",
        "And then what you happen to be thinking about is another set of data.",
        "And if those two sets of data are too far apart from each other, they create a certain logarithm when they intersect.",
        "And... are you kind of flowing with me on this a little bit?",
        "That what happens is that if they're too out of synch, the logarithm becomes too erratical and it starts to tear itself apart.",
        "And I've done these studies with sculptures.",
        "And the sculptures start to tear each other apart.",
        "And I'm wondering if you had kind of thought about it from that perspective, that, you know, mind-wandering is not so bad if it's closely tied to where you are at that point or present.",
        "But the further it gets away from it, the more radical the logarithm, because if you look at the logarithm from a bird's eye perspective, it starts to sway and move so much.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me get a reaction to the logarithm idea.",
        "Matt, what do you think?"

        "Sure.",
        "I think the closest thing to that that our data can speak to is something that to me was quite surprising, which is the happiness that people are deriving from their activity seems to be almost completely independent from the happiness or unhappiness they're deriving from their mind-wandering.",
        "In other words, if I'm doing something that's quite enjoyable or unenjoyable, that had almost no influence on the pleasantness of the thoughts that I'm having.",
        "People could be doing something very enjoyable and thinking about something terrible.",

        "Well, I think there are a lot of questions that come out of this work.",

        "I think the fact that mind-wandering and unhappiness are so strongly related is partly due to the fact that people are doing things like worrying when they mind-wander.",
        "That's a little bit tough to believe, given that he gave an interview in 2003 to Dutch television where he again, bragged about being on the tape and claimed that he was quote, \"\"offering himself up to save his land and his people.\"\" His family says now that that latter interview about the tape was just a joke.",
        "But there is this overall negative effective that isn't just the result of those kinds of negative thoughts.",
        "So what's going on with that?",
