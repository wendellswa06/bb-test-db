        "Last Friday, we had an hour-long debate on science and morality.",
        "And during that broadcast, one of our guests, the author Sam Harris, made some disparaging comments about the Catholic Church, attacking the Catholic Church.",
        "And we've been receiving quite a bit of feedback about those comments on our website, on Twitter and in personal letters.",
        "And to answer, you know, your comments in part, I'd like to read part of a letter we received from Jim Marley(ph) in Nyack, New York, which I think speaks to the concerns of Catholics who were offended by Mr. Harris's comments.",
        "Sam Harris' remarks relatives - relative to the Catholic Church fit all the definitions, his remark fit all the definition of hate speech and no one of - on the broadcast seemed to notice.",
        "I write this letter not as any kind of watchdog or NPR speech monitor.",
        "I am not condoning the horrible behaviors of some of the people and leaders of the Catholic Church that have come to light in the last few years.",
        "I'm just one of your listeners who is a Catholic, taught by my church to try to live my life in a compassionate and healing way.",
        "I write this letter in the name of Catholics who give their service freely and lovingly around the world, people who are the empirical facts that counter Mr. Harris's gross caricatures.",
        "His throwing of their moral voices to the trash heap is shameful.",
        "Some of those voices are famous such as Bishop Oscar Romero, machine-gunned to death while saying Mass.",
        "And to the Maryknoll nuns who were murdered in El Salvador, all killed because of their efforts to speak for the poor.",
        "There are, of course, thousands more who are not famous, but whose lives and moral vision could be honored and should be honored and not trashed.",
        "If you missed that broadcast, you'd like to hear the whole broadcast on Sam Harris's comments, you can go to our website at sciencefriday.com.",
        "That's about all the time we have for this week.",
        "And I'd like to tell you that Greg Smith composed our theme music.",
        "And we had help today from NPR librarian Kee Malesky.",
        "If you missed any part of our program or if you'd like it - like to take it along and listen to it again, you can go to our website.",

        "citizens abroad, destroy American property with explosives, and conspired to use weapons of mass destruction.",

        "It's a videotape of himself and his friends planting bombs along a road that U.S.",
        "troops were going to use and then bragging about it.",
        "That tape was shown widely on Arab television for quite some time, and the tape itself not only shows him doing it, it was seized from his home in May of 2005.",

        "That it's not him on the tape, or what?",

        "And now that you've gotten one atom, you need to have billions of them, don't you, to really make a functioning computer?",
        "No, no. So for classical computing, yes, you absolutely have billions of transistors on a chip.",
        "For quantum computing, it's predicted that you only need tens to hundreds of atoms in order to be able to do a quantum computation.",
        "So in your quest to do quantum computation, you don't need as many.",

        "And basically they - if you want to make a quantum computer, you have to build up these number of qubits to make a functional system.",
        "And one of the big questions internationally is how big can you keep quantum coherence across those qubits.",
        "And that's the critical thing.",
        "And if you have to have billions of them, then it's quite likely it's going to be very difficult to do that."

        "But if you only need, you know, hundreds of them, it's quite likely you should be able to keep the coherence across the whole system.",
        "So then do you have to physically place, sort of by hand, each one of those single atoms to make your computer?",
        "So if you want to make - using the route that we're taking now, where we're using the electron, the extra electron on the phosphorus atom as the qubit, then eventually you do need to be able to scale that up, and that means you have to place each individual phosphorus atom with atomic precision within the silicon crystal.",
        "And how difficult - and how difficult is that?",
        "Well, I guess the paper that we've just published is really the first time where anyone's been able to put that phosphorus atom in with, you know, one lattice spacing precision and then align the electrodes to the atom to be able to measure its electronic energy levels.",
        "And so we've done it for one, and now that we've developed the technology to do it for one, actually the technology we've developed is very easy to go from one to two to three to four to five.",
        "So we're very hopeful that it's going to be possible.",
        "But like I said, the big question is whether the actual material allows you to keep this quantum coherence over a large distance or not.",
        "And that really comes down to nature, whether it will happen or not.",
        "Can you explain that a little bit more to us, what the difficulty there is?",
        "So if you imagine in the real world, you're using an electron in a transistor, and you're carrying charge.",
        "So you switch, like we said, between on and off states.",
        "It's like - you know, you can kind of imagine a tennis ball.",
        "You throw it against a wall and it bounces back in the real world, and you understand that.",
        "It's quite a robust system.",
        "Whereas when you make things very, very small, you enter the quantum world, and instead of looking at it as a kind of physical object, you start to look at it as a wave-like object.",
        "And there you can imagine if the tennis ball was very, very small, and you'd throw it against the wall, it would actually come out the other side.",
        "So it would tunnel through, in the quantum world when you make things small."

        "And I guess that's the critical thing is in the quantum world, things behave counterintuitively and very differently to the way we expect.",
        "And in the quantum world, you really want to be able to control those quantum states, and they're much more fragile and much more able to interact with other things around them.",
        "And how long have you been working on this?",
        "So we've - really, it's about - it's a 10-year program so far.",
        "So we started about 10 years ago with the idea could we make a single-atom transistor, and then could we actually start to measure instead of the charge of the atom, the electron, we actually measure the electron spin.",
        "And so really that's what we've been doing very recently is trying to measure the spin state of the electron.",
        "But the question at the beginning was can you actually make it.",
        "Can you adapt technology that exists out there to be actual - to be able to put a single atom in with that kind of precision and then measure its energy levels electronically?",
        "So can you give me an idea of the steps now that you need to go to, go through, in order to make something practical?",
        "Yeah, well, so the technology we've developed is we take a silicon wafer, which you normally get from industry, and we put down a hydrogen layer on the surface that acts as a kind of a mask state.",
        "And then we come along with a very fine metal tip in a scanning tunneling microscope, it's a very fine metal tip that we use to pattern the hydrogen layer.",
        "And we open up regions on the surface where we dissolve the hydrogen and expose the silicon underneath.",
        "And then we bring in precursors, to bring in the phosphorus atoms.",
        "We use phosphine gas, and that will only adhere to the holes in the resist layer.",
        "And so in such a way we actually pattern the phosphorus into the silicon on that one atomic surface.",
        "And then we encapsulate that with silicon.",
        "And so basically the phosphorus atoms will stay where we've patterned them on the surface, and then we encapsulate them in a nice, robust, crystalline environment of silicon, and that keeps it protected from the outside world.",
        "It's like a silicon sandwich you've got there with phosphorus.",
        "Well, certainly, that could've been one of his claims in the earlier proceedings against him in the Dutch courts.",
        "But he didn't.",
        "He acknowledges that it is him.",
        "He told the Dutch courts that he was forced to perform on that videotape, that he had been kidnapped.",
        "He happened to be in Iraq, attending wedding, and he was kidnapped and forced to do all these things, threatened with beheading."
