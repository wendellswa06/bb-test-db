        "It is.",
        "It is, yes.",
        "So the phosphorus is really nicely protected inside, and it's surrounded by lots of silicon atoms, and that really - we call it the host material, and that really protects it.",
        "And so really when we're going to expand to large numbers of qubits, we literally use the same process.",
        "Instead of patterning a hole for one phosphorus atom, we will pattern a hole for many phosphorus atoms at the same time.",
        "And why phosphorus?",
        "What's so - what's unique about phosphorus that you've chosen that?",
        "Well, the phosphorus is great, but there's a couple of reasons.",
        "The first one is literally it has one extra electron compared to silicon.",
        "So silicon has four electrons in its outer shell, phosphorus has five.",
        "And so when you put phosphorus in silicon, four of those electrons are used to bond to the silicon atoms, and the extra one is free.",
        "And that extra one is what we use as the conventional bit, the quantum bit or qubit.",
        "So that's one reason.",
        "The other reason why we use phosphorus in silicon is that silicon itself is a nice host material.",
        "So it has no free spins in it.",
        "So all the electrons are used for bonding.",
        "And so they basically don't interact with that one extra electron, whereas the phosphorus just literally has one extra electron, which we then control in the quantum bit or qubit.",
        "You know what I'm picturing here, if you're talking about using a few hundred or a few thousand of these electrons, and you're depositing them one at a time, in - I'm sort of - a picture.",
        "You could make your logo out of the...",
        "Yeah, that's exactly what people have done.",
        "So there's a technique of scanning tunneling microscopy is about 30 years old now.",
        "It was invented in the U.S.",
        "by some researchers at IBM.",
        "And they actually pretty quickly realized that they could pick up atoms on a surface and put them down - excuse me - in different locations.",
        "And they actually formed the world's smallest logo, IBM, out of individual atoms.",
        "But really they were picking up atoms and placing them on a surface, and I guess that's been a great technique, and they've done lots of beautiful studies of that, but really what we're trying to do is to adapt the same kind of technology to a silicon device.",
        "And the key difference there is in silicon, all the atoms bond very, very strongly in the surface.",
        "So you can't pick them up and place them.",
        "And this is why we've had to kind of develop this technique with the hydrogen resist layer, to open up a little hole and then put the phosphorus atoms in.",
        "Now, we know why it's impressive to have small things, like the size of an atom, but does that also help you speed things up at that level that you're working at?",
        "Well, say - I mean, conventionally, the silicon industry, the devices get smaller, and because they're smaller, the electrons have less distance to travel, so essentially they get faster, and that's really what's, you know, pushed the existing semiconductor industry."

        "I guess in the world of quantum computing, you are actually using a completely different way of doing the computing.",
        "So you're using what's called parallelism, quantum parallelism.",
        "So instead of doing calculations in the classical world one after the other, albeit very fast, you actually do these calculations in parallel.",
        "And there are certain kinds of calculations where if you can do things in parallel, you can get a predicted exponential speed-up in the computation.",
        "And I guess that's one of the reasons why quantum computations is quite an exciting field at the moment.",
        "If you can actually realize them, then there are certain tasks that you can do which would be much faster than you can do with classical computers.",
        "And finally, what advantage did you have in beating everybody else to doing this?",
        "Look, I think partly because we looked at a very long-term project, so we, with the Australian Research Council here, and we actually get funding from the U.S.",
        "Army Research Office, we set up this program 10 years ago with the view that it was going to be at least a 10-year project.",
        "So having funding for a long period of time, sustained funding, has been essential.",
        "But I guess also, we got into the field when a lot of people were not in the silicon field.",
        "So we basically got in right at the beginning and said look, you know, you can watch Moore's Law, which is the law that kind of dictates the silicon industry, and you can see that, you know, within a couple of decades from the time that we started that we're going to hit the level of single atoms.",
        "And so we basically said, you know, we're going to literally look at the technology that exists out there and adapt it to make devices in silicon.",
        "And I think it was just that we were looking a long term ahead and with the view that we were going to have relatively sustained funding.",
