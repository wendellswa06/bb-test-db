        "But he really kind of became this darker character in the culture after he crashed the stage at the VMAs on MTV in 2009 and interrupted Taylor Swift when she won her award.",

        "The email said to, quote, \"\"be careful to avoid characterizing King's remarks as racist.",

        "And to situate this, you said the 1950s this started to change.",

        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "Phillip Atiba Goff, who is a psychologist we have on Code Switch a lot who studies racism, he said that one of the most important consequences of the civil rights movement was to create these new taboos around racial animus.",
        "So being a racist or at the time being prejudiced became a bad thing.",
        "And so reporters who were trying to stay, quote, \"\"objective\"\" were playing it safe by not characterizing the people that they were talking about as racist or prejudiced.",
        "And so to get deeper into this idea, if you primarily understand racism as a kind of, like, illness of the soul - right?",

        "If the United States was built on this history of ethnic cleansing of Native American people and the enslavement of black people and then all these subsequent arrangements flow out of those things, then racism and white supremacy is just, like, part of the source code of American life.",
        "It doesn't need to be sort of discerned from people's souls.",

        "And so that understanding shapes a lot of the guidance that newsrooms get, you know.",
        "And I think newsrooms should be much more comfortable just saying racist, and I would argue that Steve King's quote in The Times, which is a very literal defense of white supremacy, does not warrant this level of controversy.",

        "And so this investigation by the FBI says no, that's not the case.",
        "And also, there was a previous investigation, right, by the military that they came to the same conclusion?",
        "The eyewitness statements were no longer contemporaneous.",
        "And they were also handcuffed to some extent because they were unable to interview most of the important Blackwater employees themselves because of an arrangement they had with the State Department.",
        "They gave statements early on in the process that could not be used in a potential criminal inquiry.",
        "Given the difficulty, though, of piecing together what happened that day, what did the FBI conclude happened in that?",
        "It was half an hour of chaos?",
        "The FBI thought that that car, you know, might have been perceived as a threat.",
        "And there was one other Iraqi civilian, unidentified as yet, who was killed early on and also may have been perceived to oppose the threat.",
        "But after that, there were 14 more fatalities and none of those, according to the FBI or the military, could be found to have been justified.",
        "And so what can happen next, because as you say, Blackwater was operating under a State Department contract and they gave - many Blackwater employees gave testimony under the agreement that they would not be prosecuted or that testimony would not be used against them in any way.",
        "There are no laws specifically governing Blackwater's actions in Iraq.",
        "So what can happen now?",
        "It kind of looks like a jester.",
        "Well, we've--I was trained as a zoologist and an anthropologist, and so I've applied those techniques throughout my career.",
        "I do lots of naturalistic observation, so I get actually in the field and observe.",
        "In the case of this particular study, we had done, I believe, 10 previous studies in grocery stores.",
        "So we were comfortable in that setting.",
        "And we had observer teams made up of four people.",
        "Two members of each team went in once they found a--I won't say a victim, but a subject, a parent, one parent with one child.",
        "And they were trained just to look strictly at facial features, not to look at the clothing or the hair cut or anything that might be indicative of social class.",
        "And once they were through--they'd spend about five minutes doing their estimates of attractiveness--another pair of observers came in on cue and they observed parenting behavior, whether the parent ever left the child and was out of sight of the child and, most importantly, whether or not the child had been strapped into the baby seat with a seat belt that was provided.",
        "Now if I understand evolution correctly, if parents like cute kids, cute kids should do better in the world.",
        "So everyone should be absolutely beautiful.",
        "Why is that not the case?",
        "Because obviously, there are other things that count besides beauty.",
        "Certainly, beauty is an important asset.",
        "It helps you in television and the movies.",
        "And there's evidence that more attractive attorneys win more cases and so forth.",
        "But obviously, it isn't a factor in basketball.",
        "Some of us beautiful people have been waiting around for years to be drafted by the NBA, and no such luck.",
        "So if I catch you correctly, you're saying that beauty is an actual kind of biological deterministic factor that can shape your life, but it's not the only thing."
