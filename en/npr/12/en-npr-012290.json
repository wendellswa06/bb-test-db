        "Over the--I guess, the last three or four decades, social psychologists and anthropologists have gotten very good at measuring what is beautiful and what aspects of the human body are perceived as being beautiful, and the focus has pretty much been on the symmetry of the body, especially the face.",
        "So they've been able to identify the elements of the physical makeup that constitute beauty.",
        "So if beauty is that easy to boil down, why shouldn't everyone, for example, just go out and get plastic surgery, make their face perfectly symmetrical, earn more money, have their parents love them more and have everything be beautiful?",

        "And the reporting now says that one of the women passed the polygraph test.",

        "Correct.",
