        "With her literate lyrics and her high-pitched wailing voice, I don't think even her label, EMI, expected her to be anything more than a fringe artist.",

        "Some of his legacy is about policy.",
        "He pushed for policies including tax cuts, deregulation and a very hawkish stand toward the Soviet Union until the end of his presidency that I think remain integral to the Republican Party and have shaped American politics since."

        "he came into office at a time many people didn't think well of presidents.",

        "There's been a lot of mythmaking with Ronald Reagan, and like many presidents we've turned him into something he wasn't and often remembered politics that didn't exist in the period and use it today for our memory and for political purposes.",
        "But I think there's a big difference between how we remember him and what happened in the 1980s.",
        "Give us an example of a myth and then what's the reality.",
        "Well, one example is many conservatives praise Ronald Reagan as the purest of conservatives, someone who had a set of ideas including no government is usually better and that overseas you always had to be hawkish.",
        "But in fact, Reagan was a politician too, and he made many compromises during his presidency.",
        "He increased taxes in 1983, he backed off cutting many social programs, like Social Security, and in the end of his presidency he did what he always said should never be done: he negotiated with the Soviet Union over an arms agreement.",
        "So, the politician in him is often, you know, not recalled by conservatives in the current era.",
        "Let me ask you, though: he's praised for shrinking the size of the government.",
        "How much of that did he actually accomplish?",
        "He didn't.",

        "Some programs are not funded as much as people hoped.",
        "Some agencies are gutted, such as environmental programs.",
