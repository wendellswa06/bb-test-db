        "It's a little too early to say there's an Obama doctrine, but in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in December, 2009, he did lay out a fairly clear and cogent argument for going to war, as he himself said, in the face of evil.",
        "At the top of the hour, you played a little bit of that speech, where he spoke about evil.",
        "The very next couple of lines after that are really the really interesting part, where he went on to say that when evil does exist in the world, sometimes you have no choice but to confront it by force of arms.",
        "Nonviolence, he said, would not have defeated Hitler's armies.",
        "That's what he said, and he tried to limit it.",
        "He said he would limit it, from what I could tell of the speech, to self-defense, and also to defense of others.",
        "That is, what he suggested, which would be a break from what other American presidents have done, is that, for example in the face of a genocide taking place elsewhere in the world, that it might be appropriate for American forces to go stand between the perpetrators and the victims of the genocide.",
        "No American president has ever suggested that quite as clearly as President Obama did in that speech.",
        "In retrospect, did Bill Clinton, talking about Rwanda, but in any case, not while he was in office.",
        "Going back, though, to that speech that's probably the most carefully thought-out and articulated version of his thoughts on war, he cited - gave a list of examples of when it was right for the United States to use force, as you said, self-defense, and linked them to the long-standing thoughts about just war that go back to Catholic theologians, well, back to the fourth century.",
        "I think Obama did us a great service in that speech, and there's an interesting way in which we, the American people, owe him a service in return."

        "One of the things that's often been missing in discussions of war in the United States, to go, not to go, is any sort of deep reflection on the nature of war and the morality of war.",
        "Obama clearly, by personality, is a reflective person.",
        "People say he's a little bit cerebral.",
        "Just war theory, which is a part of Western philosophy and does, as you said, come originally from Catholicism, just war theory provides a framework for thinking about war, and it's clearly one that he finds attractive.",
        "In just war thinking, you have to have a just cause to go to war, but war also has to be a last resort, and you have to have reasonable success.",
        "And then when you fight the war, you have to do it in a way that uses the minimum possible force and doesn't target noncombatants and so on.",
        "And all of those are ways of thinking not about whether war is legal or illegal but whether it's right or wrong.",
        "And I think by inviting us to think about right and wrong instead of legal or illegal, the president is inviting us into a reflective conversation about war, which I hope we can have without the usual nonpartisan - I'm sorry, the usual partisan screeching that is part of so many of our debates about policy in the United States.",
        "Well, however, before we leave the issue of legality, a lot of people said: Look, the previous president, George W.",
        "Bush, went to the United Nations to try to get legal cover for an invasion of Iraq, did not get it and went anyway, that the war on that basis was illegal.",
        "Yeah, I don't think - I don't agree with those international lawyers who believe that a war has to be approved by the United Nations to be legal.",
        "So I'm not sure whether the war in Iraq was illegal.",
        "But I do think that as a moral matter, it was a war that was very difficult to justify.",
        "Even if you accepted all the Bush administration's premises about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and so on, that still doesn't tell you whether your own country is in serious and imminent danger or not.",
        "And absent that, it's difficult, in just war thinking, to justify that war.",
        "President Obama, in his speech, largely ignored the Iraq war, but he described the war in Afghanistan as a war of self-defense.",
        "Pardon?",
        "He's also elsewhere called it the war that must be won and a war of necessity.",
        "And my main quarrel with the president on those points, with President Obama on those points, is that if he thinks it's a war that must be won, he owes us, I think, a somewhat clearer definition of what would constitute winning it and how we'll know whether we've won or not."
