        "Both things that are quite murky in a situation, well, of unreliable partners.",
        "It's a little unclear as to how many of the Taliban you might bring over to one side or the other, what situation you might leave in.",
        "No, I think that's right.",
        "And part of the problem is that when people look at the war in Afghanistan, when you look at when the war was popular, back in October and November of 2001, it was envisioned then as a war in self-defense, or you could say even sliding over a little bit over to a kind of vengeance.",
        "The notion was these people came and got us, we're going to go and make sure they can't do that again.",
        "All right, but now that was nine years ago, and we're still there, and are we fighting the same people, are we fighting different people?",
        "Although the president insists on the importance of winning this war, I don't think he's given us a clear explanation of what and when it would be.",
        "My hope is that tomorrow, in his State of the Union message, he might actually answer that.",
        "And you also point out that, at least you argue, that Afghanistan in the sense of yes, we were attacked from forces based in Afghanistan, the purpose of the war was to prevent another attack, at least nine years ago.",
        "The purpose of the war in Iraq was to prevent an attack.",
        "The idea of those wars, despite their provocation, was different.",
        "But the idea of those wars was the same.",
        "I think the idea is very similar, and even today, if you look at the most recent White House report, the declassified part of it, about the Afghan war that came out in December, what the White House talks about as progress in the war means keeping the Taliban out of power.",
        "Now, that's described in the report as though that's obviously part of the self-defense of the United States.",
        "Maybe it is, but that seems to me a sufficiently difficult issue that it's one worth talking about, that is, whether keeping the Taliban out of power is sufficiently closely related to self-defense of the United States that we ought to be spending lives and resources and also killing in order to accomplish it.",
        "We're talking with Stephen Carter, author most recently of \"\"The Violence Of Peace: America's Wars In The Age Of Obama.\"\" 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "What is the morality behind America's wars in Afghanistan, in Iraq and elsewhere, as it pursues al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations?",
        "And let's go first to David(ph), David with us from St. Paul.",
        "Hello, Neal and Dr. Carter.",
        "It's great to hear from you.",
        "I had a discussion with your screener, but I think that now that we -you mentioned the war aim of keeping the Taliban out of power.",
        "That's a fairly comprehensive concept, and it raises the question, where?",
        "Clearly, we don't want the Taliban in power in Afghanistan, but we also seem to have - we actually have a serious interest in not having them come to power in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country, as well.",
        "In fact, I would argue that that may be the more important aim in our situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan."

        "I also would say that, you know, the premise that - your introductory premise of Mr. Obama's and Mr. Bush's policies being very similar or the same, as far as war policies, you know, war policy again, as Mr. Carter pointed out, has to do in many cases, or hopefully in most cases, in the first instance, as to why you go to war in the first place.",
        "And I think that there, you know, based on your discussion of just war theory, they are very different in some ways.",
        "I mean, clearly Mr. Obama objects to why we went to Iraq in the first place.",
        "He doesn't have a problem at all with why we went into Afghanistan.",
        "I would also suggest that from a budgetary and a standpoint of governance, you know, the idea that we would go to war in either place without raising taxes and making the American people pay for the war; also without conserving strategic resources, especially in the case of Iraq; and then, of course, without exposing the able-bodied male and now female sections of the population for the eventuality or possibility of participation in combat by reactivating, in a full sense, the Selective Service System.",
        "That also goes into one's attitudes about how one fights a war once one is started and whether one starts one in the first place.",
        "But Stephen Carter, does it go to morality?",
        "Well, there were a lot of really good points in David's question.",
        "I'm going to stick to two of them, and maybe these are the two easy ones, I don't know.",
        "First, on the last point, it is true, I think, that neither President Bush nor President Obama, in prosecuting these wars, has said to the American people these wars are so important that you need to sacrifice for them.",
        "So when we think of sacrifice, we think of getting extra screening at the airport.",
        "We argue over that.",
        "But the caller, in talking about taxes or the draft or things like that, is pointing to the way war used to be understood in the United States, what used to be called total war.",
        "The notion was the nation, if it's going to be a long and difficult war, commits itself in ways that are sacrificial, and the shared sacrifice helps force the government to have to justify the war.",
        "Now, the Pentagon says it doesn't - pardon, doesn't need the draft, and both administrations have said they don't need to raise taxes to pay for the wars.",
        "I'm not going to go into whether they need to or not.",
        "I do agree with the premise that the sacrifice issue is important, especially in a long and difficult war.",
        "But on the - the other part I wanted to mention, though, the caller pointed out that the problem isn't just the Taliban in Afghanistan.",
        "There's a broad range of problems.",
        "And although...",
        "And this will not be a short thought.",
        "So I'm going to hold you right there, and we'll get to it after a short break.",
        "David, stay with us on the line, we'll put you on hold, and we'll get back to that because one of the premises of Stephen Carter's book is if you look at President Obama's words and deeds over the past two years about his war policies, it will give you an insight into what he may do or may have to do if there is another situation that may, well, require thought about American intervention."

        "Yes, and actually, I'm going to be very brief.",
        "I think that what David has asked about is exactly what Obama has realized, that although the war on terror, as it's often called, not a phrase Obama likes to use, but nevertheless, the war on terror was one of the most controversial parts of the so-called Bush doctrine that Obama, once in office, seems not only to have endorsed it but to have widened it.",

        "So although it's self-defense, in a sense, what's really striking about this broader war is the notion that you try to get good enough intelligence that you know who you think is going to attack you, and then you get them first.",

        "I just had a quick point to make and then a question or -piggyback on what Mr. Carter is saying.",
        "It seems to me that in - asking the question whether or not the United States or when, at what point, do we define winning the war, you know, when does Obama lay that out, it seems to me - and I use the \"\"war\"\" in quotes because it's kind of happening in a lot of different places, it seems at this point.",
        "It seems to me that really what's in the best interest of the United States, as President Obama pointed out in his speech, the Nobel Peace Prize speech, is that if we can manage to keep our, quote-unquote, \"\"enemies\"\" off-guard or destabilize or pitted against each other, in some sense we do win, or we do create instability so that no particular group or something, you know, rises up.",
        "Now, I realize that's a very, it's a long-term projection, and it's also up to a lot of debate because people, you know, a lot of people feel, and myself included, that if you allow forces of good to rise up, and children get educations, and these places in the world where people are, you know, desperately poor and in constant war for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, they can make a better life.",
        "In the case of the president, it seems to me that he has interests of the United States at heart, and it must be a very difficult balancing act.",
        "And I'm glad that - thank you, Mr. Carter, for writing about these kinds of things and bringing it to our attention because I'm no scholar, but, you know, books like this help me see a broader picture.",
        "So that was the point I wanted to make.",
        "All right.",
        "Stephen Carter?",
        "I should say that part of what led to my writing this book, and I actually put other projects aside to work on it, was this really striking sense that in Obama, we had a man who had clearly, most of his supporters believed this was the man who was going to make peace around the world.",
        "And clearly, a lot of those who were against him thought he's going to somehow run down the American military or something.",

        "That is, once in office, faced with a menu of actual threats around the world, he behaved, in a way, like a lot of American presidents, a combination of pragmatism and ferocity.",
        "The pragmatism of believing there are actual threats that have to be stopped and then the ferocity of stopping them, often with enormous force.",
        "And so if you think about the use of drone missiles, for example, and President Obama has used them now at more than twice the rate that his predecessor did, they don't always make the evening news, but they do often miss their targets.",

        "You have to get good intelligence to do that, and the challenge of how you get good intelligence has been an immense one that we've got a lot of intelligence, I gather, over the last few years that haven't been the very serious attacks here that we've seen in some places in Europe, and of course today in Moscow.",
        "But nevertheless, I think it's a continuing challenge how to defend their values so you don't use certain kinds of methods that we should stay away from, but at the same time get the information to prevent these attacks from taking place.",
