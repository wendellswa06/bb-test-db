        "Yes, I take as my authority for what I'm about to ask, conversations I had with two constitutional law professors, one from Harvard the other from the University of Colorado at Boulder, after they were interviewed at National Public Radio.",
        "I have nowhere heard anyone go to the point of addressing the fundamental issue that we are actually not at war, since Section 2 of the Constitution has not been invoked by congressional approval, therefore.",
        "The two professors, to paraphrase slightly, agree that fundamentally, we are in a constitutional crisis, which seems to me to be of rather more importance than being attacked by particular groups, in particular countries, at particular times.",
        "Constitutional crisis that...",
        "(Unintelligible) why the press seems to have uniformly glossed over this point.",
        "Well, Stephen Carter?",
        "Well, I don't know if the press has glossed over it or not.",
        "I've taught constitutional law, and the war power in particular, for almost 30 years now.",
        "And I don't - I'm well aware of the theory that's out there, that the U.S.",
        "can't legally fight without a declaration of war.",
        "I just don't think it's true.",
        "That is, the Declaration of War Clause, what we know about its history, was included in the Constitution in keeping with the international law as understood at the time.",
        "It was a way of giving warning to third parties who might be starving the ships on the high seas or something like that.",
        "But there's only been one declaration of war in the world since 1948.",
        "No one declares war anymore.",
        "It's not how conflicts come about.",
        "And of the roughly 200 armed conflicts the United States has been involved in, and the dozen or so major ones, only about four have involved full declarations of war.",
        "I think Congress has gone along, de facto, by providing funds and so on.",
        "And I think if there is a crisis, the real crisis isn't so much whether Congress has declared war or not.",
        "Here, I think the caller is right.",
        "The crisis is that Congress tends to roll over when presidents say national security."

        "That is, as soon as the president says - and any president, Democratic or Republican - says we're going to be attacked, or we've been attacked, or we need this or that for our security, the floodgates of money open, and Congress funds pretty much whatever the president asks for.",
        "If I may interject a point here...",
        "Later on, there's often regret, and there's congressional investigations and so on, but I'd like to deal with investigations and those regrets before we provide the money.",

        "The law professor at Harvard, who I have to admit whose name I do not remember, when asked about a lawsuit by a citizen challenging the engagement of troops in these kinds of conflicts, said that members of Congress had, under - when Bush I occurred in Iraq, sought to go to court.",
        "And the courts refused to accept the suit, saying this was a disagreement between the Congress and the executive branch that would have to be handled between those two groups, that there was no legal recourse.",
        "So I'm afraid I would suggest that the issue of how many was have been declared and how many have not may well be a moot point and, in any event, it - to my -from my perspective, begs the fundamental question of the constitutionality and whether we are - what we are going to see is erosions in other areas, as well.",
        "I think that's a great question and a very important point.",
        "And we have seen a lot of erosions, in that sense.",
        "We've seen an enormous growth since - really, since Lincoln - in presidential authority beyond anything the framers are wanted, and that we saw the growth begin with Lincoln, and then we saw it explode after Roosevelt.",
        "It's not only a matter of presidential supremacy over the legislature.",

        "And it should be noted that it was clear, clear to them that war was unacceptable in any matter, and that should be stated.",
        "But my point with the just war theory that we're talking about is that there's two major problems with it.",
        "One is we never address the issues of where we are culpable, whether it's - I'm referring most to back in the '50s, which got us in trouble with Iran, or a number of dictators we've supported.",
        "We don't ever address that and stop doing that."

        "So I'm struck by Christopher Hitchens' comment about the war in Iraq.",
        "Christopher Hitchens' has made the point that if the United States is the one who supported Saddam Hussein all these years, why isn't it our job to get rid of him, too?",

        "We don't know if the next problem, major terrorist attacks or some other kind of conflict.",

        "President Clinton, after leaving office, said that the worst mistake he made in office was not to intervene during the genocide in Rwanda, which left something between 300,000 to a million dead.",
        "And I think that Obama is plainly sensitive to that.",
        "But one of the downsides of these long, exhausting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is that it's not clear that the American people would have the stomach to go to war to protect some suffering people somewhere, even if the political will existed in our leadership."

        "But if they think America is losing or they think that we're at a stalemate, the level of support for a war tends to drop.",
        "And I think part of what's causing it to drop in Afghanistan is precisely that sense that, not only it's a stalemated now, but it's been stalemated for some time.",
        "And I know that the administration has lately made progress, for example, of retaking Kandahar.",

        "But that happens in every war.",

        "It happens in every war.",
        "One of the ways that I think the news media can help educate us is before we go to war, when we're debating whether to launch an invasion or launch a defense somewhere, to, at that point, in advance, say to us, you know, if you go to war, there are terrible atrocities that will be committed, including some by your side.",
        "You have to accept that cost now, as opposed to acting surprised by it later.",
        "That's one of the ways, I think, we can have more reflective conversations than we do.",
        "Some of those conversations are conducted in Stephen Carter's new book, \"\"The Violence of Peace: America's Wars in the Age of Obama.\"\" The author, Yale University law professor and, of course, novelist, as well, joined us from a studio on the campus at Yale in New Haven.",
