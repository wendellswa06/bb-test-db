        "And I would say there is a security, like a security vacuum inside the camp, but this is how the situation is.",
        "Is the Lebanese government able to go in at all and monitor what's going on there?",
        "Actually, there is, I think, an agreement among the Arab states and with Lebanon that says that the police does not - cannot enter or choose not to enter into the camp.",

        "So on a day like today, as the second Unite the Right rally takes place outside the White House, how should media organizations handle this story without fanning the flames of racist viewpoints?",

        "Well, I think they have to weigh whether or not you're normalizing these groups by affording them the same space and the same time as legitimate news.",

        "What are you doing?",
        "On the other hand, if you don't cover it, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.",
        "And maybe covering it shows the extent of the horror in the case of genocide and perhaps can go to trying to stop it or mitigate it.",
