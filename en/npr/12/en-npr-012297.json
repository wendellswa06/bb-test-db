        "Well, in particular, who's not happy are the people who are sicker and the people who are poorer.",

        "Well, for starters, it affects 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, so that's a big chunk of the population.",

        "About a third of people said that they're in a plan that has a gap.",
        "Actually, it's a much higher number.",
