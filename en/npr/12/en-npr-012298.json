        "Change is one of the most well trod concepts in politics.",
        "Senators Obama and Clinton had been shouting it ever louder as Super Tuesday nears, while the remaining Republican trio are also making it the watch word of their campaigns.",
        "But what does it mean?",
        "What does change mean in political rhetoric?",
        "Timothy Noah, a senior writer at the online magazine Slate spent a little on the Los Angeles Times opinion page.",
        "Looking back at what change has meant in past candidacies, and he found out, well, nothing has changed.",
        "He joins us in a moment and we'd like to hear from you.",

        "Good to have you with us, Tim.",
        "Thank you, Lynn.",
        "So as you point out in your piece, this is not the first time that presidential candidates have run on this idea of change but you did a little research that shows how the use of the word has increased over the years.",
        "What did you find out exactly?",
        "Well, I found, obviously, the idea of change has been with us in politics for, you know, since time in memorial.",
        "The whole idea of throw the bums out.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Dates back at least to the 19th century.",
        "But the word change didn't really get fetishized until 1988.",
        "That's the first - in doing a data base search, I saw that was really the year when you actually heard politicians repeating the word change like a mantra."

        "And why was that in 1988?",
        "Can you remind us?",
        "Well, I think what brought the word change to the floor was the decline in party affiliation, particularly among Democrats.",
        "The Democrats lost about 10 percent of their market share between 1977 and 1987.",
        "They had 40 percent of Americans self identified as Democrats in '77.",
        "It dropped to 38 percent in '88.",
        "And since then, party affiliation for both Democrats and Republicans has hovered between 30 and 40 percent.",
        "Now what that means is that Democrats and Republicans have been fighting ever since 1988 for independence.",
        "And the question is how do you frame an appeal to independence?",
        "Well, you don't really know why they're independents, so you have to appeal to them in a vaguest way possible.",
        "Hence, change.",
        "And of course, you know, Barack Obama has made this, obviously, the catch word of his campaign.",
        "But the other candidates are also using it quite a lot.",
        "So what does that - what does it mean then when they all start talking about that fact that they are the candidate of change?",
        "It means that it's an ink blot.",
        "It means that change can be whatever you want it to be.",
        "As I said, 1988 was the first year when you really started hearing the word a lot.",
        "Mike Ducacus announced that - he said I want to be a force for positive change.",
        "And even that is a little specific.",
        "He said positive change.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And Ronald Reagan very famously answered, we are the change at the Republican convention that summer.",
        "And it went over so well, he said it again in 1992.",
        "So you had Democrats and Republicans both saying, you know, we represent change.",
        "Media organizations have been grappling with the question of whether to give white supremacists a platform, and we know that NPR aired an interview with Unite the Right organizer Jason Kessler on Friday.",
        "That drew a lot of criticism.",
        "What have you been hearing from other reporters and people - listeners who've generally been following your work about these \"\"alt-right\"\" and white supremacist gatherings - how they should actually be covered?",
        "What have you - what kind of ideas have you been hearing?",
        "Some people - and these are usually people who are not journalists - say, what happens if you just ignore them?",
        "You know that's what they want.",
        "They want your attention.",
        "They want to be on the radio.",
        "They want to be on television.",
        "They crave this.",
        "So why are you giving it to them?",

        "Lots of times, they'll have pool coverage.",

        "And, from this angle, it's tough to tell if there are more journalists than protesters in this particular scene or the other way around.",
