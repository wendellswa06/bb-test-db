        "Have you thought of a better word to campaign on?",
        "Well, it's - it depends on what you mean by better.",
        "The word change does what the politicians want it to do which is, it creates - it has universal appeal because everybody has their own notion of change.",
        "But in the past, you've had slogans that were a little bit more specific, at least.",
        "You know, John F.",
        "Kennedy in 1960 said let's get America moving again.",
        "It's very hard to imagine a politician saying that today because his consultants would be saying, oh, that sounds like activist government.",
        "That sounds like it's too liberal.",
        "Don't say that.",
        "Don't say that.",
        "So even these slogans that, at the time were thought of as extremely vague and airy, today are thought of as way too specific.",
        "We are talking about change and what it means as a political slogan.",
        "What does it mean to you when you hear a candidate talking about change?",
        "Give us a call.",

        "Hi, Erin.",

        "Hi.",
        "I am calling - I really think that - when I hear change from a candidate, I really think that Barack Obama has the right idea.",
        "He really wants to shift the way that things are happening in Washington.",
        "He wants to shift the way that policy is made.",
        "He's talking about talking to different people from nations that maybe we don't agree with, but he's still trying to make that shift from what seems like a culture of fear, a culture of at least talking and working together and compromise.",
        "So you - when you see the word change, when you, you know, are watching TV and Obama is speaking and the word change is right there behind him or in front of him, that has meaning for you?",
        "It's not a hallow or an empty kind of promise to you?",
        "Exactly.",
        "I actually saw him yesterday in Delaware and just the idea that he had about changing the way jobs are in this country and talking about how people can get new jobs as maybe inflating - buildings in the inner city, I think is really, really a big shift from what we've seen in quite a few years.",
        "So, yeah.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It really does inspire, I think, the true meaning of the word change.",

        "Yeah, I think there is a certain amount of me-tooism(ph) here.",
        "And I agree with the caller when Obama uses the word change, he's talking about a change in the tone of government.",
        "He's talking about an improvement in the quality of ethics in Washington.",
        "He's talking about moral bipartisanship.",
        "And I think that's the basis of his appeal.",

        "But one thing I will agree with you about is you are the candidate of change.",
        "And it became this sort of wonderful put down of Romney for changing his position.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Let's say Obama is nominated, which is not necessarily going to happen, but let's say he is.",
        "Would he - do you think he could continue to run on that - with that slogan or would it - did he need to - does he need to get a new slogan going into the general election, let's say.",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I mean, it's a good question.",
        "Certainly the part of the change theme that involves improving ethics in Washington, that wouldn't work quite as well against McCain as it might against some others because McCain sponsored the election reform law a few years back and he's associated with a strong commitment to ethics.",
        "So he might need another tack.",
        "On the other hand, if change means removing troops from Iraq, McCain is a strong supporter of the surge and is less likely to support withdrawal from Iraq.",
        "So it might have that resonance for Obama.",
        "Timothy Noah is my guest.",
        "We're talking about the use of the word change as a campaign slogan, as campaign rhetoric.",

        "Until I hear one candidate with that courage to bring that in the context of change, I don't believe it."
