        "What do you think of that bill up there on the Hill?",
        "Well, I have mixed feelings about it.",
        "And I think those feelings derive from the fact that on the Hill, as in other situations around the world where political leaders are looking at this issue, one of the first questions they ask is what is politically feasible?",
        "What will my constituents support?",
        "If instead of asking the question about political feasibility, we talk about scientific reality, then the question becomes how much and how fast do we have to cut carbon emissions if, for example, we want to save the Greenland ice sheet?",
        "Or how much and how fast do we have to close coal-powered power plants if we want to save the glaciers in the Himalayas and on the Tibetan plateau whose ice melt sustains the major rivers of Asia during the dry season?",
        "When you ask the latter question, then it becomes clear that we do not have very much time, we have to move quickly.",
        "And that's why we talk about cutting carbon emissions 80 percent, not by 2050 but by 2020.",
        "How can we do that?",
        "Well, there are any number of things that we can do.",
        "One, there's an enormous amount of wind energy in the world.",
        "You mentioned in the earlier introduction to the bats segment that we have overtaken Germany in terms of both total wind generating capacity and in annual installations.",
        "I think that was about three years ago.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But we're about to be overtaken by China.",
        "And the interesting thing about the U.S.",
        "and China, the two biggest economies in the world right now and the two principal sources of carbon emissions, is that each has an abundance of wind energy.",
        "In this country, we've known for nearly 20 years now that three states - North Dakota, Kansas and Texas - have enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy not only national electricity needs but national energy needs.",
        "That is to say we have an enormous amount of wind energy.",
        "In China...",
        "Lester, let me just interrupt to remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, talking with Lester Brown, author of \"\"Plan B 4.0,\"\" about wind energy.",
        "I'm sorry to interrupt, Lester.",
        "Go on.",
        "You were talking about China.",
        "No problem.",
        "Incidentally, \"\"Plan B 4.0\"\" is online at earthpolicy.org.",
        "It can be downloaded free of charge.",
        "No kidding."

        "And it's interesting, people think this must reduce sales.",
        "In fact, it increases sales.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Just between the two of us.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The - there was a joint U.S.-China study that appeared in Science just a few weeks ago, pointing out that the Chinese now know that they have enough harnessable wind energy to increase their current electricity consumption seven times.",
        "So, in both of these countries there is an abundance of wind energy.",
        "And we're beginning to see the Chinese move very fast.",
        "They were latecomers to the wind energy field, but they have been doubling their wind electric generation each year for the last four years, and probably will do so again this year.",
        "We're seeing thinking on the development of wind resources that we couldn't have imagined just a couple of years ago.",
        "But Lester, from what I read in articles, in particular one recent Wall Street Journal article, it says that while China is building all these wind turbines, they're also building these coal-fired power plants as backups to wind turbines.",
        "Doesn't that sort of defeat the purpose?",
        "Well, that's not entirely the case, though there is an element of that here of course.",
        "What has happened in China is that their sort of business-as-usual that's been doubling wind-generated electricity output each year for the last four years has now suddenly mushroomed into something even bigger with the nationally developed plan developed by - and I think coordinated by the National Development Resources Commission.",
        "I believe it now - it's a cabinet-level body in China, has a lot of authority and influence to sort of cut through things and get them done.",
        "Mm-hmm."
