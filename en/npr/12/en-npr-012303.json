        "And by the town, I mean the agencies, the publicists, the studios and networks with whom people are doing business only when there is a story published in a publication like The New York Times, not when the entire town knows about the behavior.",

        "There's some other low-hanging fruit out there or people who are also openly whispered about.",
        "To go back to Rebecca's point and to your question, the challenge for us as journalists getting people - you know, and it's very tough, we understand - but the courage to put your name to it and go on the record then makes it easier for us to do our jobs.",
        "I've reported a lot on Roy Price at Amazon, but I wouldn't have been able to get the stories I got into The Wall Street Journal in without a producer, Isa Hackett, willing to go on the record about what happened to her.",
        "With regards to Hollywood and change, I think when things start to have financial implications, that's when you start to see change in the industry.",

        "To the question of what it means for the community, I've yet to find a producer or writer who feels that more consolidation is better.",
        "We live in an era where there's all these different platforms for writers and producers to get their content out, but those platforms are owned by fewer and fewer companies.",
        "So the more consolidation it is, the tougher I feel it is for writers and producers to negotiate to get deals done.",
        "And that's where the challenge will be.",
        "So, Rebecca, why don't you pick up the thread here?",
        "I mean, this merger means Disney would now have rights to Blockbuster Fox movies like \"\"Avatar,\"\" something you know a thing or two about, you know, having written a whole book on \"\"Avatar's\"\" director, James Cameron.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, what is your take on this?",

        "I don't know.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "Yeah, as you say, so Disney - if this deal were to go through - would own the four \"\"Avatar\"\" sequels that are in production.",
        "It would also own the Marvel properties that it doesn't already own.",
        "This comes in addition to Disney owning Lucasfilm, Pixar, Disney animation and most of the Marvel films.",
        "So that is just a lot under one roof.",
        "And I do think it's kind of concerning for audiences.",
        "One thing to keep in mind though, as Joe mentioned, there are all these new players - Apple, Netflix, Amazon - who are in the marketplace.",
        "And if you look at sort of the market capitalization of Apple, you could put all of the studios under one roof and they wouldn't be as big as Apple.",
        "So the studios are sort of feeling like - and the media companies are feeling like they're sort of fighting for their lives against these new companies.",
        "And consolidation is one way for them to stay going.",
        "So, you know, but Jeff - Jeff, your son actually plays Eddie in \"\"Fresh Off The Boat,\"\" which is a show produced by Fox, which runs on ABC, which is owned by Disney, right?",
        "So it seems that there's already a lot of cross-pollination in the industry.",
        "I mean, I don't know.",
        "What are your thoughts about this?",
        "Well, it's absolutely the case that a lot of these studios are kind of frenemies, right?",
        "You know, they create things in collaboration.",
        "They air things on one another's different platforms.",
        "They're exchanging content and opportunities all over the place.",
        "But the issue with consolidation I think in a broader sense is that it tends to reinforce the notion that the people who are there already, who are inside the circle, if you will, get more chances.",
        "And, I mean, I'm saying this with a kid who is inside the circle to a certain extent.",
        "It's, you know, kind of great to see that when you have recognizability within a studio, other options come to you.",
        "But, I mean, he wasn't a few years ago.",
        "He'd never acted before.",
        "And I feel like a lot of ways, especially when we're talking about diversity, finding a way to break into an industry that is becoming more and more consolidated and monolithic can only be harder over time.",
        "So that's an issue.",
        "So, before we let you go, I just wanted to ask just very briefly if I can.",
        "And this is such a - I wanted to loop back to the topic that we started with, which is the behavior in the industry.",
        "I know, Rebecca, you were saying that - to us earlier that the casting couch was a real thing.",
        "I mean, this is a thing that has really affected people's lives in this industry.",
        "Do you feel - And I'm asking you to predict, I apologize - do you think that this is really a cultural moment where this has really changed?",
        "I'm going to give you the last word here."
